always updating and synchronizing and
they<00:02:03.229> do<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.409> pretty<00:02:03.500> good<00:02:03.799> job<00:02:04.009> at<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:04.880> mean

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
they do a pretty good job at it I mean

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.600 
they do a pretty good job at it I mean
the<00:02:05.180> weather<00:02:05.420> here<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.590> kind<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:06.979> foggy<00:02:07.250> I

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
the weather here it is kind of foggy I

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.609 
the weather here it is kind of foggy I
mean<00:02:07.850> sometimes<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.390> do<00:02:08.690> have<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:09.019> update<00:02:09.319> it

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
mean sometimes you do have to update it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.070 
mean sometimes you do have to update it
yourself<00:02:10.039> but<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.429> way<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:11.180> they<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.480> update

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
yourself but the way that they do update

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.949 
yourself but the way that they do update
it<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:12.380> just<00:02:12.620> amazing<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.940> only<00:02:14.390> downside

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
it is just amazing and the only downside

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.740 
it is just amazing and the only downside
is<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.769> this<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.250> actually<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:17.000> big<00:02:17.209> downside

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
is to this and actually the big downside

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.710 
is to this and actually the big downside
to<00:02:18.019> this<00:02:18.170> phone<00:02:18.560> itself<00:02:19.519> is<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.030> battery<00:02:20.510> for

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
to this phone itself is the battery for

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.960 
to this phone itself is the battery for
some<00:02:20.959> reason<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:21.709> really<00:02:22.519> diminishing

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
some reason it's really diminishing

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.860 
some reason it's really diminishing
let's<00:02:25.970> see<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:27.260> ah<00:02:28.690> yeah<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
let's see and it's ah yeah the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.690 
let's see and it's ah yeah the
synchronization<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:30.799> pretty<00:02:31.040> good<00:02:31.280> could<00:02:31.549> be

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
synchronization is pretty good could be

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.220 
synchronization is pretty good could be
a<00:02:31.730> little<00:02:31.880> bit<00:02:32.120> better<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:32.720> it's<00:02:32.900> one<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
a little bit better but it's one of the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.080 
a little bit better but it's one of the
other<00:02:33.380> things<00:02:33.739> i<00:02:33.950> also<00:02:34.280> like<00:02:34.640> about<00:02:34.910> this

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
other things i also like about this

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.600 
other things i also like about this
phone<00:02:35.150> how<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.959> synchronizes<00:02:36.680> everything

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
phone how it synchronizes everything

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.120 
phone how it synchronizes everything
your<00:02:38.180> facebook<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.110> twitter<00:02:39.290> updates<00:02:39.890> the

even even though even when you don't

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.130 
even even though even when you don't
even<00:02:45.260> know<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.769> it's<00:02:46.340> synchronizing<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.450> even

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
even know it it's synchronizing it even

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.290 
even know it it's synchronizing it even
as<00:02:48.290> i<00:02:48.319> speak<00:02:49.150> alright<00:02:50.150> on<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.360> number<00:02:50.630> three

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.810 

number<00:02:55.300> three<00:02:55.660> are<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.380> apps<00:02:56.560> /<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
number three are the apps / the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.110 
number three are the apps / the
program's<00:02:58.390> now<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:59.800> all<00:02:59.980> know<00:03:00.010> what<00:03:00.280> apps<00:03:00.730> do

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
program's now we all know what apps do

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.060 
program's now we all know what apps do
we<00:03:01.330> all<00:03:01.510> know<00:03:01.780> what<00:03:01.810> they<00:03:02.230> are<00:03:02.440> we<00:03:02.830> know<00:03:03.040> that

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
we all know what they are we know that

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.860 
we all know what they are we know that
half<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.700> them<00:03:03.880> probably<00:03:04.180> came<00:03:04.570> from<00:03:04.600> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
half of them probably came from the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.140 
half of them probably came from the
apple<00:03:05.320> store<00:03:05.410> before<00:03:05.740> this<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.580> half<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.970> them

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
apple store before this and half of them

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.940 
apple store before this and half of them
are<00:03:07.300> probably<00:03:07.480> not<00:03:07.750> even<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.380> apple<00:03:08.860> store

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
are probably not even on the apple store

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.550 
are probably not even on the apple store
for<00:03:09.670> example<00:03:10.240> if<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.510> go<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.140> marketplace

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
for example if I go to the marketplace

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.750 
for example if I go to the marketplace
right<00:03:11.890> now<00:03:15.000> loading<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.210> if<00:03:16.660> i<00:03:16.780> press<00:03:17.020> games

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
right now loading and if i press games

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.280 
right now loading and if i press games
and<00:03:18.760> if<00:03:18.910> i<00:03:19.060> press<00:03:19.710> what<00:03:20.710> see<00:03:23.520> how<00:03:24.520> about<00:03:25.290> all

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
and if i press what see how about all

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.990 
and if i press what see how about all
games<00:03:26.890> i<00:03:27.310> think<00:03:28.920> no<00:03:29.920> it's<00:03:30.250> no<00:03:30.430> no<00:03:30.490> no<00:03:30.640> there

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
games i think no it's no no no there

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.240 
games i think no it's no no no there
could<00:03:31.570> be<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.720> second<00:03:32.140> here<00:03:32.440> ah<00:03:34.740> here<00:03:35.740> we<00:03:35.770> are<00:03:35.860> if

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
could be a second here ah here we are if

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.530 
could be a second here ah here we are if
you<00:03:37.030> see<00:03:37.300> right<00:03:37.840> there<00:03:38.700> there<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.910> actually<00:03:40.150> an

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
you see right there there is actually an

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.290 
you see right there there is actually an
emulator<00:03:41.140> on<00:03:41.260> here<00:03:41.830> now<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.280> don't<00:03:42.730> see<00:03:43.030> that

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
emulator on here now you don't see that

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.360 
emulator on here now you don't see that
in<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.870> apple<00:03:44.260> store<00:03:44.350> apple<00:03:44.710> will<00:03:45.010> probably

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
in the apple store apple will probably

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.000 
in the apple store apple will probably
decline<00:03:45.520> it<00:03:45.970> immediately<00:03:46.420> i<00:03:46.630> mean<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.350> number

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
decline it immediately i mean the number

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.670 
decline it immediately i mean the number

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
thought that this thing would not even

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.340 
thought that this thing would not even
be<00:04:03.430> on<00:04:03.670> here<00:04:04.090> well<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.320> do<00:04:05.950> because<00:04:06.520> that's<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
be on here well I do because that's the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.650 
be on here well I do because that's the
