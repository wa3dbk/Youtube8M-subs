00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.690
 I do not have a bit of videogames but I have been put here for items to make 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.770
 an interview Alberto that in it 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.959
 let's see if this alberto 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.709
 If you mean the fat and black that I have between my legs, the answer is 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:13.799
 you know enough 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.390
 but what we have on the table is the latest Microsoft shit 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.980
 that's why we've put the color like this to save misunderstandings 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.839
 we have called it x box 3 60 years 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.509
 we could not think of any more asshole man but I'm also here 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.509
 for that reason 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.130
 and we are going to put x 2 3 60 edition gardens because we all know that this 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.399
 console are always bought by the same assholes who have been broken 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.210
 before 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.820
 We were also going to put Serbian in series to send her to the fucking service 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.570
 technical yes right here where the air comes out at 105 degrees 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.230
 steve jobs 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.730
 Of course he did not play 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.250
 since the last time you ate it, the only thing I tasted was red wine 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.980
 Simon 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.680
 joer that played more the zambomba that manolo the hype at Christmas 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.200
 but going back to the subject here is the new remote and all the accessories 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.520
 as you see this the same shit of cables and the transforming piece style 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.270
 brick we have left it the same 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.100
 there are many gamers like me who enjoy crushing will be literally all the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.940
 day with him 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.340
 we have included a peazo 120 gig hard drive 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.530
 I know you do not even know what a mega is 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.170
 only if we talk about mega collas and do not ask me pacheco do not serve 120 gigas 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.930
 to play a shit console and record the games 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.680
 and thus and at the same time corrected the manufacturing errors of the first xbox 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 those of the red lights 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.190
 Right now the only red thing in this room is my tip the dick 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.360
 I explain clearly that the three red lights no longer come out 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.490
 now is when there is a technical problem a green light appears on the fringe 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.109
 corresponding to the command 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.060
 so the player does not have a bitch that he was awarded the fucking console 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.950
 As for the hang, put that shit, we have made many advances. 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.509
 I played the balls really hard when I was playing the fucking oblivion and 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.050
 the game was blocked 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.550
 that's why we have included a reset button on the remote to restart the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.500
 console thrown from the sofa in your house so you do not have to get up and you 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.540
 can continue to touch the eggs by dropping hairs in the cited soda that pussy has 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.390
 been that 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.869
 go piece yours of subliminal advertising 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.619
 another butterfly thing 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.839
 Something I've said before about the hot air that throws behind the box 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.919
 He warmed up more than maikel inaction watching sesame neighborhood 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.429
 that's why we've included a thermometer that got the players to put it on 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:23.559
 for the extinct 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:27.329
 in this way they lose attention about the heat that comes from the console 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.979
 the command has undergone some modifications 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:34.149
 We have really just changed the case to fix the problems of the 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.430
 paddle we have given of hosts against the ground to see if we got that 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.959
 will mark the addresses right away 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.839
 follows the bullish wake when 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.579
 2x boxer it was believed that after the release of play 3 those of 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.569
 microsoft we were going to put it free 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.369
 and shit like a house 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.919
 they do not know tito villa 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:54.679
 see if it is to try that the games of the first x box are still rented 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.969
 the video store in the corner to copy the gago in his fucking mother 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.129
 I pay 500 euros and the remaining 100 to reach the base salary of food 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.169
 but here I am smiling like a good buddy I think it has already been 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.590
 quite clear that it is a real cocoon of those who have not 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.280
 I see 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.870
 but and the whole reason you are also more in need of a good 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.159
 buddy that you do not know how to tell you 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.379
 whenever you want, you took it out
