00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:25.810
 2018 p is a model in this case 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.400
 from a tablet 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:34.150
 basic is an android tablet as we see 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.030
 comes with what is shield frame with what 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.079
 which is a gray cover with this strip 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.570
 white and is a metallic gray although the 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.620
 tablet because it really is totally 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.440
 plastic well as for 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.230
 physical characteristics obviously this 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.150
 10.1 screen here in the part 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.470
 top volume buttons come 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.710
 power button 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.400
 in the part 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.030
 lower let's see what is the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.670
 audio connector the mini connector 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.190
 micro usb mini hdmi the power this 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.869
 hole that is the reset button and the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 Micro SD connector supports micro SD 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.090
 32 gigas and it has 16 gigas internal go 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.090
 to see in the settings 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.690
 Y 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.130
 comes with 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.130
 when there are 422 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:45.869
 let's see the storage 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.939
 and we have it port cd cards are going to 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.210
 have 16 gigas of which are left 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.500
 really 11 obviously by the system and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.979
 the rest the sd supports up to 32 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.960
 gigas 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.000
 as for the interface that has it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.520
 I like it because in addition to having 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.670
 physical volume buttons have them here 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.250
 in the on the screen the capture of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.050
 screen obviously and the classics 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.660
 buttons that we already know in android well 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.810
 lacan how much the appearance of the camera is 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.590
 front camera this we have here is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.920
 of 1.3 megapixels while the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.110
 rear camera 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.330
 until we have here is 2 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.360
 megapixels with what is a horns 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.270
 back here comes software is what 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.690
 is my fire wgn obviously has to 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.790
 bluetooth and the battery because if we do not 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.069
 much liked is 6000 thousand start a 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.110
 little bit reduced in terms of its 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.730
 operating capacity comes with a giga 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.550
 of ram the screen is a resolution of 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.400
 1280 x 800 so they can play very 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.880
 well enough games the processor is 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.850
 a cortex a9 of two nuclei to 1.5 arrives 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.780
 hes then they will have a good capacity 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.410
 for basic games games that do not go 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.140
 to block and then 'there is no 422 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.140
 blessing and feel capacity and 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.580
 and the resolution is fine as soon as 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.410
 to leave it either or the only 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.150
 obviously, the screen does not 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.430
 it's a nut 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.280
 gorilla glass so obviously 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.739
 we recommend that you have your protector 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.580
 its weight is approximately between 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:39.030
 3,800 and 4,000 pesos since it can be 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:44.180
 find in the market comes in your box 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.000
 with what are your basic hearing aids 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.900
 it comes with very important connector 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.860
 on-the-go otg that is micro usb a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.410
 usb female steppe of what it is to connect 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.860
 USB memories or connect a keyboard or 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.400
 USB computer mouse also comes with its 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.860
 data cable without which also 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.710
 can connect a charger 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.350
 obviously comes with your charger and if 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.989
 has support for google for what it is 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.970
 the google store or what does not 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.790
 will happen as it happens with some this 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.060
 store with some Chinese tablets that 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.260
 they have to see how to hack this 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.380
 the tablet for him to pass 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.450
 he detected 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.040
 good to have access to the store 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.230
 and then that advantage will have those 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.200
 basic equipment is what they want to 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.690
 your children or tasks and all this kind of 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.250
 questions then they worked very well 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.900
 for what is a market already 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.420
 professional because the tablet does not 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.330
 will work very well because then 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.230
 features like sound and camera 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.300
 they really are not very good either 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.360
 then this is our review of 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.190
 this tablet you already know and any questions 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.480
 or comment or suggestion we are 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.480
