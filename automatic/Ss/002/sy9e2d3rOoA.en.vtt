early in the evening let's take a look
at<00:00:44.850> how<00:00:44.970> we<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.240> one<00:00:45.420> okay<00:00:46.280> now<00:00:47.280> typically<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
at how we do one okay now typically the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.180 
at how we do one okay now typically the
fly<00:00:48.210> it'd<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.510> tied<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:49.050> anywhere<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.830> a<00:00:49.860> size

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
fly it'd be tied on anywhere some a size

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.569 
fly it'd be tied on anywhere some a size
8<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.880> a<00:00:51.270> size<00:00:51.480> 14<00:00:52.110> hook<00:00:52.470> I'm<00:00:53.040> going<00:00:53.310> to<00:00:53.430> use<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
8 to a size 14 hook I'm going to use a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.590 
8 to a size 14 hook I'm going to use a
size<00:00:53.970> 10<00:00:54.570> dry<00:00:55.110> fly<00:00:55.380> hook<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.940> materials<00:00:57.450> we

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
size 10 dry fly hook the materials we

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.790 
size 10 dry fly hook the materials we
used<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:58.050> really<00:00:58.290> pretty<00:00:58.530> straightforward

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
used are really pretty straightforward

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
used are really pretty straightforward
it's<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.930> some<00:01:00.930> coastal<00:01:01.350> deer<00:01:01.650> hair<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.480> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
it's just some coastal deer hair and I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.569 
it's just some coastal deer hair and I
use<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> little<00:01:04.049> dubbing<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> fly<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
use a little dubbing on on the fly a

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.999 
use a little dubbing on on the fly a
little<00:01:06.090> bit<00:01:06.329> of<00:01:06.450> dry<00:01:06.630> flight<00:01:06.899> dubbing<00:01:07.259> bulks

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
little bit of dry flight dubbing bulks

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.000 
little bit of dry flight dubbing bulks
it<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.250> nicely<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> let's<00:01:10.500> start<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.979> by

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it up nicely so let's start out by

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.000 
it up nicely so let's start out by
putting<00:01:11.520> our<00:01:11.670> number<00:01:12.479> 10<00:01:12.750> hook<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
putting our number 10 hook in here and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.040 
putting our number 10 hook in here and
we<00:01:14.100> set<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> hook<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> shank<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.810> nice

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
we set the hook in so the shank is nice

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.610 
we set the hook in so the shank is nice
and<00:01:16.320> level<00:01:16.500> even<00:01:17.010> with<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> top<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.670> jaws

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
and level even with the top the jaws

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.930 
and level even with the top the jaws
first<00:01:19.620> thing<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> layer<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
first thing is to put down a layer of

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.870 
first thing is to put down a layer of
working<00:01:21.360> thread<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.400> give<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> Vice

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
working thread so we just give the Vice

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
working thread so we just give the Vice
of<00:01:24.120> spin<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.900> down<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.380> back<00:01:25.590> again<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
of spin you go down and back again and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.469 
of spin you go down and back again and
that's<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.729> ready<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:28.100> now<00:01:29.270> use<00:01:30.270> some

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that's all ready to go now use some

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.180 
that's all ready to go now use some
coastal<00:01:30.900> deer<00:01:31.170> hair<00:01:31.409> we'll<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> little

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
coastal deer hair we'll take a little

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.600 
coastal deer hair we'll take a little
pinch<00:01:32.490> right<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.979> cut<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.220> off<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:37.610> I'd

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
pinch right here cut this off and I'd

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.550 
pinch right here cut this off and I'd
like<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> even<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> tips<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.229> bit<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.440> think

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
like to even up the tips a bit I think

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
like to even up the tips a bit I think
it<00:01:40.860> looks<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.220> little<00:01:41.340> nicer<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.330> we're

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
it looks a little nicer so what we're

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.710 
it looks a little nicer so what we're
gonna<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.990> clean<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.440> off<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:44.630> put<00:01:45.630> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
gonna do is clean this off a bit put it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.680 
gonna do is clean this off a bit put it
in<00:01:45.780> our<00:01:45.900> hair<00:01:46.110> stacker<00:01:47.150> to<00:01:48.150> give<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.450> couple

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
in our hair stacker to give it a couple

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.500 
in our hair stacker to give it a couple
taps<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
taps like that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.039 
taps like that
now<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.659> tips<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.290> nice<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> even<00:01:54.049> get

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
now the tips are all nice and even get

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.070 
now the tips are all nice and even get
out<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> way<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.710> moment<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> can

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
out of the way for a moment so you can

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.690 
out of the way for a moment so you can
lay<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.220> get<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> feel<00:01:59.670> for

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
lay this up here and you get a feel for

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
lay this up here and you get a feel for
about<00:01:59.970> how<00:02:00.270> long<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:00.720> want<00:02:00.900> that<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.320> extend

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
about how long you want that to extend

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.920 
about how long you want that to extend
I'd<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.580> him<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.880> extend<00:02:03.180> roughly<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
I'd like him to extend roughly the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.310 
I'd like him to extend roughly the
length<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.650> hook<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:06.270> would<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> end

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
length of the hook that would be the end
