I<00:00:26.070> believe<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.310> effectiveness<00:00:27.790> of<00:00:28.030> this<00:00:28.180> fly

I believe the effectiveness of this fly

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.170 
I believe the effectiveness of this fly
is<00:00:28.540> due<00:00:28.870> in<00:00:28.990> large<00:00:29.200> part<00:00:29.320> to<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:29.800> CDC<00:00:30.490> which

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
is due in large part to the CDC which

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.240 
is due in large part to the CDC which
traps<00:00:31.570> small<00:00:31.930> air<00:00:32.140> bubbles<00:00:32.169> that<00:00:32.920> not<00:00:33.070> only

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
traps small air bubbles that not only

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.340 
traps small air bubbles that not only
help<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.700> fly<00:00:33.880> to<00:00:33.940> float<00:00:34.360> but<00:00:34.780> also<00:00:34.960> make<00:00:35.320> it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
help the fly to float but also make it

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.780 
help the fly to float but also make it
look<00:00:35.590> extremely<00:00:36.010> realistic<00:00:38.310> if<00:00:39.310> I<00:00:39.520> could<00:00:39.700> only
