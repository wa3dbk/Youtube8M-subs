00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.629
 Welcome to this latest 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.339
 video of me 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.890
 and today it's about apple bosch 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.730
 more precisely, watch os 2 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.440
 which apple on the dummy or bio dc 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.630
 2015 and I want you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.100
 quite like to show in this video once 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.930
 how you can install this on 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.240
 your apple watch because this is currently 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 whole beta and I would like to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.439
 some new features the watch us 2 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.689
 to take with it 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.699
 if you have a detailed review one 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.740
 detailed presentation and the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.059
 have individual functions of roger s2 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.559
 I would definitely let me and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.420
 in the comments then I know 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.550
 for again extracting video for you but 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.620
 otherwise we will start right after 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:47.340
 the intro with the installation of roger 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.770
 s 2 on your apple watch first of all 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 we need ios 9 on our iphone 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.910
 which pair a lot with the apple watch 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.039
 and of course the iphone has to 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.469
 so be registered a registered 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.059
 which requires her you can give me to love 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.859
 to him I write I write you below 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.359
 this in the video description if 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.949
 somehow help needed or you yours 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.659
 julia should register 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.970
 Just have a look and in the video 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 description and then we need one 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.540
 profile and this profile you can 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.890
 easily download on the internet 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 I link that, too 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.140
 Of course, the download is on your own 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.670
 danger 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.680
 and then you send all of this 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.540
 just by e-mail to so I have that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.520
 At least that's the easiest 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.229
 Of course you can also go over one 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.070
 browser then directly on this profile 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.590
 access 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.090
 There you click on and then on apple 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.490
 watch and important, of course, is that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.500
 your apple watch with the iphone 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.790
 connected via bluetooth and that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.840
 These two devices already together 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.310
 are coupled 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.530
 Now we have the option 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.110
 install click to enter ours 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.060
 code a 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.280
 and now we have to look first 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.049
 is the apple watch in sword if you are 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.329
 a code must also trough 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.790
 you enter this once in the case 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.530
 here is no code in it and then 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.610
 we get have to install yet 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 install once 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 and now the profile will be installed as 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.369
 Next we have to go to the app 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 watch restart we get here 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.530
 on reboot and now lasts the whole 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.840
 a little moment and then show you 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 how to proceed the next step 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.510
 he now through her you have it 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.410
 just like any other 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.270
 software 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.120
 mobilization over the device either 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.130
 on the iphone ipod touch ipad or just 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.190
 also on the ad watch if you already have one 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.420
 have updated to s101 motto you know 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.340
 how the whole works you go 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.940
 just in the apple bot app on the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.920
 iphone 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.590
 and here you have under general 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.030
 if you are here at one time and then 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.130
 under generally you can also 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.200
 the point of software updating like 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.030
 also generally in the attitudes of the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.460
 iphones is and there you click and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.990
 now the motto it will update you 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.250
 displayed and it sounds easy 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.870
 on install 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.190
 in my case I have the whole 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.070
 already installed you get quite 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.320
 simply the option all down to 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.790
 invite to install and 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.980
 of course, your apple watch has to do that 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.060
 be coupled and must also to the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.560
 cable connected 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.150
 that is about the magnetic 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.060
 connection on the back connects 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.300
 her the ad watch with the cable and thus 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.950
 then connect to the stream and then 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.080
 is transferred all that has 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.600
 It took me about half an hour 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.280
 takes a long time in my opinion 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.230
 in contrast to other updates is but 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.270
 also depending on the internet depending on 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.160
 how fast that downloaded from you 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.950
 the installation itself will take then 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.420
 also a good half an hour 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.080
 So it takes quite a long time and 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.420
 then you have to be completely new about that 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.160
 Watch pair so your apple watch is 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.660
 then you no longer registered her 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.790
 couples them like the first 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.350
 Setting up the acl watch and could 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.820
 then restore from a backup 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.920
 so that you all your data again 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.170
 then transfer it all up 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.510
 the apple bot queried as well as 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.470
 on the iphone and then it will 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.940
 next watch os / 2 on your device on 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.070
 So your apple watch installs in 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.810
 in the end it is a normal one 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.100
 Registration and updating like 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.810
 also on the iphone 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.510
 but you have to do this before 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.860
 have installed profile then look 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.470
 Let us now briefly again 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.209
 few new features of watcher s2 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.010
 First of all I go here to the 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.370
 watch faces because there I have now 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.380
 new modules that i can add and 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.120
 I go here now on the 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.190
 more modules you already see here 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.720
 I added a photo album myself and 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.100
 then there are just my different 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.630
 pictures that I have in there 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.070
 displayed if you only one 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.110
 background image you want you can 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.389
 currently just one 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.800
 in this photo album you make her pure 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.080
 you have to go through the iphone 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.879
 sync when we go new 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.370
 we also have the time 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:36.439
 net recordings and then there will be 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.789
 eps part of New York or Hong Kong 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.740
 which I definitely have 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.270
 really cool in the individual 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.569
 modules that we have, for example 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.740
 in the module clock display you can 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.629
 Of course, the individual settings 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.159
 expand there are now many 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.430
 more settings and it is too 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.120
 possible then add some 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.060
 then we 'll look next 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.779
 Just look at the function time 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.939
 at 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:01.819
 we are taking the kitsch to the cogs 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:03.710
 women just turn something and then 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.779
 Do you see this is about time travel? 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.610
 and we see the number of minutes how far 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.960
 we look to the future and if 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.500
 now the opponent would change something in the 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.870
 calendar or even the number of degrees 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.550
 et cetera et cetera so all this 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.569
 functions that you see here 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.219
 they will become too 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.819
 Accordingly, you are welcome to see 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.889
 it's getting colder 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.129
 because we just go to the night 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.139
 then we have one here next 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.940
 calendar entry, and so get ahead so 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.319
 we just look and see the future 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.400
 by a click we will come back 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.810
 on the normal time in a something 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.389
 I would then more detailed video 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.539
 still respond to them facetime audio 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.610
 of course on apple that now yes in 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.099
 the wallet has left what you are here 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.270
 can see the app has been changed and 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.550
 is not facebook anymore but now 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.270
 just wallet at the end it is exactly 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.889
 the same 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.900
 I would also like to be on the 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.310
 audio function undergo the yes now 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.039
 it is possible that you just over 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.689
 the apple watch also plays music and 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.189
 also videos could play over now 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.349
 I would like the apple watch then 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:04.969
 show you everything a little bit as well 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.039
 Do you have the ability to use native apps? 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.479
 install that will be but one more 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.479
 it will take little until the developers then 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.969
 to bring out your own apps for that purpose 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.009
 So this is really easy 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:19.250
 potro s2 installed on your apple 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.379
 All you need is the iphone with ios 9 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.330
 Of course you have to do it for your julia 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:25.039
 register and then you connect the 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.719
 corner watch with the iphone invite you 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.789
 certificate or profile 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.409
 click on it and you will 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.389
 forwarded to the app installed 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.889
 you can find all this here and there 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.319
 then under the software update 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.020
 the update then you just by 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.340
 the instruction 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.259
 then you will be shown installing 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.699
 So in the end, you can do it simply and easily 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.860
 just like any other software 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.330
 update that 's it but then 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.009
 again from this video me 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.780
 Hope of course you liked and 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.650
 I could help you with it where it is 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.000
 to install 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.710
 about a thumb up or a 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.389
 comment would be very happy and 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.729
 Of course, a subscription was allowed as well
