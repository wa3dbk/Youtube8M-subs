00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.450
 all welcome on the channel my name is 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.410
 Ilyich and today I am starting a new rubric 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.269
 on skyrim modifications 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.490
 skyrim always goes huge 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.630
 number of different plugins for one 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.950
 only skyrim nexus 24 1771 files you 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.330
 imagine fucking 24 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.720
 1771 files most of which 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.609
 plugins starting categories only 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.860
 from house to player appearance changes 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.900
 characters and ending with global 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.730
 modifications that can fit 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.400
 match the fall with the original game 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.450
 then at least did a si on it and i will help 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.590
 you understand all this blockade 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.600
 Today we will talk about the global 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.969
 modifications called falls corr 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.969
 which came out most recently on July 12 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.010
 the plugin promises us 20 30 hours of gameplay 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.480
 new territory independent of april 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.030
 which is comparable in size to 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.219
 two-three with roman cold mi-26 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.399
 quests of which 9 constitute the main 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.440
 quest as well as new spell recipes 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.090
 books weapons armor screams songs for 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.110
 bards soundtrack and voice acting with 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.899
 professional and semi 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.180
 professional actors 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.610
 sounds impressive and isn't it but mod 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.410
 not only interesting in the first 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.599
 turn for him have allocated a whole 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.170
 advertising campaign I do not know the money or 

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.580
 helped 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.709
 or game publishing and truth 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.690
 interested in the nomad project widely 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.700
 was covered and does not know about him unless 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.470
 people who don't read the game press and 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.890
 not interested in skyrim modifications 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.259
 In general, in the second mode is positioned as 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.810
 resume of a 19 year old kid who is very 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.130
 wants to get into bethesda softworks and 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.420
 she really managed to attract 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.630
 attention to your project 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.460
 however let's go back to fashion is it 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.509
 good as the authors say about 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.820
 him gaming magazines 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.350
 Now I will try to explain to you what to 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.850
 what and is it worth taking at all 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.399
 passing this project 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.630
 by the way i will now retell the mod 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.520
 so if you don't want spoilers 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.619
 better close this video from sin 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.009
 away you download the mod and go play 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.420
 yourself 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.190
 but everything starts in standard rift and not 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.410
 through the streets although sometimes this person 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.120
 can be found in the tavern wanders some 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.400
 bearded pinch abalone with a mug of ale 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.830
 hands and maybe not a drunkard I have you 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.790
 just made that impression 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.100
 his name is wa jalla more 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.750
 or ate more in the manner of the Scandinavians and he 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.090
 tells us the story of the cave 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.980
 not far from rifthen they donâ€™t walk 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.180
 very pleasant rumors whether there bred 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.370
 ghosts whether deep in the cave 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.180
 there are two ugly ruins with ancient 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.769
 mechanisms 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.590
 who are just waiting for random travelers 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.230
 to deal with them jalla more but 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.519
 we will call him that way 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.290
 walked past the cave and heard 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.750
 strange terrible sounds reaching 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.519
 from there he is sure that from the cave 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.080
 something is wrong and asks us to go 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.420
 there and find out what is there all the same 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.340
 happens and we are like a decent hero 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.230
 We agree and our beginnings 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.690
 adventures in fashion 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.239
 near the cave against the bandits and even inside 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.950
 this kind of defense fully planned 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.290
 County we find interesting diaries 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 who talk about the Dwemer ruins 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.400
 and about the squad of mercenaries who went 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.870
 explore them down to the bottom 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.360
 dungeons we really start 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.370
 meets 2 nasty architecture and things 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.410
 start the case did not lie at the end 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.660
 dungeons waiting for us in a nasty centurion 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.120
 this is a rather difficult opponent especially 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.860
 at high difficulty levels I played on 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.930
 adepts but still managed to die 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.610
 a couple of times it is very accurate marks 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.360
 drenches deadly couples who 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.950
 kills in seconds 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.690
 By the way, I intend to decide to play the mod. 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.370
 new not pumped character to 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.379
 look at the stated by the author leveling 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.160
 as Skyrim and compatible with any level 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.120
 character 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.680
 still not lied by killing the centurion we 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.049
 find the last diary of seekers 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.640
 adventures they found some 2 nasty 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.590
 cube artifact with which you can 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.170
 get through the portal which stands in 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.519
 same room these guys are notable 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.359
 have fun playing with the ball 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.019
 centurion 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.700
 judging by the scattered around the corpse of the magician's corpse 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.099
 in the end we finish what we started 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.900
 mercenaries shooting in intended for him 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.790
 pedestal and ultimately open 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.790
 portal to the new world is not known to us 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.900
 We are met by a local resident who 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.489
 doesn't really explain anything besides 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.230
 that we have a village nearby 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.390
 looking for a blacksmith's apprentice from there 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.220
 whom the gangsters kidnapped and he will let go 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.290
 us from the iron cage which stands 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.420
 portal only if we help him find 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.610
 the blacksmith and the portal behind our back is very 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.550
 time closed who would doubt the devil 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.050
 take agree and go along with the new 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.150
 friend defend another cave with 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.230
 thugs which is rather strange considering 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.750
 that we are just a good fifteen 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.070
 minutes doing it 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.870
 promptly we clean the cave we find 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.700
 blacksmith and find out what thugs are you 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.220
 it turns out worked with some ingvara 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.750
 I am ral agnar ruler of the village in which 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.860
 our new friend lives urgently must 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.040
 find out this news 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.660
 but suddenly not our friend no blacksmith no 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.400
 can go and tell him everything 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.680
 because they supposedly have a lot 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.120
 important matters while somehow forgotten 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.490
 what i just got out of the portal 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.110
 that works then shouldn't have 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.650
 during this time he even managed a couple 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.810
 scary stories come up like this without 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.400
 any explanations for the ingvar and why 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.260
 we generally help these people us 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.360
 forcibly shoved into the storyline fashion 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.100
 it all looks pretty trite 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.810
 especially after it is interesting enough in 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.480
 the entry of this vile ruins and 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.870
 portal well what to do nothing we go by 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.510
 quest tag k'yar forehead 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.270
 and on the way and leveled 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.650
 fashion design graphic component 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.510
 it makes no sense to discuss because no 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.920
 no graphic changes were reported to 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.420
 the same author used resources 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.700
 original game and its content 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.860
 it seems as if he did not add so 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.980
 what about fought design then everything is pretty 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.390
 stereotyped forest field river settlements are not 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.480
 say that the developers discovered america 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.560
 but everything looks quite nice 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.900
 the only thing that really rushed 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.310
 in the eyes of the lack of grass with graphic 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.900
 my settings seem to be all in 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.210
 ok but herbs and so plainly and not 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.430
 saw the same forest without a bunch of grass and 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.350
 vegetation 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.420
 Well, finally we got to the village 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.490
 quick chatting with jarl and a little 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.750
 throwing off the load of the main quest from the shoulders I 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.540
 went to talk to the others 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.790
 residents of the settlement and here the author and 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.230
 yet there are authors like more than a hundred 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.710
 man in design to participate 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.450
 had time 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.880
 really managed to turn around 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.140
 a voice actor is very good for 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.990
 amateur project 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.250
 unless women's voices pumped up 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.260
 residents are constantly feeding you new 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.780
 information and bit by bit explain what 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.720
 here what's the side quests you can take 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.190
 every second or even 1 npc they too 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.470
 special originality does not shine 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.340
 worked for glory and do not give bored 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:42.080
 and sometimes they can even surprise you in general 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.630
 mod leaves quite a nice 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.490
 impressions especially files are good 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.620
 if you have already passed the original game and 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.110
 official department si far and wide and 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.150
 crave for new adventures but for me a little 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.040
 incomprehensible loud words about what 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.660
 this modification of the century which in level 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.970
 matches the official dlc 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.320
 yes nothing like 10 all that 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.690
 peculiar to the amateur project 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.150
 level empty world flat the game 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.010
 design some problems with dialogue but 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.810
 The potential of the mod is quite high and 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.640
 The author is generally well done that I could 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.830
 finish the project to the end and so declare 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.990
 I hope it will be taken to the whole world without 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.000
 congress teach to make games and one more 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.630
 talented game developers will become 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 more 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.860
 if you don't know english 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.420
 translation is now in progress 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.430
 development and I think that soon 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.260
 time it will be shared 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.240
 I strongly advise with the mod download
