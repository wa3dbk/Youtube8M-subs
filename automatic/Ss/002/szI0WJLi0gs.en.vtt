option

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.390 

we<00:01:29.690> just<00:01:29.990> increased<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.620> slight<00:01:30.920> little<00:01:31.220> bit

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
we just increased a slight little bit

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.050 
we just increased a slight little bit
obviously<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.120> depends<00:01:32.770> half<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:34.220> and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
obviously it depends half of it and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.209 
obviously it depends half of it and
slide<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.720> outline

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
slide the outline

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.190 
slide the outline
the<00:01:38.689> defined<00:01:39.689> line<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.319> which<00:01:40.469> on<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
the defined line on which on to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.980 
the defined line on which on to
basically<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.770> cut<00:01:43.979> out<00:01:44.249> a<00:01:44.609> half<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.479> Thailand

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
basically to cut out a half of Thailand

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.529 
basically to cut out a half of Thailand
was<00:01:46.170> inside<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.549> half<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.179> must<00:01:48.390> be

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
was inside and half of it must be

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.539 
was inside and half of it must be
outside<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.409> pick<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> highlight<00:01:50.310> color

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
outside I just pick a highlight color

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.870 
outside I just pick a highlight color
that<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:52.020> clearly<00:01:52.819> so<00:01:53.819> you

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that you can see really clearly so you

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
that you can see really clearly so you
can<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.569> what<00:01:54.780> you're<00:01:54.959> working<00:01:55.319> with<00:01:55.350> and
