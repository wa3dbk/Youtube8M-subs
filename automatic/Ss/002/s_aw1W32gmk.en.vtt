00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.770
 Hello, my name is Boik, Sergey, I 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.119
 I am an instructor drove you from day 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.129
 around the world we face different 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.959
 situations when we need 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.359
 repair our equipment 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.070
 low or high pressure hoses in 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.839
 during operation wear and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.619
 the worst when it happens exactly 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.960
 on a trip 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.210
 for this we have created such a fitting 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:35.010
 which allows you to connect the hose 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 assemble it and screw it to the regulator 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.670
 thereby troubleshoot how 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.010
 it works in life that's normal 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.440
 The standard regulator looks absolutely 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.470
 normal good and he keeps working 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.360
 pressure but it happens so under 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.090
 protectors that are recognized designed 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.750
 protect hoses are hiding like that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.290
 defects and on the trip you need this 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 moment 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:08.399
 eliminate for this we first have it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.990
 I will unscrew the frontal place in this place 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.820
 we will need to cut off the slag 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.690
 disassemble the fitting and take the outer nut 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.310
 the left thread is cut inside this nut 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.590
 the hole here is big enough for 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.710
 different types of hose hoses are 11 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.369
 millimeters 12 13 14 here actually 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.440
 crawl through any in order to 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.509
 it is easy to install its left thread 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.550
 cheat sometimes hoses are such 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.350
 that we just dress him now 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.840
 will need a little salt tip for 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.820
 to lubricate the inside 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.490
 which will enter directly 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.020
 flank if you use a regulator under 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.410
 oxygen you have to use 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.039
 oxygen mask for nightcross 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:57.000
 enough ordinary silicone and we have it 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.860
 we insert inside and we twist coming 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.820
 inside 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:07.220
 fitting we clamp the hose and presses and log 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.580
 the outer wall further need 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.580
 second key 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:21.530
 and two keys you secure it hose 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.530
 ready to install it on regular places 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.900
 some tread and even 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.420
 will get on and so and see that in 5 minutes 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.520
 I was repaired with nipples and 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.980
 now before diving we need 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.610
 check it out for this course we 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.800
 need a full tank 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.750
 you have a new connection and before 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.320
 it is necessary to dive 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.420
 check 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.760
 so that no one is hurt we 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.100
 we will cover just in case we rag 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.190
 open the air on the gauge we are not 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:59.530
 look see pressure 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.709
 that the 8 bar connection works for us 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.170
 you can check it for strength 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.620
 she is absolutely safe i'm on your eyes 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.180
 in five minutes I fixed the hose in the same way 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.070
 way you can repair not only 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.590
 broken hose, for example, shorten 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.330
 him if you need to inflator or 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.370
 on the second step when you collect 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.290
 scuba gear you definitely do test 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.300
 checks if you see that you have something 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.000
 something like that happened don't be lazy 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.800
 replace this connection remember 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.780
 your safety your as 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.780
 know that we work for you
