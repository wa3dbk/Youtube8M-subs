like<00:01:15.799> in<00:01:16.040> looks<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.689> my<00:01:17.689> first<00:01:18.110> impressions

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
like in looks and my first impressions

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.960 
like in looks and my first impressions
that<00:01:19.040> first<00:01:19.280> night<00:01:19.490> was<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
that first night was that the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.620 
that first night was that the
photo-ready

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
photo-ready

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.709 
photo-ready
was<00:01:21.200> not<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.560> good<00:01:21.890> foundation<00:01:22.119> first<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.359> all<00:01:23.479> I

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
was not a good foundation first of all I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.149 
was not a good foundation first of all I
have<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.990> be<00:01:24.079> honest<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:24.499> say<00:01:24.649> that<00:01:24.679> I<00:01:24.859> got<00:01:25.009> the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
have to be honest and say that I got the

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.370 
have to be honest and say that I got the
wrong<00:01:25.280> color<00:01:25.609> and<00:01:25.939> I<00:01:25.999> think<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.390> does<00:01:26.899> affect

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
wrong color and I think that does affect

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.380 
wrong color and I think that does affect
my<00:01:27.710> opinion<00:01:28.189> on<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.520> product<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.999> little<00:01:29.119> bit

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
my opinion on the product a little bit

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.450 
my opinion on the product a little bit
so<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.630> think<00:01:29.749> that<00:01:30.049> my<00:01:30.200> opinion<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:31.130> going<00:01:31.369> to

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
so I think that my opinion is going to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.520 
so I think that my opinion is going to
be<00:01:31.549> skewed<00:01:31.939> just<00:01:32.359> on<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.630> fact<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.380> was

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
be skewed just on the fact that it was

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.840 
be skewed just on the fact that it was
the<00:01:33.619> wrong<00:01:33.770> color<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.189> it<00:01:34.249> looks<00:01:34.280> ridiculous

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
the wrong color and it looks ridiculous

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.929 
the wrong color and it looks ridiculous
on<00:01:34.969> my<00:01:35.119> skin<00:01:35.420> but<00:01:36.020> even<00:01:36.380> color<00:01:37.100> aside<00:01:37.579> it

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
on my skin but even color aside it

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.020 
on my skin but even color aside it
didn't<00:01:38.600> blend<00:01:38.840> very<00:01:38.990> well<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:40.039> applied<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:40.909> with

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
didn't blend very well I applied it with

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.389 
didn't blend very well I applied it with
my<00:01:41.149> fingers<00:01:41.569> just<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.960> make<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:42.289> even<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:42.859> not

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
my fingers just to make it even and not

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.709 
my fingers just to make it even and not
have<00:01:43.579> to<00:01:43.700> worry<00:01:43.880> about<00:01:43.999> dirtying<00:01:44.539> up<00:01:44.569> the

have to worry about dirtying up the

have to worry about dirtying up the
brush<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.109> combining<00:01:45.499> the<00:01:45.590> products<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.280> I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
did it with two different hands and it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.709 
did it with two different hands and it
just<00:01:49.009> didn't<00:01:49.280> blend<00:01:49.579> easily<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:50.240> was<00:01:50.359> splotchy

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
just didn't blend easily it was splotchy

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.569 
just didn't blend easily it was splotchy
on<00:01:51.020> my<00:01:51.170> skin<00:01:51.499> and<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.829> shimmer<00:01:52.069> was<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
on my skin and the shimmer was like the

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.950 
on my skin and the shimmer was like the
number<00:01:52.850> one<00:01:52.999> complaint<00:01:53.329> against<00:01:53.840> this

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
number one complaint against this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.599 
number one complaint against this
foundation<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.770> your<00:01:55.069> face<00:01:55.280> looks<00:01:55.549> like

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
foundation is that your face looks like

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.940 
foundation is that your face looks like
a<00:01:55.729> disco<00:01:56.060> ball<00:01:56.359> I<00:01:56.630> think<00:01:57.319> that<00:01:57.469> in<00:01:57.619> direct

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
a disco ball I think that in direct

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.859 
a disco ball I think that in direct
sunlight<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:59.060> would<00:01:59.209> be<00:01:59.329> able<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.600> see<00:01:59.749> the

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
sunlight you would be able to see the

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.779 
sunlight you would be able to see the
shimmer<00:02:00.109> I<00:02:00.380> can't<00:02:01.009> see<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.340> shimmer<00:02:01.579> when

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
shimmer I can't see the shimmer when

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.340 
shimmer I can't see the shimmer when
it's<00:02:01.909> on<00:02:02.060> my<00:02:02.209> face<00:02:02.420> when<00:02:02.630> I'm<00:02:02.719> just<00:02:02.899> looking<00:02:03.229> in

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's on my face when I'm just looking in

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.980 
it's on my face when I'm just looking in
my<00:02:03.499> mirror<00:02:03.530> but<00:02:04.459> I<00:02:04.670> think<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.359> if<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:05.689> had

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
my mirror but I think that if you had

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.350 
my mirror but I think that if you had
porcelain<00:02:06.979> skin<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.609> you<00:02:07.729> didn't<00:02:08.060> need<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.209> lot

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
porcelain skin and you didn't need a lot

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.570 
porcelain skin and you didn't need a lot
of<00:02:08.509> coverage<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.259> didn't<00:02:09.619> have<00:02:09.800> like

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
of coverage and you didn't have like

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.070 
of coverage and you didn't have like
freckles<00:02:10.880> or<00:02:11.209> anything<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.690> think<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.990> would

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
freckles or anything I think it would

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.780 
freckles or anything I think it would
look<00:02:12.110> really<00:02:12.709> really<00:02:12.980> great<00:02:13.100> on<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.580> think

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
look really really great on you I think

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.150 
look really really great on you I think
the<00:02:14.090> combination<00:02:14.300> for<00:02:14.959> me<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.290> freckles<00:02:15.770> and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the combination for me of freckles and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.910 
the combination for me of freckles and
shimmer<00:02:17.090> just<00:02:17.630> didn't<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.410> just<00:02:18.530> didn't<00:02:18.860> look

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
shimmer just didn't it just didn't look

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.500 
shimmer just didn't it just didn't look
good<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.160> didn't<00:02:19.610> like<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:19.940> foundation<00:02:20.270> at

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
good I didn't like this foundation at

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.480 
good I didn't like this foundation at
all<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.990> other<00:02:21.140> foundation<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.950> color<00:02:22.160> stay

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
all the other foundation the color stay

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.580 
all the other foundation the color stay
I<00:02:22.520> had<00:02:22.850> on<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.180> side<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.420> my<00:02:23.600> face<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:24.050> think

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
I had on this side of my face I think

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.500 
I had on this side of my face I think
that<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.830> applied<00:02:25.159> a<00:02:25.430> lot<00:02:25.700> easier<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.269> was<00:02:26.390> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
that it applied a lot easier it was the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.160 
that it applied a lot easier it was the
right<00:02:26.689> color<00:02:26.930> which<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.439> course<00:02:27.470> helped

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
right color which of course helped

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.010 
right color which of course helped
but<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.920> does<00:02:29.220> dry<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:30.000> quickly<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.690> had

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
but it does dry really quickly so I had

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.960 
but it does dry really quickly so I had
to<00:02:31.200> blend<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.709> pretty<00:02:31.980> quickly<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.520> had<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.880> do

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
to blend it pretty quickly I had to do

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.760 
to blend it pretty quickly I had to do
sections<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.630> my<00:02:33.750> face<00:02:33.989> instead<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> whole

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
sections of my face instead of the whole

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.640 
sections of my face instead of the whole
half<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:36.270> also<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.989> one<00:02:37.170> doesn't<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.500> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
half and also this one doesn't have a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.589 
half and also this one doesn't have a
pump<00:02:38.040> which<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.640> really<00:02:38.849> annoying<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.360> one

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
pump which was really annoying this one

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.910 
pump which was really annoying this one
has<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.959> nice<00:02:40.170> little<00:02:40.500> pump<00:02:40.739> to

the color state is not and I am NOT a

the color state is not and I am NOT a
big<00:02:43.980> fan<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.280> foundations<00:02:44.970> without<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> pump

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
big fan of foundations without a pump

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.699 
big fan of foundations without a pump
just<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.230> makes<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.650> really

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
just because it makes it really

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.190 
just because it makes it really
difficult<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.940> always<00:02:48.330> lose<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.690> ton<00:02:49.140> of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
difficult you always lose a ton of

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.350 
difficult you always lose a ton of
product<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.800> way<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.819> think<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.060> I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
product that way and I just think it's I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.120 
product that way and I just think it's I
just<00:02:51.780> don't<00:02:52.200> think<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.440> would<00:02:52.560> be<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.920> much

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
just don't think it would be that much

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.800 
just don't think it would be that much
more<00:02:53.340> expensive<00:02:53.550> for<00:02:53.850> Revlon<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.390> put<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> pump

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
more expensive for Revlon to put a pump

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.210 
more expensive for Revlon to put a pump
on<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.290> would<00:02:55.350> make<00:02:55.560> life<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.100> much

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
on it and it would make life so much

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.890 
on it and it would make life so much
easier<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.760> us<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> don't<00:02:57.209> understand<00:02:57.780> why

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
easier for us so I don't understand why

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.420 
easier for us so I don't understand why
it<00:02:57.959> doesn't<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.319> pump

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.789 

so<00:03:02.939> I<00:03:02.970> blended<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.870> out<00:03:03.959> on<00:03:04.200> my<00:03:04.290> skin<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.739> I

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
so I blended it out on my skin and I

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.770 
so I blended it out on my skin and I
really<00:03:05.310> liked<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.700> coverage<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.299> enough

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
really liked the coverage of this enough

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.990 
really liked the coverage of this enough
that<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.470> would<00:03:07.829> honestly<00:03:08.189> recommend<00:03:08.610> this

sheer<00:03:17.909> coverage<00:03:18.209> I'm<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:18.569> gonna<00:03:18.720> go<00:03:18.870> for<00:03:19.019> a

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079

sheer coverage I'm just gonna go for a
tinted<00:03:19.379> moisturizer<00:03:19.590> I'm<00:03:20.159> not<00:03:20.310> gonna<00:03:20.489> try<00:03:20.670> to

do<00:03:20.879> a<00:03:20.909> liquid<00:03:21.299> foundation<00:03:21.420> because<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.230> kind

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
do a liquid foundation because that kind

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.199 
do a liquid foundation because that kind
of<00:03:22.500> defeats<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.890> purpose<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.400> think<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:24.000> I've

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
of defeats the purpose I think so I've

I go over it I just buff it out with the

I go over it I just buff it out with the
109<00:03:41.069> brush<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.819> it's<00:03:41.940> real<00:03:42.120> smooth

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
109 brush just so that it's real smooth

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.869 
109 brush just so that it's real smooth
looking<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.139> I<00:03:43.920> haven't<00:03:44.310> been<00:03:44.430> setting<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
looking and I haven't been setting it

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.250 
looking and I haven't been setting it
with<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> powder<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.480> don't<00:03:45.780> really<00:03:45.900> think<00:03:45.989> it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
with a powder I don't really think it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.960 
with a powder I don't really think it
needs<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.680> think<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:46.980> dries<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.549> really

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
needs it I think it dries to a really

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.240 
needs it I think it dries to a really
powdery<00:03:48.689> finish<00:03:49.139> and<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.620> really<00:03:49.859> like<00:03:50.069> that

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
powdery finish and I really like that

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.360 
powdery finish and I really like that
now<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.120> do<00:03:51.540> think<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.620> one<00:03:52.769> for<00:03:53.010> oily

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
now I do think that the one for oily

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.610 
now I do think that the one for oily
skin<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:53.909> little<00:03:54.299> bit<00:03:54.420> harder<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.290> blend

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
skin is a little bit harder to blend

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.470 
skin is a little bit harder to blend
than<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.189> dry<00:03:56.400> skin<00:03:56.459> version<00:03:56.879> because<00:03:57.299> the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
than the dry skin version because the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.059 
than the dry skin version because the
dry<00:03:57.689> skin<00:03:57.750> does<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.439> moisturizing

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
dry skin does have moisturizing

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.710 
dry skin does have moisturizing
properties<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.819> I<00:03:59.939> think<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.269> reason<00:04:00.599> why

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
properties to it I think the reason why

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.479 
properties to it I think the reason why
this<00:04:00.780> foundation<00:04:01.439> is<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:01.739> popular<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.459> because

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
this foundation is so popular is because

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.940 
this foundation is so popular is because
when<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.569> first<00:04:03.780> came<00:04:04.049> out<00:04:04.260> there<00:04:04.439> was<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.620> ton

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
when it first came out there was a ton

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.470 
when it first came out there was a ton
of<00:04:04.980> hype<00:04:05.250> around<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.790> saying<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.329> was

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
of hype around it saying that it was

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.129

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
haven't had any problems with the color

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.120 
haven't had any problems with the color
stay<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.760> photo-ready<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.539> supposed<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.260> make

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
stay the photo-ready is supposed to make

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.189 
stay the photo-ready is supposed to make
your<00:04:50.280> skin<00:04:50.550> look<00:04:50.699> airbrushed<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.720> that's<00:04:51.990> why

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
your skin look airbrushed and that's why

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.420 
your skin look airbrushed and that's why
it's<00:04:52.349> supposed<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.680> look<00:04:52.830> good<00:04:53.010> in<00:04:53.159> pictures

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
it's supposed to look good in pictures

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.790 
it's supposed to look good in pictures
with<00:04:53.940> flash<00:04:54.240> photography<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.530> shimmer

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
with flash photography and the shimmer

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.439 
with flash photography and the shimmer
is<00:04:56.010> supposed<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.340> just<00:04:56.520> make<00:04:56.699> your<00:04:56.880> face<00:04:57.090> glow

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
is supposed to just make your face glow

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.480 
is supposed to just make your face glow
I<00:04:57.690> think<00:04:58.139> that<00:04:58.260> it<00:04:58.349> does<00:04:58.560> make<00:04:58.800> your<00:04:58.949> face<00:04:59.190> glow

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
I think that it does make your face glow

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.300 
I think that it does make your face glow
but<00:04:59.789> for<00:05:00.060> me<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.510> was<00:05:00.690> not<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.320> good<00:05:01.590> purchase<00:05:01.889> I

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
but for me it was not a good purchase I

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.070 
but for me it was not a good purchase I
don't<00:05:02.610> recommend<00:05:02.909> it<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.449> think<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:03.900> the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
don't recommend it I think that the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.020 
don't recommend it I think that the
color<00:05:04.289> stay<00:05:04.590> is<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.800> good<00:05:05.010> purchase<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.699> I<00:05:05.820> have

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
color stay is a good purchase and I have

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.790 
color stay is a good purchase and I have
been<00:05:06.210> wearing<00:05:06.419> it<00:05:06.659> and<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:06.840> do<00:05:06.900> recommend<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.620> I

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
been wearing it and I do recommend it I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.500 
been wearing it and I do recommend it I
think<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.310> best<00:05:08.340> way<00:05:08.699> I<00:05:08.729> found<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:09.210> apply<00:05:09.449> it

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
think the best way I found to apply it

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.180 
think the best way I found to apply it
like<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.840> said<00:05:10.020> was<00:05:10.199> just<00:05:10.409> with<00:05:10.590> my<00:05:10.770> fingers

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
like I said was just with my fingers

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.459 
like I said was just with my fingers
because<00:05:11.430> it's<00:05:12.270> kind<00:05:12.599> of<00:05:12.719> a<00:05:12.900> thick<00:05:13.229> consistency

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
because it's kind of a thick consistency

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.439 
because it's kind of a thick consistency
so<00:05:14.219> if<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.490> warm<00:05:14.760> it<00:05:14.820> up<00:05:14.940> with<00:05:15.000> your<00:05:15.240> feet

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
so if you warm it up with your feet

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.390 
so if you warm it up with your feet
and<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.289> apply<00:05:16.559> it<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:16.740> your<00:05:16.800> skin<00:05:17.069> you<00:05:17.129> kind

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
and you apply it to your skin you kind

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.040 
and you apply it to your skin you kind
of<00:05:17.430> press<00:05:17.610> it<00:05:17.729> into<00:05:17.969> your<00:05:18.059> skin<00:05:18.389> like<00:05:18.599> this<00:05:18.779> I

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
of press it into your skin like this I

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.559 
of press it into your skin like this I
think<00:05:19.529> that<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:20.009> kind<00:05:20.249> of<00:05:20.490> melts<00:05:21.360> into<00:05:21.479> your

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
think that it kind of melts into your

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:22.969 
think that it kind of melts into your
skin<00:05:21.689> and<00:05:22.139> gives<00:05:22.289> you<00:05:22.409> the<00:05:22.529> most<00:05:22.680> flawless

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979
