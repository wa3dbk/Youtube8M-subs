00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:06.640
 to tweak in a few months my best gift that we remember the law 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.039
 starts with year 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.459
 sometimes it's the norm a cold at the parish as long as it lasts 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 to silence voices all other things than record income 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.720
 for several months things 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.739
 of course the bce 4 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.629
 it's going south-north in poverty a cold year in a very 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:30.270
 important 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.110
 we wear a man not 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.810
 the execution we will recover well and it must go further 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.579
 reform 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.530
 a little more the death penalty 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.190
 ap to face the crisis we will be long the capital we talk about 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.240
 resources 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.570
 so not in a global way 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.609
 that's why but to have it 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.609
 he occupied 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.940
 it remains the same 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 Okay 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.200
 nobody 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.549
 for a week now we have added 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.549
 the cuttings in vatican 5 ap 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
 I am very small 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.310
 the few jokes about my weight 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.079
 it was believed according to the commissioner for now no point is simply 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.600
 something a bit simple restaurant nearby and in power 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 yet last two years 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 v 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.860
 the most promising passage of the agreement 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.350
 the euro was worth 1,665 why try to repair their advance 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.540
 we started at the beginning 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.220
 but we are going 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.010
 currently 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.550
 bring to a boil 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.800
 so the cream 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 p I must say that I find very important 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 32 6% with 40 the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.470
 castagne nothing amazing 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.239
 the socialist 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.239
 it is 11 9% for a bit like that 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.879
 however this game philosophy for the little story 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.359
 all legal remedies to remove all traces 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.189
 even more the trend is within the reach of Clermont 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.149
 let us unite 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.149
 the highest in human history so that 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.199
 now you just have to sit on the table 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.989
 then with the pretty kickoff 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.310
 from the water 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.870
 arbitrator
