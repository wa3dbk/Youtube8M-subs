everything gets really quiet only thing
here<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.099> bubbles<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.970> your<00:00:30.359> own<00:00:30.510> oxygen

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
here is the bubbles of your own oxygen

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.500 
here is the bubbles of your own oxygen
you<00:00:31.349> look<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.009> see<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.910> waves<00:00:33.120> from

reef and fish and he's just floating in

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
reef and fish and he's just floating in
space<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.379> great<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.399> incredible

space and it's great it was incredible

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.389 
space and it's great it was incredible
to<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.930> all<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> different<00:00:43.530> fish<00:00:43.770> all

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
to see like all the different fish all

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.060 
to see like all the different fish all
around<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.559> they<00:00:46.559> kind<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.890> treat

divers like tourists you know what I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.049 
divers like tourists you know what I
mean<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.590> ignore<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.100> completely<00:00:50.489> and

go about their business

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.330 
go about their business
we<00:00:53.940> had<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.329> these<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> survey<00:00:56.039> sheets

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
we had these these kind of survey sheets

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.580 
we had these these kind of survey sheets
they<00:00:56.789> had<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> species<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.289> every

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
they had the species on it and every

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.260 
they had the species on it and every
time<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.770> saw<00:00:59.010> species<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.550> would<00:00:59.579> mark<00:01:00.120> down

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
time I saw species we would mark down

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.209 
time I saw species we would mark down
what<00:01:00.329> species<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.109> saw<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> how<00:01:01.649> much<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.070> them

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
what species we saw and how much of them

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.740 
what species we saw and how much of them
so<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.609> would<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:03.059> down<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
so you would go down with a like a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.440 
so you would go down with a like a
clipboard<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.830> write<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.339> how<00:01:06.119> many<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
clipboard and write down how many of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
clipboard and write down how many of
each<00:01:06.570> thing<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.020> saw<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> hard

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
each thing you saw it was kind of hard

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
each thing you saw it was kind of hard
to<00:01:08.400> identify<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:09.210> first<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
to identify at first but you get the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
to identify at first but you get the
hang<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:11.100> submitted<00:01:11.490> those<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> reef

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
hang of it we submitted those to reef

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
hang of it we submitted those to reef
not<00:01:12.150> org<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.510> data<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.200> will<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.710> used

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
not org as data which will then be used

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.310 
not org as data which will then be used
by<00:01:14.220> scientists<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.119> various<00:01:15.720> different

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
by scientists in various different

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530 
by scientists in various different
studies<00:01:16.740> all<00:01:17.220> across<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> board<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
studies all across the board so

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.679 
studies all across the board so
hopefully<00:01:18.930> our<00:01:19.460> work<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:21.180> lead<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> things

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
hopefully our work will lead to things

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.080 
hopefully our work will lead to things
like<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.229> conservation<00:01:23.090> helping

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
like that in conservation helping

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
like that in conservation helping
maintain<00:01:24.270> great<00:01:24.750> health<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.189> best

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
maintain great health one of the best

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.020 
maintain great health one of the best
things<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.960> how<00:01:28.500> fast<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.670> learn

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
things is just how fast you do learn

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.840 
things is just how fast you do learn
when<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.950> real-world

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
when you are in that real-world

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.240 
when you are in that real-world
situation<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.770> felt<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.130> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
situation because going in I felt like I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.429 
situation because going in I felt like I
knew<00:01:35.430> maybe<00:01:35.640> 20<00:01:36.090> fish<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> by<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> end<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.229> had

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
knew maybe 20 fish and by the end I had

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.390 
knew maybe 20 fish and by the end I had
documented<00:01:38.509> 97<00:01:39.509> fish<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.590> gave<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
documented 97 fish and it gave you a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760 
documented 97 fish and it gave you a
real<00:01:41.729> taste<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.299> what<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> could<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
real taste of what it could be like to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.520 
real taste of what it could be like to
sort<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.189> work<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> research<00:01:44.939> project<00:01:45.530> which

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sort of work on a research project which

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
sort of work on a research project which
is<00:01:47.009> something<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.700> definitely<00:01:47.880> interested

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
is something I'm definitely interested

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.039 
is something I'm definitely interested
in<00:01:48.840> doing<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:50.000> feel<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.390> became
