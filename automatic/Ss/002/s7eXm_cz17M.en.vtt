00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
well pretty much what will resemble a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.200 
well pretty much what will resemble a
jordan<00:01:12.840> royal<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.439> same<00:01:14.369> scenario<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
jordan royal one same scenario with this

jordan royal one same scenario with this
one<00:01:15.450> except<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.960> it'll<00:01:16.140> look<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> bread

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
one except for it'll look like the bread

one except for it'll look like the bread
colorway<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.570> differences<00:01:19.049> between<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
colorway and the differences between the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
colorway and the differences between the
two<00:01:19.590> are<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.880> souls<00:01:21.210> are

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
two are going to be that the souls are

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
two are going to be that the souls are
always<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.900> different<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:23.159> are

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
always going to be different these are

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.060 
always going to be different these are
going<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.700> crazy<00:01:23.820> prices<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.770> pretty

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
going for crazy prices I that's pretty

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
going for crazy prices I that's pretty
much<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> reason<00:01:26.460> why<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> held<00:01:27.150> off<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.509> long

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
much the reason why it held off so long

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.280 
much the reason why it held off so long
I<00:01:27.990> actually<00:01:28.229> had<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> friend<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> my
