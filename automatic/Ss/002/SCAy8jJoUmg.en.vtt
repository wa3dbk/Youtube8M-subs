tooth or multiple T very or we have to
weigh<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.450> options<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.440> dental<00:03:31.829> bridge

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
weigh the options of a dental bridge

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.420 
weigh the options of a dental bridge
versus<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.090> dental<00:03:33.600> implant<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.950> should<00:03:35.190> know

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
versus a dental implant you should know

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.030 
versus a dental implant you should know
a<00:03:35.810> permanent<00:03:36.810> bridge<00:03:36.989> has<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.799> disadvantage

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
a permanent bridge has the disadvantage

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.300 
a permanent bridge has the disadvantage
of<00:03:38.670> filing<00:03:39.480> down<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.900> teeth<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.350> either<00:03:40.769> side

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
of filing down the teeth on either side

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.599 
of filing down the teeth on either side
of<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.940> missing<00:03:42.299> space<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:43.410> process<00:03:43.950> can

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
of the missing space this process can

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.090 
of the missing space this process can
lead<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.329> premature<00:03:45.600> aging<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.650> these<00:03:46.829> teeth

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
lead to premature aging of these teeth

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.140 
lead to premature aging of these teeth
so<00:03:47.670> tooth<00:03:48.000> implants<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:49.170> be<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.440> better<00:03:49.739> option

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
so tooth implants can be a better option

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.030 
so tooth implants can be a better option
however<00:03:51.150> sometimes<00:03:51.900> these<00:03:52.350> adjacent<00:03:52.680> teeth

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
however sometimes these adjacent teeth

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.640 
however sometimes these adjacent teeth

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
have larger fillings and are better off

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.580 
have larger fillings and are better off

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
caps sometimes a price of teeth implants

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.920 
caps sometimes a price of teeth implants
or<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.489> cost<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:03.000> permanent<00:04:03.450> tooth<00:04:03.600> bridge
