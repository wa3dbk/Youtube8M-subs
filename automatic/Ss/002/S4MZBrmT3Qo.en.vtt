00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.950
 work at 5 numbers cap 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.909
 I 'm going to show you an exercise for 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.539
 endurance 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:19.210
 so that's going to be an exercise that goes 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.310
 make you more efficient at the level of 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.250
 endurance 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.359
 I'm not going to do it just I just 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.849
 show how to do it and you 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.089
 reproduce you reproduce that at the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.370
 room where you and again 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.490
 I still have not found my gloves in 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.560
 did I find a glove and a glove but 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.750
 two different so that 's okay not the 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.240
 so do imagine that I have gloves 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.630
 it does not feel like the big kgs go 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.020
 slowly 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.800
 ok so that's gone cake what he 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 this is very simple it is about 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.000
 to make ramps 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.400
 you 're going to hit like that like that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.790
 it's the daily routine of the boxer 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.570
 he must redo in his regime 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.930
 drive 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.290
 at least once a week a job 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.260
 of endurance the endurance work and 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.990
 not only to the bag the bag must not 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.979
 train one hour at the bag the bag these 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.790
 genres its 3.34 walls in five big 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.740
 go there 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.560
 it depends you see in your 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.250
 program do not have to work a 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.700
 hour of 5 at bottom and no I was working 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.930
 Well, it's better to work hard 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.450
 little time long and dad well 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.100
 what sent and then we must not do 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.740
 only one thing you make the bag 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.369
 not your daddy you play with your table 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.149
 between you do it's not me them 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.550
 sparring jumping rope 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.380
 bodybuilding pumping the gym the 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.869
 abs finally all there is in the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.630
 boxing what is very repetitive so that 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.670
 there is not the only roped the race to 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.979
 foot the bag the sparring and then the gym 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.720
 corner and the gym do some 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.400
 easing all that so it's very 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 repetitive but not what I mean 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.570
 it's not burning in one 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.730
 exercise ok so that's the daily 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.880
 of the boxer what is it then the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.400
 live work then you work 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.459
 close by and then you step back 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.540
 work your reach then of 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.400
 good strikes did not lie well 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.079
 too powerful and not too weak no 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.840
 more then what are you going to do 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:45.080
 accelerate for 5 seconds 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.269
 our lax okay you do that and 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:55.280
 then the second the same thing with the 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:03:01.879
 hyper he was doing that starts well 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:10.730
 breathe so you accelerate since the 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:12.950
 same thing be the hooks so that's it 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.030
 will work your stamina you 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.160
 just go there for 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.799
 each language 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.130
 they have three series of accelerations done 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.629
 at your own pace 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.230
 when you feel you can not 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.299
 do more keep in memory the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.090
 performance you did but 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.120
 little by little you will do 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.720
 better later ok so here's a job 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.239
