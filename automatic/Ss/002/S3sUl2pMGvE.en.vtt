Dreamcast<00:06:18.569> emulator<00:06:18.959> that<00:06:19.199> arcane<00:06:19.559> kids

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
Dreamcast emulator that arcane kids

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.759 
Dreamcast emulator that arcane kids
built<00:06:20.009> so<00:06:20.249> we<00:06:21.229> even<00:06:22.229> there's<00:06:22.439> a<00:06:22.529> cheat<00:06:22.739> code

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:22.769 
built so we even there's a cheat code

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:25.189 
built so we even there's a cheat code
that<00:06:23.069> lets<00:06:23.189> you<00:06:23.249> play<00:06:23.369> Shane<00:06:23.639> me<00:06:23.789> maybe<00:06:24.689> I<00:06:24.959> can

that lets you play Shane me maybe I can
kind<00:06:25.439> of<00:06:25.499> understand<00:06:25.949> why<00:06:26.099> that<00:06:26.279> didn't<00:06:26.729> end

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
kind of understand why that didn't end

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.279

up<00:06:26.909> getting<00:06:27.029> shipped<00:06:28.699> Eggman<00:06:29.699> origin<00:06:30.080> again<00:06:31.080> I

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
up getting shipped Eggman origin again I

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.719 
up getting shipped Eggman origin again I
think<00:06:31.379> sticking<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:31.979> chronological<00:06:32.550> order

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
think sticking to chronological order

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.779 
think sticking to chronological order
makes<00:06:32.879> most<00:06:33.089> sense<00:06:33.179> yeah<00:06:34.099> almost<00:06:35.099> nothing<00:06:35.669> is

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
makes most sense yeah almost nothing is

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.129 
makes most sense yeah almost nothing is
known<00:06:35.819> about<00:06:36.089> Eggman<00:06:36.479> origin<00:06:36.869> there's<00:06:37.019> no

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139
