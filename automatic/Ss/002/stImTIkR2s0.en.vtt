to<00:00:58.680> rename<00:00:58.949> your<00:00:59.070> character<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.879> which

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to rename your character I think which

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
to rename your character I think which
is<00:01:00.059> pretty<00:01:00.300> cool<00:01:00.570> stalemate<00:01:01.350> detection<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is pretty cool stalemate detection I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.619 
is pretty cool stalemate detection I
really<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.910> because<00:01:03.120> you'd<00:01:03.329> actually<00:01:03.449> be

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
really like because you'd actually be

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.219 
really like because you'd actually be
surprised<00:01:04.080> how<00:01:04.290> often<00:01:04.470> stalemates<00:01:05.189> occur

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
surprised how often stalemates occur

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.250 
surprised how often stalemates occur
quite<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.439> bit<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.510> there's<00:01:09.720> no<00:01:09.869> income

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
quite a bit so now if there's no income

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
quite a bit so now if there's no income
production<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:10.950> destroyed<00:01:11.670> structures<00:01:12.119> for

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
production or destroyed structures for

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.820 
production or destroyed structures for
three<00:01:12.600> consecutive<00:01:12.750> minutes<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.560> looks<00:01:13.680> like

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
three consecutive minutes it looks like

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.050 
three consecutive minutes it looks like
the<00:01:14.369> server<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:15.180> detect<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.689> stalemate<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
the server will detect a stalemate and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
the server will detect a stalemate and
yeah<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.479> there's<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.619> any

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
yeah so there's not going to be any

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
yeah so there's not going to be any
awkward<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.790> hour<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> half<00:01:21.360> long<00:01:21.570> games

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
awkward like hour and a half long games

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
hallucination is definitely an underused

the<00:02:15.400> Phoenix<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.180> pretty<00:02:16.420> big<00:02:16.629> deal

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
the Phoenix this is a pretty big deal

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.929 
the Phoenix this is a pretty big deal
that's<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.260> pretty<00:02:17.470> significant<00:02:18.220> decrease<00:02:18.730> in

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
that's a pretty significant decrease in

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
build time which I don't know how

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.270 
build time which I don't know how
necessary<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.970> was<00:02:22.200> just<00:02:23.200> because<00:02:23.349> Phoenix<00:02:24.099> is

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
necessary it was just because Phoenix is

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.149 
necessary it was just because Phoenix is
or<00:02:24.909> Phoenix<00:02:25.629> aren't<00:02:25.870> necessarily<00:02:26.349> a<00:02:26.530> really

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
or Phoenix aren't necessarily a really

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.910 
or Phoenix aren't necessarily a really
underused<00:02:27.790> unit<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:29.290> buff<00:02:29.560> could<00:02:29.799> be

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
underused unit and this buff could be

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.890 
underused unit and this buff could be
pretty<00:02:30.190> dramatic<00:02:30.280> FOID<00:02:31.239> raise<00:02:31.420> now<00:02:31.569> do<00:02:31.629> more

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
pretty dramatic FOID raise now do more

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.110 
pretty dramatic FOID raise now do more

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
damage to massive targets so of course

Colossus<00:02:35.019> Thor<00:02:35.379> ultralisks<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.610> think<00:02:37.239> that's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
Colossus Thor ultralisks I think that's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.330

this<00:02:55.120> has<00:02:55.269> actually<00:02:55.329> been<00:02:55.540> introduced<00:02:55.930> in

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
this has actually been introduced in

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.660 
this has actually been introduced in
previous<00:02:56.440> patches<00:02:56.859> as<00:02:56.980> well<00:02:57.159> they<00:02:57.340> decrease

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
previous patches as well they decrease

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.270 
previous patches as well they decrease
the<00:02:57.790> build<00:02:58.030> time<00:02:58.150> from<00:02:58.329> 35<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.810> 30<00:02:59.319> but<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.159> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
the build time from 35 to 30 but in the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.149 
the build time from 35 to 30 but in the
previous<00:03:00.549> patches<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.209> was<00:03:01.450> re<00:03:02.079> up<00:03:02.109> to<00:03:02.440> 35<00:03:02.889> once

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
previous patches it was re up to 35 once

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.550 
previous patches it was re up to 35 once
again<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.730> as<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.480> says<00:03:04.629> here<00:03:04.659> this<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.049> only

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
again and as it says here this is only

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.399 
again and as it says here this is only
gonna<00:03:05.650> be<00:03:05.799> temporary<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:07.269> yeah<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.079> think<00:03:08.170> it's

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
gonna be temporary so yeah I think it's

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.539 
gonna be temporary so yeah I think it's
going<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.620> experiment<00:03:08.859> with<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.310> little

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
going to experiment with that a little

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.500 
going to experiment with that a little
bit<00:03:09.639> i'm<00:03:09.760> not<00:03:09.879> sure<00:03:10.030> if<00:03:10.120> that's<00:03:10.209> going<00:03:10.359> to<00:03:10.420> be

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
bit i'm not sure if that's going to be

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.500 
bit i'm not sure if that's going to be
permanent<00:03:11.489> SCV's<00:03:12.489> now<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.790> same<00:03:13.060> threat

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
permanent SCV's now the same threat

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.599 
permanent SCV's now the same threat
priority<00:03:14.049> as<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.769> unit<00:03:14.980> they're<00:03:15.129> repairing<00:03:15.400> I

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
priority as the unit they're repairing I

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.819 
priority as the unit they're repairing I
don't<00:03:15.730> think<00:03:15.849> that's<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.090> huge<00:03:16.299> deal

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
don't think that's a huge deal

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.930 
don't think that's a huge deal
construction<00:03:17.829> movement<00:03:18.220> more<00:03:18.400> consistent

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
construction movement more consistent

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.509 
construction movement more consistent
with<00:03:19.030> STV<00:03:19.449> that's<00:03:19.750> pretty<00:03:20.739> reasonable<00:03:21.010> I

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
with STV that's pretty reasonable I

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.500 
with STV that's pretty reasonable I
guess<00:03:21.730> it's<00:03:21.849> going<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.030> be<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.120> little<00:03:22.269> easier

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
couple of things I mean Phoenix for

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.699 
couple of things I mean Phoenix for
example<00:03:50.019> are<00:03:50.079> gonna<00:03:50.169> be<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> lot<00:03:50.379> harder<00:03:50.440> to

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
example are gonna be a lot harder to

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.430 
example are gonna be a lot harder to
deal<00:03:50.919> with<00:03:50.949> because<00:03:51.940> if<00:03:52.359> you've<00:03:52.660> got<00:03:52.810> Mutis<00:03:53.319> in

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
deal with because if you've got Mutis in

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.930 
deal with because if you've got Mutis in
the<00:03:53.560> air<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.919> can't<00:03:54.160> fungal<00:03:54.579> growth<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
the air you can't fungal growth the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.610 
the air you can't fungal growth the
Phoenix<00:03:55.389> so<00:03:55.569> that<00:03:55.720> your<00:03:55.870> mutis<00:03:56.230> can<00:03:56.409> get<00:03:56.530> that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
Phoenix so that your mutis can get that

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.949 
Phoenix so that your mutis can get that
splash<00:03:57.040> damage<00:03:57.400> it's<00:03:58.299> going<00:03:58.419> to<00:03:58.480> make<00:03:58.540> Phoenix

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
splash damage it's going to make Phoenix

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.330 
splash damage it's going to make Phoenix
really<00:03:59.199> hard<00:03:59.349> to<00:03:59.440> deal<00:03:59.590> with<00:03:59.620> zerg<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.250> know

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
really hard to deal with zerg you know

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.250 
really hard to deal with zerg you know
would<00:04:00.489> have<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.699> go<00:04:00.790> kind<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.060> mass<00:04:01.269> air<00:04:01.569> verse

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
would have to go kind of mass air verse

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.740 
would have to go kind of mass air verse
them<00:04:02.790> drops<00:04:03.790> as<00:04:04.030> well<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:04.510> going<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.690> be

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
them drops as well it's going to be

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.289 
them drops as well it's going to be
harder<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.049> pick<00:04:05.290> off<00:04:05.609> medevacs<00:04:06.609> as<00:04:06.940> they<00:04:07.180> can

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
harder to pick off medevacs as they can

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.000 
harder to pick off medevacs as they can
just<00:04:07.449> lift<00:04:07.629> off<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.049> escape<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.560> ensnare

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
just lift off and escape you can ensnare

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.640 
just lift off and escape you can ensnare
the<00:04:09.340> medevac<00:04:09.729> so<00:04:10.510> that's<00:04:11.169> just<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.440> couple

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
the medevac so that's just a couple

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.119 
the medevac so that's just a couple
examples<00:04:12.099> of<00:04:12.760> many<00:04:13.620> about<00:04:14.620> how<00:04:14.769> this<00:04:14.979> is

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
examples of many about how this is

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.740 
examples of many about how this is
really<00:04:15.459> going<00:04:15.669> to<00:04:15.760> affect<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:16.150> game<00:04:16.329> so<00:04:16.659> it's

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
really going to affect the game so it's

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.060 
really going to affect the game so it's
a<00:04:16.780> pretty<00:04:16.959> big<00:04:17.079> deal<00:04:17.139> I'm<00:04:17.530> really<00:04:17.829> interested
