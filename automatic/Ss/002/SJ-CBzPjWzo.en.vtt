00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
disconnect one is this plug right here

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
disconnect one is this plug right here
which<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.939> believe<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> reverse<00:01:15.900> switch

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
which I believe is the reverse switch

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.560

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
slave cylinder so the plug I believe

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:42.910 
slave cylinder so the plug I believe
will<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.619> pop<00:01:28.619> out

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920

looks like a 12 millimeter 12-point
range

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
range

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.250 
range
I've<00:03:17.579> gotten<00:03:18.030> three<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.480> four<00:03:18.720> bolts<00:03:19.079> out

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
I've gotten three of the four bolts out

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.990 
I've gotten three of the four bolts out
and<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.709> loose<00:03:20.190> now<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.639> I<00:03:20.670> just<00:03:20.819> need<00:03:20.970> to

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
and it's loose now so I just need to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.470 
and it's loose now so I just need to
finish<00:03:21.269> removing<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:23.130> bolt<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.639> I'll<00:03:24.209> slide

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
finish removing this bolt and I'll slide

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.789 
finish removing this bolt and I'll slide
the<00:03:24.780> drive<00:03:25.380> shaft<00:03:25.709> out<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.900> transmission

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
the drive shaft out of the transmission

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.720 
the drive shaft out of the transmission
up<00:03:28.980> there<00:03:30.769> next<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.859> need<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:32.130> remove<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
up there next I need to remove the

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.250 
up there next I need to remove the
starter<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.359> it's<00:03:33.510> important<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.049> I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
starter so it's important that I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.409 
starter so it's important that I
disconnect<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.090> battery<00:03:38.090> before<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.120> remove

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
disconnect the battery before I remove

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.839 
disconnect the battery before I remove
the<00:03:39.690> starter<00:03:40.079> bolts<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.829> need<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.610> disconnect

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
the starter bolts I need to disconnect

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:50.819 
the starter bolts I need to disconnect
the<00:03:43.510> electrical<00:03:44.430> leads<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:46.569> starter<00:03:49.829> it

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
the electrical leads the starter it

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.959 
the electrical leads the starter it
looks<00:03:50.980> like<00:03:51.129> there<00:03:51.400> are<00:03:51.579> two<00:03:52.239> Nets<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:53.969> 10

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:54.969 
looks like there are two Nets a 10

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.599 
looks like there are two Nets a 10
millimeter<00:03:55.329> and<00:03:55.810> perhaps<00:03:56.379> a<00:03:56.709> 12<00:03:57.040> or<00:03:57.159> 13

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
millimeter and perhaps a 12 or 13

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.910 
millimeter and perhaps a 12 or 13
millimeters<00:03:58.060> so<00:03:58.689> I'll<00:03:58.900> disconnect<00:03:59.290> both<00:03:59.739> of

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
millimeters so I'll disconnect both of

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.479 
millimeters so I'll disconnect both of
those<00:04:01.049> now<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.409> electrical<00:04:03.040> leads<00:04:03.250> are

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
those now that the electrical leads are

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.970 
those now that the electrical leads are
disconnected<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.420> can<00:04:04.989> unbolt<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.560> starter

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
disconnected I can unbolt the starter

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.199 
disconnected I can unbolt the starter
these<00:04:08.980> two<00:04:09.220> bolts<00:04:11.549> there<00:04:12.549> are<00:04:12.609> actually<00:04:12.909> three

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
these two bolts there are actually three

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.589 
these two bolts there are actually three
bolts<00:04:13.540> holding<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.139> starter<00:04:14.530> on<00:04:14.680> I've<00:04:14.950> got

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
bolts holding the starter on I've got

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.330 
bolts holding the starter on I've got
this<00:04:16.599> is<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.870> third<00:04:17.079> one<00:04:17.289> that's<00:04:17.739> just<00:04:17.979> about

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
this is the third one that's just about

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.439 
this is the third one that's just about
to<00:04:18.519> come<00:04:18.699> out<00:04:19.229> and<00:04:20.789> then<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:21.880> starter<00:04:22.210> should

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
to come out and then the starter should

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:32.999 
to come out and then the starter should
just<00:04:23.099> come<00:04:24.099> right<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:32.139> transmission<00:04:32.710> is<00:04:32.800> held

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
just come right the transmission is held

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.650 
just come right the transmission is held
to<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.280> engine<00:04:33.610> by<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.000> bunch<00:04:34.360> of<00:04:34.479> these

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
the perimeter some of them you can get

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.820 
the perimeter some of them you can get
to<00:04:39.940> from<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.210> top<00:04:40.300> some<00:04:40.750> from<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:40.990> bottom<00:04:41.320> I'm

going to take out all of them except
about<00:04:43.599> three<00:04:44.729> and<00:04:45.900> then<00:04:46.900> we<00:04:47.080> will<00:04:47.380> support<00:04:48.310> the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
about three and then we will support the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.879 
about three and then we will support the
transmission<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.349> take<00:04:50.349> out<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.590> remainder

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
transmission and take out the remainder

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.980 
transmission and take out the remainder
I<00:04:52.349> took<00:04:53.349> out<00:04:53.530> all<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.800> bolts<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:55.690> hold<00:04:55.840> the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
I took out all the bolts that hold the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.460 
I took out all the bolts that hold the
transmission<00:04:56.530> except<00:04:56.800> for<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.610> couple<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.470> now

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
transmission except for a couple and now

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.830 
transmission except for a couple and now
it's<00:04:59.680> time<00:04:59.889> to<00:04:59.970> jack<00:05:00.970> up<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.270> transmission

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
it's time to jack up the transmission

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.350 
it's time to jack up the transmission
and<00:05:02.409> remove<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.870> crossmember<00:05:05.789> now<00:05:06.789> I<00:05:06.849> want<00:05:07.150> to

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
and remove the crossmember now I want to

and remove the crossmember now I want to
jack<00:05:07.690> it<00:05:07.720> up<00:05:07.930> just<00:05:08.260> enough<00:05:09.539> to<00:05:10.539> raise<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:10.960> off

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
jack it up just enough to raise it off

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:22.620 
jack it up just enough to raise it off
of<00:05:11.409> the<00:05:11.620> crossmember<00:05:17.460> Matt<00:05:21.120> now<00:05:22.120> that<00:05:22.449> I<00:05:22.479> know

of the crossmember Matt now that I know

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.980 
of the crossmember Matt now that I know
that<00:05:22.720> it's<00:05:23.020> supported<00:05:23.560> I<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.680> remove<00:05:24.990> these

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
that it's supported I can remove these

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.230 
that it's supported I can remove these

crossmember I'm holding it up with my
knee<00:05:34.630> on<00:05:35.340> this<00:05:36.340> side<00:05:36.639> so<00:05:37.060> that<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.270> can<00:05:37.419> loosen

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
knee on this side so that I can loosen

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.640 
knee on this side so that I can loosen
up<00:05:37.900> this<00:05:38.650> bolt<00:05:39.240> so<00:05:40.240> after<00:05:40.570> this<00:05:40.659> is<00:05:40.720> this<00:05:41.349> bolt

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
up this bolt so after this is this bolt

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.990 
up this bolt so after this is this bolt
out<00:05:41.830> I<00:05:41.860> should<00:05:42.009> be<00:05:42.220> able<00:05:42.310> to<00:05:42.430> take<00:05:42.699> off<00:05:42.880> the

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
out I should be able to take off the

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.330 
out I should be able to take off the
crossmember

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
crossmember

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.980 
crossmember
now<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.699> crossmember<00:05:46.389> is<00:05:46.509> out<00:05:46.750> it's

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
now that the crossmember is out it's

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.420 
now that the crossmember is out it's
time<00:05:47.199> for<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.680> fun<00:05:47.830> part<00:05:47.860> I<00:05:50.010> probably<00:05:51.010> should

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
time for the fun part I probably should

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.060 
time for the fun part I probably should
have<00:05:51.460> a<00:05:51.610> transmission<00:05:52.180> jack<00:05:52.770> makes<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.919> a<00:05:53.979> lot

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
have a transmission jack makes it a lot

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.230 
have a transmission jack makes it a lot
safer

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
safer

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.370 
safer
I'm<00:05:56.020> going<00:05:56.410> to<00:05:57.810> take<00:05:58.810> out<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.050> remaining

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
I'm going to take out the remaining
