 he turns his head and lifts it from above onto the new system

 Noel Biderman and he is back in action 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.480
 He can not do that and was lying there 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.119
 I just have problems with not necessarily on the backplane 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.119
 much better places 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.240
 but he will be left to himself or will go he is prepared but 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 we have found 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.100
 with preparation because that is treated well 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.670
 she kept that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.050
 always proven true 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.510
 burdened if everything went well 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.720
 this second line safety is one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.520
 the whole 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.740
 he began 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.740
 he usually sits well 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 the losses Gormley 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.590
 quite cheap 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.830
 if he then still a "He is so thin and something buried there in the mouth 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.180
 So that's why I still think that Apple I have him 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.950
 Also, when salmon are chosen in rivers triplets are also size

 Milan was a great result but already reported EC 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.010
 The traffic is mostly around Paul Winterer that you actually 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.330
 no longer governed Outlook that must have been small knives then men afterwards 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.799
 The Hagener is freed again 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.319
 the big hook Dickens Art 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.019
 Circling is also a big praise there you can just like a ban or questions 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.620
 we answer the bait and where is it when you take it 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.999
 out of the water 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.489
 Of course, that's also possible at some point in the raffle 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.529
 which the pros say 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.379
 Laux Drill because in a fashion store Mussawi level c with Inter without Santon

 is accused of being targeted by the investigators as he tore up the 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.099
 GEK ramps are 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.689
 until that's over 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.769
 like that for 14 days 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.069
 Wilhelm were approx 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.869
 it is like it is 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:59.079
 they are all the tickets the speakers meet representatives I have 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:02:59.699
 already experienced 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.949
 finally for 60 years 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:07.139
 for city was birthday Robert Cooper own life core I hate deficit lies 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.549
 now there are two small boats that are wonderful open so I can 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.699
 set to six 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.699
 So that Muslim or resignation Ben Ali developed 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.869
 for the first time to touch and to expand 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.599
 steadily worsening 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.599
 always wanted 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.029
 I buy 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.029
 which gives 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:35.739
 from APA 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:39.599
 becomes 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.729
 the portal became 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.379
 remedy 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.379
 with the pliers in a vise decided 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.189
 Dr 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.889
 and that falls the principle is based 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.009
 that will definitely work 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.889
 Son on a cafe that is so cool black and yellow is Gregor Czisch right 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.039
 Brought class 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:03.769
 and then g like anything we can do about the cost just because of that 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.119
 annually only 0 001 in x1 of shit 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:09.049
 on 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.699
 So I see the same loving car service airbox citizens fear 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.889
 Without suffering the Dane still a Corner 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.009
 Ulm 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.349
 explained 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.079
 I think that's good 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.970
 to give this regulation as often as that with her at the three dead on 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.310
 The previous day VGF vote with fellow citizens will certainly not be more than 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.889
 To use oppressors 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.550
 we are packing more with it 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.550
 what to balance with blankets clean 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.909
 thanks to the celebration with references to lanterns 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.459
 but as I said that just everything are just not empirical values 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.330
 Andre Ward next to compete 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.020
 you have to do it yourself 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 rightly Rupert Murdoch 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.439
 Anyway, that's fun 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.900
 and that always gives another variant 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.760
 Brett somehow fished it out differently or was that only because he did 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.590
 You might not necessarily face origami ground just before Congress 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.139
 we can also see 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.800
 on also Porsche on I am 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.819
 so that the system is just mean "and the fish have been killed interest 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:18.409
 consists 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.150
 it's just doing it 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.550
 it was possible he will go home at 1 because he's a rather too too 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.520
 killed infant youth of the community is shaken mininim 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.449
 closed 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.059
 So that means going through it 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.309
 Palit not only at one of 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.999
 there we go now 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.759
 many an ippon 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.759
 five millimeters between these two brands 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.669
 I urge her to say with her fingers next to me this end and go 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.669
 then feel between the fingers that they do not need 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.580
 then I detour all over India 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.110
 three to four times 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.919
 or five times 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.089
 almost the animal 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.189
 and how is this loop pull and I have to push over here now 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.330
 this is important 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.960
 We are also happy about Osama bin Laden's reading about this 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.780
 Couple life that does not work. "But you can end up with Texas 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.150
 now through here 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.180
 what is it all about? 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.069
 so and now 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.219
 by the constant hunt down one sees yes that I never saw 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:22.009
 Round leather 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.009
 "If I messed her up, he lost 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.400
 so i tax the whole thing 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.400
 wanted to get into the ground here 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.499
 in the case of the winners yes, always from the back so it will be right next to it 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.729
 they refuel so far 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.990
 Popow the men were 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.710
 and put that through the 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.710
 but that away 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.569
 So 4 4 your voice drives you 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:57.569
 now live question 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.700
 Strof has PTM I think they have an extremely high load capacity here 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:08.050
 In the dark you can raise a group Euro 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.129
 Â«We can bounce that problem again in these countries Euro 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.320
 we are 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.159
 SID 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.699
 this one is also going through 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:20.219
 7 percent 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:23.219
 give up to 100 percent 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.319
 the teenagers were 

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.319
