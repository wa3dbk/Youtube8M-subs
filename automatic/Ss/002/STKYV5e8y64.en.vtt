the questions you should ask yourself

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.900 
the questions you should ask yourself
when<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.230> do<00:00:07.350> so<00:00:07.529> so<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.670> clip

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
when you going to do so so this clip

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.360 
when you going to do so so this clip
starts<00:00:09.059> off<00:00:09.360> we<00:00:09.540> catch<00:00:09.750> Evelyn<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.469> our<00:00:11.010> side

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
starts off we catch Evelyn and our side

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.730 
starts off we catch Evelyn and our side
of<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> jungle<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.870> kill<00:00:13.049> her<00:00:13.200> as<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.650> can

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
of the jungle and we kill her as you can

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.499 
of the jungle and we kill her as you can
see<00:00:13.889> she's<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.219> level<00:00:14.460> 5<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.880> I'm<00:00:14.940> level<00:00:15.179> seven

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
see she's on level 5 and I'm level seven

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.470 
see she's on level 5 and I'm level seven
so<00:00:15.750> i<00:00:16.550> figure<00:00:17.550> i<00:00:17.580> will<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.910> pretty<00:00:18.180> big

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
so i figure i will have a pretty big

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.950 
so i figure i will have a pretty big
advantage<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.020> any<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.350> v<00:00:19.560> 1<00:00:20.359> in<00:00:21.359> game<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
advantage in any one v 1 in game the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.279 
advantage in any one v 1 in game the
time<00:00:22.230> right<00:00:22.800> now<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.369> x<00:00:24.090> 10<00:00:24.390> 20<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> know<00:00:25.080> this

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
time right now is x 10 20 so I know this

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.779 
time right now is x 10 20 so I know this
is<00:00:25.470> when<00:00:25.590> second<00:00:26.010> buff<00:00:26.130> should<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.460> spawned<00:00:26.670> in

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

burn it in a fight about two minutes ago
and<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.610> I've<00:01:32.850> accessed<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.860> she<00:01:35.759> did

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and I know I've accessed if I if she did

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.429 
and I know I've accessed if I if she did
have<00:01:36.150> flash<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.720> would<00:01:36.869> probably<00:01:36.960> hit<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.259> with

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
have flash I would probably hit it with

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.109 
have flash I would probably hit it with
my<00:01:37.470> cocoon<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.100> she's<00:01:38.310> walking<00:01:38.340> into<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> bush

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
my cocoon as she's walking into the bush

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
my cocoon as she's walking into the bush
to<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:39.509> sure<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> can't<00:01:40.049> hit<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.619> then

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
to make sure I can't hit that and then

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
to make sure I can't hit that and then
try<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.369> follow<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.479> she<00:01:42.600> does

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
try and follow up but because she does

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.960 
try and follow up but because she does
not<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:43.200> flash<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.799> confident<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.729> do

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
not have flash I'm confident I can do

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819 
not have flash I'm confident I can do
damage<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.329> her<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:46.049> follow<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> cocoon

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
damage with her then follow the cocoon

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.649 
damage with her then follow the cocoon
and<00:01:47.070> still<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.520> hold<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> down<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.270> longer

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and still just hold it down for longer

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.010 
and still just hold it down for longer
while<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:48.960> doing<00:01:49.079> damage<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> her<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:51.020> let

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
while I'm doing damage to her so I let

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.539 
while I'm doing damage to her so I let
her<00:01:52.110> face<00:01:52.290> check<00:01:52.500> into<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> bush<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.340> cast

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
my W with the same time I then hit her

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.010

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.280 
with my cue the neurotoxin novel talk
and<00:01:58.340> now<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.369> nail<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.000> cocoon<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:01.049> change

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and now I nail it the cocoon we change

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.399 
and now I nail it the cocoon we change

into spider poem London auto-attack use

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.620 
into spider poem London auto-attack use
chillin<00:02:04.829> smite<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> slow

chillin smite for the slow

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.839 
chillin smite for the slow
and<00:02:07.200> damage<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:08.489> venomous

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
and damage and then we use venomous

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.999 
and damage and then we use venomous
might<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.330> execute<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:10.319> more<00:02:10.530> auto<00:02:10.679> attack

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
might the execute one more auto attack

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.010 
might the execute one more auto attack
and<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.520> think<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.790> spiderling<00:02:12.209> finishes<00:02:12.930> her

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.610 
and I think a spiderling finishes her
off<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.790> look<00:02:14.790> how<00:02:14.910> free<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.300> was<00:02:15.510> very<00:02:16.319> easy
