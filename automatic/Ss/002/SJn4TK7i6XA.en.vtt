00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.260
 m 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.890
 hello everyone today I bring you a review 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.070
 express I will tell you about this little 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.110
 little egg and nothing I hope they serve to be 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.250
 something very fast then tell me to see 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.310
 what do you think 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.770
 it had never caught my attention 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.809
 use makeup sponges 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.449
 joe saunders only the typical 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.879
 triangular white and another deliplus 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.410
 that it was very small purple that I caught in 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.250
 a balance of these that they put from time to time 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.989
 when at 50 cents the habit and blender 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.170
 Well, of course it caught my attention 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.040
 so much to see it everywhere but the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.989
 price seems a bit exorbitant 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.829
 so when I started to see this one 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.590
 the rial techniques called me so much 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.430
 the attention was beginning to hear criticism 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.170
 good bad reviews but for example 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.659
 the one that ends up convincing me I think 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.210
 that was the ebook and 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.590
 my 1000 and 1 I think it's the blog os 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.479
 I'll leave the link that in the cafe has 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.580
 information anyway has a 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.460
 lots of cool reviews 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.720
 and well, it convinced me so when 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.780
 Yesterday I asked for it has a price of 6 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.470
 dollars there about four euros and something 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.570
 so take accounts of how many 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.540
 these sponges you can spend up 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.090
 that you compensate or not the habit and blender 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.550
 I know that later they have taken out many more 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.070
 like vanity tools and many others 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.550
 marks I leave this one because it 's the one 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.280
 I have been very particularities 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.770
 well here you see it is worth here you are going to see 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.080
 now in dry then the woman and I teach you 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.520
 how this sponge changes size is 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.100
 very important 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.690
 use it in the wet to have the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 good effect on the skin because if there are 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.810
 it's dry sucked I know it's a 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.340
 wonder 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.490
 here is the peak part of this part 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.490
 it's super good especially for 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.650
 the details corrector in the fins 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.430
 of the nose and also has this other 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.170
 part that is flat to me this flat part 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.540
 I like a lot so that to go to 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.560
 touches applying the base for all the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.420
 face aside from the base you can use it 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.200
 for powders 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.819
 this tricks of serbia quirós and me 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.020
 I was surprised a lot also for 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.260
 apply rouge in cream and another type of 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.680
 cosín asín we believe that it is very well 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.200
 I'm going to show you the wet and here I would be 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.330
 in the wet 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.020
 I hope you appreciate everything that 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.350
 has grown 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.210
 before using it what I do is 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.010
 put it in a bowl with water or in the 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.770
 sink 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.020
 I filled it a little and I put it in that way 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.090
 little either do not have to twist the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.030
 nor do you anything unusual and for 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.800
 wash it because coconut soap was used or 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.980
 a little fire but very little 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.050
 because then it's hard to get the foam 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.050
 moment since mine has already 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.989
 I do not know if it's almost two months old and good 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.849
 it's fine you see here there is some spot 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.109
 because it still costs to remove a 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:37.260
 little bit and here but in general it's fine 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.719
 does not have a hole or anything 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.299
 it has broken me or nothing strange between them and 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:46.620
 that I would recommend how it applies 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:49.290
 with it wet you are going to the base and 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.500
 the partys to little touches to do as 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.269
 if we said anyway as already the 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.560
 I used at least a couple of 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.540
 make- ups I'll leave you here 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.290
 makeup in which he has used it for 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.200
 If you want to see how it is used, it is not very 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.120
 comfortable it's easy it's super fast them and 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.489
 I recommend it and yes I would go back to 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.319
 buy it but without hesitation also in the 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.480
 lips good the same with the kilo 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.229
 previous because stretching them in a row 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.930
 the number 56 of English that is this pink 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.539
 that you are seeing and in the nails I wear the 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.400
 tone d 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:30.140
 daisy sunday found 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.690
 that has been everything is a very review 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.970
 quick I hope you like it to serve you 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.970
 if you were playing if you do with this 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.620
 sponge I recommend it without having 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.540
 tested the visible in black and none 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.130
 another but for the price that the 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.570
 result that has given me I think that 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.570
 it's worth it
