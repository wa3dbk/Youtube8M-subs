 trade and cfd on currency indices

 raw material reactions 24 hours 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.670
 out of 24 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.099
 cmc markets one of the world leaders in 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.099
 forex cfd trading since 1989 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.450
 hi it's rade we see the video of 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.790
 update for gold and silver 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.600
 good finally so those put back in order 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.670
 walking 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.100
 it was done in two stages then 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.920
 first we extracted from the black channel 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.989
 that was yesterday and then today we have 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.460
 succeeded what we failed at 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.910
 know to spend less than 20 mobile 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.860
 sessions 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.510
 and that's good because it's confirmed 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.290
 by clear technical indicators 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.780
 improvement 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.489
 not so much on the side of the stochastic who 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.890
 now evolves over his 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.680
 signal for quite a few days but 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.720
 especially in terms of my given that 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.960
 cross his signal upward 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.960
 look and moment man who topples 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.630
 at the same time positive so we have a 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.670
 extremely positive beam of elements 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.170
 statistically and well we can 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.910
 expect to go for the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.720
 good sister superior now that 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.899
 this is a good thing 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.759
 finally we have to put everything back into the 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.770
 context the fact that we're going 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.140
 seek 50% retracement of this multi 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.170
 fibonacci boot is actually a 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.160
 element that was triggering the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.670
 going up I'm going to put some 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.740
 little girls from small ones 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.229
 a little fork of andrews for 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.150
 show a jump to the share interest 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.979
 now but it shows at least that 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.899
 look at we extracted from the famous 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.130
 andrews fork there but I have everything 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.420
 immediately had substitute another 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.720
 fork that is still more 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.830
 interesting is this one now 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.390
 I invite you to look at the graph 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.759
 after because otherwise it'll be a little 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.030
 dirty and on the money side things 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.860
 are totally similar since we have 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.439
 reminded 57% increase 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.729
 but here we kill two birds with one stone 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.130
 since we arrive at once 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.350
 to get out of the canal 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.000
 black and art and influenced 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.670
 bearish moving average at 20 sessions 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.049
 so things are well oriented there 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.030
 also we can expect samoa 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.620
 the money on the top border to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.530
 end term is at least what the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.299
 statistics tell us that's it at 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.709
 the anointing had to actually go to 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.019
 end of this movement 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.819
 well we could expect to see 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.220
 an andros fork that looks like 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:31.340
 so this is a contact with the 34 35 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.460
 dollars an ounce of money had to do it 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.310
 immediately like that it will be done 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.330
 we are here and here is the fork 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.110
 of andrews which is that is similar to 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.790
 that of money that's what this one 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.550
 is not very pretty I will probably 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:56.810
 rework for tomorrow that's good 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:58.550
 good trade evening and tomorrow cmc markets 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.560
 a world leader in the trading of 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.560
 cfd forex since 1989
