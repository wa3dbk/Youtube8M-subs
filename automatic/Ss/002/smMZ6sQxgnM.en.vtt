longer<00:00:44.129> learning<00:00:44.940> curve<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> frustration

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
longer learning curve and frustration

longer learning curve and frustration
level<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.649> court<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.489> two<00:00:48.000> things<00:00:48.179> that

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
level with this court so two things that

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.430 
level with this court so two things that
I'd<00:00:48.480> say<00:00:48.960> about<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I'd say about it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
I'd say about it
one<00:00:49.769> is<00:00:49.920> practice<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> further<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> neck<00:00:51.089> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
one is practice it further up the neck a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
one is practice it further up the neck a
little<00:00:52.109> bit<00:00:52.260> first<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.679> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:52.739> easier

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
little bit first it's a little easier

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.130 
little bit first it's a little easier
around<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.609> third<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.089> fourth<00:00:54.300> fret<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.839> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
around the third and fourth fret and is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.009 
around the third and fourth fret and is
the<00:00:55.289> first<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:56.760> don't<00:00:57.539> worry<00:00:57.749> so<00:00:57.960> much

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
the first and then don't worry so much

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.540 
the first and then don't worry so much
about<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.379> tone<00:00:58.589> on<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.859> first<00:00:59.100> string<00:00:59.370> if

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
about the tone on the first string if

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.069 
about the tone on the first string if
you<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.539> want<00:01:00.749> to<00:01:00.839> hear<00:01:01.019> is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.640 
you get what you don't want to hear is
this<00:01:02.269> where<00:01:03.269> I've<00:01:03.359> got<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.659> completely<00:01:04.290> clear

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
figure out what chord that is but if you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.850

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
make sure to practice just pumping it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.590 
make sure to practice just pumping it
like<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.920> whole<00:02:04.070> squeezing<00:02:04.610> bar<00:02:05.300> chords

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
like the whole squeezing bar chords

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.980 
like the whole squeezing bar chords
drill<00:02:05.840> get<00:02:06.620> that<00:02:06.800> happening<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:09.160> when<00:02:10.160> you're

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
drill get that happening and when you're

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.200 
drill get that happening and when you're
yeah<00:02:11.990> it's<00:02:12.980> just<00:02:13.130> it's<00:02:13.400> just<00:02:13.490> such<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> such<00:02:14.180> a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
tough course so just just practice

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.010 
tough course so just just practice
squeezing<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.550> like<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.150> then<00:02:17.450> pumping

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
squeezing it like that and then pumping

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.940 
squeezing it like that and then pumping
it<00:02:18.110> really<00:02:18.640> hard<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:21.290> quick<00:02:21.650> burst

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
it really hard but just that quick burst

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.530 
it really hard but just that quick burst
of<00:02:22.160> speed<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.640> really<00:02:23.090> what<00:02:23.210> you<00:02:23.300> what<00:02:23.450> you

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
of speed is really what you what you

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.060 
of speed is really what you what you
want<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.750> do<00:02:23.840> because<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.290> then<00:02:24.650> last<00:02:24.860> thing

we're gonna number the knuckles that one
can't<00:02:41.900> be<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.170> third<00:02:42.410> though<00:02:42.620> if<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:43.580> count

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
can't be the third though if we count

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.330 
angle almost a 90 degree angle
here<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.489> put<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.540> not<00:02:56.930> locked<00:02:57.890> straight

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
here and put it and not locked straight

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.830 
here and put it and not locked straight
that's<00:02:58.880> why<00:02:59.030> how<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.180> get<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.570> little<00:02:59.690> bit

that's why how you get this a little bit

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.040 
that's why how you get this a little bit
of<00:02:59.930> hyperextension<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:00.890> finger<00:03:01.100> so

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
of hyperextension in that finger so
