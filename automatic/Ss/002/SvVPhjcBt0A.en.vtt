and<00:00:13.610> well<00:00:14.610> Pete<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.210> some<00:00:15.509> uses<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.379> am

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
and well Pete is some uses for it I am

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.320 
and well Pete is some uses for it I am
it<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.240> be<00:00:18.390> used<00:00:18.800> for<00:00:19.800> example<00:00:19.920> as<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it can be used for example as I just a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.179 
it can be used for example as I just a
simple<00:00:21.660> volume<00:00:22.080> boost<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.619> use<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.039> as<00:00:23.160> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
simple volume boost you can use it as a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.189 
simple volume boost you can use it as a
tone<00:00:23.640> shaper<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:25.199> use<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:27.170> with<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
tone shaper you can use it with a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.660 
tone shaper you can use it with a
distortion<00:00:28.619> pedal<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.099> example<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.550> get

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
distortion pedal for example to get

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.389 
distortion pedal for example to get
really<00:00:30.000> scooped<00:00:30.390> tone<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> take<00:00:31.560> out<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
really scooped tone so to take out to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.060 
really scooped tone so to take out to
make<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.759> clean<00:00:33.140> have<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> dirty<00:00:34.469> tone<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
make your clean have a dirty tone in the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.840 
make your clean have a dirty tone in the
amplifier<00:00:36.350> use<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> EQ<00:00:37.950> pedal<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> clean<00:00:38.700> it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
amplifier use the EQ pedal to clean it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.410 
amplifier use the EQ pedal to clean it
up<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.600> stamp<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> off<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:42.210> give<00:00:42.329> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
up and then stamp it off to give you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.700 
up and then stamp it off to give you
back<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:42.870> dead<00:00:43.020> stone<00:00:43.260> which<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.500> quite

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
back to your dead stone which is quite

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.990 
back to your dead stone which is quite
an<00:00:43.770> interesting<00:00:43.860> way<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:44.550> Paul<00:00:44.760> Gilbert

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
an interesting way I think Paul Gilbert

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.029 
an interesting way I think Paul Gilbert
does<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> tend<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.379> use<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.739> here

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
does that the way I tend to use in here

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
does that the way I tend to use in here
is<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> mid<00:00:51.149> boost<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.899> solo<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:52.680> really

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
is as a mid boost for solo so not really

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.229 
is as a mid boost for solo so not really
putting<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.190> much<00:00:53.399> living<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:54.059> gone

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
putting that much living in that's gone

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:07.850 
putting that much living in that's gone
up<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.600> bit<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.500> usually<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.949> there

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:18.670 

you

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.140 

using<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> shape<00:01:20.100> go<00:01:20.340> down<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.030> turn

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
using the shape go down so you can turn

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:33.850 
using the shape go down so you can turn
on<00:01:22.910> some<00:01:23.910> weird<00:01:24.180> filtering<00:01:24.780> effects<00:01:25.020> here

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.840 

it's<00:01:34.860> quite<00:01:35.040> interesting<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:35.730> as<00:01:35.790> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it's quite interesting way and as you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.400 
it's quite interesting way and as you
can<00:01:36.060> hear<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.240> start<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.170> valve

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
can hear you start here with this valve

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:53.460 
can hear you start here with this valve
and<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.800> get<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.130> distortion

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.260 

Oh

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.670 

so<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.390> shaping<00:02:01.630> function<00:02:02.140> here's<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.470> sir

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
so the shaping function here's the sir

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.850 
so the shaping function here's the sir
right

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:22.610 

kind<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.870 

you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.010 

that's<00:02:27.870> kind<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.170> nice<00:02:28.320> shaping<00:02:28.710> function<00:02:29.220> air

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
that's kind of nice shaping function air

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:40.210 
that's kind of nice shaping function air
to<00:02:31.020> do<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.410> your<00:02:31.500> clean<00:02:31.710> as<00:02:31.830> well

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:49.430 

you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.010 

so<00:02:50.440> everything<00:02:50.830> just<00:02:51.070> flat<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:52.120> say<00:02:52.630> you've<00:02:52.810> got

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
so everything just flat I say you've got

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.690 
so everything just flat I say you've got
it<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.380> can<00:02:53.530> use<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.860> either<00:02:54.010> by<00:02:54.250> moving<00:02:54.490> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
it you can use it either by moving the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.280 
it you can use it either by moving the
sliders<00:02:55.090> up<00:02:55.180> as<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.390> volume<00:02:55.690> boost<00:02:55.870> or<00:02:56.080> just

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
sliders up as a volume boost or just

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:06.880 
sliders up as a volume boost or just
turning<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.680> with<00:02:56.890> it

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.060 

you

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.410 

one<00:03:14.070> way<00:03:14.220> if<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.430> use<00:03:14.490> it<00:03:14.730> as<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.850> volume<00:03:15.180> boost

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
one way if you use it as a volume boost

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.680 
one way if you use it as a volume boost
as<00:03:15.600> well<00:03:15.630> as<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.020> can<00:03:16.290> put<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.590> into<00:03:16.740> the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
as well as if you can put it into the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.780 
as well as if you can put it into the
effects<00:03:18.690> loop<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.080> your<00:03:19.230> amp<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.710> your<00:03:20.520> for

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
effects loop of your amp and your for

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.310 
effects loop of your amp and your for
you<00:03:20.910> actually<00:03:21.240> you're<00:03:21.360> not<00:03:21.390> then<00:03:21.780> driving

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
you actually you're not then driving

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.540 
you actually you're not then driving
because<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.800> is<00:03:22.920> going<00:03:23.130> straight<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.490> the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
because this is going straight to the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.040 
because this is going straight to the
front<00:03:23.670> me<00:03:23.790> I'm<00:03:23.880> actually<00:03:24.060> driving<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.720> valves

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
front me I'm actually driving the valves

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.290 
front me I'm actually driving the valves
in<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.170> preamp<00:03:25.560> harder<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.940> that's<00:03:27.120> what's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
in the preamp harder so that's what's

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.700 
in the preamp harder so that's what's
causing<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> break<00:03:27.900> up<00:03:28.170> if<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.380> put<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.650> in

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
causing it to break up if I put it in

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.740 
causing it to break up if I put it in
the<00:03:28.800> power<00:03:29.010> amp<00:03:29.280> perception<00:03:29.880> as<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.660> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
the power amp perception as in the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.840 
the power amp perception as in the
effects<00:03:31.110> loop<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.400> drive<00:03:32.550> your

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
effects loop it's like to drive your

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.060 
effects loop it's like to drive your
power<00:03:33.200> valves<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.260> bit<00:03:34.440> more<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:34.920> get

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
power valves a bit more so you can get

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.070 
power valves a bit more so you can get
that<00:03:35.190> power<00:03:35.460> of<00:03:35.640> distortion<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.720> not<00:03:36.870> only

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
that power of distortion but not only

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.760 
that power of distortion but not only
that<00:03:37.260> you're<00:03:37.560> also<00:03:38.840> can<00:03:39.840> give<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> level

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
that you're also can give you a level

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.960 
that you're also can give you a level
boost<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.220> if<00:03:41.310> you've<00:03:41.430> got<00:03:41.550> something<00:03:41.730> like<00:03:41.880> an

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
boost so if you've got something like an

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.070 
boost so if you've got something like an
HD<00:03:42.330> 5<00:03:42.630> black<00:03:43.200> star<00:03:43.440> really<00:03:43.680> small<00:03:43.950> lock<00:03:45.080> little

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
HD 5 black star really small lock little

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.990 
HD 5 black star really small lock little
amplifier<00:03:46.920> if<00:03:47.100> you<00:03:47.190> put<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.460> in<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.610> effects

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
amplifier if you put it in the effects

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.340 
amplifier if you put it in the effects
loop<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.390> you're<00:03:48.540> actually<00:03:48.660> getting<00:03:48.870> a

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
loop of that you're actually getting a

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.290 
loop of that you're actually getting a
substantial<00:03:50.070> volume<00:03:50.580> boost<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:51.030> well<00:03:51.060> and

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
substantial volume boost as well and

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.730 
substantial volume boost as well and
driving<00:03:51.600> those<00:03:51.720> pedals<00:03:52.050> so<00:03:52.230> it's<00:03:52.530> quite<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
driving those pedals so it's quite a

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.260 
driving those pedals so it's quite a
nice<00:03:52.980> little<00:03:53.010> thing<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:54.660> there<00:03:55.020> it<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:56.270> GE

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
nice little thing so there it is the GE

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.180 
nice little thing so there it is the GE
7<00:03:57.630> I'll<00:03:57.840> put<00:03:57.990> it<00:03:58.080> back<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.320> my<00:03:58.590> sound<00:03:58.890> which<00:03:59.160> is

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
7 I'll put it back to my sound which is

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.330 
7 I'll put it back to my sound which is
a<00:03:59.370> roughly<00:04:00.180> like<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:00.510> kind<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:01.130> little<00:04:02.130> boost

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
a roughly like that kind of little boost

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.260 
a roughly like that kind of little boost
in<00:04:02.460> the<00:04:02.580> frequencies<00:04:02.970> around<00:04:03.180> here<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:05.120> use<00:04:06.120> it

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
in the frequencies around here I use it

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:29.300 
in the frequencies around here I use it
just<00:04:06.300> for<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:06.960> and<00:04:07.200> so

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.490 

so<00:04:29.700> yeah<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.180> g-seven<00:04:30.780> hope<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.110> found<00:04:31.260> that

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
so yeah the g-seven hope you found that

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.370 
so yeah the g-seven hope you found that
very<00:04:32.010> helpful<00:04:32.780> thanks<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.840> lot<00:04:34.020> leave<00:04:34.260> your

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
very helpful thanks a lot leave your
