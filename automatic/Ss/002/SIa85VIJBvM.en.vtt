00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.919
 this is the olympus now 70 40 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.920
 a modern design 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.709
 consumer camera 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.459
 14 megapixels 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.669
 pretty gloomy rich 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.409
 namely seven times starting 35 millimeters wide angle 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.109
 a very nice device 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.669
 a number of things stand out when you view this camera at the back 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.649
 the fairly large screen 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.940
 he started up incredibly quickly 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.270
 there are relatively few buttons on it, but that is because the most important 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.200
 knock 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.720
 multiple functions for mountain 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.170
 Then there is also a button that denies video to start the HD video event 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.850
 and stop 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.880
 camera has a lens which is pretty sweet seven times 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.860
 That means it's pretty excellent from the camera but just not 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.430
 far enough to tilt the camera when you are on the table, for example 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.460
 stand 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.840
 preparation is in practice 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.350
 very practical 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.070
 you can also make very beautiful photos up close for portraits and the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.200
 Great Rebellion is dedicated enough for landscape photography 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.180
 the screen is the most comprehensive 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.219
 as if we had no information 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.440
 can be seen 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.440
 you can also choose the information 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.920
 in addition, there is the option of displaying a number of lines 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.820
 can be an aid in determining the top position 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.880
 and the pieces from the lending of horizontal and vertical lines 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.320
 ease 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.850
 we all don't know because it's the sport 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.329
 chess returns 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.329
 if you only capture the image you want 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.280
 in addition to changing 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.890
 basic settings such as sensitivity and the like 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.430
 You can also choose graphic effects in this camera 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.000
 You can choose black and white photos for many users or a variety 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.620
 line drawing 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.870
 that is nice but often adds something to your photo quality it is just the 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.050
 ask 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.380
 the user menu 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.109
 is in the camera 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.199
 very nicely designed 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.780
 it is convenient to use when it comes to 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.559
 finding settings that fit 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.429
 but it is rather awkward 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.619
 because it is now sprinting back into the city where you started 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.579
 if you have adjusted a change 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.840
 and you wanted to undo it again 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.579
 then you have to charge quite a bit back and forth which is quite tricky 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.659
 could have been different 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.409
 is the final conclusion 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.849
 a very nice camera nicely designed 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.169
 good football runs practically 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.229
 and nice clear screen large 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:46.919
 lots of options 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:51.529
 A minus point is that it is now rather complicated that you go every time 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.529
 and must turn again if you want to undo a change 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.950
 real camera to put in your inner pocket
