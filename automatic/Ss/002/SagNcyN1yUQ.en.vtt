00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
calorimetry experiment you can measure

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
calorimetry experiment you can measure
the<00:00:59.039> energy<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.699> released<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.210> fuels

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the energy that is released from fuels

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
the energy that is released from fuels
can<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.829> why<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.129> might<00:01:02.460> be

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
can you think why this might be

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.080 
can you think why this might be
important<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.769> answer<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.670> different

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
important the answer is that different

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.760 
important the answer is that different
fuels<00:01:06.420> release<00:01:06.900> different<00:01:07.320> amounts<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
fuels release different amounts of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
fuels release different amounts of
energy<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.090> you're<00:01:09.240> flying<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.630> plane

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
energy so if you're flying a plane

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.990 
energy so if you're flying a plane
you<00:01:10.500> need<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> fuel<00:01:11.100> which<00:01:11.130> releases<00:01:11.790> more

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you need a fuel which releases more

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.140 
you need a fuel which releases more
energy<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.900> say<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> were<00:01:13.590> driving<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.100> car

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
energy and say if you were driving a car

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.550 
energy and say if you were driving a car
this<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> plane<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.200> heavier

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
this is because the plane is heavier

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.950 
this is because the plane is heavier
than<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> car<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.759> more<00:01:18.000> energy<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.479> needed<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
than the car so more energy is needed to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.310 
than the car so more energy is needed to
make<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.350> move<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.909> classroom<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.140> do

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
make it move in the classroom if you do

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.109 
make it move in the classroom if you do
this<00:01:22.470> experiment<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.759> do<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
this experiment you would do it on a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.450 
this experiment you would do it on a
much<00:01:24.299> smaller<00:01:24.330> scale<00:01:24.840> using<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> spirit<00:01:26.159> burner

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
much smaller scale using a spirit burner

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.569 
much smaller scale using a spirit burner
this<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> would<00:01:27.960> need<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.579> one

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
this is what you would need to do one

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.580 
this is what you would need to do one
you'd<00:01:30.270> measure<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> mass<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> spirit

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you'd measure the mass of the spirit

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.700 
you'd measure the mass of the spirit
burner<00:01:31.799> before<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.369> experiment<00:01:32.930> two<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
burner before the experiment two and a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800 
burner before the experiment two and a
certain<00:01:35.159> amount<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.520> cold<00:01:35.820> water<00:01:36.090> into<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
certain amount of cold water into a

certain amount of cold water into a
copper<00:01:37.200> calorimeter<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:38.100> small<00:01:38.640> metal<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
copper calorimeter a small metal can and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.020 
copper calorimeter a small metal can and
suspended<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.650> fixed<00:01:41.100> distance<00:01:41.310> from<00:01:41.670> the

suspended a fixed distance from the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.389 
suspended a fixed distance from the
spirit<00:01:42.390> burner<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.710> think<00:01:43.920> why<00:01:44.189> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
spirit burner can you think why is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.690 
spirit burner can you think why is
important<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.810> too<00:01:46.110> far<00:01:46.439> away

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
important for it not to be too far away

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.340 
important for it not to be too far away
pause<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.939> video<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.420> continue<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.079> ready

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
pause the video and continue and ready

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.859 
pause the video and continue and ready
the<00:01:49.850> answer<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> sort<00:01:51.810> of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the answer is that in this sort of

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.660 
the answer is that in this sort of
experiment<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.680> lot<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> heat<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
experiment a lot of the heat is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
experiment a lot of the heat is
transferred<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.540> surroundings<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.409> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
transferred to the surroundings so you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.039 
transferred to the surroundings so you
need<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.340> minimize<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.030> by<00:01:57.270> either<00:01:57.420> placing

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
need to minimize this by either placing

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109 
need to minimize this by either placing
the<00:01:58.140> spirit<00:01:58.560> burner<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.399> close<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the spirit burner as close to the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.410 
the spirit burner as close to the
calorimeter<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.990> possible<00:02:01.920> or<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.939> could

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
calorimeter as possible or you could

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.690 
calorimeter as possible or you could
reduce<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:04.079> by<00:02:04.290> insulating<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.130> sides<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
reduce this by insulating the sides and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.960
