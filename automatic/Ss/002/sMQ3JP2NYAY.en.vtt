you have a good relationship because

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.090 
you have a good relationship because
that<00:03:06.900> would<00:03:07.020> be<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.410> awkward<00:03:07.620> working

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.560 
that would be so awkward working
together<00:03:08.430> with<00:03:08.790> someone<00:03:09.270> you've<00:03:09.420> had<00:03:09.540> a

together with someone you've had a
really<00:03:09.990> bad<00:03:10.170> relationship<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:11.700> think<00:03:11.940> about

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
really bad relationship just think about

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.630 
really bad relationship just think about
that<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.780> yeah<00:03:13.020> in<00:03:13.500> my<00:03:13.770> own<00:03:13.950> experience<00:03:14.520> I

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
that and yeah in my own experience I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.000 
that and yeah in my own experience I
just<00:03:15.180> realized<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:15.870> many<00:03:15.930> times<00:03:16.470> how<00:03:16.740> true

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
just realized so many times how true

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.480 
just realized so many times how true
that<00:03:17.040> is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
that is

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.250 
that is
I<00:03:17.850> hope<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.990> won't<00:03:19.800> get<00:03:20.400> together<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:22.080> work
