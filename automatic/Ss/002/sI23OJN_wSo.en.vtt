00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.010 
refer back to I think I'm gonna revert
back<00:06:08.600> to<00:06:08.840> the<00:06:09.020> original<00:06:09.320> mod<00:06:10.190> I<00:06:10.550> mean<00:06:11.180> as<00:06:11.720> cool

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
back to the original mod I mean as cool

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.540 
back to the original mod I mean as cool
as<00:06:12.139> this<00:06:12.260> mod<00:06:12.500> is<00:06:12.680> I<00:06:12.889> think<00:06:12.949> it'd<00:06:13.220> be<00:06:13.310> better<00:06:13.490> if

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
as this mod is I think it'd be better if

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.760 
as this mod is I think it'd be better if
this<00:06:13.729> original<00:06:14.330> motto<00:06:14.510> like<00:06:15.169> when<00:06:15.380> you<00:06:15.470> spawn

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
this original motto like when you spawn

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.670 
this original motto like when you spawn
a<00:06:15.800> storm<00:06:16.190> that<00:06:17.060> tornadoes<00:06:17.750> on<00:06:17.870> Mac<00:06:18.169> reform

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
a storm that tornadoes on Mac reform

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.189 
a storm that tornadoes on Mac reform
without<00:06:19.040> Zion<00:06:19.760> the<00:06:19.940> wait<00:06:20.150> for<00:06:20.660> like<00:06:20.840> tornado

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
without Zion the wait for like tornado

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.050 
without Zion the wait for like tornado
so<00:06:21.380> for<00:06:21.590> those<00:06:21.800> automatically<00:06:22.430> come<00:06:22.729> in<00:06:22.910> the

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
so for those automatically come in the
