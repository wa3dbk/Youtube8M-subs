inches long and a half an inch right now
let's<00:00:35.280> say<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> square<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.469> saw<00:00:37.950> in

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
let's say you get a square and a saw in

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
let's say you get a square and a saw in
a<00:00:38.730> marking<00:00:39.180> gauge<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:39.809> may<00:00:40.020> add<00:00:40.260> in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
a marking gauge and we may add in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.330 
a marking gauge and we may add in
another<00:00:41.280> saw<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> there'll<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.800> some<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
another saw and there'll be some way to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
another saw and there'll be some way to
measure<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.910> three<00:00:45.149> inches<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
measure the three inches and you

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.490 
measure the three inches and you
probably<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> knife<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:48.120> pencil<00:00:48.500> you'll

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
probably get a knife and a pencil you'll

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.900 
probably get a knife and a pencil you'll
be<00:00:49.620> using<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:50.579> 18<00:00:51.030> inch<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:52.230> saw<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:53.010> think

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
be using an 18 inch back saw I think

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:04.479
