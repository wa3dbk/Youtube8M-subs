00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
kind of it was kind of complicated to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.319

but I do want to go ahead and read off

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.179 
but I do want to go ahead and read off
some<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.030> features<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:01.200> mouse<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.950> if

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
some of the features of this mouse so if

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.850 
some of the features of this mouse so if
you<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.579> see<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> box<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.649> mouse

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860

you do not see on the box on the mouse
this<00:02:05.340> piece<00:02:05.700> pulls<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.329> now<00:02:06.960> when<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> first

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this piece pulls out now when you first

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.460 
this piece pulls out now when you first
get<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> mouse<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.489> seems<00:02:08.910> very<00:02:09.470> pointless

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
get the mouse this seems very pointless

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.100 
get the mouse this seems very pointless
but<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.160> actually<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:12.030> very<00:02:12.150> useful

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
but it actually is very useful

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.160 
but it actually is very useful
here's<00:02:13.410> wine<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.970> does<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.840> kind<00:02:16.080> of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
here's wine what this does is it kind of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.130 
here's wine what this does is it kind of
gives<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.650> mouse<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.910> design<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> mouse

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140

which I'll get to in a minute is very
clean<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.450> feels<00:02:21.840> very<00:02:22.230> nice<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> hand<00:02:22.850> so

this little blue stripe

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.170 
this little blue stripe
kind<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.920> gives<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.430> very<00:02:27.120> cool<00:02:27.660> design<00:02:27.930> but

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
kind of gives it a very cool design but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.100 
kind of gives it a very cool design but
it<00:02:30.180> also<00:02:30.360> has<00:02:30.690> another<00:02:31.170> purpose<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.930> you

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
it also has another purpose so what you

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.140 
it also has another purpose so what you
actually<00:02:34.290> have<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> green<00:02:35.730> indicator

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150

actually have here is a green indicator
light<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.170> knew<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.470> guys<00:02:37.650> probably<00:02:38.040> can't

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
light and I knew you guys probably can't

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.620 
light and I knew you guys probably can't
see<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.550> obviously<00:02:38.820> because<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.510> not

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
see it obviously because it's not

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.150 
see it obviously because it's not
lighting<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:39.990> but<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.380> right<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:40.920> and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
lighting up but it is right there and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.030 
lighting up but it is right there and
that's<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.270> your<00:02:42.480> indicator<00:02:42.959> light<00:02:43.230> but<00:02:43.920> we

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
that's just your indicator light but we

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.830 
that's just your indicator light but we
pull<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.550> out<00:02:44.790> okay<00:02:45.180> there's<00:02:45.390> nothing<00:02:45.510> there

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
pull this out okay there's nothing there

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.300 
pull this out okay there's nothing there
so<00:02:46.200> you're<00:02:46.410> going<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:46.740> okay<00:02:47.040> well

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so you're going to be like okay well

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.060 
so you're going to be like okay well
that's<00:02:47.550> kind<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.850> us<00:02:48.120> well<00:02:48.900> over<00:02:49.170> here<00:02:49.890> there's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
that's kind of us well over here there's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.310 
that's kind of us well over here there's
a<00:02:50.130> button<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.840> Bluetooth

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
a button and this is your Bluetooth

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.920 
a button and this is your Bluetooth
connection<00:02:52.980> button<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.910> reason<00:02:54.360> why<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.570> like

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
connection button the reason why I like

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.190 
connection button the reason why I like
this<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.320> because<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.190> press<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:57.090> button

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
this is because if you press this button

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.500 
this is because if you press this button
while<00:02:58.200> you're<00:02:58.650> using<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.459> mouse<00:02:59.670> then<00:03:00.330> your

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
while you're using the mouse then your

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.449 
while you're using the mouse then your
connection<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.260> lost<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.340> get

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
connection is lost and that can get

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.699 
connection is lost and that can get
annoying<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.600> fact<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.050> closes

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
annoying so the fact that that closes

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.300 
annoying so the fact that that closes
off<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.160> actually<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> very<00:03:06.090> very<00:03:06.209> nice<00:03:06.690> feature

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
off is actually a very very nice feature

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.720 
off is actually a very very nice feature

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
you can scroll very slow or you can just

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.900 
you can scroll very slow or you can just
go<00:03:24.989> like<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.620> Jun<00:03:26.070> super<00:03:26.489> fast<00:03:26.700> as

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
still use the gestures that you're used

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.460 
still use the gestures that you're used
