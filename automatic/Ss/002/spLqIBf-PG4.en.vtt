00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.400 

and<00:00:09.599> then<00:00:09.720> we<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:09.930> a<00:00:09.960> strengthened

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
and then we have a strengthened

this one end

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.770 
this one end
and<00:00:19.760> we<00:00:19.850> should<00:00:20.030> see<00:00:20.210> a<00:00:20.240> little<00:00:20.450> bit<00:00:20.570> higher

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
and we should see a little bit higher

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.540 
and we should see a little bit higher
strength<00:00:21.200> with<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:21.560> because<00:00:21.890> we've<00:00:22.040> it's

it's high routine strength going to put
gorilla<00:00:58.540> glass<00:00:58.720> 2<00:00:58.780> in<00:00:59.140> here<00:00:59.379> so<00:00:59.949> what's<00:01:00.129> so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
gorilla glass 2 in here so what's so

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.860 
gorilla glass 2 in here so what's so
good<00:01:00.370> about<00:01:00.430> gorillas<00:01:00.910> Gustav<00:01:01.420> it's<00:01:01.690> going<00:01:01.809> to

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
good about gorillas Gustav it's going to

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.450 
good about gorillas Gustav it's going to
enable<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.350> go<00:01:02.530> twenty<00:01:02.860> percent<00:01:03.129> thinner

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
enable you to go twenty percent thinner

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.920 
enable you to go twenty percent thinner
and<00:01:04.210> it's<00:01:04.330> going<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.509> give<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.780> same

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
and it's going to give you the same

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.359 
and it's going to give you the same
level<00:01:05.140> of<00:01:05.290> damage<00:01:05.440> resistance<00:01:06.009> we're<00:01:06.250> going

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
level of damage resistance we're going

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.800 
level of damage resistance we're going
to<00:01:06.430> show<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.670> here<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.000> it's<00:01:07.240> going<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.420> kind

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
to show you here is it's going to kind

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.149 
to show you here is it's going to kind
of<00:01:07.900> stand<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.650> same<00:01:08.890> amount<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.940> load<00:01:10.119> bearing

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
of stand the same amount of load bearing

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.670 
of stand the same amount of load bearing
at<00:01:12.159> twenty<00:01:12.580> percent<00:01:12.910> less<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.869> can<00:01:14.080> go<00:01:14.289> you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
at twenty percent less you can go you

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.990 
at twenty percent less you can go you
can<00:01:14.890> keep<00:01:15.070> going<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:16.840> go<00:01:17.080> go<00:01:17.320> same<00:01:18.070> so<00:01:18.550> what<00:01:18.880> is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
can keep going go go go same so what is

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.940 
can keep going go go go same so what is
the<00:01:19.090> difference<00:01:19.390> in<00:01:19.570> he<00:01:20.020> said<00:01:20.229> twenty<00:01:20.590> percent

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
the difference in he said twenty percent

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.760 
the difference in he said twenty percent
thinner<00:01:21.190> so<00:01:21.430> much<00:01:22.030> is<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.619> point<00:01:23.619> two

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
thinner so much is a point two

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.950 
thinner so much is a point two
millimeters<00:01:24.250> in<00:01:24.369> this<00:01:24.490> case<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.970> level<00:01:25.750> meter

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
millimeters in this case a level meter

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.920 
millimeters in this case a level meter
two<00:01:26.170> point<00:01:26.410> eight<00:01:26.500> millimeter<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.930> there

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
two point eight millimeter and there

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.420 
two point eight millimeter and there
seems<00:01:29.289> to<00:01:29.410> be<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> little<00:01:29.680> dent<00:01:30.009> in<00:01:30.130> there<00:01:30.310> is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
seems to be a little dent in there is

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.130 
seems to be a little dent in there is
that<00:01:30.580> just<00:01:30.880> because<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.330> amount<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:31.929> times

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
that just because of the amount of times

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.770 
that just because of the amount of times
you've<00:01:32.350> done<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.649> again<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:34.000> M<00:01:34.270> plastic

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
you've done it again because M plastic

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.570 
you've done it again because M plastic
and<00:01:34.899> there<00:01:35.560> was<00:01:35.679> a<00:01:35.710> flex<00:01:36.070> in<00:01:36.220> there<00:01:36.340> as<00:01:36.429> well

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
and there was a flex in there as well

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.680 
and there was a flex in there as well
yes<00:01:38.009> remember<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.039> can<00:01:39.250> shake<00:01:39.429> as<00:01:39.550> well<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:39.970> so

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
yes remember I can shake as well and so

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.859 
yes remember I can shake as well and so
who<00:01:40.899> move<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.820> signed<00:01:42.820> deals<00:01:43.210> with<00:01:43.479> for<00:01:43.750> this

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
who move you signed deals with for this

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.029 
who move you signed deals with for this
so<00:01:44.590> we've<00:01:44.890> had<00:01:45.099> announcements<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:47.200> acer

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
so we've had announcements of with acer
