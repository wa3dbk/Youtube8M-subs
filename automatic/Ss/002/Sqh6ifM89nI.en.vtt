00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
see it rob dyrdek Wow um skateboard I

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.600 
see it rob dyrdek Wow um skateboard I
bought<00:00:21.760> it<00:00:21.880> on<00:00:22.000> eBay<00:00:22.360> as<00:00:22.600> a<00:00:22.630> complete<00:00:23.080> I<00:00:23.610> guess

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
bought it on eBay as a complete I guess

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.240 
bought it on eBay as a complete I guess
I<00:00:24.789> could<00:00:24.970> think<00:00:25.090> I<00:00:25.240> got<00:00:25.390> it<00:00:25.539> for<00:00:26.130> $74<00:00:27.130> or

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
I could think I got it for $74 or

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.370 
I could think I got it for $74 or
something<00:00:27.550> like<00:00:27.699> that<00:00:27.910> or<00:00:28.660> I<00:00:28.689> think<00:00:28.930> that's<00:00:29.260> a

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
something like that or I think that's a

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.150 
something like that or I think that's a
great<00:00:29.500> deal<00:00:30.270> the<00:00:31.270> trucks<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:32.109> wheels<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:32.800> the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
great deal the trucks the wheels and the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.210 
great deal the trucks the wheels and the
bangs<00:00:33.370> in<00:00:33.699> hard<00:00:34.149> way<00:00:34.590> they're<00:00:35.590> not<00:00:35.800> like<00:00:36.040> the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
bangs in hard way they're not like the

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.700 
bangs in hard way they're not like the
greatest<00:00:36.520> they're<00:00:37.450> not<00:00:37.630> like<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:37.870> pro<00:00:38.260> brand

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
greatest they're not like a pro brand

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.709 
greatest they're not like a pro brand
but<00:00:39.160> I<00:00:39.309> don't<00:00:39.489> necessarily<00:00:39.760> think<00:00:40.180> they're

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
but I don't necessarily think they're

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.560 
but I don't necessarily think they're
generic<00:00:41.500> or<00:00:41.649> anything<00:00:41.829> like<00:00:42.100> that<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:43.210> they

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
generic or anything like that but they

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.040 
generic or anything like that but they
work<00:00:43.809> for<00:00:44.590> me<00:00:44.710> at<00:00:44.890> least<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:46.239> especially<00:00:46.630> for

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
work for me at least but especially for

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.020 
work for me at least but especially for
$74<00:00:47.890> they<00:00:48.070> work<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.770> board<00:00:51.100> that<00:00:51.670> has

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
$74 they work this board that has

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.010 
$74 they work this board that has
texmarq<00:00:52.860> technology<00:00:53.860> which<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.940> had<00:00:55.480> means

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
texmarq technology which that had means

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.790 
texmarq technology which that had means
his<00:00:56.579> honeycomb<00:00:57.579> shaped<00:00:58.329> carbon-fiber<00:00:59.289> inlays

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
his honeycomb shaped carbon-fiber inlays

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.430 
his honeycomb shaped carbon-fiber inlays
in<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.250> board<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.780> can<00:01:01.930> actually<00:01:02.079> see<00:01:02.379> it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
in the board and you can actually see it

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.959 
in the board and you can actually see it
it's<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.680> good<00:01:02.829> tape<00:01:03.010> on<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.340> on<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.640> can<00:01:03.670> see

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
it's a good tape on and on you can see

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.410 
it's a good tape on and on you can see
the<00:01:04.149> inlays<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.340> it<00:01:06.340> just<00:01:06.609> adds<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:07.119> bunch<00:01:07.299> of

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
the inlays and it just adds a bunch of

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.870 
the inlays and it just adds a bunch of
strength<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.139> durability<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.979> it<00:01:09.429> helps

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
strength and durability and it helps

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.929 
strength and durability and it helps
maintain<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.329> shape<00:01:10.659> of<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.959> board<00:01:11.459> I<00:01:12.459> think

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
maintain the shape of the board I think

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.190 
maintain the shape of the board I think
it's<00:01:13.329> pretty<00:01:13.689> cool<00:01:14.549> um<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:16.749> great<00:01:16.899> board

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
it's pretty cool um it's a great board

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.669 
it's pretty cool um it's a great board
kit<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:19.090> got<00:01:19.299> lots<00:01:19.569> of<00:01:19.779> pop<00:01:20.020> I've<00:01:20.319> been<00:01:20.529> able

I<00:01:39.279> love<00:01:39.310> this<00:01:39.729> board<00:01:39.999> it's<00:01:40.869> not<00:01:41.349> really

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
I love this board it's not really

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.699 
I love this board it's not really
raising<00:01:42.880> yet<00:01:43.119> it's<00:01:43.389> getting<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:44.109> little<00:01:44.289> flat

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
raising yet it's getting a little flat

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.300 
raising yet it's getting a little flat
right<00:01:44.919> there<00:01:45.130> but<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.359> don't<00:01:46.989> know<00:01:47.079> it<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
right there but I don't know it it

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.099 
right there but I don't know it it
probably<00:01:48.549> will<00:01:48.880> raise<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.270> tail<00:01:49.479> like<00:01:49.869> most

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
probably will raise the tail like most

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.300 
probably will raise the tail like most
boards<00:01:50.499> do<00:01:50.649> but<00:01:50.919> it<00:01:51.909> hasn't<00:01:52.119> yet<00:01:52.539> and<00:01:53.069> like<00:01:54.069> the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
boards do but it hasn't yet and like the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.609 
boards do but it hasn't yet and like the
graphic<00:01:54.849> it<00:01:55.810> kind<00:01:56.109> of<00:01:56.289> just<00:01:57.090> scratches<00:01:58.349> like<00:01:59.349> I

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
graphic it kind of just scratches like I

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.799 
graphic it kind of just scratches like I
don't<00:01:59.799> know<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.249> doesn't<00:02:00.579> really<00:02:00.880> weigh<00:02:01.209> this

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:01.809 
don't know it doesn't really weigh this

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.949 
don't know it doesn't really weigh this
kind<00:02:02.049> of<00:02:02.109> scratches<00:02:02.849> for<00:02:03.849> some<00:02:04.059> reason<00:02:04.419> like

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
kind of scratches for some reason like

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.629 
kind of scratches for some reason like
when<00:02:05.139> I'll<00:02:05.259> be<00:02:05.380> doing<00:02:05.559> my<00:02:05.679> kick<00:02:05.919> flips<00:02:06.249> like

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
when I'll be doing my kick flips like

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:07.919 
when I'll be doing my kick flips like
when<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:06.849> was<00:02:06.969> learning<00:02:07.090> my<00:02:07.299> fake<00:02:07.479> flips<00:02:07.779> like

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
when I was learning my fake flips like

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.250 
when I was learning my fake flips like
I'll<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.530> would<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.099> this<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:10.719> don't

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
I'll and I would like this and I don't

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.040 
I'll and I would like this and I don't
scrape<00:02:11.829> on<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.069> ground<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:13.390> kind<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.659> see

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
scrape on the ground there kind of see

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.980 
scrape on the ground there kind of see
like<00:02:14.740> right<00:02:14.980> there<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.790> shining<00:02:16.690> down<00:02:16.780> it's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
like right there it's shining down it's

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.600 
like right there it's shining down it's
grounding<00:02:17.380> down<00:02:17.530> my<00:02:17.620> grip<00:02:17.830> tape<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.310> you're

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
grounding down my grip tape and you're

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.780 
grounding down my grip tape and you're
getting<00:02:18.760> flat<00:02:19.210> out<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.420> talk<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.070> don't

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
getting flat out the talk but I don't

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.140 
getting flat out the talk but I don't
know<00:02:22.030> that's<00:02:22.330> kind<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.600> weird<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.960> think<00:02:23.020> and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
know that's kind of weird I think and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.820 
know that's kind of weird I think and
it's<00:02:25.150> not<00:02:25.300> really<00:02:25.570> it's<00:02:25.960> really<00:02:26.320> flexible

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
it's not really it's really flexible

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.710 
it's not really it's really flexible
board<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.610> not<00:02:27.670> very<00:02:27.940> stiff

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
board it's not very stiff

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.200 
board it's not very stiff
really<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.340> thought<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.550> would<00:02:30.880> be<00:02:31.030> really

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
really like I thought it would be really

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.840 
really like I thought it would be really
stiff<00:02:31.540> from<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.380> Hindley's<00:02:32.740> but<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.250> got<00:02:33.670> do<00:02:33.820> a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
stiff from the Hindley's but I got do a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.180 
stiff from the Hindley's but I got do a
kickflip<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.750> neither<00:02:34.960> one<00:02:35.110> slick<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.950> far

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
kickflip and I neither one slick it far

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.280 
kickflip and I neither one slick it far
enough<00:02:36.400> I'll<00:02:36.670> click<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.060> too<00:02:37.330> much<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.170> it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
enough I'll click it too much and it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.960 
enough I'll click it too much and it
will<00:02:38.410> land<00:02:38.620> like<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.520> I'll<00:02:39.820> actually

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
will land like this and I'll actually

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.170 
will land like this and I'll actually
land<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.590> flexes<00:02:42.370> pretty<00:02:42.670> far<00:02:42.970> when

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
land on it and it flexes pretty far when

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.310 
land on it and it flexes pretty far when
you<00:02:43.270> land<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.110> kind<00:02:44.140> of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
you land on it like that it kind of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.460 
you land on it like that it kind of
scares<00:02:44.680> me<00:02:44.800> I'm<00:02:45.730> gonna<00:02:45.880> snap<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.450> or<00:02:46.600> ruin<00:02:47.380> it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
scares me I'm gonna snap it or ruin it

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.460 
scares me I'm gonna snap it or ruin it
but<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:48.490> even<00:02:49.450> though<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.660> does<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.200> still

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
but it even though it does that it still

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.370 
but it even though it does that it still
keeps<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.860> shape<00:02:51.600> like<00:02:52.600> it's<00:02:52.810> got<00:02:52.960> a<00:02:52.990> lot<00:02:53.350> of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
keeps the shape like it's got a lot of

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.970 
keeps the shape like it's got a lot of
concave<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.450> kind<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.690> Ike<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.770> thought<00:02:56.950> I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
concave I kind of like Ike I thought I

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.710 
concave I kind of like Ike I thought I
would<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.640> bunch<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:57.940> concave<00:02:58.270> more<00:02:58.540> than

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
would like a bunch of concave more than

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.260 
would like a bunch of concave more than
I<00:02:58.810> actually<00:02:58.930> do<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.520> think<00:03:00.520> that's<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.910> little

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
I actually do I think that's a little

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.180 
I actually do I think that's a little
easier<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.840> do<00:03:01.960> your<00:03:02.140> tricks<00:03:02.470> if<00:03:02.620> there's<00:03:02.830> less

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
easier to do your tricks if there's less

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.540 
easier to do your tricks if there's less
concave<00:03:03.820> but<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.540> don't<00:03:05.080> really<00:03:05.170> care<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.650> so

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
concave but I don't really care it's so

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.020 
concave but I don't really care it's so
good<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.080> it's<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.770> great<00:03:08.950> board<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.490> would

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
good and it's a great board I would

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.130 
good and it's a great board I would
definitely<00:03:10.390> recommend<00:03:10.480> it

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
definitely recommend it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.590 
definitely recommend it
no<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.160> don't<00:03:12.490> think<00:03:12.520> very<00:03:13.000> much<00:03:13.210> it's<00:03:13.360> kinda

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
no I don't think very much it's kinda

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.480 
no I don't think very much it's kinda
hard<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.810> find<00:03:14.020> now<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.440> not<00:03:14.620> like<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.310> think

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
hard to find now it's not like I think

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.650 
hard to find now it's not like I think
it's<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.640> little<00:03:15.730> bit<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.000> an<00:03:16.090> older<00:03:16.330> board<00:03:16.540> I

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
it's a little bit of an older board I

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.480 
it's a little bit of an older board I
think<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:16.960> can<00:03:17.110> still<00:03:17.320> find<00:03:17.560> out<00:03:17.710> zoomies<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
think you can still find out zoomies I

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.270 
think you can still find out zoomies I
think<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.750> don't<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.710> don't<00:03:20.860> know<00:03:21.010> if<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.160> can

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
think I don't I don't know if you can

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.030 
think I don't I don't know if you can
find<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.550> dyrdek<00:03:21.940> one<00:03:22.210> but<00:03:22.710> supposed<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.800> find

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
find the dyrdek one but supposed to find

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.360 
find the dyrdek one but supposed to find
on<00:03:24.190> eBay<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:24.550> stuff<00:03:24.820> but<00:03:25.090> it's<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.390> great<00:03:25.600> board

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
on eBay and stuff but it's a great board

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.370 
on eBay and stuff but it's a great board
definitely<00:03:27.370> recommend<00:03:27.820> it

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
definitely recommend it

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.220 
definitely recommend it
yep<00:03:29.490> I'll<00:03:30.490> probably<00:03:30.730> do<00:03:30.940> another<00:03:31.210> review<00:03:31.930> once

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
yep I'll probably do another review once

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.740 
yep I'll probably do another review once
I've<00:03:32.620> skated<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.760> crap<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.210> of<00:03:34.240> this<00:03:34.450> thing

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
I've skated the crap out of this thing

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.720 
I've skated the crap out of this thing
and<00:03:35.050> I'm<00:03:35.380> getting<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.710> new<00:03:35.830> board<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.520> one

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
and I'm getting a new board I like one

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.640 
and I'm getting a new board I like one
next<00:03:37.060> time<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:37.270> get<00:03:37.330> a<00:03:37.420> new<00:03:37.540> board<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.530> give

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
next time we get a new board and give

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.250 
next time we get a new board and give
you<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:38.800> final<00:03:39.370> review<00:03:39.520> but<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.450> far<00:03:40.690> it's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260
