00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
got a lot of leg extension and it's real

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.920 
got a lot of leg extension and it's real
common<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.850> riders<00:01:09.240> when<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.720> this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
common for riders when they have this

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.280 
common for riders when they have this
going<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.920> their<00:01:11.880> heels<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.420> real<00:01:12.689> high<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
going they their heels up real high and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.679 
going they their heels up real high and
it's<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.580> their<00:01:14.790> hamstrings<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.509> tight

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it's because their hamstrings are tight

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.080 
it's because their hamstrings are tight
well<00:01:16.439> when<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.860> off<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.460> bike<00:01:17.700> after

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
well when you get off of the bike after

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
well when you get off of the bike after
swimming<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.110> biking<00:01:19.350> hard<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> race<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
swimming and biking hard in a race and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
swimming and biking hard in a race and
you're<00:01:20.759> fixing<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.210> run<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:22.049> hamstrings

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you're fixing to go run your hamstrings

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.590 
you're fixing to go run your hamstrings
are<00:01:22.740> even<00:01:22.979> tighter<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.880> heels<00:01:24.180> pull<00:01:24.450> up

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
are even tighter so your heels pull up

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.830 
are even tighter so your heels pull up
well<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.439> she's<00:01:25.799> scrubbing<00:01:26.280> back<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.600> forth

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
well then she's scrubbing back and forth

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080 
well then she's scrubbing back and forth
across<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.350> top<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> seat<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
across the top of the seat and that just

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.270 
across the top of the seat and that just
leaves<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.259> seed<00:01:31.470> quadrants<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
leaves to all kind of seed quadrants so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
leaves to all kind of seed quadrants so
we're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> eliminate<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.840> scrubbing

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
we're going to eliminate the scrubbing

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.530 
we're going to eliminate the scrubbing
we're<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> change<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> seat<00:01:35.970> height<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
we're going to change the seat height so

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630 
we're going to change the seat height so
that<00:01:36.720> she's<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:36.930> getting<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.829> snap<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.549> her

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that she's not getting this snap in her

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.100 
that she's not getting this snap in her
knee<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> bottom<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.540> stroke<00:01:39.869> and

knee at the bottom of the stroke and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.240 
knee at the bottom of the stroke and
pretty<00:01:40.770> good<00:01:40.860> foot<00:01:41.100> position<00:01:42.439> I've<00:01:43.439> put<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.829> a

something that's just a good way to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
something that's just a good way to
start<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.579> these<00:01:56.759> seats<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.270> actually<00:01:57.659> on

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
start with these seats it's actually on

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.880 
start with these seats it's actually on
a<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.140> point<00:01:58.380> two<00:01:58.530> degree<00:01:59.009> nose

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
a one point two degree nose

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.070 
a one point two degree nose
I<00:01:59.920> attitude<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:01.150> we<00:02:01.270> may<00:02:01.420> actually<00:02:01.630> go<00:02:01.960> up

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
I attitude and we may actually go up

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.399 
I attitude and we may actually go up
even<00:02:02.260> higher<00:02:02.440> like<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.870> reason<00:02:05.020> why

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
even higher like that but the reason why

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.440 
even higher like that but the reason why
is<00:02:05.470> if<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.950> look<00:02:06.130> at<00:02:06.220> our<00:02:06.340> elbow<00:02:06.760> patch<00:02:07.060> here

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
is if you look at our elbow patch here

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.020 
is if you look at our elbow patch here
their<00:02:08.080> level<00:02:08.619> with<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.920> top<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.369> seat<00:02:09.700> and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
their level with the top of the seat and

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.100 
their level with the top of the seat and
even<00:02:10.959> her<00:02:12.000> brake<00:02:13.000> hoods<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.450> all<00:02:13.600> are<00:02:13.900> only

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
even her brake hoods and all are only

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.650 
even her brake hoods and all are only
just<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.830> couple<00:02:15.190> inches<00:02:15.370> below<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.940> seat<00:02:16.300> so

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
just a couple inches below the seat so

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.960 
just a couple inches below the seat so
her<00:02:17.320> goal<00:02:17.350> is<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.040> start<00:02:18.280> doing<00:02:18.520> some<00:02:18.760> road

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
her goal is to start doing some road

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.990 
her goal is to start doing some road
racing<00:02:19.360> next<00:02:19.510> year<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.850> a

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
racing next year and this is just a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.560 
racing next year and this is just a
pretty<00:02:22.240> typical<00:02:22.540> position<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.300> bike<00:02:25.300> off

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
pretty typical position that a bike off

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.430 
pretty typical position that a bike off
the<00:02:25.780> floor<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.410> bike<00:02:26.650> shop<00:02:26.950> would<00:02:27.190> have<00:02:27.430> and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the floor and bike shop would have and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.720 
the floor and bike shop would have and
for<00:02:29.440> somebody<00:02:29.620> that's<00:02:29.950> got<00:02:30.130> her<00:02:30.340> type<00:02:30.580> of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
for somebody that's got her type of

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.930 
for somebody that's got her type of
flexibility<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:32.890> wait<00:02:33.100> wrong<00:02:33.340> so

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
flexibility this is just wait wrong so

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.240 
flexibility this is just wait wrong so
we're<00:02:34.180> going<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.360> fix<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.810> over<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> next

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
we're going to fix that over the next

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.800 
we're going to fix that over the next
few<00:02:36.250> minutes<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:37.209> we're<00:02:37.300> going<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.480> start

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
few minutes but we're going to start

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.660 
few minutes but we're going to start
with<00:02:38.019> her<00:02:38.140> we<00:02:38.410> put<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:38.800> here<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.280> change<00:02:39.489> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
with her we put it on here we change the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.220 
with her we put it on here we change the
seat<00:02:39.910> height<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.239> get<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.600> on

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
seat height to get that on

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.229 
seat height to get that on
so<00:02:41.769> hop<00:02:41.980> them<00:02:42.160> there<00:02:42.519> for<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> minute<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.120> can

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
so hop them there for a minute so we can

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:53.780 
so hop them there for a minute so we can
get<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> view<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.959> real<00:02:44.170> quick

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.210 

so<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.870> researcher<00:02:55.319> said<00:02:55.409> hides<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.099> now

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
so the researcher said hides and now

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.490 
so the researcher said hides and now
she's<00:02:57.150> got<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.540> little<00:02:57.750> bit<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.049> Bend<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.409> her

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
she's got a little bit of Bend in her

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.649 
she's got a little bit of Bend in her
leg<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.069> her<00:02:59.129> feet<00:02:59.760> aren't<00:02:59.940> tilting<00:03:00.360> up<00:03:00.480> so

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
leg and her feet aren't tilting up so

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.229 
leg and her feet aren't tilting up so
bad<00:03:00.900> there<00:03:01.110> she's<00:03:01.379> got<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> flatter<00:03:02.190> foot<00:03:02.610> now

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
bad there she's got a flatter foot now

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.460 
bad there she's got a flatter foot now
take<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> lot<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.780> pressure<00:03:04.080> off<00:03:04.260> her

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
take a lot of pressure off her

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.920 
take a lot of pressure off her
hamstrings<00:03:05.010> man<00:03:05.760> her<00:03:06.030> face<00:03:06.360> she's<00:03:06.690> got<00:03:06.900> a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
hamstrings man her face she's got a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.839 
hamstrings man her face she's got a
shorter<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> body<00:03:07.950> length<00:03:08.280> versus<00:03:08.730> our

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
shorter of the body length versus our

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.750 
shorter of the body length versus our
leg<00:03:09.060> length<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.049> sometimes<00:03:10.920> required<00:03:11.549> a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
leg length and that sometimes required a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.300 
leg length and that sometimes required a
lot<00:03:11.940> different<00:03:12.360> seat<00:03:13.349> management<00:03:13.920> than<00:03:14.040> just

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
lot different seat management than just

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.339 
lot different seat management than just
a<00:03:14.430> standard<00:03:14.849> formula<00:03:15.180> given<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.049> we'll<00:03:16.200> go

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
a standard formula given but we'll go

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.970 
a standard formula given but we'll go
through<00:03:16.379> that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
through that

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.300 
through that
getting<00:03:17.340> your<00:03:17.459> air<00:03:17.610> bar<00:03:17.879> set<00:03:18.950> point<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.129> look

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
getting your air bar set point we look

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.369 
getting your air bar set point we look
at<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.760> when<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.239> see<00:03:21.450> someone's<00:03:21.930> shoulder

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
at is when you see someone's shoulder

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.759 
at is when you see someone's shoulder
pivot<00:03:22.709> point<00:03:22.950> here<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.930> their<00:03:24.930> lack<00:03:25.230> pivot

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
pivot point here and their lack pivot

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.280 
pivot point here and their lack pivot
point<00:03:26.069> here<00:03:26.180> well<00:03:27.180> ideally<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.840> want<00:03:28.049> this

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
point here well ideally you want this

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.369 
point here well ideally you want this
point<00:03:28.650> about<00:03:29.610> two<00:03:29.970> inches<00:03:30.299> lower<00:03:30.540> than<00:03:30.959> this

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
point about two inches lower than this

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.699 
point about two inches lower than this
point<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.549> we<00:03:33.150> have<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.299> long<00:03:33.780> way<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.170> go<00:03:34.440> here

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
point so we have a long way to go here

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.979 
point so we have a long way to go here
to<00:03:34.859> achieve<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:36.060> because<00:03:36.359> she's<00:03:36.629> thin

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
to achieve that but because she's thin

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.220 
to achieve that but because she's thin
and<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:38.730> make<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> air<00:03:39.239> flow<00:03:39.599> right<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.079> pull

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
and to make the air flow right and pull

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.229 
and to make the air flow right and pull
up<00:03:40.349> over<00:03:40.680> her<00:03:40.739> hips<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.250> make<00:03:41.340> their<00:03:41.579> pull<00:03:42.120> off

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
up over her hips and make their pull off

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.180 
up over her hips and make their pull off
of<00:03:42.269> your<00:03:42.540> shoulders<00:03:42.959> faster<00:03:43.440> we're<00:03:44.010> going<00:03:44.129> to

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
of your shoulders faster we're going to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.130 
of your shoulders faster we're going to
have<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.459> slam<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:45.030> run<00:03:45.269> in<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.569> achieve<00:03:45.870> that

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
have to slam this run in to achieve that

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.059 
have to slam this run in to achieve that
and<00:03:47.269> ultimately<00:03:48.269> when<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:48.930> do<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:49.680> on<00:03:49.920> her

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
and ultimately when we do this on her

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.849 
and ultimately when we do this on her
tri<00:03:50.340> bike<00:03:50.750> should<00:03:51.750> be<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.930> lot<00:03:52.109> further<00:03:52.319> forward

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
tri bike should be a lot further forward

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.050 
tri bike should be a lot further forward
and<00:03:52.890> it'll<00:03:53.160> feel<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> lot<00:03:53.519> better

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and it'll feel a lot better

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.569 
and it'll feel a lot better
ya<00:03:54.209> know<00:03:54.390> put<00:03:54.629> this<00:03:54.780> hip<00:03:54.989> angle<00:03:55.250> we<00:03:56.250> took<00:03:56.400> over

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
ya know put this hip angle we took over

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.670 
ya know put this hip angle we took over
break<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:56.970> worked<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.989> charities<00:03:58.470> bike<00:03:58.650> a

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
break and worked on a charities bike a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.020 
break and worked on a charities bike a
little<00:03:58.889> bit<00:03:59.750> we<00:04:00.750> had<00:04:00.930> her<00:04:01.430> pedal<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:02.880> we

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
little bit we had her pedal it so we

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.059 
little bit we had her pedal it so we
change<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.599> tilt<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.169> the<00:04:04.230> seat<00:04:04.530> now<00:04:04.799> it's<00:04:04.980> up

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
change the tilt of the seat now it's up

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.000 
change the tilt of the seat now it's up
to<00:04:05.099> about<00:04:05.370> two<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:05.669> a<00:04:05.819> half<00:04:05.849> degrees<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:07.769> that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
to about two and a half degrees and that

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.920 
to about two and a half degrees and that
lets<00:04:08.250> her<00:04:08.400> pubic<00:04:08.819> bone<00:04:09.030> roll<00:04:09.269> down<00:04:09.510> into<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
lets her pubic bone roll down into the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.020 
lets her pubic bone roll down into the
soft<00:04:10.230> tissue<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.709> B<00:04:10.859> flow<00:04:11.099> means<00:04:11.430> soft<00:04:11.669> foam

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
soft tissue the B flow means soft foam

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.819 
soft tissue the B flow means soft foam
of<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.269> B<00:04:12.450> flow<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.959> that's<00:04:13.079> what<00:04:13.290> that's<00:04:13.440> far

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
of the B flow and that's what that's far

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.610 
of the B flow and that's what that's far
so<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.549> your<00:04:14.669> soft<00:04:14.970> tissue<00:04:15.239> pivots<00:04:16.200> up<00:04:16.380> and

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
so that your soft tissue pivots up and

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
so that your soft tissue pivots up and
gets<00:04:16.799> up<00:04:16.950> out<00:04:17.099> of<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.280> way<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.820> sit

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
gets up out of the way and your sit

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.670 
gets up out of the way and your sit
bones<00:04:18.329> are<00:04:18.510> up<00:04:18.570> here<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.200> really<00:04:19.410> makes

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
bones are up here so it really makes

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.339 
bones are up here so it really makes
your<00:04:19.829> crotch<00:04:20.099> have<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> lot<00:04:20.579> less<00:04:20.789> pressure

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
your crotch have a lot less pressure

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.250 
your crotch have a lot less pressure
then<00:04:22.349> in<00:04:23.070> her<00:04:23.280> case<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.910> took<00:04:24.870> him<00:04:24.990> put<00:04:25.169> an

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
then in her case I took him put an

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.740 
then in her case I took him put an
adjustable<00:04:25.889> stem<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.460> bike<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:27.479> get<00:04:27.660> her

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
adjustable stem on the bike to get her

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.070 
adjustable stem on the bike to get her
low<00:04:27.960> enough<00:04:28.289> she's<00:04:28.650> got

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
low enough she's got

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.469 
low enough she's got
kind<00:04:30.289> of<00:04:30.379> extreme<00:04:30.860> flexibility<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.210> lot

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
kind of extreme flexibility that a lot

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.529 
kind of extreme flexibility that a lot
of<00:04:32.599> people<00:04:32.990> don't<00:04:33.110> have<00:04:33.430> but<00:04:34.430> in<00:04:35.210> her<00:04:35.300> case<00:04:35.330> she

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
of people don't have but in her case she

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.480 
of people don't have but in her case she
has<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:36.080> so<00:04:36.199> we<00:04:36.289> month<00:04:36.500> away<00:04:36.650> use<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:37.069> he's

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
has it so we month away use it he's

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.360 
has it so we month away use it he's
going<00:04:37.639> to<00:04:37.759> do<00:04:37.909> some<00:04:38.150> road<00:04:38.629> racing<00:04:39.110> next<00:04:39.979> year

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
going to do some road racing next year

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.830 
going to do some road racing next year
and<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:40.639> we<00:04:40.729> wanted<00:04:40.969> to<00:04:41.060> get<00:04:41.150> her<00:04:41.270> bar<00:04:41.539> down

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
and so we wanted to get her bar down

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.629 
and so we wanted to get her bar down
anyway<00:04:42.229> so<00:04:42.289> when<00:04:42.710> she<00:04:42.860> goes<00:04:43.039> off<00:04:43.219> the<00:04:43.280> crunch

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
anyway so when she goes off the crunch

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.249 
anyway so when she goes off the crunch
you<00:04:43.849> can<00:04:44.000> build<00:04:44.180> more<00:04:44.330> power<00:04:44.599> by<00:04:44.840> pulling<00:04:45.199> on

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
you can build more power by pulling on

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.709 
you can build more power by pulling on
the<00:04:45.319> bar<00:04:45.620> do<00:04:45.949> these<00:04:46.159> are<00:04:46.310> paths<00:04:46.520> so<00:04:47.270> hump<00:04:47.599> on

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:47.719 
the bar do these are paths so hump on

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.619 
the bar do these are paths so hump on
here<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.960> second<00:04:48.349> and<00:04:49.039> I<00:04:49.789> think<00:04:50.240> you'll<00:04:50.360> be<00:04:50.539> able

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 
here a second and I think you'll be able

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.689 
here a second and I think you'll be able
to<00:04:50.840> reflect<00:04:51.259> back<00:04:51.560> on<00:04:51.590> some<00:04:52.069> of<00:04:52.099> our<00:04:52.280> earlier

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
to reflect back on some of our earlier

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.850 
to reflect back on some of our earlier
shots<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.979> see<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.099> difference<00:04:55.520> now<00:04:56.860> you

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
shots and see the difference now you

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.179 
shots and see the difference now you
know<00:04:57.979> I<00:04:58.340> can<00:04:59.240> rotate<00:04:59.419> like<00:04:59.840> that<00:04:59.870> in<00:05:00.680> my<00:05:00.860> dreams

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
know I can rotate like that in my dreams

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.749 
know I can rotate like that in my dreams
but<00:05:02.440> anyway<00:05:03.440> this<00:05:03.650> is<00:05:03.830> ideal<00:05:04.250> or<00:05:04.280> it's<00:05:04.639> getting

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
but anyway this is ideal or it's getting

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.610 
but anyway this is ideal or it's getting
closer<00:05:05.090> ideal<00:05:05.569> she's<00:05:05.930> got<00:05:06.080> this<00:05:06.259> kind<00:05:06.469> of

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
closer ideal she's got this kind of

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.820 
closer ideal she's got this kind of
flexibility<00:05:07.250> in<00:05:07.460> your<00:05:07.550> lower<00:05:07.610> back<00:05:08.830> our

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
flexibility in your lower back our

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.830 
flexibility in your lower back our
shoulder<00:05:10.250> pivot<00:05:10.580> point<00:05:10.849> is<00:05:11.060> finally<00:05:11.509> closed

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
shoulder pivot point is finally closed

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.260 
shoulder pivot point is finally closed
in<00:05:12.020> line<00:05:12.319> with<00:05:12.560> her<00:05:12.650> lap<00:05:12.889> point<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:14.060> would<00:05:14.180> be

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
in line with her lap point it would be

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.779 
in line with her lap point it would be
really<00:05:14.569> difficult<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:15.080> get<00:05:15.319> much<00:05:15.560> lower<00:05:15.889> but

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
really difficult to get much lower but

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.999 
really difficult to get much lower but
because<00:05:17.539> she<00:05:17.810> can<00:05:17.960> drop<00:05:18.289> her<00:05:18.500> head<00:05:18.710> down<00:05:18.949> and

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
because she can drop her head down and

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.339 
because she can drop her head down and
what<00:05:19.759> they<00:05:19.879> call<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.150> turn<00:05:20.419> her<00:05:20.629> head<00:05:20.840> gives<00:05:21.259> a

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
what they call it turn her head gives a

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.230 
what they call it turn her head gives a
nice<00:05:21.560> deep<00:05:21.919> drop<00:05:22.310> in<00:05:22.580> her<00:05:22.669> shoulder<00:05:23.029> blades

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
nice deep drop in her shoulder blades

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.689 
nice deep drop in her shoulder blades
there<00:05:23.990> come<00:05:24.379> visit<00:05:24.830> through<00:05:25.039> here<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.610> will

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
there come visit through here it will

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.089 
there come visit through here it will
come<00:05:25.940> through<00:05:25.969> here<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.539> up<00:05:26.659> over<00:05:26.990> hips<00:05:27.229> pull

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
come through here and up over hips pull

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.950 
come through here and up over hips pull
off<00:05:28.279> the<00:05:28.460> bat<00:05:28.639> so<00:05:28.939> variwatt<00:05:29.419> she's<00:05:29.719> going<00:05:29.870> to

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
off the bat so variwatt she's going to

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.990 
off the bat so variwatt she's going to
be<00:05:30.020> pretty<00:05:30.289> fast<00:05:32.259> the<00:05:33.259> seat<00:05:33.680> allows<00:05:34.490> her<00:05:34.969> to

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
be pretty fast the seat allows her to

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.990 
be pretty fast the seat allows her to
rotate<00:05:35.479> or<00:05:35.629> pelvis<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.379> so<00:05:37.340> what<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:37.759> want

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
rotate or pelvis and so what you want

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.439 
rotate or pelvis and so what you want
ideally<00:05:38.659> is<00:05:38.990> if<00:05:39.229> your<00:05:39.379> hips<00:05:39.759> socket<00:05:40.759> and<00:05:41.210> your

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
ideally is if your hips socket and your

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.050 
ideally is if your hips socket and your
