and in this segment we're going to talk

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.430 
and in this segment we're going to talk
about<00:00:05.130> how<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.730> divide<00:00:06.299> peonies

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
about how to divide peonies

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.310 
about how to divide peonies
now<00:00:08.099> peonies<00:00:08.610> are<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.849> beautiful<00:00:09.840> flower<00:00:10.110> that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
now peonies are a beautiful flower that

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.709 
now peonies are a beautiful flower that
bloom<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.130> late<00:00:11.370> spring<00:00:11.849> early<00:00:12.150> summer

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
bloom in the late spring early summer

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.129 
bloom in the late spring early summer
time<00:00:13.320> they<00:00:13.559> look<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.860> big<00:00:14.099> roses<00:00:14.790> big<00:00:15.660> pink

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
time they look like big roses big pink

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.560 
time they look like big roses big pink
and<00:00:16.529> yellow<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.760> white<00:00:18.029> come<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.449> all

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and yellow and white come in all

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.880 
and yellow and white come in all
different<00:00:18.779> colors<00:00:19.109> they're<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
different colors they're just a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.640 
different colors they're just a
beautiful<00:00:20.400> garden<00:00:20.640> plants<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:22.020> they<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.230> make

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
beautiful garden plants but they do make

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.740 
beautiful garden plants but they do make
almost<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.220> big<00:00:23.519> shrubs<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.240> they<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.570> get

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
almost like big shrubs and they can get

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.410 
almost like big shrubs and they can get
really<00:00:24.930> big<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.529> crowded<00:00:25.710> over<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> years<00:00:26.580> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
really big and crowded over the years so

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720 
really big and crowded over the years so
the<00:00:27.630> best<00:00:27.840> time<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.199> divide<00:00:28.560> them<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.250> any<00:00:29.429> time

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the best time to divide them is any time

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.939 
the best time to divide them is any time
they're<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:29.939> blooming<00:00:30.590> preferably<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
they're not blooming preferably in the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.549 
they're not blooming preferably in the
late<00:00:32.160> fall<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.780> whenever<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.050> leaves<00:00:34.320> are

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
late fall or whenever the leaves are

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.110 
late fall or whenever the leaves are
really<00:00:34.950> starting<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.370> die<00:00:35.520> back<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
really starting to die back and the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
really starting to die back and the
nights<00:00:36.300> are<00:00:36.480> getting<00:00:36.510> cold<00:00:37.020> or<00:00:37.559> even<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
nights are getting cold or even in the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.290 
nights are getting cold or even in the
middle<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> winter<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.940> live<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
middle of the winter if you live in a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
middle of the winter if you live in a
milder<00:00:39.719> climate<00:00:39.899> where<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.559> get<00:00:40.649> into

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
milder climate where you can get into

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470 
milder climate where you can get into
the<00:00:40.980> ground<00:00:41.219> that's<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.030> best<00:00:42.210> time<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the ground that's the best time to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
the ground that's the best time to
divide<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.860> any<00:00:44.010> time<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.340> divide<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
divide it because any time you divide it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
divide it because any time you divide it
when<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.239> growing<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.289> might<00:00:46.500> stop<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.950> from

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
when it's growing you might stop it from

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
when it's growing you might stop it from
growing<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.969> peonies<00:00:48.390> once<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.809> cut

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
growing and with peonies once you cut

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.260 
growing and with peonies once you cut
off<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.950> greenery<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.730> usually<00:00:51.090> doesn't

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
off that greenery it usually doesn't

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.110 
off that greenery it usually doesn't
grow<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:51.989> till<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> next<00:00:52.680> year<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.699> let's

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
grow more till the next year so let's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.639 
grow more till the next year so let's
take<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> look<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.870> peony<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.410> gotten

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
take a look at this peony it's gotten

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
take a look at this peony it's gotten
kind<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.890> big<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.460> how<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> divide<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.210> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
kind of big and see how to divide it so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.410 
kind of big and see how to divide it so
the<00:00:57.719> peonies<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.770> nice<00:00:59.010> bronze<00:00:59.699> foliage<00:01:00.270> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the peonies get nice bronze foliage in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
the peonies get nice bronze foliage in
the<00:01:00.510> fall<00:01:00.719> too<00:01:01.050> which<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.620> pretty<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the fall too which is really pretty and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
the fall too which is really pretty and
this<00:01:02.640> one's<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.239> getting<00:01:03.539> big<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
this one's kind of getting big for the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.429 
this one's kind of getting big for the
spot<00:01:04.409> had<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> lot<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.460> blooms<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.439> when

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
spot had a lot of blooms on it and when

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.260 
spot had a lot of blooms on it and when
you<00:01:07.530> dig<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.400> makes<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.939> massive

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you dig it out it makes just a massive

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.200 
you dig it out it makes just a massive
root<00:01:09.720> system<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> work<00:01:12.000> all

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
root system so I just kind of work all

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600 
root system so I just kind of work all
the<00:01:12.540> way<00:01:12.689> around<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.950> start<00:01:14.280> at<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.580> side

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the way around so I start at one side

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
the way around so I start at one side
and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> work<00:01:16.560> my<00:01:16.740> way<00:01:16.920> all

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and then I just kind of work my way all

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.550 
and then I just kind of work my way all
the<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.310> around<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.909> plant<00:01:24.229> until<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.409> kind

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the way around the plant until it kind

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
the way around the plant until it kind
of<00:01:25.710> rocks<00:01:25.979> out<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.299> pull

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
of rocks out of it because if you pull

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630 
of rocks out of it because if you pull
on<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.780> too<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> lot<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> times<00:01:28.710> you'll<00:01:29.310> pull<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
on it too a lot of times you'll pull the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.100 
on it too a lot of times you'll pull the
stems<00:01:29.909> right<00:01:30.150> off<00:01:30.299> which<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.750> wouldn't

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
stems right off which really wouldn't

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.109 
stems right off which really wouldn't
matter<00:01:31.229> at<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.590> time<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.040> year<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.970> then

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
matter at this time of the year but then

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.460 
matter at this time of the year but then
you<00:01:33.210> can't<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:33.540> keep<00:01:33.900> track<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.350> where

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
you can't really keep track of where

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740 
you can't really keep track of where
it's<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.770> underneath<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.340> ground<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it's at underneath the ground so this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.800 
it's at underneath the ground so this
has<00:01:36.960> gotten<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:38.159> size<00:01:38.400> root<00:01:38.810> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
has gotten to be a good size root and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.069 
has gotten to be a good size root and
you<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.890> I've<00:01:41.159> got<00:01:41.340> mondo<00:01:41.909> grass<00:01:42.090> growing

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you can see I've got mondo grass growing

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.670 
you can see I've got mondo grass growing
right<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> too<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> love<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.259> mondo

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
right in with it too so I love my mondo

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.249 
right in with it too so I love my mondo
grass<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.310> another<00:01:47.729> Japanese<00:01:48.509> plant<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
grass it's another Japanese plant that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.649 
grass it's another Japanese plant that
does<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.890> well<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.880> almost<00:01:51.030> any<00:01:51.450> climate

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
does really well in almost any climate

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
does really well in almost any climate
so<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> move<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.490> over

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so I'm just going to move that one over

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.380 
so I'm just going to move that one over
here<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:54.720> it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.180 

and<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.170> way<00:02:02.350> you'll<00:02:02.530> have<00:02:02.560> its<00:02:02.890> own<00:02:03.040> little

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
and that way you'll have its own little

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.609 
and that way you'll have its own little
area<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.680> now<00:02:05.830> as<00:02:06.010> you<00:02:06.040> can<00:02:06.160> see<00:02:06.370> I<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:08.440> a

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
area so now as you can see I have just a

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.090 
area so now as you can see I have just a
mass<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.270> peony<00:02:10.270> roots<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.840> it's<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.950> eyes

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
mass of peony roots and it's the eyes

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.520 
mass of peony roots and it's the eyes
that<00:02:12.490> matter<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.300> all<00:02:13.510> these<00:02:13.720> little<00:02:13.780> eyes<00:02:14.200> is

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
that matter so all these little eyes is

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.290 
that matter so all these little eyes is
where<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.860> new<00:02:14.980> growth<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.430> going<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.730> be<00:02:16.000> for

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
where the new growth is going to be for

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.540 
where the new growth is going to be for
next<00:02:16.600> year<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:16.960> that's<00:02:17.740> where<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.070> stems<00:02:18.340> are

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
next year and that's where the stems are

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.330 
next year and that's where the stems are
going<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> come<00:02:19.120> out<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.900> as<00:02:20.050> long<00:02:20.230> as<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:21.070> have<00:02:21.310> a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
going to come out so as long as I have a

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.070 
going to come out so as long as I have a
piece<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.790> wood<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.150> has<00:02:22.270> an<00:02:22.450> eye<00:02:22.570> on<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.900> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
piece of wood that has an eye on it it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.240 
piece of wood that has an eye on it it
will<00:02:23.440> grow<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:25.150> kind<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:26.250> separate

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
will grow so I just kind of separate

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.740 
will grow so I just kind of separate
them<00:02:27.370> out<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.760> lot<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.970> times<00:02:28.300> if<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.630> was

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
them out and a lot of times if it was

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.170 
them out and a lot of times if it was
really<00:02:29.050> hard<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.560> soaking<00:02:30.490> them<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.850> bucket

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
really hard to soaking them in a bucket

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.720 
really hard to soaking them in a bucket
of<00:02:31.270> water<00:02:31.480> will<00:02:31.780> soften<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.459> just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
of water will soften it up but I just

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.060 
of water will soften it up but I just
gradually<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.330> ply<00:02:34.780> them<00:02:34.959> apart<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.770> I

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
gradually just ply them apart and I

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.130 
gradually just ply them apart and I
still<00:02:39.310> like<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.640> start<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.239> give<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.989> pretty

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
still like to start and give it a pretty

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.170 
still like to start and give it a pretty
good<00:02:41.260> sized<00:02:41.620> root<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.640> probably<00:02:42.910> wouldn't

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
good sized root so I probably wouldn't

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.820 
good sized root so I probably wouldn't
break<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.480> up<00:02:43.600> any<00:02:43.810> more<00:02:44.050> than<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.470> already

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
break it up any more than that already

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.340 
break it up any more than that already
but<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.820> can<00:02:45.970> see<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.300> just<00:02:46.450> got<00:02:46.660> lots<00:02:47.050> and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
but you can see it's just got lots and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.650 
but you can see it's just got lots and
lots<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.950> eyes<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.520> looks<00:02:48.700> really<00:02:49.120> healthy<00:02:49.480> so

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
lots of eyes it looks really healthy so

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.900 
lots of eyes it looks really healthy so
what<00:02:50.470> I'm<00:02:50.590> going<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.890> do<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.220> replant<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.760> right

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
what I'm going to do is replant it right

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.330 
what I'm going to do is replant it right
away<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:53.140> I'll<00:02:53.290> probably<00:02:53.470> just<00:02:53.770> cut<00:02:53.980> off<00:02:54.100> this

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
away so I'll probably just cut off this

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.530 
away so I'll probably just cut off this
greenery<00:02:54.640> because<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:55.150> starting<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.450> look

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
greenery because it's starting to look

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.960 
greenery because it's starting to look
raggedy<00:02:56.140> anyway<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.800> it'll<00:02:57.400> be<00:02:57.489> dormant<00:02:57.880> all

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
raggedy anyway and it'll be dormant all

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.340 
raggedy anyway and it'll be dormant all
winter<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.390> then<00:02:58.480> kind<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.720> come<00:02:59.050> up<00:02:59.200> and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
winter and then kind of come up and

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.410 
winter and then kind of come up and
bloom<00:02:59.530> next<00:02:59.830> spring<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.640> like<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.150> leave

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
bloom next spring and so I like to leave

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.470 
bloom next spring and so I like to leave
them<00:03:01.630> on<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.900> bigger<00:03:02.110> side<00:03:02.470> too<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.790> they<00:03:04.209> kind

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
them on the bigger side too so they kind

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.870 
them on the bigger side too so they kind
of<00:03:04.540> braid<00:03:05.100> themselves<00:03:06.100> too<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.670> one<00:03:06.850> you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
of braid themselves too so this one you

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.330 
of braid themselves too so this one you
can<00:03:07.060> see<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.360> totally<00:03:07.570> made<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.989> braid<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.280> you

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
can see is totally made of braid so you

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.340 
can see is totally made of braid so you
just<00:03:09.700> kind<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.940> take<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.299> braid<00:03:10.510> apart<00:03:10.660> and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
just kind of take the braid apart and

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.259 
just kind of take the braid apart and
really<00:03:12.040> when<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.340> comes<00:03:12.370> down<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.970> it's<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
really when it comes down to it it's the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.180 
really when it comes down to it it's the
eyes<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.750> matter<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.320> these<00:03:14.920> eyes<00:03:15.160> are

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
eyes that matter and these eyes are

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.820 
eyes that matter and these eyes are
pretty<00:03:15.670> intermingled<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.380> could<00:03:17.680> actually

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
pretty intermingled so I could actually

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.380 
pretty intermingled so I could actually
cut<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.489> right<00:03:18.640> down<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.880> middle<00:03:19.000> with<00:03:19.360> a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
cut it right down the middle with a

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.870 
cut it right down the middle with a
shovel<00:03:19.720> or<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.110> knife<00:03:20.410> or<00:03:20.739> take<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> screwdriver

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
shovel or a knife or take a screwdriver

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.170 
shovel or a knife or take a screwdriver
and<00:03:22.500> separate<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.650> even<00:03:23.950> more<00:03:24.160> but<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.670> found<00:03:24.940> in

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
and separate it even more but I found in

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.180 
and separate it even more but I found in
the<00:03:25.269> N<00:03:25.450> peonies<00:03:25.870> like<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.350> be<00:03:26.470> crowded<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.070> the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
the N peonies like to be crowded and the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.160 
the N peonies like to be crowded and the
more<00:03:27.430> crowded<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.360> roots<00:03:28.630> are<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.989> better

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
more crowded the roots are the better

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.930 
more crowded the roots are the better
they<00:03:29.769> grow<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.250> bed<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.549> blooms<00:03:30.760> are

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
they grow in the bed of the blooms are
