00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.700
 your models heart or career can 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.500
 they already realize that that warmly 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.260
 vertical in the chest like medias animal 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.440

 you can see running along the heart here 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.109
 the heart wreaths carry theirs 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.840
 Names therefore because the big like moving 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.660
 thanks a sick in the heart and she runs 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.000
 see smaller vessels from 20 onwards 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.859
 which eventually becomes so small 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.320
 among the individual cardiomyocytes and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.530
 pull that with the otto and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.730
 supply nutrients 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.170
 one recognizes here also this 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.600
 model very nice heart 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.780
 the whole are the route and here now 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.020
 removed the right charge as well 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.750
 look at the hearts of the vessels 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.780
 but you see them growing up here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.739
 hearts from behind and the bottom or 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.420
 probably those vena cava superior and 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:12.270
 inferior the blood the oxygen poor 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.799
 comes over this upper 000 gene in the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.780
 right from right fund to right 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:25.350
 Chamber public was the model here 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.900
 sees the right-hand chamber from the right 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 The blood flows over the salary 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.140
 vein tribe petrus kommunal is one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.060
 this problem is a short one 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.299
 then understood quickly in one 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.390
 right and angular matter splits the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.090
 dasa low in raw materials and thus there with it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.830
 oxygen enriched 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 the oxygen-enriched blood comes 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.909
 all the way back and flows into the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.270
 angle past and we now see that 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.119
 it two tubes are two settings 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.830
 vienna made the blood rich in substance 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:09.479
 Left before killing family before flowing 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:13.620
 it came then the left and then from the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.690
 left chamber about the mother the big one 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.220
 Body artery may affect the whole 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.920
 be distributed to the body 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.410
 You can see them here at the booth 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.260
 ascending no orders trend 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.940
 exact words and the descending part 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.940
 the tendency of the lollipop behind the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.550
 heart 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.330
 you recognize that you are swaying yourself 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.150
 the heart in a right and left 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.819
 narrated here divided between the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.750
 follow and the chambers is the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.780
 saw fold 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.579
 here at the real heart the carrier hospital 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.269
 body and record 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:58.110
 in the pliers these cards are easy to 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.750
 recognize the ten cases and the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.410
 kabila muscles at the many falls 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.049
 rooted to the mugs are fold 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.900
 have been found in the outgoing 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.420
 a completely different composition 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.140
 a pocket flap here at the departure 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.239
 At the thrombus they polygonal the three 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.239
 Flashlights recognize the three 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.380
 share and which one also as 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.750
 half and colored single called because 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.260
 both of them look like one 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.890
 stop 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.170
 moon these bags because we are so 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:41.689
 as I said at the tus form is and
