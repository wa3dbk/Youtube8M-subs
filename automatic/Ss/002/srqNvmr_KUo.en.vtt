00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.880
 Well then this is it 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.960
 Jan went last time 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.930
 4 strokes 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.930
 If you remember the next thing is this 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.660
 Well divided into four 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.750
 There are 16 types of moving and increasing the black circle 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.579
 With this table 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.199
 Design practice of accent movement 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.199
 Because I think that I want to live 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.550
 Last time was down tap up full 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.560
 4th kind of stroke 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.200
 The 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.850
 I explained it, but use it 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.850
 This black circle is accented 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.040
 It looks like this 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.360
 This table is 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.830
 Get a look at Toka front of some number and it fine with Kaiserslautern Dechotto 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.100
 by myself 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.220
 Please try to write 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 so 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.280
 If it is the first strike accent 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.070
 That's right hand right hand start're playing this line of orange 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.540
 Don't miss it 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.540
 As I explained last time 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.320
 This first hit accent 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.530
 Just 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.830
 That's head 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.130
 Here is 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.330
 There is no accent on the next sound 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.330
 Because it sounds small 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.290
 Even loud noises, next time 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.050
 So down stroke 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.700
 Right hand down stroke 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.700
 The left hand is first 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.800
 First shot 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.800
 And I tiny because not a accent 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.730
 The next left hand is again 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.730
 It's a tiny sound 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.860
 When in addition to the repeating this 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:18.810
 Well, what is this 3rd tier 4 bad ? 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:23.370
 If you repeat this, you might be up next 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.690
 It's from here 2 weak sound and strong 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:33.710
 An investor because entertain next strong up here up 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.710
 I 'll hit it down again with four next time 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.890
 Ultra For example, 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.069
 Number 11 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.400
 As we look at what the 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.000
 The first shot f is so so 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.910
 d is down 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.989
 In elegant up 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.819
 f is full and d is tap 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.850
 It shakes when it sees at 11 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.760
 And by strong from a strong sound 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.260
 Strong and strong 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.080
 Useless up up to Kai 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.780
 From a weak sound 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.490
 Strength door because the accent is lucky 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.280
 Up from weak sound and strong 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.850
 This is a turn 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.850
 Tata 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.520
 Was Tsu fished 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.290
 Because it was 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.829
 If you want to hit this 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:35.159
 Full stroke left hand upstroke 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:38.340
 If the right hand repeats connection, the next big thing will come next time 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.290
 In full stroke 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.460
 Next is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.920
 If you go Then next left repeating this 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:53.560
 Rock I bet So 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:58.050
 I hit a loud sound and it 's going to be a town stroke here because it's small next time 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.050
 The point is to separate the right hand and the left hand 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:08.540
 This is the right hand column 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:12.080
 Change the stroke depending on whether you hit the next loud sound or not 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.629
 I've been doing a little best thing 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.629
 The most down tap up 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.410
 Fully stone 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.170
 First down the first shot down 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.650
 Left tap 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.650
 Right hand 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.040
 I'll wait for Ichida 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.500
 Hmm 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.280
 Tarp 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.080
 Barn 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:45.550
 Ap Down Down Tap Up Tap Tap Tap Up Tap 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.550
 Early do and edge it 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.310
 is 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.350
 So to get used to is a slowly 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.650
 Zan 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.790
 Standing 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:01.129
 standing up 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:07.569
 It was down tap tap tap package 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:07.569
 If you can hit it without being aware of this, you will be able to get it as soon as possible 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.280
 so 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.689
 Even to want up from the wrist 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.120
 If you raise it from your wrist 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:20.569
 It may be good I'm pulling power 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.620
 It is okay to give it as it is, though 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.580
 From the wrist 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.409
 I can give it 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.710
 It is fine as it is 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.630
 Well information is warm ah 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.350
 tee 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.620
 so 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.700
 Such feeling 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.350
 This table 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.060
 A little 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:49.600
 Write by yourself 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:51.930
 In my right hand, I took a weak sound from a strong sound, so try writing d here 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.940
 So if there slowly 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.720
 Tsukun Well, for example, is No. 2 but I do not know if it looks that it is No. 2 accent on the second shot 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.660
 you know 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.320
 One stroke first tap So t 2 strokes th Dan 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.320
 Tarp 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.820
 It was won 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:18.780
 It's all early 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:22.050
 It is Tantatana cold wave awareness 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.190
 When it comes to Papirio , this accent move is all 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:31.600
 Do it slowly 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:32.140
 If you can do this while using this stroke, you will be able to do this 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.470
 From 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:42.720
 Please try writing this for a moment 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:46.980
 For example, in Tsu path until now If you use an 8-beat 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.700
 Well eh could only like this do 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.700
 Early 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.630
 It was accented that it was possible to create more atmosphere that this was only 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.630
 When it comes to 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.440
 A little Nde allow Toka 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:21.390
 this 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:23.480
 Yao Maku Naru This is a little bit 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.470
 Made while watching 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.470
 Please try it 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.670
 so 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.600
 Anyway 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.600
 Accent good and cherry blossom 

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:34.799
 Is like this 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:45.470
 Please try it 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:49.200
 If I could write this in that commentary again, I would like to write 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:52.370
 I will write if I can write 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.370
 That's it
