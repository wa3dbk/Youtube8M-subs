00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
and then I'm to make the three branches

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.130 
and then I'm to make the three branches
just<00:04:56.130> take<00:04:56.640> little<00:04:56.880> pieces<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.450> string<00:04:57.810> and

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
just set them on top of each other and

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.200 
just set them on top of each other and
then<00:05:00.630> just<00:05:00.900> tape<00:05:01.170> them<00:05:01.320> down<00:05:01.350> but<00:05:01.950> then<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.520> just
