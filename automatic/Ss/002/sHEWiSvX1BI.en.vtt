00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 and there's starting another flight in 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.310
 summer residence we'll go 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.770
 to make a tapioca with cheese using 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.460
 the bonus flavor mandioquinha with onion 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.960
 parsley 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:21.420
 hit that family does not know what 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:23.100
 calm down the solution is the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.970
 first step we'll do is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.429
 a cup of sweet sprinkles or 100 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 grams that gives the same 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.300
 We'll mix it up with a bundle of 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.780
 flight in flavor mandioquinha con onion 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780
 parsley 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.860
 Now, just mix it up for taste. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860
 isaaa our tapioca flour 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.730
 I will now add 75 ml or 4 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 tablespoons of water and if only 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.280
 getting too dry you add a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.280
 over water woman 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.150
 Now what we're going to do is 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 a sieve to finish 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.380
 once with all these little grains and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.380
 leave a good thing lisinha cool 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.840
 You'll sift it. It's super simple. 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.570
 you go through the china is falling will 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.340
 getting too thin like that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.549
 and then we'll go to the frying pan for 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.170
 make our wonderful ones worse 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.600
 How low are you going to heat up your? 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.909
 frying pan to be very warm to 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.700
 mass is in this texture well , 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.100
 because I operated and very moist because 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 I put that amount of water 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.580
 people will put four tablespoons of 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.580
 well scattered soup 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.290
 but also depends on the size of your 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.180
 frying pan 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.370
 now we will last this record 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.370
 mass for one minute on each side 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:17.490
 Now we're going to put half the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:21.930
 quantity of our cheese here from 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:25.020
 Brazil in this way that we will 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:32.310
 cover and will leave for another minute 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:34.670
 or until the cheese melts the exchange of 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.670
 cheese 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.610
 Looks fresh just in time. 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.620
 usually with a full mouth in the game is 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.629
 better for the city because it really 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.719
 it is delicious 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.340
 In this the little boss with salsa my show 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.959
 Remember the cheese you can use 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.810
 other types of cheese that do not 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.579
 Pharaoh bono and other flavors that is not 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.200
 of mandioquinha with parsley and for 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.720
 continue to track revenues from 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.969
 bonus between our shared channel 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.489
