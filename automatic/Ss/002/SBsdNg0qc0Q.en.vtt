just double tap on it

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.530 
just double tap on it
and<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> go<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.700> could<00:00:42.000> write<00:00:42.300> as

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and there you go so you could write as

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.680 
and there you go so you could write as
usual<00:00:43.430> but<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.489> want<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> show<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.239> couple<00:00:45.660> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
usual but I want to show you a couple of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
usual but I want to show you a couple of
differences<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.440> eraser<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.850> just

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
differences that eraser when you just

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.779 
differences that eraser when you just
click<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> letter<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.620> removes<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> whole

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
click on the letter it removes the whole

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.060 
click on the letter it removes the whole
letter<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.710> really

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
letter right and I think that's really

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.330 
letter right and I think that's really
cool<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.579> think<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.600> improvement

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
cool I think that is an improvement

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.979 
cool I think that is an improvement
another<00:00:56.340> new<00:00:56.579> great<00:00:56.820> addition<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
another new great addition is if you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.869 
another new great addition is if you
have<00:00:58.289> notes<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.100> were<00:00:59.309> working<00:00:59.609> on

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
have notes that you were working on

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.849 
have notes that you were working on
before<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.410> write<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> new<00:01:01.829> one

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
before you don't have to write a new one

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.920 
before you don't have to write a new one
because<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.730> hit<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> menu<00:01:03.359> button<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
because it's hit that menu button and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
because it's hit that menu button and
then<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.470> could<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.650> continue<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
then you could just continue on with the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.570 
then you could just continue on with the
memo<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> had<00:01:07.670> okay<00:01:08.750> can<00:01:09.750> save<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.580> but

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
memo that you had okay can save it but

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
memo that you had okay can save it but
one<00:01:11.850> thing<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.180> doesn't<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.810> surprisingly<00:01:13.740> I'm

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
one thing it doesn't do surprisingly I'm

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.830 
one thing it doesn't do surprisingly I'm
going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.250> bring<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.580> note<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.689> going

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
going to bring a note up and I'm going

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.550 
going to bring a note up and I'm going
to<00:01:15.990> write<00:01:16.140> something<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:18.270> used<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.810> close<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to write something it used to close and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
to write something it used to close and
save<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> used<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> insert<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.330> s-pen<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
save when I used to insert the s-pen and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
save when I used to insert the s-pen and
no<00:01:22.170> longer<00:01:22.560> does<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.009> maybe<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.150> feature

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
no longer does that maybe it's a feature

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.109 
no longer does that maybe it's a feature
I<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.570> change<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.350> um<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.490> doesn't<00:01:26.820> seem<00:01:26.939> like

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
I can change but um it doesn't seem like

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.870 
I can change but um it doesn't seem like
it<00:01:27.439> automatically<00:01:28.439> saved<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.700> thought

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it automatically saved which I thought

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
it automatically saved which I thought
was<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.119> cool<00:01:30.390> feature<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> notes<00:01:31.110> too<00:01:31.409> but

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
was a cool feature on the notes too but

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
was a cool feature on the notes too but
it<00:01:31.979> doesn't<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.689> let<00:01:33.960> me<00:01:34.049> show<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it doesn't do it here so let me show you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
it doesn't do it here so let me show you
a<00:01:34.439> couple<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.340> things<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:36.329> are<00:01:36.540> some

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
a couple of more things here are some

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.069 
a couple of more things here are some
really<00:01:37.079> cool<00:01:37.350> ways<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.979> pop<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.430> memo<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
really cool ways to use pop up memo and

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
really cool ways to use pop up memo and
I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:40.860> makes<00:01:41.159> sense<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.700> use<00:01:41.939> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I think it really makes sense to use it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.940 
I think it really makes sense to use it
like<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> lot<00:01:43.920> of

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
like this because you know a lot of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.219 
like this because you know a lot of
times<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:44.970> taking<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.750> somebody's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
times you are taking down somebody's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.679 
times you are taking down somebody's
name<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.560> phone<00:01:47.009> number<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.270> really

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
name and phone number and you really

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.330 
name and phone number and you really
don't<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.049> time<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.530> break<00:01:49.829> out<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
don't have time to break out that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.490 
don't have time to break out that
contact<00:01:50.880> list<00:01:51.060> type<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> number<00:01:51.930> type<00:01:52.350> in

and out Hollywood okay let's see if we

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:52.750 
and out Hollywood okay let's see if we
can<00:03:43.549> find<00:03:43.819> that<00:03:49.540> oops<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.780> meant<00:03:51.079> to<00:03:51.400> go<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.459> Mass

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
can find that oops I meant to go to Mass

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.400 
can find that oops I meant to go to Mass
but<00:03:53.060> as<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.419> could<00:03:53.540> see<00:03:53.599> it<00:03:53.930> did<00:03:54.169> actually

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
but as you could see it did actually

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.430 
but as you could see it did actually
find<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.919> location<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.750> course<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.169> found

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
find the location and of course it found

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.190 
find the location and of course it found
it<00:04:00.620> there's<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:01.069> high<00:04:01.220> school<00:04:02.200> there's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
it there's the high school there's

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.960 
it there's the high school there's
Hollywood<00:04:03.739> Boulevard<00:04:05.530> there<00:04:06.530> we<00:04:06.650> go

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
Hollywood Boulevard there we go

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.580 
Hollywood Boulevard there we go
so<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.359> looks<00:04:08.599> like<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.870> found<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:09.290> with<00:04:09.440> no

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
so it looks like you found it with no

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.289 
so it looks like you found it with no
problem<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.280> think<00:04:10.549> there's<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.000> lot<00:04:11.269> of

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
problem so I think there's a lot of

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.170 
problem so I think there's a lot of
potential<00:04:11.780> here<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:13.280> let's<00:04:13.549> look<00:04:13.669> at<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.940> last

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
potential here so let's look at the last

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.909 
potential here so let's look at the last
option<00:04:14.419> we<00:04:14.720> saw<00:04:14.930> on<00:04:15.109> there<00:04:15.350> which<00:04:15.500> was<00:04:15.709> make<00:04:15.889> a

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
option we saw on there which was make a

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.660 
option we saw on there which was make a
task<00:04:16.280> list<00:04:16.639> so<00:04:17.509> say<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.109> you

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
task list so say that you

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.180 
task list so say that you
remember<00:04:19.210> that<00:04:19.510> almost<00:04:19.990> six<00:04:20.440> months<00:04:20.770> ago<00:04:20.890> you

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
remember that almost six months ago you

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.400 
remember that almost six months ago you
filed<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.640> tax<00:04:21.880> extension<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.020> really

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
filed a tax extension and you really

the owner of this device to access that

memo<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.360> then<00:06:04.360> you<00:06:04.510> can<00:06:04.810> do<00:06:05.050> something<00:06:05.410> about

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
memo and then you can do something about

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.010 
memo and then you can do something about
it<00:06:07.380> so<00:06:08.380> that's<00:06:08.500> a<00:06:08.620> brief<00:06:08.860> look<00:06:09.190> at<00:06:09.780> action<00:06:10.780> memo

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
I think you could briefly resize here no

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.860 
I think you could briefly resize here no
you<00:06:14.140> can't<00:06:14.410> really<00:06:14.980> size<00:06:15.820> it<00:06:16.090> any<00:06:16.270> bigger<00:06:16.600> than

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
you can't really size it any bigger than

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.990 
you can't really size it any bigger than
that<00:06:17.080> though<00:06:17.350> and<00:06:17.620> then<00:06:17.890> in<00:06:18.160> this<00:06:18.310> little<00:06:18.580> plus

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
that though and then in this little plus

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.910 
that though and then in this little plus
button<00:06:19.030> it'll<00:06:19.630> save<00:06:19.990> it<00:06:20.200> and<00:06:20.380> it<00:06:20.500> will<00:06:20.650> create

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
button it'll save it and it will create
