road or maybe it's a gravel road or
off-road<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:54.000> provides<00:01:54.390> better<00:01:54.780> traction

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
off-road it provides better traction

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.760 
off-road it provides better traction
because<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> power<00:01:56.850> pulses<00:01:57.180> now<00:01:57.770> in

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
because of the power pulses now in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.640 
because of the power pulses now in
addition<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.310> that

usually<00:02:01.190> we<00:02:01.280> have<00:02:01.780> electronic<00:02:02.780> traction

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
usually we have electronic traction

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.800 
usually we have electronic traction
control<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.160> lot<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.370> this<00:02:07.420> there<00:02:08.420> are<00:02:08.540> three
