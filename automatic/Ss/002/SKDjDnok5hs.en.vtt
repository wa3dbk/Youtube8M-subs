the patch layer in anime studio Pro

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.320 
the patch layer in anime studio Pro
allows<00:00:23.289> us<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.619> create<00:00:23.859> a<00:00:24.039> patch<00:00:24.340> which<00:00:25.029> hides

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
allows us to create a patch which hides

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.409 
allows us to create a patch which hides
the<00:00:25.539> seam<00:00:25.840> between<00:00:26.080> two<00:00:26.619> objects<00:00:27.360> this<00:00:28.360> is

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
the seam between two objects this is

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.810 
the seam between two objects this is
ideal<00:00:28.989> if<00:00:29.320> you<00:00:29.500> have<00:00:29.739> an<00:00:29.859> arm<00:00:30.099> or<00:00:30.340> a<00:00:30.369> leg<00:00:30.430> that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
ideal if you have an arm or a leg that

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.330 
ideal if you have an arm or a leg that
is<00:00:30.939> made<00:00:31.149> of<00:00:31.270> one<00:00:31.509> or<00:00:31.720> more<00:00:31.899> parts<00:00:32.349> for

here<00:00:36.070> you<00:00:36.940> can<00:00:37.120> see<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:37.330> have<00:00:37.750> two<00:00:38.019> parts<00:00:38.379> of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
here you can see I have two parts of

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.579 
here you can see I have two parts of
this<00:00:38.589> arm<00:00:38.860> made<00:00:39.339> up<00:00:39.460> two<00:00:39.670> different<00:00:39.820> layers

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
this arm made up two different layers

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.200 
this arm made up two different layers
the<00:00:41.589> bottom<00:00:42.010> portion<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.519> arm<00:00:42.760> has<00:00:43.059> this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
the bottom portion of the arm has this

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.290 
the bottom portion of the arm has this
line<00:00:43.510> that<00:00:43.809> extends<00:00:44.260> across<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:45.089> it<00:00:46.089> just

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
line that extends across and it just

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.880 
line that extends across and it just
doesn't<00:00:46.570> look<00:00:46.690> natural<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:47.230> have<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.650> line

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
doesn't look natural to have the line

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.610 
doesn't look natural to have the line
this<00:00:48.100> way<00:00:48.309> we<00:00:49.180> can<00:00:49.360> manually<00:00:49.780> go<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.379> tweak

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
this way we can manually go in and tweak

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.310 
this way we can manually go in and tweak
this<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.129> get<00:00:51.339> rid<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.670> line<00:00:51.910> or<00:00:52.329> we<00:00:53.170> can

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
this to get rid of the line or we can

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.160 
this to get rid of the line or we can
use<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.649> patch<00:00:53.829> layer<00:00:54.190> in<00:00:54.750> order<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.870> use<00:00:56.020> the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
use the patch layer in order to use the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.959 
use the patch layer in order to use the
patch<00:00:56.410> layer<00:00:56.770> let's<00:00:57.129> first<00:00:57.430> click<00:00:57.760> on<00:00:57.910> the

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
patch layer let's first click on the

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.060 
patch layer let's first click on the
bottom<00:00:58.420> portion<00:00:58.629> of<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:58.989> arm<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:01.769> my<00:01:02.769> case

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
bottom portion of the arm in my case

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.180 
bottom portion of the arm in my case
this<00:01:03.430> is<00:01:03.579> arm<00:01:03.820> one<00:01:04.059> part<00:01:04.420> two<00:01:04.660> I'm<00:01:05.039> doing<00:01:06.039> this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
this is arm one part two I'm doing this

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.310 
this is arm one part two I'm doing this
because<00:01:06.369> when<00:01:06.759> I<00:01:06.789> create<00:01:07.149> the<00:01:07.270> patch<00:01:07.479> layer<00:01:07.899> it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
because when I create the patch layer it

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.650 
because when I create the patch layer it
will<00:01:08.679> go<00:01:08.890> above<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:09.700> portion<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.450> arm

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
will go above this portion of the arm

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.900 
will go above this portion of the arm
and<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.470> need<00:01:11.679> the<00:01:11.800> patch<00:01:12.039> layer<00:01:12.310> above<00:01:12.670> what

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
and I need the patch layer above what

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.050 
and I need the patch layer above what
it's<00:01:13.060> patching<00:01:13.539> the<00:01:13.660> function<00:01:14.080> properly<00:01:14.500> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's patching the function properly so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060 
it's patching the function properly so
once<00:01:16.060> you've<00:01:16.210> done<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:16.600> go<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.470> new<00:01:17.830> layer

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
once you've done this go to new layer

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.730 
once you've done this go to new layer
and<00:01:18.630> choose<00:01:19.630> patch<00:01:21.929> now<00:01:22.929> we<00:01:22.990> need<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.289> select<00:01:23.530> a

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
and choose patch now we need to select a

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.249 
and choose patch now we need to select a
target<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.250> patch<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:25.390> case<00:01:25.659> it's<00:01:25.990> going

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
target to patch in this case it's going

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.980 
target to patch in this case it's going
to<00:01:26.380> be<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.710> upper<00:01:27.070> portion<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.670> my<00:01:27.880> arm<00:01:28.119> or<00:01:28.420> in

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
to be the upper portion of my arm or in

to be the upper portion of my arm or in
other<00:01:29.140> words<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.860> arm<00:01:30.070> one<00:01:30.430> part<00:01:30.790> one<00:01:31.000> layer

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
other words the arm one part one layer

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.609 
other words the arm one part one layer
so<00:01:32.950> I'll<00:01:33.189> choose<00:01:33.430> target<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.150> pick<00:01:35.049> arm<00:01:35.320> one

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
so I'll choose target and pick arm one

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.499 
so I'll choose target and pick arm one
part<00:01:36.280> one<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:37.240> click<00:01:38.200> ok<00:01:39.000> you'll<00:01:40.000> now<00:01:40.210> notice

a patch lair has been inserted into my
layers<00:01:42.970> panel<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:43.600> it's<00:01:44.049> currently<00:01:44.439> above

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
layers panel and it's currently above

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.940 
layers panel and it's currently above
the<00:01:44.890> arm<00:01:45.070> one<00:01:45.399> part<00:01:45.759> two<00:01:45.970> layer<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:47.439> i<00:01:47.530> zoom<00:01:47.560> out

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
the arm one part two layer if i zoom out

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.789 
the arm one part two layer if i zoom out
and<00:01:48.520> scroll<00:01:48.939> up<00:01:49.119> we<00:01:49.390> can<00:01:50.200> find<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.619> patch

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
and scroll up we can find the patch

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.600 
and scroll up we can find the patch
layer<00:01:51.130> right<00:01:51.340> here<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.659> simple<00:01:53.110> circle

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
layer right here it's a simple circle

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.190 
layer right here it's a simple circle
like<00:01:54.610> any<00:01:54.850> layer<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:55.360> can<00:01:55.540> be<00:01:55.659> moved<00:01:55.869> or

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
like any layer it can be moved or

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.959 
like any layer it can be moved or
tweaked<00:01:56.500> so<00:01:57.070> let's<00:01:57.219> take<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.520> move<00:01:57.729> layer

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
tweaked so let's take the move layer

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.330 
tweaked so let's take the move layer
tool<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.500> just<00:02:00.399> move<00:02:00.579> it<00:02:00.729> down<00:02:00.880> like<00:02:01.119> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
tool and just move it down like this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.560 
tool and just move it down like this
towards<00:02:03.340> my<00:02:03.549> two<00:02:03.610> arm<00:02:04.180> pieces<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.759> you'll

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
towards my two arm pieces and you'll

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.229 
towards my two arm pieces and you'll
notice<00:02:07.810> when<00:02:08.799> I<00:02:08.860> place<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.190> patch<00:02:09.610> over<00:02:09.880> the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
notice when I place the patch over the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:18.750 
notice when I place the patch over the
arm<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:11.320> line<00:02:11.530> goes<00:02:11.829> away

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.700 

now<00:02:19.760> if<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.240> go<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> my<00:02:20.660> bone<00:02:21.050> structure<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:24.020> I

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
now if I go to my bone structure and I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.530 
now if I go to my bone structure and I
take<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> manipulate<00:02:25.490> bone<00:02:25.700> tool<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.360> just

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
take the manipulate bone tool and I just

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.140 
take the manipulate bone tool and I just
move<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.870> limb<00:02:27.140> around<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:28.520> can<00:02:28.700> see<00:02:28.940> that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
move this limb around you can see that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.180 
move this limb around you can see that
the<00:02:29.240> patch<00:02:29.450> layer<00:02:29.840> has<00:02:30.290> fixed<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.890> seam

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
the patch layer has fixed that seam

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.710 
the patch layer has fixed that seam
there<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:31.970> no<00:02:32.180> line<00:02:32.480> coming<00:02:32.780> in<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.110> intersect

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
there is no line coming in to intersect

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.300 
there is no line coming in to intersect
the<00:02:35.720> patch<00:02:35.960> lair<00:02:36.290> will<00:02:36.440> also<00:02:36.830> follow<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
the patch lair will also follow the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.340 
the patch lair will also follow the
joins<00:02:37.610> when<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.300> are<00:02:38.450> using<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.870> bone<00:02:39.050> tool

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
joins when you are using the bone tool

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.040 
joins when you are using the bone tool
if<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:40.550> ever<00:02:40.760> need<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.180> adjust<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.840> patch

if you ever need to adjust the patch

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.500 
if you ever need to adjust the patch

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
one more thing just to point it out

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.540 
one more thing just to point it out
again<00:02:56.140> make<00:02:57.140> sure<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.410> your<00:02:57.770> patch<00:02:58.010> layer<00:02:58.340> is

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
again make sure that your patch layer is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.220 
again make sure that your patch layer is
above<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.120> layers<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.510> want<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.990> patch

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
above the layers you want to patch

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.680 
above the layers you want to patch
because<00:03:00.920> again<00:03:01.220> if<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:02.030> bring<00:03:02.240> this<00:03:02.450> layer

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
because again if I bring this layer

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.320 
because again if I bring this layer
below<00:03:03.050> my<00:03:03.230> arm<00:03:03.500> piece<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:04.670> can<00:03:04.850> see<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.270> the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
below my arm piece you can see that the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.880 
below my arm piece you can see that the
patch<00:03:05.540> layer<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:06.080> no<00:03:06.260> longer<00:03:06.500> working

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.070 

so<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:10.070> conclusion<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.120> how<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.360> use<00:03:11.780> the
