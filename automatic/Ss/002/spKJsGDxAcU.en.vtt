fixes to this things like this which

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990 
fixes to this things like this which
have<00:00:49.140> b12<00:00:49.739> minute<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> actually<00:00:50.520> has<00:00:50.700> one

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
have b12 minute this actually has one

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.760 
have b12 minute this actually has one
serving<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.690> has<00:00:52.010> 150%<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.370> 12<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.620> what

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
serving of this has 150% of 12 so what

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.040 
serving of this has 150% of 12 so what
you<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.370> you're<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> pulse

not<00:01:29.680> sticking<00:01:30.010> together<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.790> it's<00:01:31.000> sort<00:01:31.300> of

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
not sticking together and it's sort of

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.680 
not sticking together and it's sort of

unsweetened<00:02:30.890> organic<00:02:31.760> soil<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:32.930> have<00:02:33.110> a

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
unsweetened organic soil so I have a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.400 
unsweetened organic soil so I have a
couple<00:02:33.500> things<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.770> say<00:02:33.980> about<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:35.410> of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
couple things to say about that of

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.830 
couple things to say about that of
course<00:02:36.650> we<00:02:36.920> know<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.370> canola<00:02:38.000> oil<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.600> not

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
course we know that canola oil is not

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.300 
course we know that canola oil is not
the<00:02:39.170> best<00:02:39.380> thing<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:39.650> you

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
the best thing for you

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.520 
the best thing for you
and<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:41.360> we've<00:02:41.630> experimented<00:02:42.020> with<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.470> couple

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
and so we've experimented with a couple

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.080 
and so we've experimented with a couple
other<00:02:42.890> different<00:02:43.280> kind<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.459> oils<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:43.940> are

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
other different kind of oils that are

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.050 
other different kind of oils that are
