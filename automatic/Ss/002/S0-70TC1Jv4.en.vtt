00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
test series against the Lions would

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.719

kicker<00:01:14.799> left<00:01:15.340> on<00:01:15.549> I<00:01:15.580> sort<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:15.909> got<00:01:16.000> knocked<00:01:16.240> out

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360

in<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.570> first<00:01:16.659> 30<00:01:17.110> seconds<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.680> game<00:01:17.710> so

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
in the first 30 seconds of the game so

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.740 
in the first 30 seconds of the game so
that<00:01:18.460> changed<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.360> guess<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.630> whole

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
that changed I guess the whole

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.240 
that changed I guess the whole
combination<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.440> we've<00:01:20.590> been<00:01:20.740> working<00:01:21.130> on

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
combination that we've been working on

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.469 
combination that we've been working on
you<00:01:21.520> know<00:01:21.610> we<00:01:21.729> wanted<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.030> attack<00:01:22.240> them<00:01:22.390> off

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
you know we wanted to attack them off

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.630 
you know we wanted to attack them off
second<00:01:22.840> ball<00:01:22.990> player<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.290> also<00:01:24.070> sort<00:01:24.369> of<00:01:24.430> goal

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
second ball player and also sort of goal

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.120 
second ball player and also sort of goal
Kings<00:01:24.909> that<00:01:25.420> was<00:01:25.960> pretty<00:01:26.140> tough<00:01:26.380> at<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.920> time

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
Kings that was pretty tough at the time

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.149 
Kings that was pretty tough at the time
but<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:28.450> guess<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.439> second<00:01:29.799> game<00:01:29.860> was<00:01:30.010> quite

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
but I guess that second game was quite

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.859 
but I guess that second game was quite
memorable<00:01:30.549> for<00:01:30.970> us<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.240> know<00:01:31.360> we<00:01:31.479> found<00:01:31.659> our

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
memorable for us you know we found our

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.539 
memorable for us you know we found our
groove<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.380> we<00:01:32.770> started<00:01:33.040> getting<00:01:33.280> into<00:01:33.520> it

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
groove and we started getting into it

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.840 
groove and we started getting into it
and<00:01:33.760> Ford<00:01:34.210> really<00:01:34.510> stepped<00:01:34.810> up<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:36.220> guess

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
and Ford really stepped up and I guess

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.090 
and Ford really stepped up and I guess
and<00:01:37.030> then<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.299> final<00:01:37.540> final<00:01:38.290> tester<00:01:38.770> I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
and then that final final tester I

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.520 
and then that final final tester I
thought<00:01:39.880> we<00:01:40.000> had<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.180> momentum<00:01:41.170> came<00:01:41.350> our<00:01:41.500> way

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
thought we had it momentum came our way

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.950 
thought we had it momentum came our way

bad bad mistakes and us and bad judgment

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.450 
bad bad mistakes and us and bad judgment

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
cause I'd say that I guess aren't

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.100

usually<00:02:33.610> sort<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.270> what<00:02:34.360> I'd<00:02:34.480> be<00:02:34.600> doing<00:02:34.630> but<00:02:35.080> uh

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
usually sort of what I'd be doing but uh

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.070 
usually sort of what I'd be doing but uh

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
you know definitely cost me but if you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.450 
you know definitely cost me but if you
learn<00:02:38.260> from<00:02:38.440> mistakes<00:02:38.620> that's<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.220> thing

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460

possession and territory and you know

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.900 
possession and territory and you know
transferring<00:04:25.980> that<00:04:26.100> pressure<00:04:26.370> over<00:04:26.640> we're

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
transferring that pressure over we're

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.630 
transferring that pressure over we're
sort<00:04:27.360> of<00:04:27.420> back<00:04:27.900> only<00:04:28.200> we<00:04:28.770> tend<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.040> chance<00:04:29.490> to

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
sort of back only we tend to chance to

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
hand a little bit more but I definitely

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.530 
hand a little bit more but I definitely
think<00:04:31.920> that<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.490> English<00:04:32.820> Premiership<00:04:33.270> is

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
think that the English Premiership is

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.750 
think that the English Premiership is
closer<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.960> sort<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.350> international<00:04:35.040> rugby<00:04:35.220> in

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
closer to sort of international rugby in

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.310 
closer to sort of international rugby in
that<00:04:35.970> respect<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.510> definitely<00:04:36.870> World<00:04:37.080> Cup

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
that respect and definitely World Cup

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.310 
that respect and definitely World Cup
World<00:04:37.620> Cups<00:04:37.890> sort<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.430> what<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:38.850> found<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.750> sort

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
World Cups sort of what I found is sort

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.870
