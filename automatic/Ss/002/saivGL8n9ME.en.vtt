filters before threaded filters are

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.730 
filters before threaded filters are
simply<00:00:18.240> filters<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.230> thread<00:00:19.470> right<00:00:19.680> on

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
can do anything from polarizing the ND

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.380 
can do anything from polarizing the ND
to<00:00:28.470> simple<00:00:28.920> UV<00:00:29.279> filter<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> protect<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.300> lens

from getting any scratches or dust on it
now<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> thing<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:33.780> filters<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
now the thing about these filters is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
now the thing about these filters is
they're<00:00:34.620> great<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.100> threaded<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.090> they

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
they're great to be threaded on but they

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.090 
they're great to be threaded on but they
also<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> hassle<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.260> thread<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.770> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
also can be a hassle to thread on this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
also can be a hassle to thread on this
is<00:00:38.250> why<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> lot<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.850> times<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.180> Hollywood<00:00:39.540> sets

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is why a lot of times in Hollywood sets

adapter system their adapter system is
very<00:01:18.930> simply<00:01:19.320> magnets<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.430> hold<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.509> filter

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
very simply magnets that hold the filter

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
very simply magnets that hold the filter
onto<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.799> camera<00:01:23.100> lens<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.790> comes<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.180> two

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
onto the camera lens it comes with two

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690 
onto the camera lens it comes with two

end of the filter and once you're done

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.760 
end of the filter and once you're done
you<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.840> slap<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.530> you're<00:01:31.619> good<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you just slap it on and you're good to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.520 
you just slap it on and you're good to
go<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.579> lens<00:01:32.850> adapters<00:01:33.329> use<00:01:33.689> rare<00:01:34.350> earth

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
go now the lens adapters use rare earth

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.740 
go now the lens adapters use rare earth
metal<00:01:34.979> magnets<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.299> they're<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.720> very

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
metal magnets so they're actually very

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
metal magnets so they're actually very
strong<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.530> hold<00:01:37.770> most<00:01:38.220> filters<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
strong they can hold most filters on

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
strong they can hold most filters on
without<00:01:39.000> having<00:01:39.270> any<00:01:39.450> issue<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.960> weight<00:01:40.200> or

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500

noticed that when I rotate that the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.959 
noticed that when I rotate that the

off the UV filter and then going back

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.509 
scenarios I prefer to take the UV filter
off<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.900> course<00:02:44.620> now<00:02:44.950> I'm<00:02:45.099> dealing<00:02:45.280> with

off of course now I'm dealing with

off of course now I'm dealing with

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.270 
single time I'm in that type of scenario
very<00:02:49.030> inconvenient<00:02:49.650> what's<00:02:50.650> great<00:02:50.890> about<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
very inconvenient what's great about the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.120 
very inconvenient what's great about the
zoom<00:02:51.970> adapters<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> can<00:02:53.140> leave<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.829> UV

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
zoom adapters is that I can leave the UV

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.339 
zoom adapters is that I can leave the UV
on<00:02:54.280> there<00:02:54.519> most<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.480> time<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.959> if<00:02:56.049> I<00:02:56.140> hit<00:02:56.319> a

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
on there most of the time and if I hit a

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.930 
on there most of the time and if I hit a
scenario<00:02:56.860> where<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.069> don't<00:02:57.340> want<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.790> just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
scenario where I don't want it I just

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.360 
scenario where I don't want it I just
pop<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.450> off<00:02:58.569> now<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.470> small<00:02:59.650> downside<00:03:00.280> with

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
pop it off now one small downside with

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.039 
pop it off now one small downside with
the<00:03:00.459> zoom<00:03:00.610> adapters<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.180> they<00:03:01.329> don't<00:03:01.510> fit<00:03:01.840> with

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
the zoom adapters is they don't fit with

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.440 
the zoom adapters is they don't fit with
the<00:03:02.230> standard<00:03:02.620> lens<00:03:02.799> cap<00:03:03.099> on<00:03:03.299> directly<00:03:04.299> onto

the standard lens cap on directly onto
the<00:03:04.690> lens<00:03:04.900> adapter<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.950> usually<00:03:06.519> what<00:03:06.640> they

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
the lens adapter so usually what they

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.819 
the lens adapter so usually what they
recommend<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.420> having<00:03:08.110> another<00:03:08.410> filter

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
recommend is having another filter

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.490 
recommend is having another filter
adapter<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.519> clip<00:03:09.879> your<00:03:10.120> lens<00:03:10.690> cap<00:03:10.959> on<00:03:11.200> -

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
adapter that you clip your lens cap on -

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.740 
adapter that you clip your lens cap on -
and<00:03:11.769> then<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:12.430> magnetically<00:03:13.209> attach<00:03:13.480> it

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
and then you just magnetically attach it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.080 
and then you just magnetically attach it
to<00:03:14.049> your<00:03:14.260> lens<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.709> little<00:03:15.160> inconvenient<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.030> I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
to your lens a little inconvenient and I

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.059 
to your lens a little inconvenient and I
find<00:03:16.329> myself<00:03:16.450> sometimes<00:03:16.810> forgetting<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:18.010> I

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
find myself sometimes forgetting that I

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.340 
find myself sometimes forgetting that I
have<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:19.150> zoom<00:03:19.540> adapter<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:19.989> there<00:03:20.139> so<00:03:20.290> I'll

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
have the zoom adapter on there so I'll

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.960 
have the zoom adapter on there so I'll
still<00:03:20.590> pop<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:21.010> off<00:03:21.160> which<00:03:21.370> then<00:03:21.579> just<00:03:21.790> leaves

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
still pop it off which then just leaves

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.849 
still pop it off which then just leaves
a<00:03:22.060> filtering<00:03:22.600> on<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.810> end<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.380> what<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.560> find

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
a filtering on the end so what I find

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.949 
a filtering on the end so what I find
myself<00:03:23.980> doing<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:24.579> just<00:03:25.000> having<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.329> UV<00:03:25.630> filter

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
myself doing is just having a UV filter

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.470 
myself doing is just having a UV filter
for<00:03:26.139> every<00:03:26.319> lens<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.859> clipping<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:28.000> lens<00:03:28.209> cap

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
for every lens and clipping the lens cap

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.870 
for every lens and clipping the lens cap
directly<00:03:28.900> onto<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.349> UV<00:03:29.650> filter<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.220> then<00:03:30.639> I

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
directly onto the UV filter and then I

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.910 
directly onto the UV filter and then I
either<00:03:31.150> take<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.720> lens<00:03:31.989> cap<00:03:32.109> off<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.680> UV

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
either take the lens cap off of the UV

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.009 
either take the lens cap off of the UV
filter<00:03:33.280> or<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:33.970> take<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.299> lens<00:03:34.480> cap<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.930> the

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
filter or just take the lens cap and the

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.020 
filter or just take the lens cap and the
UV<00:03:35.290> filter<00:03:35.650> right<00:03:35.799> off<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.190> lens<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.579> this

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
UV filter right off of the lens so this

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.400 
UV filter right off of the lens so this
is<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.209> little<00:03:37.450> bit<00:03:37.540> easier<00:03:37.840> way<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:38.049> doing<00:03:38.290> that

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
is a little bit easier way of doing that

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.039 
is a little bit easier way of doing that
now<00:03:38.700> recently<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.819> went<00:03:40.239> from<00:03:40.389> just<00:03:40.690> honing<00:03:40.870> at

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
now recently I went from just honing at

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:41.909 
now recently I went from just honing at
fs700

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
fs700

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.430 
fs700
to<00:03:42.220> owning<00:03:42.459> fs700<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.480> now<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.690> beach<00:03:44.079> camera

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
to owning fs700 and now a beach camera

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.159 
to owning fs700 and now a beach camera
of<00:03:44.590> an<00:03:44.680> fs100<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.700> love<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:46.450> setup<00:03:46.660> because<00:03:46.900> it

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
of an fs100 I love this setup because it

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.409 
of an fs100 I love this setup because it
allows<00:03:47.380> me<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.620> get<00:03:47.799> great<00:03:48.609> -<00:03:48.819> camera<00:03:49.150> shoots

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
allows me to get great - camera shoots

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.930 
allows me to get great - camera shoots
be<00:03:50.049> able<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.260> get<00:03:50.380> me<00:03:50.500> good<00:03:50.620> pickup<00:03:50.980> shots<00:03:51.250> now

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
be able to get me good pickup shots now

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.000 
be able to get me good pickup shots now
whatever<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.480> scenario<00:03:52.690> may<00:03:53.019> be<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.440> can<00:03:53.829> have

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
whatever the scenario may be I can have

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.430 
whatever the scenario may be I can have
a<00:03:54.040> very<00:03:54.340> good<00:03:54.519> match<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.970> my<00:03:55.090> fs700<00:03:55.690> don't<00:03:56.319> want

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
a very good match to my fs700 don't want

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.470 
a very good match to my fs700 don't want
the<00:03:56.500> big<00:03:56.590> downsides<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.370> fs100<00:03:57.880> over<00:03:58.359> the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
the big downsides to the fs100 over the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.870 
the big downsides to the fs100 over the
700<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.500> 100<00:03:59.889> does<00:04:00.069> not<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.549> ND

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
700 is that the 100 does not have ND

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.699 
700 is that the 100 does not have ND
filters<00:04:01.269> but<00:04:01.810> I'm<00:04:01.900> getting<00:04:02.139> very<00:04:02.169> used<00:04:02.620> to

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
filters but I'm getting very used to

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.120 
filters but I'm getting very used to
having<00:04:02.799> ND<00:04:03.310> filters<00:04:03.639> on<00:04:03.819> my<00:04:03.940> 700<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:05.349> all<00:04:05.829> my

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
having ND filters on my 700 so all my

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.610 
having ND filters on my 700 so all my
lenses<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:07.540> I<00:04:07.599> can<00:04:07.840> use<00:04:07.989> either<00:04:08.200> with<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
lenses that I can use either with the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.159 
lenses that I can use either with the
700<00:04:09.220> or<00:04:09.400> with<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.700> 100<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.359> have<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.930> find<00:04:11.109> out

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
700 or with the 100 I have to find out

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.720 
700 or with the 100 I have to find out
when<00:04:11.380> I'm<00:04:11.470> going<00:04:11.709> over<00:04:11.799> to<00:04:11.889> the<00:04:11.980> 100<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.519> find

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
when I'm going over to the 100 I find

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.729 
when I'm going over to the 100 I find
myself<00:04:12.849> having<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.359> put<00:04:13.540> an<00:04:13.720> ND<00:04:14.260> filter<00:04:14.560> back

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
myself having to put an ND filter back

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.740 
myself having to put an ND filter back
on<00:04:14.919> and<00:04:15.549> when<00:04:15.669> I<00:04:15.700> go<00:04:15.849> over<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.060> 700<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.539> find

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
on and when I go over the 700 I find

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.729 
on and when I go over the 700 I find
myself<00:04:16.840> I'm<00:04:17.139> going<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.289> take<00:04:17.410> that<00:04:17.530> indi

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
myself I'm going to take that indi

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:18.539 
myself I'm going to take that indi
filter<00:04:18.070> off

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
filter off

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.759 
filter off
so<00:04:18.849> my<00:04:19.090> scenario<00:04:19.389> this<00:04:19.690> filter<00:04:20.229> system<00:04:20.410> works

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
so my scenario this filter system works

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.350 
so my scenario this filter system works
really<00:04:21.130> really<00:04:21.280> well<00:04:21.519> I<00:04:21.700> love<00:04:22.000> having<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
really really well I love having the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.510 
really really well I love having the
zoom<00:04:22.539> because<00:04:22.719> I<00:04:22.960> can<00:04:23.169> quickly<00:04:23.409> remove<00:04:24.099> and

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
zoom because I can quickly remove and

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.790 
zoom because I can quickly remove and
attach<00:04:24.789> it<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.150> whatever<00:04:25.330> lenses<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.289> have

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
attach it to whatever lenses that I have

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.700 
attach it to whatever lenses that I have
most<00:04:27.129> of<00:04:27.280> my<00:04:27.370> lenses<00:04:27.789> are<00:04:28.060> 77<00:04:29.020> millimeter<00:04:29.410> on

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
most of my lenses are 77 millimeter on

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.800 
most of my lenses are 77 millimeter on
the<00:04:30.220> filter<00:04:30.520> thread<00:04:30.729> size<00:04:30.940> so<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.300> can<00:04:31.419> easily

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
the filter thread size so I can easily

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.860 
the filter thread size so I can easily
take<00:04:32.229> that<00:04:32.440> off<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:33.460> it's<00:04:33.970> Universal<00:04:34.300> for

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
take that off and it's Universal for

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.629 
take that off and it's Universal for
whatever<00:04:35.169> adapter<00:04:35.889> that<00:04:36.009> I<00:04:36.069> have<00:04:36.280> now

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
whatever adapter that I have now

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.309 
whatever adapter that I have now
recently<00:04:37.060> I've<00:04:37.449> started<00:04:37.479> getting<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.080> lot<00:04:38.289> of

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
recently I've started getting a lot of

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.559 
recently I've started getting a lot of
Sony<00:04:38.740> lenses<00:04:39.129> for<00:04:39.250> my<00:04:39.400> cameras<00:04:39.879> I<00:04:40.060> like<00:04:40.419> this

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
Sony lenses for my cameras I like this

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.580 
Sony lenses for my cameras I like this
because<00:04:40.780> they<00:04:41.050> have<00:04:41.199> features<00:04:41.530> like

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
because they have features like

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.589 
because they have features like
out-of-focus<00:04:42.129> image<00:04:42.610> stabilization<00:04:43.000> stuff

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
out-of-focus image stabilization stuff

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.990 
out-of-focus image stabilization stuff
like<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.229> still<00:04:45.039> love<00:04:45.220> my<00:04:45.250> Canon<00:04:45.699> lenses

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
like that I still love my Canon lenses

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.430 
like that I still love my Canon lenses
for<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.240> lot<00:04:46.419> of<00:04:46.509> cinematic<00:04:46.900> stuff<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.229> times

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
for a lot of cinematic stuff but times

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.260 
for a lot of cinematic stuff but times
that<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.620> need<00:04:47.889> auto<00:04:48.069> functionality<00:04:48.940> it's

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
that I need auto functionality it's

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.390 
that I need auto functionality it's
really<00:04:49.569> nice<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.870> have<00:04:50.050> those<00:04:50.259> but<00:04:51.009> these<00:04:51.190> have

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
really nice to have those but these have

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.309 
really nice to have those but these have
a<00:04:51.430> smaller<00:04:51.879> filter<00:04:52.120> science<00:04:52.539> they<00:04:52.690> have<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:52.870> 49

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
a smaller filter science they have a 49

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.170 
a smaller filter science they have a 49
millimeter<00:04:53.710> thread<00:04:53.979> versus<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.580> 77

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
millimeter thread versus the 77

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.119 
millimeter thread versus the 77
millimeter<00:04:55.509> thread<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.349> rather<00:04:56.560> than<00:04:56.860> get

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
millimeter thread so rather than get

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.240 
millimeter thread so rather than get
several<00:04:58.060> ND<00:04:58.360> filters<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.889> fader<00:05:00.159> nd

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
several ND filters of the the fader nd

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.279 
several ND filters of the the fader nd
that<00:05:00.610> I<00:05:00.669> have<00:05:00.819> I<00:05:00.849> really<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.449> but<00:05:02.229> they

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
that I have I really like but they

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.290 
that I have I really like but they
really<00:05:02.500> don't<00:05:02.590> have<00:05:02.740> one<00:05:03.159> in<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.759> forty<00:05:04.150> nine

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
really don't have one in the forty nine

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.330 
really don't have one in the forty nine
millimeter<00:05:04.659> size<00:05:04.930> so<00:05:05.740> what<00:05:06.009> I've<00:05:06.099> done<00:05:06.280> is

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
millimeter size so what I've done is

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.760 
millimeter size so what I've done is
I've<00:05:06.639> got<00:05:06.759> a<00:05:06.819> step-down<00:05:07.120> ring<00:05:07.509> and<00:05:07.780> usually

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
I've got a step-down ring and usually

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.870 
I've got a step-down ring and usually
step-down<00:05:09.099> rings<00:05:09.310> are<00:05:09.460> kind<00:05:09.610> of<00:05:09.639> a<00:05:09.729> hassle

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
step-down rings are kind of a hassle

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.980 
step-down rings are kind of a hassle
because<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:10.270> have<00:05:10.360> to<00:05:10.479> thread<00:05:10.690> them<00:05:10.840> on

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
because you have to thread them on

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.320 
because you have to thread them on
thread<00:05:11.440> on<00:05:11.560> both<00:05:12.280> having<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.729> zoom<00:05:12.909> adapter

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
thread on both having the zoom adapter

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.480 
thread on both having the zoom adapter
system<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:13.870> can<00:05:14.259> easily<00:05:14.530> use<00:05:14.740> a<00:05:14.770> magnetic

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
system I can easily use a magnetic

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.159 
system I can easily use a magnetic
attachment<00:05:15.880> for<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.330> step-down<00:05:16.720> ring<00:05:16.960> and

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
attachment for the step-down ring and

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.860 
attachment for the step-down ring and
use<00:05:17.500> my<00:05:17.680> existing<00:05:18.130> 77<00:05:18.819> millimeter<00:05:19.210> fader<00:05:19.750> nd

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
use my existing 77 millimeter fader nd

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.469 
use my existing 77 millimeter fader nd
that<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.620> use<00:05:20.830> with<00:05:20.979> my<00:05:21.009> Canon<00:05:21.340> lenses<00:05:21.699> right<00:05:22.270> on

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
that I use with my Canon lenses right on

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.450 
that I use with my Canon lenses right on
my<00:05:22.750> sony<00:05:22.990> lenses<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.680> when<00:05:24.069> i'm<00:05:24.159> not<00:05:24.250> using

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
my sony lenses and when i'm not using

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.369 
my sony lenses and when i'm not using
and<00:05:24.699> i<00:05:24.729> just<00:05:24.909> pop<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.240> right<00:05:25.270> off<00:05:25.389> so<00:05:25.870> i<00:05:25.900> really

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
and i just pop it right off so i really

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:27.779 
and i just pop it right off so i really
really<00:05:26.500> love<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.860> system<00:05:27.039> it<00:05:27.280> keeps<00:05:27.430> me<00:05:27.610> very

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
really love the system it keeps me very

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.969 
really love the system it keeps me very
quick<00:05:28.030> on<00:05:28.210> set<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.750> lot<00:05:29.199> faster<00:05:29.620> than<00:05:29.710> i<00:05:29.830> would

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
quick on set a lot faster than i would

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.439 
quick on set a lot faster than i would
even<00:05:30.190> be<00:05:30.310> with<00:05:30.490> having<00:05:30.819> a<00:05:30.880> matte<00:05:31.060> box<00:05:31.240> and

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
even be with having a matte box and

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:32.790 
even be with having a matte box and
usually<00:05:31.719> matte<00:05:31.900> boxes<00:05:32.319> are<00:05:32.440> what<00:05:32.560> keep<00:05:32.710> you

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
usually matte boxes are what keep you

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.189 
usually matte boxes are what keep you
fast<00:05:33.069> on<00:05:33.250> set<00:05:33.520> but<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.120> really<00:05:34.479> love<00:05:34.659> the<00:05:34.780> system

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
fast on set but I really love the system

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.680 
fast on set but I really love the system
it's<00:05:35.949> a<00:05:36.039> great<00:05:36.370> great<00:05:36.610> investment<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.270> make<00:05:37.300> a

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
it's a great great investment to make a

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.379 
it's a great great investment to make a
little<00:05:38.380> bit<00:05:38.680> pricier<00:05:39.310> then<00:05:39.759> you<00:05:39.880> might<00:05:40.030> expect

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
little bit pricier then you might expect

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.230 
little bit pricier then you might expect
four<00:05:40.659> filters<00:05:41.490> definitely<00:05:42.490> not<00:05:42.729> out<00:05:42.969> of<00:05:43.029> the

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
four filters definitely not out of the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.149 
four filters definitely not out of the
price<00:05:43.419> range<00:05:43.569> of<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.020> average<00:05:44.289> tutor<00:05:44.620> but<00:05:45.130> a

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
price range of the average tutor but a

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.499 
price range of the average tutor but a
little<00:05:45.430> on<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.699> higher<00:05:45.849> end<00:05:46.029> but<00:05:46.300> I

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
little on the higher end but I

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.920 
little on the higher end but I
understand<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:47.500> Rd<00:05:47.949> cost<00:05:48.310> money<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:48.789> so<00:05:49.509> I

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
understand that Rd cost money and so I

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.240 
understand that Rd cost money and so I
think<00:05:49.990> that<00:05:50.229> this<00:05:50.710> is<00:05:50.889> still<00:05:51.039> a<00:05:51.069> great

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
think that this is still a great

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.830 
think that this is still a great
investment<00:05:51.789> to<00:05:51.819> make<00:05:51.909> something<00:05:52.509> that<00:05:52.750> you

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
investment to make something that you

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.149 
investment to make something that you
can<00:05:52.960> easily<00:05:53.139> get<00:05:53.409> for<00:05:53.560> all<00:05:53.680> of<00:05:53.770> your<00:05:53.889> lenses

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
can easily get for all of your lenses

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.740 
can easily get for all of your lenses
and<00:05:54.340> not<00:05:54.460> spent<00:05:54.729> too<00:05:54.849> much<00:05:54.940> money<00:05:55.000> definitely

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
and not spent too much money definitely

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.310 
and not spent too much money definitely
check<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:56.139> out<00:05:56.289> and<00:05:56.469> give<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.590> a<00:05:56.710> big<00:05:56.860> thumbs<00:05:57.130> up
