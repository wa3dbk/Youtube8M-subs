00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.390
While the home cinema system
seems unobtrusive from the outside,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.240
its special feature is revealed immediately when looking at the Blu-ray receiver:

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.999
Samsung relies on the sound
of the electron tube.

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.719
Embedded transparently, two tubes are glowing in the high-quality

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.189
body and providing a visual highlight

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.529
and of course a bit of nostalgia.

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.409
Unobtrusively the touch-sensitive 
buttons for operation

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.100
fit in the design, which is characterized by 
a combination of high-gloss black

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.250
and brushed aluminum.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.150
Over the network high-resolution audio and video data are streamed.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.990
At the speaker connections the four-wire cables for the front channels attract attention particularly.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.250
While the rest of the speakers, as here the center, are fed with the usual signals

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.690
of the respective channels,
at the fronts there are additional height channels.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.120
These are calculated by DTS Neo fusion algorithm

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.170
and provide an optimization of the
premises with the aim of: higher realism.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.979
To play these signals additional drivers are installed

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.360
in the front speakers, which are placed above the

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.030
ordinary chassis.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.430
Using the supplied measuring 
microphone it is also possible to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.620
optimize the System in terms of their positioning in the room.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.660
Samsung relies on an in-house
calibration process.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.130
The measurement (here shown in time-lapse) provides mostly

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.830
very accurate results. Only the
Surround speakers and subwoofer

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.750
had to be corrected manually regarding to their distance.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.280
The measurement records not only the distance of the speakers to the listening postition but also their level.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.460
The Blu-ray player not only masters the
standard discipline 3D, but is even

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.030
designed for the processing of 4K signals
with 4x full HD resolution.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.340
All in all, Samsung provides a well-rounded product

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.460
and bridges the gap between the
technology of yesterday and tomorrow.
