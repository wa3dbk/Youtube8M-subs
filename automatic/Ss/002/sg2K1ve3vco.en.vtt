00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.940
 how should we warm up for a runner 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.250
 The best way to warm up is by running 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.450
 if we are going to make a more or less 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.490
 long 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.320
 we can dedicate the first minutes of 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.000
 training to go a little bit more 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.100
 Slowly until the body takes a tone 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.280
 that's enough to warm 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.590
 if we are serious if we are going to compete 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.030
 what we do is also to get to 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.920
 treat 10-15 minutes very gently not 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.770
 it's about getting tired or wearing ourselves out 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.840
 nothing simply from breaking a sweat 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.270
 little bit and that the body enters 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.630
 heat and fuck and tone 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.550
 after 10 who having these giving 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.570
 We can make a straight years 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.570
 you remember what the straight lines were 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.500
 and after these replicas we will be 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.070
 prepared for series or for 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 competition 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.650
 but for people who want a routine 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.250
 Warm up exercises 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.250
 specific 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.470
 I have a small table of 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.780
 warming up is pressing each of 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.170
 bercy de vale or if it's not worth it ay me 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.700
 It is very useful to heat the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.200
 basic muscle groups of a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.759
 training that fast 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.549
 we started with the ankles part 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.370
 twins we put our feet together 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.140
 something to get stability and 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.480
 we go up confident what we go down we go up 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.900
 tiptoes we go down like this for 30 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.900
 seconds 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.290
 we continue with the ischiums we have 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.800
 seized here and what we do is 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.550
 bend the knee backwards during 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.550
 30 seconds 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.360
 and then we change legs 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.390
 or not 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.880
 this is the exercise of any park 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.180
 more comfortable truth but be sitting without 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.180
 chair 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.259
 and that makes this hurts a little bit 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.270
 but it's better to do this 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.130
 warming up that some exercise of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.500
 squats that is more aggressive for 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.350
 joints we hold 30 to 40 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.390
 seconds 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.390
 abs 25 30 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.930
 lumbar is good 25 30 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.380
 and if we feel like it 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.380
 6 or 8 funds 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.170
 ace 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.620
 good as you see for those who do not want 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.360
 heating only running this tablita of 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.680
 exercises is very basic but it is 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.630
 completita twin ankles isquios 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.100
 abdominal and lumbar quadriceps and a 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.300
 little arm to expel since 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.870
 the straight lines attract four straight 60 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.660
 70 meters and we would also be already 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.770
 prepared for a more intense routine 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.110
 you already know that when entering it is very 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.080
 important especially when we go to 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.940
 submit after an intense of it 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.130
 so that when we finish it is very 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.130
 important to stretch and take care
