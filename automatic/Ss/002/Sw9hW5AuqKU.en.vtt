and today I'm bringing you guys a how to
get<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> nuke<00:00:04.589> video<00:00:04.980> on<00:00:05.420> scrapyard<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.810> this

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
get a nuke video on scrapyard and this

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.660 
get a nuke video on scrapyard and this
is<00:00:07.319> one<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.620> easiest<00:00:08.010> strategies<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.550> get

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
is one of the easiest strategies to get

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.190 
is one of the easiest strategies to get
a<00:00:08.730> nuke<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.090> don't<00:00:09.330> know<00:00:09.480> why<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.630> never<00:00:09.809> made

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
a nuke I don't know why I never made

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.839 
a nuke I don't know why I never made
this<00:00:10.380> video<00:00:10.679> back<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.130> day<00:00:11.370> when<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> was

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
this video back in the day when I was

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.570 
this video back in the day when I was
making<00:00:12.030> how<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.389> get<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> nuke<00:00:12.840> videos<00:00:13.230> but<00:00:14.130> yeah

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
making how to get a nuke videos but yeah

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.890 
making how to get a nuke videos but yeah
this<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> strategy<00:00:15.509> right<00:00:15.719> here

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this so this is the strategy right here

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.560 
this so this is the strategy right here
is<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.789> protecting<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.820> beef<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.390> mean

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
is just protecting the beef like I mean

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.240 
is just protecting the beef like I mean
when<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> enemies<00:00:19.500> are<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> C<00:00:20.039> flag

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
when the enemies are on the C flag

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.040 
when the enemies are on the C flag
they're<00:00:20.460> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.880> rushing<00:00:21.090> via<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.510> lot<00:00:21.779> so

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
they're going to be rushing via a lot so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.660 
they're going to be rushing via a lot so
that<00:00:22.170> they<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.439> break<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.070> trap<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that they can break out of that trap and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.670 
that they can break out of that trap and
if<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.750> go<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.140> head<00:00:25.320> glitch<00:00:25.529> right

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
if you just go in this head glitch right

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920 
if you just go in this head glitch right
here<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.670> kill<00:00:26.849> them<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.150> easily<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.689> so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
here you can kill them so easily it's so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900 
here you can kill them so easily it's so
impossible<00:00:28.289> for<00:00:28.710> them<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.859> kill<00:00:29.580> people<00:00:29.730> in

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
impossible for them to kill people in

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.669 
impossible for them to kill people in
that<00:00:30.060> head<00:00:30.210> glitch<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:30.900> tough<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.560> if

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
that head glitch it's really tough so if

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.590 
that head glitch it's really tough so if
you<00:00:31.769> sit<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.040> hop<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.030> garbage<00:00:33.390> can

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you sit there hop on this garbage can

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.760 
you sit there hop on this garbage can
every<00:00:33.840> now<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.110> then<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.590> look

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
every now and then and you can look

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.799 
every now and then and you can look
right<00:00:35.010> into<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.340> see<00:00:35.610> area<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.149> then<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
right into the see area and then and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.360 
right into the see area and then and
you'll<00:00:37.290> always<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.680> born<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.129> someone's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you'll always be born when someone's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.500 
you'll always be born when someone's
coming<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.910> look<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.360> can

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
coming because if you look there you can

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.940 
coming because if you look there you can
kind<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.260> run<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.770> then

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
kind of see them as they run and then

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.380 
kind of see them as they run and then
you<00:00:41.040> could<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.520> over<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you could just go over here and as you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.930 
you could just go over here and as you
see<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.719> kill<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> guy<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.700> also<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.879> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
see I kill the guy and also you have to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.400 
see I kill the guy and also you have to
keep<00:00:45.120> an<00:00:45.239> eye<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.660> left<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.350> in

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
keep an eye on your left right here in

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.470 
keep an eye on your left right here in
the<00:00:46.469> middle<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:46.950> doing<00:00:47.480> because

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the middle as I'm doing because

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.880 
the middle as I'm doing because
sometimes<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> enemies<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:49.680> through

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
sometimes the enemies will go through

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
sometimes the enemies will go through
that<00:00:50.039> plane<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> middle<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.079> they'll

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that plane in the middle and they'll

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.630 
that plane in the middle and they'll
find<00:00:52.320> their<00:00:52.500> way<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> center<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> map

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
find their way to the center of the map

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.920 
find their way to the center of the map
and<00:00:53.879> you've<00:00:53.969> got<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.480> watch<00:00:54.750> out

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and you've got to really watch out

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.180 
and you've got to really watch out
because<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> ways<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.129> die

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
because that's one of the ways I die

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.720 
because that's one of the ways I die
very<00:00:57.120> often<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.379> scrapyard<00:00:59.250> when<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.520> doing

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
very often on scrapyard when I'm doing

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.520 
very often on scrapyard when I'm doing
this<00:00:59.820> strategy<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> enemies<00:01:01.320> get

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
this strategy is because the enemies get

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
this strategy is because the enemies get
to<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> center<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> map<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.609> you're<00:01:03.270> not

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to the center of the map and you're not

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.549 
to the center of the map and you're not
ready<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.870> because<00:01:03.989> you're<00:01:04.140> staring<00:01:04.470> at

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
ready for it because you're staring at

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.990 
ready for it because you're staring at
the<00:01:04.650> B<00:01:04.769> flag<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.309> always<00:01:05.519> got<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> make

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the B flag so you always got to make

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.940 
the B flag so you always got to make
sure<00:01:06.150> keep<00:01:06.689> an<00:01:06.840> eye<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.560> center<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
sure keep an eye on the center of the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.600 
sure keep an eye on the center of the
map<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.340> here

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
map right here

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910 
map right here
they<00:01:09.000> got<00:01:09.180> hairy<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.659> had<00:01:09.810> run<00:01:10.140> back<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that's pretty much it for the strategy I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.969 
that's pretty much it for the strategy I
mean<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> rest<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.380> video<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
mean for the rest of this video I just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
mean for the rest of this video I just
kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.189> sit<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.790> my<00:01:23.909> ec130<00:01:24.450> go<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> town

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
kind of sit here get my ec130 go to town

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.550 
kind of sit here get my ec130 go to town
with<00:01:25.080> ec130<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:27.049> if<00:01:28.049> you're<00:01:28.200> wondering<00:01:28.470> why

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
with ec130 and if you're wondering why

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
with ec130 and if you're wondering why
I'm<00:01:28.680> using<00:01:28.799> ac-130<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.549> regular<00:01:29.880> domination

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I'm using ac-130 and regular domination

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.249 
I'm using ac-130 and regular domination
there's<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> reason<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.140> because

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
there's a reason for that because

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
there's a reason for that because
usually<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:32.369> use<00:01:32.520> chopper<00:01:32.909> gunner<00:01:33.150> got

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
usually I would use chopper gunner got

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569 
usually I would use chopper gunner got
on<00:01:33.750> scrapyard<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.560> always<00:01:35.070> recommend

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
on scrapyard I do always recommend

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.990 
on scrapyard I do always recommend
ac-130<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> there's<00:01:36.570> two<00:01:36.720> reasons<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.259> that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
ac-130 and there's two reasons for that

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
ac-130 and there's two reasons for that
the<00:01:39.000> first<00:01:39.240> reason<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.509> cause<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.380> have

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the first reason is cause I like to have

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.770 
the first reason is cause I like to have
them<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> C<00:01:41.250> flag<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.600> play

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
them on the C flag when I when I play

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
them on the C flag when I when I play
scrapyard<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> C

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
scrapyard and if you have them on the C

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.490 
scrapyard and if you have them on the C
flag<00:01:45.149> there's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> good<00:01:45.659> chance<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.259> lot<00:01:46.470> of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
flag there's a good chance that a lot of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.450 
flag there's a good chance that a lot of
them<00:01:46.649> are<00:01:46.740> gonna<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.920> hiding<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.430> that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
them are gonna be hiding in that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.850 
them are gonna be hiding in that
building<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.750> -<00:01:48.930> right<00:01:49.380> next<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.680> C

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
building that's right - right next to C

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.789 
building that's right - right next to C
I'll<00:01:50.040> show<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.250> once<00:01:50.579> I'm<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.939> ac-130

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
I'll show you once I'm in this ac-130

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.810 
I'll show you once I'm in this ac-130
see<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.920> building<00:01:53.100> I'm<00:01:53.280> aiming<00:01:53.549> at<00:01:53.610> right

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
see that building I'm aiming at right

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.149 
see that building I'm aiming at right
now<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.689> slaw<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.680> bomb<00:01:55.890> right

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
now if you slaw a little bomb right

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.170 
now if you slaw a little bomb right
through<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.430> you'll<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.640> able<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.969> kill

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
through there you'll be able to kill

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389 
through there you'll be able to kill
them<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.659> building<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
them out of that building but with the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.370 
them out of that building but with the
chopper<00:01:59.729> gunner<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.719> barely<00:02:01.020> can

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
chopper gunner you can you barely can

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
chopper gunner you can you barely can
get<00:02:01.530> them<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.430> tough<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.969> lot<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
get them it's really tough if a lot of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.520 
get them it's really tough if a lot of
them<00:02:03.360> spawn<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:03.869> run<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.350> then

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
them spawn and they run in there then

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.810 
them spawn and they run in there then
your<00:02:04.649> chopper<00:02:04.860> gunner<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.219> worthless

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
your chopper gunner is worthless

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.639 
your chopper gunner is worthless
so<00:02:06.390> ac-130<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.020> definitely<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> better<00:02:07.439> option

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
so ac-130 is definitely a better option

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.589 
so ac-130 is definitely a better option
for<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.489> another<00:02:08.940> reason<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
for that and another reason I like the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.999 
for that and another reason I like the
ac-130<00:02:09.959> better<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> chopper

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
ac-130 better is because the chopper

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.710 
ac-130 better is because the chopper
gunner<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.520> ever<00:02:11.790> used<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.239> scrapyard

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
gunner if you ever used it on scrapyard

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.010 
gunner if you ever used it on scrapyard
you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.480 
you
that<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> chopper<00:02:13.590> gunner<00:02:13.800> takes<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.160> long

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
that the chopper gunner takes a long

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.880 
that the chopper gunner takes a long
time<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.820> get<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> map<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.590> ends<00:02:16.830> up

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
time to get to the map so it ends up

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.410 
time to get to the map so it ends up
that<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.100> don't<00:02:17.280> really<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.610> much<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.240> map

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
that you don't really do much on the map

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.850 
that you don't really do much on the map
because<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.930> chart<00:02:19.140> we're<00:02:19.230> gonna<00:02:19.320> start<00:02:19.650> from

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
because the chart we're gonna start from

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.430 
because the chart we're gonna start from
so<00:02:20.070> far<00:02:20.310> away<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:21.330> mean<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.930> don't<00:02:22.200> know<00:02:22.350> if

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
so far away I mean I don't know if

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.630 
so far away I mean I don't know if
you've<00:02:22.530> ever<00:02:22.680> used<00:02:22.740> one<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.220> if<00:02:23.490> you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
you've ever used one if you if you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.490 
you've ever used one if you if you
haven't<00:02:23.940> used<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.180> definitely<00:02:24.990> go<00:02:25.080> put<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.380> on
