vehicle<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:52.530> question<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.700> airplane

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
vehicle in question here is the airplane

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.200 
vehicle in question here is the airplane
that's<00:01:55.229> essentially<00:01:55.679> a<00:01:55.890> 400-ton<00:01:56.700> glass<00:01:56.910> I<00:01:57.060> can

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that's essentially a 400-ton glass I can

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.980 
that's essentially a 400-ton glass I can
fly<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.970> people<00:01:59.970> unsurprisingly<00:02:00.660> do<00:02:00.840> not

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
fly and people unsurprisingly do not

fly and people unsurprisingly do not
feel<00:02:01.200> safe<00:02:01.410> in<00:02:01.590> these<00:02:01.710> machines<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> everyone

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
feel safe in these machines so everyone

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660 
feel safe in these machines so everyone
security<00:02:04.289> is<00:02:04.410> go<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.830> extreme<00:02:05.190> lengths<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.580> try

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
security is go to extreme lengths to try

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.540 
security is go to extreme lengths to try

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
us from the plane itself true threat

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.660 
us from the plane itself true threat
they<00:02:31.470> tried<00:02:31.890> projected<00:02:32.310> from<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.490> other

they tried projected from the other
passengers<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:34.130> therefore<00:02:35.130> assume<00:02:35.400> that

everyone getting on board the plane is a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.280 
everyone getting on board the plane is a
mass<00:02:38.010> murdering<00:02:38.340> psychopath<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.510> they<00:02:42.780> open

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
mass murdering psychopath so they open

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.840 
mass murdering psychopath so they open
up<00:02:43.320> your<00:02:43.440> bags<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.040> little<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.460> can<00:02:44.640> take
