00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 To seal I use the box 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:11.340
 rent and the oxide hard it is almost 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.469
 version with the following four 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.780
 parts of it 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.289
 I 'm always an old spoon 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.430
 Part of it 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.260
 you have half an hour to get it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.080
 to process 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.340
 then the people will be hard on their needs 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.559
 always new brush many many bindl though 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.630
 It's tough once you're tough 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.170
 necessarily in a well-ventilated room 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.059
 do with a respirator or 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.950
 outside on the terrace never in 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.820
 a closed room of bad 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.770
 then ventilation is never without breath mask 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.300
 especially important gloves 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.980
 either these gloves or simply 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.180
 working gloves gardening gloves us 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.699
 even skin contact can cause bleeding 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.710
 lead or allergic reactions i 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.869
 so far had only redness if I have one 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.070
 hole in my man show had been careful 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.280
 a mug and not in the sun 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.090
 put the stuff will then 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.070
 indescribably means it has the cup 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.330
 forbidden 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.590
 within two minutes three minutes 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.759
 this has become hard and therefore 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.990
 steamed without end 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.990
 then I want to mix that stuff 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.360
 where you get the convincing her then think 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.219
 I later in the infobox you times 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.039
 carry on our shield 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:05.020
 I 'm still wearing goggles 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.020
 somehow possible now 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.800
 That's best now for six hours 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.570
 long dry and then it is 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.930
 cured then you can from the inside 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.930
 Beginning
