00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.559
 the boy is fine with you today I 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.920
 I will talk about the use of sneakers 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.440
 with casual looks is very com 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.350
 preconception did not have a prejudice of the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.410
 I wear sneakers with casual looks and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.880
 sometimes I even rejected that kind of look 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.939
 Of course it is the sneakers currently used 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 are sneakers are so sportive produced 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.860
 by sports brands but already comes with 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 casual touches are to be used 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.570
 especially for this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.570
 this mixture of sportive as casual is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.840
 see also clothes there we see artists 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.020
 celebrities and style icons is using 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.469
 already the mix of sports with the couple in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.629
 other parts and also taking this 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.739
 mix in shoes with more looks 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.190
 formal 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.050
 besides the couples also this mixture does not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 used only by artists but 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.090
 has also reflected on the catwalks that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 confirms this even more first than 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.189
 backpack is presented in summer in 2016 in 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.260
 milano in the last days 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.560
 the very evident mixture of the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.110
 with the couple and then the commitment 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.390
 of man with comfort then people are 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.490
 this silly prejudice of the use of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.670
 with the episode couples have 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.460
 fallen and the acceptance of the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.680
 of the man she used sports shoes 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.060
 with a more formal look at the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.750
 joão pimenta in são paulo fashion week 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.549
 2016, where is the time for 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.820
 You who do not know are master of 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.149
 tailor and he mixed there are the looks 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.060
 of tailoring him with casual shoes 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.399
 Of course you saw the photo of the backpack. 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.470
 while joão pepper there that exaggeration 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.140
 the walkway but now I will talk to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.600
 you on the day- to-day use that is 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.899
 It is very easy for you to take the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.759
 motto you use this trend of 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.740
 mixture of the mixture in the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.170
 from the top know that he wore a sweatshirt 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.270
 that I'll talk about in the next videos but 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.700
 the use of the cool shoes of you 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.650
 invest in the most classic shoes 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.500
 do you know that it sends 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.170
 those shoes from the 90's up to 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.659
 that has been recreated by the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.329
 brands like you do not know if you all 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.400
 You are in color and accompanied me in the middle of the 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.379
 personal clothing that alex clothing 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.310
 but nike has been ordering in recent months 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.400
 it's some snickers it 's like imax the mole 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.519
 who has that vintage touch feel 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.010
 I always wanted to have an imax and I received 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.140
 This is now the night staff and it has 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.500
 used in my visuals as you can 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.620
 see there I wear it with jeans is with 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.359
 a leather jacket is with a pair of pants 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.579
 ripped that I used last time with 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.950
 a pole and you can do this 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.680
 mix you can also use with the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.200
 jeans you can wear with a pair of pants 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.870
 a combination of jeans t-shirt and 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.599
 a denim jacket can waive the use 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.180
 of the shirt blazer jacket and opt 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.180
 just for a casual shirt a shirt 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.180
 also to get her into this 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.459
 mixing is very simple you use a text 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.069
 cool of all this is you leave the sneakers 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.500
 in evidence as key piece of visol 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.049
 As I said here in our last video 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.000
 the bent bar shows the footwear and is 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.139
 very cool you wear these shoes 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.299
 Welcome 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.209
 it is with this sporty touch an extract 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.269
 with the couple as a key piece give their 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.069
 are you going to just include the 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.489
 footwear on the visuals you wear 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.709
 currently you are not going to use the 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.060
 law to have a best man 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.459
 To go to the wedding unless you 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.609
 be invited not so much 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.879
 That's a strict rule, but I find it very cool. 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.370
 also mix a bit of a blazer 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.129
 little side of the upa would be with the side 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.139
 sports if you want more states 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.949
 inspirations to leave matter 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.530
 complementary 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.079
 there in our site related to tennis there 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.440
 that are fit for the race that are 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.970
 and I do not think it's so cool to 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.849
 this type of trend because they are 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.849
 for racing I think these 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:20.449
 that mix race with the couple but it is 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:22.400
 there harmonics with this type of visual 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.820
 casual or more formal than if you did not 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.940
 had 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.730
 the running shoes for a casual look 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.400
 will not get a very harmonious thing 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.530
 not even the pieces will not talk and 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.660
 The cool of the style is you do one thing 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.450
 that you feel at ease 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.600
 Of course, having those people who 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.540
 shocked by the use of sports shoes 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.760
 with a more casual or visual look 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.530
 formal but this will soon be over 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.480
 because you can see there that great 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.910
 national and international brands that 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.850
 influences study the man before 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.460
 take him to the catwalk is proposed 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.470
 this and this is also well reflected there 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.440
 because you can see there like chris 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.660
 brown geisy 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.990
 style icons that have nothing to do with 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.150
 something I disagree has put another 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.460
 in the midst of these productions that 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.350

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.150
