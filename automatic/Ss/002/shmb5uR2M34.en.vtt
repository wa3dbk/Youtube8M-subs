 all have leukemia or rhinotracheitis and 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.710
 I have other cats that are like I say 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.490
 those who are sick have 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.430
 pancreatic renal failure I have 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.220
 others that have calculations and you have to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.560
 be probing them or you have to be 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.190
 giving special medicine your food 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.190
 hills 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.600
 since I have cats really my 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.820
 life fluctuates between my work 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.180
 the cats clean them inject them 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 take care of them down doing the tasks with my

 children because I have a teenage son 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.790
 preuniversity and two children in the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.790
 school 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.130
 because in the time I was living 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.090
 forgiveness to the Augustinian to the merchants to 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.690
 those cats were throwing them bleach or boiling 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.160
 or be really young dying a 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.270
 animal and it's like they see what I know 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.760
 trash 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.000
 no, they do not think that the 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.770
 animal feels suffers has cold pain 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.770
 hungry just like us 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.920
 do not 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.689
