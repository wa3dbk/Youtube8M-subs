I began shopping for a new later to
replace<00:00:17.230> useful<00:00:17.980> check<00:00:18.220> that<00:00:18.490> I<00:00:18.520> had<00:00:18.699> about<00:00:18.820> a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
replace useful check that I had about a

replace useful check that I had about a
year<00:00:19.210> ago<00:00:19.360> had<00:00:20.289> the<00:00:20.410> opportunity<00:00:21.039> to<00:00:21.100> try

year ago had the opportunity to try

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.029 
year ago had the opportunity to try
several<00:00:21.640> different<00:00:21.789> devices<00:00:22.410> when<00:00:23.410> I<00:00:23.740> looked

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
several different devices when I looked

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.400 
several different devices when I looked
at<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.760> spectra<00:00:25.180> peoria<00:00:25.779> became<00:00:26.109> quite

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
at the spectra peoria became quite

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.340 
at the spectra peoria became quite
impressed<00:00:26.859> with<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.910> power<00:00:28.539> supply<00:00:29.080> which<00:00:29.320> is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
impressed with the power supply which is

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.980 
impressed with the power supply which is
550<00:00:30.310> watts<00:00:30.520> this<00:00:30.910> allows<00:00:31.269> us<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.570> really

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
550 watts this allows us to really

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.260 
550 watts this allows us to really
provide<00:00:32.439> more<00:00:32.680> photoacoustic<00:00:33.250> energy<00:00:33.880> to<00:00:34.149> the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
provide more photoacoustic energy to the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.389 
provide more photoacoustic energy to the
tech<00:00:34.480> chip<00:00:34.750> with<00:00:35.079> its<00:00:35.290> very<00:00:35.739> short<00:00:35.829> pulse

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
tech chip with its very short pulse

tech chip with its very short pulse
width<00:00:36.700> I<00:00:36.940> found<00:00:37.480> this<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:37.809> be<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:38.050> most

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
width I found this to be the most

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.709 
width I found this to be the most
effective<00:00:38.860> laser<00:00:39.280> available<00:00:40.030> in<00:00:40.210> terms<00:00:40.480> of

treatment tell me a little bit about you
how<00:00:46.300> long<00:00:46.450> you've<00:00:46.660> had<00:00:46.899> it<00:00:47.170> if<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:47.860> recall

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
maybe what type of ink it was and did

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.950 
maybe what type of ink it was and did
you<00:00:52.540> end<00:00:52.750> up<00:00:52.870> putting<00:00:53.170> this<00:00:53.350> on<00:00:53.559> yourself<00:00:54.010> yes

we're<00:01:05.470> gonna<00:01:05.590> do<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:06.100> we're<00:01:06.370> gonna<00:01:06.460> use<00:01:06.670> a

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
we're gonna do is we're gonna use a

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.969 
we're gonna do is we're gonna use a
laser<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:08.260> we're<00:01:08.409> going<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.560> turn<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.830> power

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
laser and we're going to turn the power

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.830 
laser and we're going to turn the power
down<00:01:09.280> just<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.790> little<00:01:10.030> bit<00:01:10.180> because<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.659> are<00:01:10.810> a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
down just a little bit because you are a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.540 
down just a little bit because you are a
dark<00:01:11.170> color<00:01:11.440> but<00:01:11.979> we<00:01:12.070> should<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.340> able<00:01:12.490> to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
dark color but we should be able to

00:01:12.550 --> 00:02:03.140 
dark color but we should be able to
treat<00:01:12.760> this<00:01:12.970> without<00:01:13.300> any<00:01:13.540> real<00:01:13.750> concern<00:01:14.170> okay
