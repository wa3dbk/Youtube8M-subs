to turn the Wi-Fi off so now you'll see
that<00:05:28.240> 3G<00:05:28.870> pop<00:05:29.110> up<00:05:29.320> there<00:05:29.670> let's<00:05:30.670> get<00:05:30.970> it<00:05:31.090> to

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
that 3G pop up there let's get it to

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:38.880 
that 3G pop up there let's get it to
focus<00:05:31.690> here<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:34.300> Wi-Fi<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:34.720> off<00:05:37.890> and

let's go back here and we'll go to

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:51.620 
let's go back here and we'll go to
Google<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:48.630> there<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:49.960> data<00:05:50.170> is<00:05:50.440> working

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
Google and there the data is working

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.930 
Google and there the data is working
I'll<00:05:52.630> just<00:05:52.840> double<00:05:53.290> check<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:53.860> there<00:05:54.640> it<00:05:54.790> is
