so<00:02:13.430> let's<00:02:13.670> try<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.000> one<00:02:14.090> out<00:02:14.420> now<00:02:14.689> shall<00:02:14.989> we

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
so let's try this one out now shall we

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.600 
so let's try this one out now shall we
so<00:02:17.360> that's<00:02:17.870> how<00:02:18.110> easy<00:02:18.140> put<00:02:18.739> them<00:02:18.860> on<00:02:19.010> Geo<00:02:19.310> later

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
so that's how easy put them on Geo later

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.410 
so that's how easy put them on Geo later
so<00:02:20.450> now<00:02:20.750> we<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:21.019> just<00:02:21.049> put<00:02:21.379> it<00:02:21.470> in<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:22.189> or<00:02:22.610> put

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
so now we can just put it in to or put

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.890 
so now we can just put it in to or put
it<00:02:23.569> on<00:02:23.750> my<00:02:24.019> samsung<00:02:24.920> galaxy<00:02:25.310> s4<00:02:27.220> there<00:02:28.220> we<00:02:28.370> go

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
it on my samsung galaxy s4 there we go

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.210 
it on my samsung galaxy s4 there we go
so<00:02:29.900> very<00:02:30.560> very<00:02:30.680> easy<00:02:30.799> to<00:02:31.280> install<00:02:31.310> here<00:02:33.220> you

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
so very very easy to install here you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.699 
so very very easy to install here you
see<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.849> how<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.120> looks<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:35.720> when<00:02:36.140> you

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
see this is how it looks like when you

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.330 
see this is how it looks like when you
put<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.959> let's<00:02:38.959> try<00:02:39.290> out<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.799> built-in

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
put it on let's try out the built-in

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.449 
put it on let's try out the built-in
stand<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.870> as<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.079> can<00:02:45.140> see<00:02:45.200> infinite<00:02:45.980> like<00:02:46.430> a

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
stand so as you can see infinite like a

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.580 
stand so as you can see infinite like a
stand<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.090> now<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:48.230> have<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:48.470> be

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
stand like that now you have to be

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.039 
stand like that now you have to be
careful<00:02:49.040> when<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.549> have<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.790> out<00:02:50.049> especially

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
careful when you have it out especially

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.690 
careful when you have it out especially
mostly<00:02:51.530> good<00:02:51.709> for<00:02:51.980> watching<00:02:52.310> movies<00:02:52.670> I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
mostly good for watching movies I

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.640 
mostly good for watching movies I
suppose<00:02:53.120> because<00:02:53.450> then<00:02:53.659> you<00:02:53.780> won't<00:02:53.930> moved

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
suppose because then you won't moved

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.979 
suppose because then you won't moved
advise<00:02:55.629> it<00:02:56.629> will<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.290> stand<00:02:57.560> there<00:02:57.909> but

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
advise it will you stand there but

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.050 
advise it will you stand there but
probably<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.109> little<00:03:00.440> bit<00:03:00.620> hard<00:03:00.950> if<00:03:01.159> you<00:03:01.489> will

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
probably a little bit hard if you will

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.520 
probably a little bit hard if you will
do<00:03:02.269> some<00:03:02.540> web<00:03:02.930> browsing<00:03:04.090> as<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.209> can<00:03:05.329> see<00:03:05.540> but

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
do some web browsing as you can see but

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.440 
do some web browsing as you can see but
watching<00:03:06.950> movies<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.519> would<00:03:07.730> say<00:03:07.909> that<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.269> is

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
watching movies I would say that this is

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.750 
watching movies I would say that this is
a<00:03:08.480> nice<00:03:08.780> stand<00:03:09.200> or<00:03:09.470> when<00:03:10.129> you<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.340> reading<00:03:10.700> a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
a nice stand or when you is reading a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.009 
a nice stand or when you is reading a
lot<00:03:10.909> and<00:03:11.239> if<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.510> are<00:03:11.900> careful<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.150> we<00:03:14.840> can

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
lot and if you are careful so we can

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.830 
lot and if you are careful so we can
also<00:03:15.139> see<00:03:15.409> here<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:16.040> need<00:03:16.159> to<00:03:16.340> put<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.670> on

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
also see here that you need to put it on

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.920 
also see here that you need to put it on
fully<00:03:17.840> here<00:03:18.230> on<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.739> sides<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.699> you<00:03:20.690> can<00:03:20.810> also

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
fully here on the sides and you can also

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.800 
fully here on the sides and you can also
see<00:03:21.169> that<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.620> protects<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.449> front

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
see that it protects and the the front

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.659 
see that it protects and the the front
side<00:03:24.109> because<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.829> sticks<00:03:25.099> out<00:03:25.250> here<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.549> little

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
side because it sticks out here a little

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.110 
side because it sticks out here a little
bit<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.239> when<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.230> put<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.680> down<00:03:28.430> on<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.849> table

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
bit so when you put it down on the table

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.789 
bit so when you put it down on the table
and<00:03:30.099> your<00:03:31.099> screen<00:03:31.669> is<00:03:31.940> protected<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.810> this

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
and your screen is protected and this

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.309 
and your screen is protected and this
hard<00:03:34.069> case<00:03:34.280> material<00:03:34.849> of<00:03:35.000> course<00:03:35.359> will<00:03:36.019> also

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
hard case material of course will also

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.750 
hard case material of course will also
protect<00:03:36.620> your<00:03:36.980> device<00:03:37.250> pretty<00:03:37.609> good<00:03:38.379> so<00:03:39.760> when

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
protect your device pretty good so when

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.689 
protect your device pretty good so when
you<00:03:40.819> put<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.090> down<00:03:41.209> like<00:03:41.269> this<00:03:41.629> or<00:03:42.430> throw<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.459> a

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
you put it down like this or throw it a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.539 
you put it down like this or throw it a
little<00:03:43.730> bit<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.449> will<00:03:45.139> probably<00:03:45.889> work<00:03:46.489> pretty

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
little bit it will probably work pretty

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.689 
little bit it will probably work pretty
good<00:03:47.180> also<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.260> buttons<00:03:48.799> you<00:03:49.099> have<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.519> push

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
good also the buttons you have to push

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.089 
good also the buttons you have to push
it<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.819> little<00:03:49.849> bit<00:03:50.030> harder<00:03:50.540> than<00:03:50.780> usually<00:03:51.709> then

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
it a little bit harder than usually then

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.659 
it a little bit harder than usually then
what<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.549> usually<00:03:52.730> have<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.150> do<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:55.489> can

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
what you usually have to do and you can

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:01.229 
what you usually have to do and you can
steal<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:56.780> can't<00:03:57.049> still<00:03:57.260> use<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.650> buttons

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.009 

but<00:04:02.239> you<00:04:02.299> have<00:04:02.449> to<00:04:02.510> push<00:04:02.659> it<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.810> little<00:04:02.840> bit

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
but you have to push it a little bit

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.710 
but you have to push it a little bit
harder<00:04:03.440> here<00:04:04.030> I'm<00:04:05.030> not<00:04:05.209> sure<00:04:05.299> if<00:04:05.419> it<00:04:05.510> needs<00:04:05.659> a

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
harder here I'm not sure if it needs a

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.349 
harder here I'm not sure if it needs a
screen<00:04:06.019> protector<00:04:06.169> either<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:07.060> because<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
screen protector either and because it

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.689 
screen protector either and because it
does<00:04:08.629> takes<00:04:08.900> out<00:04:09.049> tool<00:04:09.229> here<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.500> little<00:04:09.829> bit<00:04:09.979> on

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
does takes out tool here a little bit on

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.520 
does takes out tool here a little bit on
the<00:04:10.909> sides

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
the sides

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.899 
the sides
but<00:04:13.069> I<00:04:13.840> like<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.989> feature<00:04:15.459> with<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.549> building

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
but I like the feature with the building

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.580 
but I like the feature with the building
stand<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.359> think<00:04:17.539> that's<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.930> it's<00:04:18.409> like<00:04:18.560> a

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590
