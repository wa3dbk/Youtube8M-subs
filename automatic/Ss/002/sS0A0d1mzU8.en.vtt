00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.080 
explaining how to make a 3d bun for this
I<00:00:09.960> used<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.500> solid<00:00:10.769> acrylic<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.670> has<00:00:11.849> no

two large beads observe that our bow
protruding<00:00:23.430> much<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> nail<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.609> need<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
protruding much of the nail so we need a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.069 
protruding much of the nail so we need a
fair<00:00:30.269> amount<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.779> acrylic<00:00:32.059> now<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.719> let's
