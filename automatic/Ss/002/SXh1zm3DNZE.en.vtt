part<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.540> think<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
part right here just because I think it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.990 
part right here just because I think it
looks<00:01:09.840> better<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.610> sick<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.880> that

out<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.570> thought<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:58.020> kind<00:01:58.259> of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
out but I just thought it was kind of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
out but I just thought it was kind of
good<00:01:58.500> idea<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.250> really<00:01:59.430> bad<00:01:59.579> laugh

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
good idea because I get really bad laugh

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.100 
good idea because I get really bad laugh
lines<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.170> then<00:02:01.290> sometimes

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
lines right here and then sometimes

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.230 
lines right here and then sometimes
maybe<00:02:02.830> like<00:02:03.070> right<00:02:03.280> now<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.549> get<00:02:03.940> a<00:02:03.970> little<00:02:04.119> bit

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
maybe like right now I get a little bit

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.279 
maybe like right now I get a little bit
oily<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:04.810> can<00:02:04.960> just<00:02:05.110> touch<00:02:05.350> up<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.020> is

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
oily so I can just touch up so this is

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.469 
oily so I can just touch up so this is
the<00:02:08.560> Urban<00:02:08.920> Decay<00:02:09.009> Naked<00:02:09.280> skin

ultra definition foundation powder so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.210 
ultra definition foundation powder so
this<00:02:13.300> isn't<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.540> shade<00:02:13.750> medium<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.010> then<00:02:15.190> I

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
this isn't a shade medium and then I

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.800 
this isn't a shade medium and then I
have<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:15.760> little<00:02:15.970> stippling<00:02:16.450> brush<00:02:16.569> right

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
here because it's kind of like a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.199 
here because it's kind of like a
multi-purpose<00:02:18.220> brushing<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.060> just

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
multi-purpose brushing you just

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.550 
multi-purpose brushing you just
basically<00:02:19.600> do<00:02:19.780> whatever<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.140> want<00:02:20.290> with<00:02:20.410> it
