evangelist<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.559> autodesk<00:00:14.280> manufacturing<00:00:15.320> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
evangelist for autodesk manufacturing so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.439 
evangelist for autodesk manufacturing so
first<00:00:16.529> off<00:00:16.740> i'm<00:00:17.670> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.940> create<00:00:18.150> some

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
first off i'm going to create some

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.380 
first off i'm going to create some
highly<00:00:18.900> complex<00:00:19.350> geometry<00:00:20.039> here<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:21.090> really

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
highly complex geometry here not really

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.790 
highly complex geometry here not really
so<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> coffee<00:00:21.869> cup<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.320> I'd<00:00:22.410> sitting<00:00:22.710> on

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
so it's a coffee cup that I'd sitting on

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
so it's a coffee cup that I'd sitting on
my<00:00:22.890> desk<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:24.029> what<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> did<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.080> they

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
my desk but what I did there was they

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.750 
my desk but what I did there was they
did<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> revolve<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> take<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
did a revolve now I'm going to take a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.390 
did a revolve now I'm going to take a
same<00:00:27.539> geometry<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> force

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
same geometry but I'm going to force

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.569 
same geometry but I'm going to force
myself<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.210> use<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> different<00:00:30.960> set<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> tools

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
myself to use a different set of tools

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.479 
myself to use a different set of tools
to<00:00:32.579> create<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.940> desired<00:00:33.360> result<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.070> I'm

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to create a desired result so here I'm

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.810 
to create a desired result so here I'm
just<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.850> grab<00:00:36.030> radial<00:00:37.020> dimension<00:00:37.820> same

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
just going to grab radial dimension same

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.130 
just going to grab radial dimension same
base<00:00:39.059> diameter<00:00:39.300> radius<00:00:40.290> if<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.920> will<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
base diameter radius if you will and

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.299 
base diameter radius if you will and
this<00:00:43.140> time<00:00:43.320> i<00:00:43.379> would<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.620> extrude<00:00:44.100> rather

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
this time i would use extrude rather

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.920 
this time i would use extrude rather
than<00:00:44.520> revolve<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.239> order<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.420> me<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> be

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
than revolve but in order for me to be

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.840 
than revolve but in order for me to be
able<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.950> taper<00:00:47.219> angle<00:00:47.489> i

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
able to get that that that taper angle i

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.260 
able to get that that that taper angle i
have<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.660> go<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> find<00:00:49.460> where<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> grab<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
have to go and find where to grab and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.860 
have to go and find where to grab and
create<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> taper<00:00:52.469> during<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> extrude<00:00:53.870> fill

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
create a taper during the extrude fill

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.500 
create a taper during the extrude fill
it<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.260> she'll<00:00:55.770> i<00:00:56.629> get<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.079> same<00:00:58.260> result<00:00:59.510> now

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it and she'll i get the same result now

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.490 
it and she'll i get the same result now
i'm<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.980> different<00:01:02.039> set<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> tool

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
i'm going to use a different set of tool

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.870 
i'm going to use a different set of tool
again<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.949> create<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.850> same<00:01:06.500> coffee<00:01:07.500> mug<00:01:07.880> now

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
again to create the same coffee mug now

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
again to create the same coffee mug now
the<00:01:08.939> point<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:09.900> guys<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.650> so

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the point of this really guys is is so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.100 
the point of this really guys is is so
that<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> force<00:01:11.760> yourself<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.299> learn<00:01:12.689> new

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that you force yourself to learn new

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.050 
that you force yourself to learn new
commands<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.830> five<00:01:14.070> minutes<00:01:14.310> you

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
commands if you have five minutes you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.429 
commands if you have five minutes you
know<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.390> sit<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.720> take<00:01:15.990> something<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
know just sit down take something you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.770 
know just sit down take something you
have<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.710> your<00:01:16.799> desk<00:01:17.100> i<00:01:17.420> happen<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.659> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
have on your desk i happen to be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.390 
have on your desk i happen to be
drinking<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> cup<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> coffee<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.130> time

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
drinking a cup of coffee at the time

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.820 
drinking a cup of coffee at the time
that<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.700> recording<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.680> thought

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that i was recording this and I thought

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890 
that i was recording this and I thought
well<00:01:23.070> people<00:01:23.880> ask<00:01:24.060> me<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> time<00:01:24.479> how<00:01:24.840> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
well people ask me all the time how do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.390 
well people ask me all the time how do
you<00:01:25.049> how<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> learn<00:01:25.799> some<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> new

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you how do you learn some of the new

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.200 
you how do you learn some of the new
features<00:01:27.000> within<00:01:28.100> inventor<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> I've<00:01:29.939> always

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
features within inventor and I've always

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
features within inventor and I've always
told<00:01:30.450> people<00:01:30.720> when<00:01:31.320> you're<00:01:31.409> learning<00:01:31.619> 3d

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
told people when you're learning 3d

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.109 
told people when you're learning 3d
applications<00:01:33.979> take<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.369> same<00:01:35.670> piece<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
applications take the same piece of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.539 
applications take the same piece of
geometry<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.840> try<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> figure<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.920> every

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
geometry and try to figure out every

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.789 
geometry and try to figure out every
single<00:01:38.729> way<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.420> model<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
single way that you can model it and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.170 
single way that you can model it and
that<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.460> focus<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that way what you can focus on is the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.670 
that way what you can focus on is the
different<00:01:42.540> modeling<00:01:42.899> techniques<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.500> then

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
different modeling techniques and then

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.889 
different modeling techniques and then
over<00:01:44.430> time<00:01:44.670> you'll<00:01:45.119> figure<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.479> where<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
over time you'll figure out where to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.950 
over time you'll figure out where to
deploy<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:47.149> loft<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:49.460> sweep<00:01:50.460> sweep<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> rail

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
deploy a loft a sweep sweep of the rail

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.950 
deploy a loft a sweep sweep of the rail
and<00:01:52.350> extrusion<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.159> revolution<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.840> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and extrusion of revolution and it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
and extrusion of revolution and it
really<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.560> depends<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.189> your<00:01:56.310> desired<00:01:56.670> result

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
really it depends on your desired result

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.889 
really it depends on your desired result
so<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:58.159> I'm<00:01:59.159> able<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.549> achieve<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.180> design<00:02:00.719> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
so here I'm able to achieve a design of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.319 
so here I'm able to achieve a design of
a<00:02:00.960> coffee<00:02:01.200> mug<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:02.909> been

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
a coffee mug that I would not have been

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.410 
a coffee mug that I would not have been
able<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.600> achieve<00:02:03.810> had<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.430> simply<00:02:05.430> done<00:02:05.670> an

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
able to achieve had I simply done an

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.619 
able to achieve had I simply done an
extrusion<00:02:06.899> or<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.710> revolve<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.179> I'll<00:02:09.330> loft

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
extrusion or a revolve so here I'll loft

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.710 
extrusion or a revolve so here I'll loft
between<00:02:10.140> those<00:02:10.289> two<00:02:10.500> offset<00:02:11.160> profiles<00:02:12.120> but

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
between those two offset profiles but

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.900 
between those two offset profiles but
I'm<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.020> use<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.200> supply

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
I'm going to use that supply

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.630 
I'm going to use that supply
is<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.120> rail<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.440> again<00:02:15.740> by<00:02:15.950> forcing<00:02:16.520> yourself

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
is a rail so again by forcing yourself

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.350 
is a rail so again by forcing yourself
to<00:02:17.060> use<00:02:17.830> some<00:02:18.830> things<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.400> may<00:02:19.730> not<00:02:19.970> have

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
to use some things that you may not have

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.100 
to use some things that you may not have
kind<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.700> reached<00:02:22.700> into<00:02:23.300> if<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.020> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
kind of reached into if you and the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.870 
kind of reached into if you and the
other<00:02:24.320> bag<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.710> tricks<00:02:25.010> within<00:02:25.400> your<00:02:25.550> within

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
other bag of tricks within your within

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.000 
other bag of tricks within your within
your<00:02:26.030> inventor<00:02:26.360> toolbar<00:02:26.750> here<00:02:26.960> you<00:02:27.800> may<00:02:27.980> not

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
your inventor toolbar here you may not

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.980 
your inventor toolbar here you may not
be<00:02:28.400> able<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.760> achieve<00:02:28.880> your<00:02:29.180> desired<00:02:29.480> result

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990

so<00:02:30.290> again<00:02:31.100> with<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.820> spline<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.210> get<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.480> little

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
so again with this spline I get a little

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.350 
so again with this spline I get a little
bit<00:02:32.810> more<00:02:32.960> control<00:02:33.760> swing<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.910> over<00:02:35.120> just<00:02:35.270> a
