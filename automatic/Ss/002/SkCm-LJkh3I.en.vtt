00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.549
 defa and the criticism is on more 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.290
 trailer shows and indeed to a film 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.790
 place but a main role 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.410
 viggo mortensen always stands for one 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.330
 certain quality because he is one of the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.340
 method actor so he comes with a movie 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.929
 therefore offers hardly anyone knows 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 but if you look a blatant 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.310
 can enchant with their special 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.660
 kind and with their brute hardness and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.340
 that's often small 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.470
 discoveries and with that we throw one 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.470
 everyone has a plan 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.110
 I have to go back to work 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.110
 time has come 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.770

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.720

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.560

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.030
 it jumps out at something 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.180
 maybe it's better on the island 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.260
 there are no questions very much 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.260
 discreet 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.869
 rome said you do not drink crooked 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.869

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:40.520
 hello we can learn from the bees 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.770
 in them stock, each as their task 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.670
 from birth to death 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.670

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.920

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.659

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.989

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.790
 23 may 2013 in German cinemas and 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.830
 viggo mortensen first played 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.030
 man named augustin actually one 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.739
 Pediatrician is with one 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.510
 everything could work that way 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.430
 be nice and good as bored and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.379
 annoyed by his life as one day 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.209
 his twin brother Lars pegelow ago 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.040
 the door has lung cancer 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.569
 He decides to kill himself 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.950
 to leave his identity behind 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.930
 and his twin brother 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.879
 to accept and have a common place 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.440
 to return where she once grew up 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.819
 there he finds out in the net 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.790
 crime from being his brother 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.560
 actually entangled is a murder and 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.730
 many many new problems so he 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.769
 probably be in it again 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.690
 wish old life back with it 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.459
 this movie in an argentinean world 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.560
 full of crime very very exciting 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.390
 be shot in original in spanish 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.069

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.690
 I'm interested in where that goes 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.030
 only knows that viggo mortensen often 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.040
 simply for good movies is unfortunately 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.420
 far too rarely seen are what do you say 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.099
 I am interested in this trailer 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.750
 In any case, it likes to write in 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.700
 the comments that was my little one 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.130
 outlook on everyone has a plan more 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.690
 Unfortunately, the century fox still had infos 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.220
 not published at this point 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.169
 But anyway, I want you to 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.120
 call attention to it tomorrow 15 o'clock 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.530

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.359
