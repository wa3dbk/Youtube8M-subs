too<00:01:45.600> far<00:01:45.810> away<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:47.009> sure<00:01:47.189> about<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
too far away so I'm not sure about the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.310 
too far away so I'm not sure about the
balancing<00:01:47.939> issues<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.540> we'll<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.079> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
balancing issues in this we'll have to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.249 
balancing issues in this we'll have to
see<00:01:49.500> about<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:51.270> next<00:01:51.509> feature<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.049> new

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
see about that the next feature is a new

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.889 
see about that the next feature is a new
map<00:01:52.470> called<00:01:52.829> racing<00:01:53.340> Akina<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> race

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
map called racing Akina it's the race

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
map called racing Akina it's the race
against<00:01:55.290> time<00:01:55.350> against<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:55.979> buddies<00:01:56.250> or<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
against time against your buddies or you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.450 
against time against your buddies or you
can<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.820> single<00:01:57.180> player<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.469> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
can do in single player and and you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.380 
can do in single player and and you
basically<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> go<00:02:00.149> through<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
basically have to go through this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.870 
basically have to go through this
assault<00:02:00.780> course<00:02:01.020> style<00:02:01.350> racing<00:02:01.829> map<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.280> get

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
assault course style racing map and get

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
assault course style racing map and get
to<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> end<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.329> fast<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.600> possible<00:02:03.710> my<00:02:04.710> best

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
to the end as fast as possible my best

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.789 
to the end as fast as possible my best
time<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.000> ninety<00:02:06.689> five<00:02:06.899> point<00:02:07.380> six

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
time in this is ninety five point six

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.369 
time in this is ninety five point six
eight<00:02:08.009> seconds<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:09.200> that's<00:02:10.200> at<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
eight seconds I think that's at the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.979 
eight seconds I think that's at the
current<00:02:10.679> time<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.190> haven't<00:02:12.150> seen<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> faster

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
current time I haven't seen a faster

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.640 
current time I haven't seen a faster
time<00:02:13.170> by

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
time by

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.670 
time by
released<00:02:14.129> by<00:02:14.280> anyone<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.599> think<00:02:16.470> I've<00:02:16.620> got

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
released by anyone so I think I've got

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.490 
released by anyone so I think I've got
the<00:02:17.040> best<00:02:17.420> known<00:02:18.420> anyway<00:02:18.989> i'm<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.319> i'm<00:02:19.470> not

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
the best known anyway i'm not i'm not

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.869 
the best known anyway i'm not i'm not
sure<00:02:19.739> about<00:02:19.799> that<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.670> time

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
sure about that and this is the time

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.690 
sure about that and this is the time
it's<00:02:21.329> been<00:02:21.540> released<00:02:21.900> pretty<00:02:22.170> soon<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.280> who

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
it's been released pretty soon so who

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.670 
it's been released pretty soon so who
knows<00:02:23.939> who's<00:02:24.659> you<00:02:24.989> know<00:02:25.110> who<00:02:25.260> knows<00:02:25.439> how<00:02:25.620> long

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
knows who's you know who knows how long

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.319 
knows who's you know who knows how long
it<00:02:25.890> will<00:02:25.950> take<00:02:26.010> before<00:02:26.159> someone<00:02:26.549> beats<00:02:26.579> me<00:02:26.909> but

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
it will take before someone beats me but

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.130 
it will take before someone beats me but
it's<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:27.540> fun<00:02:27.900> map<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.909> i<00:02:29.909> would<00:02:30.510> recommend

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
it's a very fun map I i would recommend

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.569 
it's a very fun map I i would recommend
that<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.319> turned<00:02:31.530> down<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.920> quality<00:02:32.370> for<00:02:32.549> the

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
that you turned down the quality for the

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.849 
that you turned down the quality for the
map<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:33.150> because<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.450> lag<00:02:33.750> issues<00:02:34.170> i<00:02:34.379> actually

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
map not because of lag issues i actually

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.759 
map not because of lag issues i actually
get<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.159> 800<00:02:35.609> FPS<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.209> map<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:37.049> because

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
get like 800 FPS on the map but because

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.160 
get like 800 FPS on the map but because
of<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:38.849> depth<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.180> field<00:02:39.480> messes<00:02:39.900> with<00:02:40.049> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
of the depth of field messes with the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.020 
of the depth of field messes with the
walls<00:02:40.530> or<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.829> old<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.340> all<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.640> walls<00:02:41.849> are

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
walls or the old that all the walls are

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.819 
walls or the old that all the walls are
really<00:02:42.209> blurry<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.349> kind<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.560> hard<00:02:43.769> to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
really blurry and it's kind of hard to

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.250 
really blurry and it's kind of hard to
see<00:02:44.159> properly<00:02:44.750> everything's<00:02:45.750> everything's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
see properly everything's everything's

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.780 
see properly everything's everything's
really<00:02:46.470> blurry<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.980> depth<00:02:47.159> of<00:02:47.280> field<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.579> kind

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
really blurry the depth of field is kind

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.250 
really blurry the depth of field is kind
of<00:02:47.879> off<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:49.609> so<00:02:50.609> yeah<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.659> map<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:51.870> really

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
of off and so yeah that map is really

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.949 
of off and so yeah that map is really
cool<00:02:52.409> I'm<00:02:52.680> playing<00:02:53.159> it<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.400> lot<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.000> yeah

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
cool I'm playing it a lot and yeah

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.509 
cool I'm playing it a lot and yeah
that's<00:02:55.440> fair<00:02:55.590> pretty<00:02:55.769> much<00:02:55.829> there's<00:02:56.190> also<00:02:56.310> an

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
that's fair pretty much there's also an

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.300 
that's fair pretty much there's also an
exploit<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.269> which<00:02:58.139> if<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.920> check<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.129> video

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
exploit and which if you check the video

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.280 
exploit and which if you check the video
in<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.700> on<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.659> annotation<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.230> screen

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
in the on the annotation on the screen

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.050 
in the on the annotation on the screen
right<00:03:01.470> now<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:02.010> should<00:03:02.430> take<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:02.849> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
right now it should take you to the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.289 
right now it should take you to the
export<00:03:03.959> video<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.349> I<00:03:04.379> released<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:06.030> that

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
export video that I released and it that

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.940 
export video that I released and it that
should<00:03:06.480> be<00:03:06.569> fixed<00:03:06.780> pretty<00:03:07.109> soon<00:03:07.379> it's<00:03:07.590> really

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
should be fixed pretty soon it's really

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.890 
should be fixed pretty soon it's really
really<00:03:08.220> easy<00:03:08.250> fix<00:03:08.819> basically<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.599> can<00:03:09.750> just

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
really easy fix basically you can just

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.149 
really easy fix basically you can just
get<00:03:10.019> out<00:03:10.109> them<00:03:10.230> up<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.560> finish<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.010> map

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
get out them up and finish the map

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.729 
get out them up and finish the map
within<00:03:11.519> 30<00:03:11.909> seconds<00:03:12.359> and<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.989> kind<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.379> ruins

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
within 30 seconds and it kind of ruins

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.619 
within 30 seconds and it kind of ruins
it<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.519> not<00:03:14.730> many<00:03:14.849> people<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:15.150> how<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.299> do<00:03:15.480> it

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
it but not many people know how to do it

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.140 
it but not many people know how to do it
and<00:03:16.159> and<00:03:17.159> even<00:03:17.430> then<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.609> know<00:03:17.849> I<00:03:17.879> could

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
and and even then you know I could

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.369 
and and even then you know I could
probably<00:03:18.180> still<00:03:18.569> boot<00:03:18.720> into<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.989> end<00:03:19.139> if<00:03:19.260> they

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
probably still boot into the end if they

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:29.140 
probably still boot into the end if they
did<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:20.359> but<00:03:21.359> then

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.170 

a<00:03:29.290> two<00:03:30.290> more<00:03:30.500> maps<00:03:30.709> have<00:03:30.950> been<00:03:31.099> well<00:03:31.579> readded

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
a two more maps have been well readded

into the game by going on full screen

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.790 
into the game by going on full screen
mode<00:05:20.150> by<00:05:20.300> pressing<00:05:20.330> backspace<00:05:20.900> while<00:05:21.500> in<00:05:21.680> the

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
game we will to see it on the right side

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.450 
game we will to see it on the right side
of<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.750> screen<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:24.289> think<00:05:24.680> it's<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:24.860> glitch<00:05:25.159> that

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
of the screen I think it's a glitch that

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.520 
of the screen I think it's a glitch that
when<00:05:26.000> i'm<00:05:26.090> pretty<00:05:26.180> sure<00:05:26.449> that<00:05:27.020> you<00:05:27.080> can't<00:05:27.289> see

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
when i'm pretty sure that you can't see

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.560 
when i'm pretty sure that you can't see
unless<00:05:27.830> you're<00:05:28.010> in<00:05:28.099> full<00:05:28.280> screen<00:05:28.460> mode

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
unless you're in full screen mode

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.719 
unless you're in full screen mode
basically<00:05:29.570> when<00:05:30.349> you<00:05:30.380> get<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:31.039> tat<00:05:31.400> when<00:05:31.580> you

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
basically when you get a tat when you

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.850 
basically when you get a tat when you
get<00:05:32.000> a<00:05:32.210> hit<00:05:32.780> depending<00:05:33.349> on<00:05:33.349> how<00:05:33.530> much<00:05:33.680> damage

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
get a hit depending on how much damage

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.149 
get a hit depending on how much damage
you<00:05:34.070> do<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.669> pumps<00:05:35.479> up<00:05:35.659> your<00:05:35.960> combo<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:36.860> a

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
you do it pumps up your combo to a

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.250 
you do it pumps up your combo to a
certain<00:05:37.639> level<00:05:37.789> whether<00:05:38.210> it<00:05:38.539> starts<00:05:38.960> at<00:05:39.110> like

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
certain level whether it starts at like

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.640 
certain level whether it starts at like
d

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
d

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.340 
d
and<00:05:40.979> then<00:05:41.460> it<00:05:41.580> goes<00:05:41.729> up<00:05:41.759> to<00:05:42.180> Triple<00:05:42.840> S<00:05:42.990> or<00:05:43.229> some

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
and then it goes up to Triple S or some

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.700 
and then it goes up to Triple S or some
plot<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:44.790> basically<00:05:45.330> I<00:05:45.780> think<00:05:46.290> it's<00:05:46.380> SS

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
plot and and basically I think it's SS

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.890 
plot and and basically I think it's SS
actually<00:05:47.070> basically<00:05:47.669> yeah<00:05:48.030> that<00:05:48.509> is<00:05:48.750> your

combo and it goes down faster the higher
