00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
pretty much the same in the water it's

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.759 
pretty much the same in the water it's
how<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.579> start<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.419> how<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.720> finish<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.319> is

how you start and how you finish that is
going<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.130> be<00:03:20.250> what's<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.700> critical<00:03:21.060> here

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
going to be what's so critical here

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.289 
going to be what's so critical here
especially<00:03:22.440> as<00:03:23.040> he<00:03:23.190> head<00:03:23.370> into<00:03:23.579> these<00:03:23.700> last<00:03:23.970> 50

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
especially as he head into these last 50

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.030 
especially as he head into these last 50
meters<00:03:24.569> how<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:24.930> end<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.530> white<00:03:25.709> stroke

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
meters how you end on that white stroke

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.339 
meters how you end on that white stroke
so<00:03:26.639> yellow<00:03:26.849> as<00:03:27.090> fast<00:03:27.389> as<00:03:27.630> down<00:03:27.840> looks<00:03:28.169> like
