the gas you want to make sure that

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.110 
the gas you want to make sure that

to stay there for the for the whole time
so<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.830> might<00:04:44.040> want<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.310> fire<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.729> that

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
so it so you might want to fire it that

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.629 
so it so you might want to fire it that
the<00:04:45.389> challenge<00:04:45.780> with<00:04:45.930> firing<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.470> car<00:04:46.710> every

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
the challenge with firing the car every

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.750 
the challenge with firing the car every
other<00:04:47.790> month<00:04:48.419> is<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.620> if<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:50.130> don't<00:04:50.400> get<00:04:50.669> it

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
other month is that if you don't get it

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.740 
other month is that if you don't get it
to<00:04:50.850> bring<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.360> operating<00:04:51.660> temperature

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
to bring it to operating temperature

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.960 
to bring it to operating temperature
then<00:04:52.650> all<00:04:52.860> you're<00:04:53.010> doing<00:04:53.220> is<00:04:53.370> increasing<00:04:53.520> the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
then all you're doing is increasing the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.870 
then all you're doing is increasing the
amount<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.270> moisture<00:04:54.449> content<00:04:55.080> in<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.199> engine

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
amount of moisture content in the engine

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.250 
amount of moisture content in the engine
because<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.030> fire<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.660> doesn't<00:04:57.840> get<00:04:58.050> hot

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
because you fire it and doesn't get hot

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.560 
because you fire it and doesn't get hot
it<00:04:58.560> creates<00:04:59.220> condensation<00:04:59.490> that<00:04:59.970> mixes<00:05:00.419> with

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
it creates condensation that mixes with

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.680 
it creates condensation that mixes with
the<00:05:00.600> oil<00:05:01.280> so<00:05:02.280> it's<00:05:02.430> kind<00:05:02.639> of<00:05:02.699> a<00:05:02.850> you're<00:05:03.419> darned

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
the oil so it's kind of a you're darned

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.469 
the oil so it's kind of a you're darned
if<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.810> do<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.020> darned<00:05:04.560> if<00:05:04.650> you<00:05:04.740> don't<00:05:04.979> I

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
if you do and darned if you don't I

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.969 
if you do and darned if you don't I
would<00:05:06.479> favor<00:05:07.520> maybe<00:05:09.110> firing<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.199> car<00:05:10.380> off<00:05:10.590> and

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
would favor maybe firing the car off and

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.029 
would favor maybe firing the car off and
just<00:05:11.880> pull<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.300> cover<00:05:12.810> up<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.440> fire<00:05:13.889> the

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
just pull the cover up and and fire the

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.290 
just pull the cover up and and fire the
car<00:05:14.250> off<00:05:14.690> every<00:05:15.690> every<00:05:16.410> two<00:05:16.620> months<00:05:16.800> okay<00:05:17.729> and

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
car off every every two months okay and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.520 
car off every every two months okay and
I<00:05:18.360> do<00:05:18.419> have<00:05:18.630> one<00:05:18.660> of<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:18.930> hoses<00:05:19.199> that<00:05:19.229> I<00:05:19.350> can

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
I do have one of the hoses that I can

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.620 
I do have one of the hoses that I can
run<00:05:19.680> outside<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.310> garage<00:05:20.400> well<00:05:20.940> obviously<00:05:21.449> I

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
run outside the garage well obviously I

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.629 
run outside the garage well obviously I
started<00:05:22.410> say<00:05:22.560> open<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.830> garage<00:05:22.919> door<00:05:23.039> but<00:05:23.490> I

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
started say open the garage door but I

and I kept the windows up to keep the

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.350 
and I kept the windows up to keep the
dust<00:05:57.419> out<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:58.370> kept<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.490> car<00:05:59.669> covered<00:06:00.120> right

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
dust out and kept the car covered right

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.140 
dust out and kept the car covered right
but<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.320> interior<00:06:01.620> over<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.250> period<00:06:02.580> of<00:06:02.880> a

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
couple years time turned yellow from the

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.820 
couple years time turned yellow from the
humidity<00:06:05.849> and<00:06:06.030> that's<00:06:06.870> because<00:06:07.199> the<00:06:07.380> humidity

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
humidity and that's because the humidity

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.550 
humidity and that's because the humidity
gotten<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:08.370> you<00:06:08.760> know<00:06:08.880> got<00:06:09.060> in<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.270> car<00:06:09.479> and

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
gotten and you know got in the car and

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.870 
gotten and you know got in the car and
hovered<00:06:10.560> and<00:06:10.710> stayed<00:06:10.949> so<00:06:11.490> you'll<00:06:11.669> make<00:06:11.849> sure

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
hovered and stayed so you'll make sure

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.400 
hovered and stayed so you'll make sure
the<00:06:12.090> windows<00:06:12.240> are<00:06:12.449> a<00:06:12.630> couple<00:06:12.810> of<00:06:12.930> inches<00:06:13.050> down

the windows are a couple of inches down

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.360 
the windows are a couple of inches down
and<00:06:14.840> as<00:06:15.840> far<00:06:16.050> as<00:06:16.169> parking<00:06:16.560> outside<00:06:16.740> I<00:06:17.039> don't

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
think that should be any challenge maybe

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.640 
think that should be any challenge maybe
an<00:06:20.400> inch<00:06:20.610> down<00:06:20.880> because<00:06:21.300> of<00:06:21.510> the<00:06:21.650> allowance

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 
are some trickle chargers that you can

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.020 
are some trickle chargers that you can
leave<00:07:03.970> on<00:07:04.409> but<00:07:05.409> if<00:07:05.620> you<00:07:05.680> leave<00:07:06.009> on<00:07:06.220> a<00:07:06.250> standard

out of the battery and it can ruin the

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.029 
out of the battery and it can ruin the
battery<00:07:12.220> so<00:07:12.819> what<00:07:13.000> I<00:07:13.030> would<00:07:13.330> do<00:07:13.479> is<00:07:13.810> and<00:07:14.590> what<00:07:15.009> I

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 
battery so what I would do is and what I

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.550 
battery so what I would do is and what I
have<00:07:15.370> is<00:07:15.520> a<00:07:15.550> unit<00:07:16.060> that<00:07:16.090> it<00:07:16.630> has<00:07:16.900> a<00:07:16.930> floater

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 
have is a unit that it has a floater

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.830 
have is a unit that it has a floater
it's<00:07:18.099> a<00:07:18.220> floating<00:07:18.639> and<00:07:18.819> it's<00:07:19.330> a<00:07:19.419> special
