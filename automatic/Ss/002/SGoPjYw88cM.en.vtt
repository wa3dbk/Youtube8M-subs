00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 oculus ruiz will not be alone sun and will 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.560
 sum to virtual reality glasses and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.360
 they do not stop coming out related projects 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.670
 meanwhile of microsoft we only know 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.349
 who has a project called strength 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 just like the city where I played to 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.490
 brazil your world cup this year you had not 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520
 fallen in this because attentive that here 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.439
 begins the daily fix of March 19 , 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.439
 2014 and if I am white eva 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.500
 for three years they are and have 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.170
 I develop some reality glasses 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.640
 virtual for ps4 that is to say they already had 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.440
 thought before leaving the console 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.690
 obviously and even if it looks like a piece of information 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.970
 anecdotal and obvious is the mother of 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.920
 lamb under the project codename 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.140
 morpheus we see that it is not a 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.210
 accessory of those that take a lot 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.309
 later as the mega cd no no nothing no 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.260
 this goes seriously so much that it can 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.140
 mean the same thing as kinect for xbox 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.390
 360 is to say an extension of about 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.480
 how many years in the life of ps 4 now 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.699
 we need to know when and how much 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.160
 what something to which they are and they have already 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.890
 answered with a as soon as possible so 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.080
 minimum and to play and watch movies 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.600
 all kinds, because this last one we do not take for 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.340
 done if you were one of the pioneers who 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.020
 they gave their money to her 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.210
 congratulations you contributed since the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.090
 consoles and video games are a bit 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.920
 stronger if you also have one of those 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.170
 machines maybe you're happy to know that your 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.360
 travel will go beyond the hardware 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.030
 said it continued until it sounds good that you 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.340
 play now or it's easy to leave behind your 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.830
 ties to hardware and become 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.400
 an online store a hub and a 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.870
 and services for android users 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.870
 regardless of the console stick h 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.610
 of my TV or mobile that you use you will have 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.370
 the games and applications with the stamp 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.260
 of hoya and a place where to find them at 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.750
 less that is clear from the initiative 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.640
 obvious everywhere at the moment it seems that 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.460
 we do not see a new version of the console 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.670
 much more powerful and with possibilities of 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.330
 plant face to xbox one or ps4 alone 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.340
 software and the cloud that can be more 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.860
 smart that a pileup that tells you 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.229
 I always simple when a clock 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.150
 smart or one that gives you the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.610
 forecast of time and it has inside your 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.500
 contacts whatsapp milk is the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.209
 power of the cloud you ask how 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.780
 is a movie and your group tells you 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.060
 good bad very good fatal masterpiece 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.370
 the latter only if you have Carlos 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.709
 pumares viejuno joke long 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.750
 of the last google has been released to 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.520
 defend smart watches and everything 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.130
 which can engage in garment 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.380
 arms head or legs 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.970
 that is to say things that you can differentiate from 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.920
 a mobile or a tablet where 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.040
 keep that yes everything with 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.510
 and integrated voice recognition seems 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.790
 that the condition of leaving first in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.010
 xbox one or at least at the same time not 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.650
 prevents the console from adding indie games 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.870
 your xbox initiative goes from that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.480
 Microsoft produces and advises you 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.300
 filter and in return allows the game 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.640
 of shift out in xbox one something like 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.580
 the bazaar of xbox 360 but with something more 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.080
 of control even the advantage of this is 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.489
 that anyone can skip the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.890
 need to have a company 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.170
 producer that negotiates with microsoft 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.810
 something essential to get a game 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.730
 in this console the negative point about 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.519
 everything is that the game has to go to the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.680
 less at the same time in xbox one than in 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.239
 other platforms on the other hand 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.010
 Microsoft has also announced new 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.750
 countries where your machine will arrive from 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.760
 September let's go he will 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.370
 officially because without restrictions 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.530
 by areas and with any money the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.450
 can have since November the good 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.489
 news is that xbox live will also be 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.000
 available without rare tricks to access 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.190
 to foreign stores this has been all 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.230
 in your virtual daily fix of today remember 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.760
