on my face I'm probably breathing less
dirt<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:55.200> i<00:02:55.260> use<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.470> for<00:02:55.650> racing<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:57.600> this

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
dirt in so i use it for racing and this

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.470 
dirt in so i use it for racing and this
thing<00:02:58.680> might<00:02:58.980> seem<00:02:59.459> like<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.820> would<00:03:00.269> be<00:03:00.450> a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
thing might seem like it would be a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.599 
thing might seem like it would be a
little<00:03:00.720> much<00:03:00.989> for<00:03:01.049> hot<00:03:01.500> weather<00:03:01.709> use<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:02.370> even

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
little much for hot weather use but even

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.870 
little much for hot weather use but even
in<00:03:02.730> hot<00:03:02.970> weather<00:03:03.739> my<00:03:04.739> opinion<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.670> that

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
in hot weather my opinion is is that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.880 
in hot weather my opinion is is that
when<00:03:06.810> you're<00:03:06.930> breathing<00:03:07.320> your<00:03:07.440> respiration

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
when you're breathing your respiration

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.110 
when you're breathing your respiration
you're<00:03:08.250> actually<00:03:08.400> there's<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.910> lot<00:03:09.090> of

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
you're actually there's a lot of

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.509 
you're actually there's a lot of
humidity<00:03:09.660> vapor<00:03:10.079> in<00:03:10.410> your<00:03:10.560> breath<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:11.370> it's

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
humidity vapor in your breath that it's

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.949

kind<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.760> trapped<00:03:12.120> inside<00:03:12.359> here<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:12.840> you

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
kind of trapped inside here and you

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.750

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
up on that a lots of good points about

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.200 
up on that a lots of good points about
the<00:04:45.150> helmet<00:04:45.659> the<00:04:46.220> general<00:04:47.220> fit<00:04:47.460> it's<00:04:48.000> very

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
the helmet the general fit it's very

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.270 
the helmet the general fit it's very
neutral<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:49.020> not<00:04:49.260> too<00:04:49.440> round<00:04:49.680> it's<00:04:49.949> not<00:04:50.099> two

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
neutral it's not too round it's not two

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.649 
neutral it's not too round it's not two
ovals<00:04:50.669> so<00:04:50.940> we<00:04:51.330> think<00:04:51.479> of<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:53.150> arrive<00:04:54.150> being<00:04:54.449> kind

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
ovals so we think of a arrive being kind

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.810 
ovals so we think of a arrive being kind
of<00:04:54.810> narrow<00:04:55.110> oval<00:04:55.530> shape<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.099> a<00:04:56.220> showy<00:04:56.490> being

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
of narrow oval shape and a showy being

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.430 
of narrow oval shape and a showy being
more<00:04:57.000> of<00:04:57.060> a<00:04:57.120> traditional<00:04:57.300> round<00:04:57.840> shape<00:04:58.199> this

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
more of a traditional round shape this

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.779 
more of a traditional round shape this
really<00:04:58.710> splits<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.220> difference<00:04:59.370> between

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
really splits the difference between

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.629 
really splits the difference between
them<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.419> wear<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:01.229> medium<00:05:01.530> in<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:01.979> helmet<00:05:02.250> and

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
them I wear a medium in this helmet and

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.480 
them I wear a medium in this helmet and
it<00:05:03.030> fits<00:05:03.240> me<00:05:03.389> just<00:05:03.419> right<00:05:03.780> yeah<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.830> first

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
it fits me just right yeah the first

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.460 
it fits me just right yeah the first
generation<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.449> helmets<00:05:06.840> like<00:05:06.990> these<00:05:07.229> they

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
generation of helmets like these they

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.909 
generation of helmets like these they
had<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> little<00:05:08.099> bit<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:09.630> tendency<00:05:10.199> to<00:05:10.440> sit

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
had a little bit of a tendency to sit

had a little bit of a tendency to sit
kind<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.250> high<00:05:11.460> on<00:05:11.610> your<00:05:11.789> head<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.240> they<00:05:12.960> fit<00:05:13.349> a

little bit tight they changed all that
in<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.509> second<00:05:15.930> generation<00:05:16.080> helmet<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:16.919> if

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
motorcycle and what comes again through

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.550 
motorcycle and what comes again through
branches<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:42.599> stuff<00:05:42.780> I<00:05:42.930> need<00:05:42.990> all<00:05:43.259> the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
branches and stuff I need all the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.150 
branches and stuff I need all the
clearance<00:05:43.919> like

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
clearance like

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.580 
clearance like
yet<00:05:44.370> so<00:05:44.910> I<00:05:44.940> take<00:05:45.300> those<00:05:45.600> off<00:05:45.840> I've<00:05:46.140> caught

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
yet so I take those off I've caught

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.880 
yet so I take those off I've caught
those<00:05:47.010> once<00:05:47.340> or<00:05:47.460> twice<00:05:47.580> I<00:05:48.350> and<00:05:49.350> kind<00:05:49.650> of<00:05:49.740> had

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
those once or twice I and kind of had

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.610 
those once or twice I and kind of had
them<00:05:50.070> pull<00:05:50.340> my<00:05:50.490> neck<00:05:50.700> around<00:05:50.880> so<00:05:51.480> I<00:05:51.720> ride

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
them pull my neck around so I ride

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.920 
them pull my neck around so I ride
without<00:05:52.920> that<00:05:53.340> if<00:05:53.730> I<00:05:53.790> was<00:05:54.000> just<00:05:54.360> doing<00:05:54.540> open

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
without that if I was just doing open

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.240 
without that if I was just doing open
terrain<00:05:55.110> it<00:05:55.320> really<00:05:55.590> wouldn't<00:05:55.830> be<00:05:55.890> a<00:05:55.980> big<00:05:56.220> deal

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
terrain it really wouldn't be a big deal

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.360 
terrain it really wouldn't be a big deal
I<00:05:56.730> know<00:05:57.570> it<00:05:57.840> distracts<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.710> little<00:05:59.100> bit<00:05:59.250> from

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
I know it distracts a little bit from

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.490 
I know it distracts a little bit from
how<00:05:59.610> much<00:05:59.760> air<00:06:00.000> gets<00:06:00.240> directed<00:06:00.690> in<00:06:00.900> but<00:06:01.380> the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
how much air gets directed in but the

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.040 
how much air gets directed in but the
things<00:06:01.770> still<00:06:02.100> that's<00:06:03.030> really<00:06:03.510> good<00:06:03.690> without

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
things still that's really good without

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.200 
things still that's really good without
them<00:06:05.420> the<00:06:06.420> liners<00:06:07.230> snap<00:06:07.920> in<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.370> out<00:06:08.550> really

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
them the liners snap in and out really

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.550 
them the liners snap in and out really
easy<00:06:09.510> they're<00:06:10.320> super<00:06:11.040> simple<00:06:11.910> to<00:06:11.970> clean<00:06:12.560> the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
easy they're super simple to clean the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.020 
easy they're super simple to clean the
only<00:06:13.800> thing<00:06:13.980> I<00:06:14.070> wish<00:06:14.250> is<00:06:14.430> I<00:06:14.550> wish<00:06:14.580> they<00:06:14.850> had<00:06:15.000> a

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
only thing I wish is I wish they had a

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.360 
only thing I wish is I wish they had a
little<00:06:15.390> better<00:06:15.780> quality<00:06:16.560> faux<00:06:16.830> minute<00:06:17.220> they

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
little better quality faux minute they

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.750 
little better quality faux minute they
start<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.820> lose<00:06:18.090> their<00:06:18.120> fluff<00:06:18.750> pretty<00:06:19.290> quickly

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
start to lose their fluff pretty quickly

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.120 
start to lose their fluff pretty quickly
so<00:06:20.760> what<00:06:20.970> I<00:06:21.000> do<00:06:21.120> when<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.200> get<00:06:22.260> a<00:06:22.440> helmet<00:06:22.710> I<00:06:22.920> just

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
so what I do when I get a helmet I just

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.310 
so what I do when I get a helmet I just
buy<00:06:23.280> a<00:06:23.310> couple<00:06:23.580> extra<00:06:23.730> liners<00:06:24.180> that<00:06:24.630> way<00:06:25.110> when

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
buy a couple extra liners that way when

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.720 
buy a couple extra liners that way when
it<00:06:25.410> starts<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.740> get<00:06:25.890> a<00:06:25.950> little<00:06:26.010> loose<00:06:26.310> feeling

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
it starts to get a little loose feeling

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.250 
it starts to get a little loose feeling
I<00:06:26.790> just<00:06:27.000> throw<00:06:27.180> a<00:06:27.210> new<00:06:27.390> one<00:06:27.600> in<00:06:27.750> there<00:06:27.990> and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
I just throw a new one in there and

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.470 
I just throw a new one in there and
really<00:06:28.950> that<00:06:29.130> makes<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.520> helmet<00:06:29.850> feel<00:06:30.210> like<00:06:30.450> a

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
really that makes the helmet feel like a

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.800 
really that makes the helmet feel like a
brand<00:06:30.810> new<00:06:30.870> helmet<00:06:31.260> again<00:06:32.420> and<00:06:33.420> I<00:06:33.480> think<00:06:33.690> that

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
brand new helmet again and I think that

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.780 
brand new helmet again and I think that
about<00:06:33.840> covers<00:06:34.020> it<00:06:34.350> for<00:06:34.620> almost<00:06:35.370> all<00:06:35.640> the

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
about covers it for almost all the

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.970 
about covers it for almost all the
writing<00:06:36.090> I<00:06:36.150> do<00:06:36.330> this<00:06:36.570> is<00:06:36.720> what<00:06:36.900> I<00:06:36.930> wear<00:06:37.230> I<00:06:37.500> have

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
writing I do this is what I wear I have

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.590 
writing I do this is what I wear I have
a<00:06:38.010> few<00:06:38.310> other<00:06:38.430> helmets<00:06:38.850> but<00:06:39.030> it's<00:06:39.150> funny<00:06:39.360> every

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
a few other helmets but it's funny every

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.060 
a few other helmets but it's funny every
time<00:06:39.630> I<00:06:39.810> wear<00:06:40.020> one<00:06:40.200> of<00:06:40.260> my<00:06:40.350> other<00:06:40.560> helmets

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
time I wear one of my other helmets

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.760
