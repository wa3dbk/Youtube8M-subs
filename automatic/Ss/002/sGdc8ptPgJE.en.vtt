00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790 

I<00:00:00.089> always<00:00:00.659> recommend<00:00:01.170> that<00:00:01.199> you<00:00:01.350> blend<00:00:01.650> your

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
I always recommend that you blend your

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.240 
I always recommend that you blend your
fruits<00:00:02.149> but<00:00:03.149> juice<00:00:03.540> your<00:00:03.870> vegetables<00:00:04.250> and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
fruits but juice your vegetables and

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.369 
fruits but juice your vegetables and
this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.120> because<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.450> know<00:00:06.569> we're<00:00:07.020> not<00:00:07.049> set

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
this is because you know we're not set

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.080 
this is because you know we're not set
up<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.710> our<00:00:07.859> digestive<00:00:08.280> system<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.730> not<00:00:08.880> set

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
up and our digestive system is not set

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.419 
up and our digestive system is not set
up<00:00:09.150> like<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> cow<00:00:09.889> we<00:00:10.889> don't<00:00:11.040> have<00:00:11.219> three

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
up like a cow we don't have three

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.549 
up like a cow we don't have three
stomachs<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:11.969> don't<00:00:12.120> regurgitate<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:13.019> you

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
stomachs we don't regurgitate and you

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.189 
stomachs we don't regurgitate and you
know<00:00:13.679> chew<00:00:14.160> our<00:00:14.309> food<00:00:14.340> are<00:00:14.910> cut<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.599> all<00:00:15.690> this

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
know chew our food are cut and all this

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.840 
know chew our food are cut and all this
stuff<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.470> most<00:00:16.949> people<00:00:17.190> don't<00:00:17.310> chew<00:00:17.580> enough

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
stuff so most people don't chew enough

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.609 
stuff so most people don't chew enough
and<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.690> know<00:00:18.810> what<00:00:18.960> most<00:00:19.080> people<00:00:19.289> don't<00:00:19.380> know

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
and you know what most people don't know

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.310 
and you know what most people don't know
is<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.920> food<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.760> only<00:00:20.910> digested<00:00:21.750> once<00:00:22.170> it's

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
is that food is only digested once it's

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.070 
is that food is only digested once it's
in<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> liquid<00:00:22.740> state<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.340> our<00:00:23.430> bodies<00:00:23.880> by<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
in a liquid state in our bodies by the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560 
in a liquid state in our bodies by the
villi<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.650> if<00:00:26.640> food<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> liquid

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
villi and if food is not in a liquid

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.419 
villi and if food is not in a liquid
state<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.900> can't<00:00:28.170> absorb<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> nutrition<00:00:29.250> from

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
state we can't absorb the nutrition from

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.880 
state we can't absorb the nutrition from
it<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.820> that's<00:00:30.359> why<00:00:30.539> juicing<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.410> powerful

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it and that's why juicing is so powerful

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.520 
it and that's why juicing is so powerful
because<00:00:32.009> juicing<00:00:32.730> basically<00:00:33.570> removes<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
because juicing basically removes a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.709 
because juicing basically removes a
fiber<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> juice<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.480> fiber

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
fiber and it's the juice of the fiber

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
fiber and it's the juice of the fiber
that<00:00:37.079> feeds<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> know<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.550> took

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
that feeds you and and you know I took

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
that feeds you and and you know I took
that<00:00:38.879> quote<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> juice<00:00:39.600> man<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> have

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that quote for the juice man so I have

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.020 
that quote for the juice man so I have
to<00:00:40.260> give<00:00:40.440> him<00:00:40.530> give<00:00:40.980> him<00:00:41.070> props<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> juice<00:00:41.820> man

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
to give him give him props the juice man

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.360 
to give him give him props the juice man
you<00:00:42.540> know<00:00:42.660> he<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.050> me<00:00:43.230> into<00:00:43.320> juicing<00:00:43.770> he's<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you know he got me into juicing he's a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.639 
you know he got me into juicing he's a
great<00:00:44.730> guy<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.660> look<00:00:45.960> him<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.440> he

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
great guy you know look him up and he

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.049 
great guy you know look him up and he
has<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> new<00:00:46.980> book<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.460> program<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.030> check

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
has a new book and program out so check

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.180 
has a new book and program out so check
him<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.350> juice<00:00:49.649> from<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> fiber

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
him out but it's a juice from the fiber

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.369 
him out but it's a juice from the fiber
that<00:00:50.370> feeds<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> that's<00:00:51.809> why<00:00:51.930> juicing<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that feeds you and that's why juicing is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.049 
that feeds you and that's why juicing is
so<00:00:52.469> beneficial<00:00:52.680> we've<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.340> had<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.760> big

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so beneficial we've all had that big

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.330 
so beneficial we've all had that big
Thanksgiving<00:00:54.600> dinner<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> afterwards<00:00:56.070> we

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
Thanksgiving dinner and afterwards we

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
Thanksgiving dinner and afterwards we
just<00:00:56.520> kind<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> feel<00:00:56.850> tired<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.480> because

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
just kind of feel tired that's because

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170 
just kind of feel tired that's because
our<00:00:57.870> bodies<00:00:58.199> take<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.800> energy<00:00:59.190> you<00:01:00.059> know

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
our bodies take a lot of energy you know

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.819 
our bodies take a lot of energy you know
to<00:01:00.239> digest<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> food<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.530> ate<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to digest the food that we just ate to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.310 
to digest the food that we just ate to
get<00:01:01.949> more<00:01:02.160> energy<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
get more energy out of it and in the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.620 
get more energy out of it and in the
Thanksgiving<00:01:04.680> dinner<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.700> extreme

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
Thanksgiving dinner is like the extreme

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.410 
Thanksgiving dinner is like the extreme
example<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.560> end<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.490> our<00:01:09.060> bodies

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
example on one end of like our bodies

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420 
example on one end of like our bodies
having<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> work<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.049> hard<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
having to work really hard to get the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.219 
having to work really hard to get the
energy<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.030> food<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> other

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
energy out of that food and on the other

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.770 
energy out of that food and on the other
end<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.950> juicing<00:01:14.520> juices<00:01:14.909> juicing<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
end is juicing juices juicing is the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.620 
end is juicing juices juicing is the
absolutely<00:01:16.320> easiest<00:01:16.619> way<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:18.000> our<00:01:18.119> bodies<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
absolutely easiest way for our bodies to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.200 
absolutely easiest way for our bodies to
extract<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> nutrition<00:01:19.740> from<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:20.850> fresh

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
extract the nutrition from these fresh

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
extract the nutrition from these fresh
fruits<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.750> vegetables<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:23.280> why

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
fruits and vegetables and that's why

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.609 
fruits and vegetables and that's why
juicing<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.299> beneficial<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:25.020> things

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
juicing can be so beneficial in things

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.990 
juicing can be so beneficial in things
such<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.040> gaining<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.670> energy

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
such as you know gaining more energy

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.670 
such as you know gaining more energy
because<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.960> body's<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.380> having<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
because now if your body's not having to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.560 
because now if your body's not having to
use<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.920> energy<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.280> digest<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.909> food<00:01:30.119> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
use that energy to digest the food it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
use that energy to digest the food it
has<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.990> energy<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.680> live<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.790> be

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
has that energy for you to live and be

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450
