00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
guys want to go test it out in single
player<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.940> how<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.110> does

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
player and see how it is to you it does

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
player and see how it is to you it does
fit<00:00:55.469> six<00:00:55.770> people<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
fit six people in it which is kind of a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.060 
fit six people in it which is kind of a
cool<00:00:57.149> thing<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.320> again<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:58.800> think

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
cool thing but then again I don't think

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
cool thing but then again I don't think
it's<00:00:59.160> worth<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> much<00:00:59.699> money<00:00:59.930> especially

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's worth that much money especially

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.420 
it's worth that much money especially
since<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.440> don't<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> lot<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:01.980> money<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
since we don't have a lot of money to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.549 
since we don't have a lot of money to
spend<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.969> I'd<00:01:03.510> rather<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
spend and I'd rather have you know a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
spend and I'd rather have you know a
whole<00:01:04.710> bunch<00:01:05.040> other<00:01:05.250> souped-up<00:01:05.850> cars<00:01:06.090> rather
