bottom<00:02:04.700> punch<00:02:10.870> now<00:02:11.870> have<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.410> counter<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
bottom punch now have can counter the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:24.430 
bottom punch now have can counter the
left<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.549> body<00:02:21.849> excellent<00:02:22.849> now<00:02:23.780> what

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
left of the body excellent now what

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.870 
left of the body excellent now what
we're<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.830> do<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.310> we're<00:02:25.610> going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.760> put

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
we're going to do is we're going to put

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.539 
we're going to do is we're going to put
this<00:02:26.030> all<00:02:26.299> together<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.709> can<00:02:27.860> see<00:02:28.130> what<00:02:28.400> if

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
this all together so you can see what if

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.820 
this all together so you can see what if
this<00:02:28.670> would<00:02:28.880> typically<00:02:29.239> look<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:30.440> an

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
this would typically look like in an

00:02:30.830 --> 00:03:22.650 
this would typically look like in an
accession<00:02:31.220> engine

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.210 

so<00:03:23.660> there<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:23.840> go<00:03:23.960> kind<00:03:24.830> of<00:03:24.860> through<00:03:25.070> there

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
so there you go kind of through there

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.430 
so there you go kind of through there
all<00:03:25.370> together<00:03:25.780> through<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> lot<00:03:26.960> of<00:03:27.050> inches<00:03:27.290> up

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
all together through a lot of inches up

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.380 
all together through a lot of inches up
ones<00:03:27.710> as<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:27.890> can<00:03:28.100> just<00:03:28.730> get<00:03:28.910> rid<00:03:29.030> of<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.180> not

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
ones as I can just get rid of this not

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.870 
ones as I can just get rid of this not
seeing<00:03:29.780> punches<00:03:30.260> get<00:03:30.440> come<00:03:30.710> out<00:03:30.950> up<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.310> just

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
seeing punches get come out up and just

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.880 
seeing punches get come out up and just
start<00:03:32.210> to<00:03:32.420> fill<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:32.810> repetition<00:03:33.110> repetition

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
start to fill that repetition repetition

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.300 
start to fill that repetition repetition
so<00:03:34.460> where<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:35.300> comes<00:03:35.660> time<00:03:35.990> on<00:03:36.410> where<00:03:37.190> is

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
so where it comes time on where is

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.210 
so where it comes time on where is
actually<00:03:37.700> why<00:03:37.880> this<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.510> a<00:03:38.540> natural<00:03:39.050> reaction

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
actually why this is a natural reaction

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.190 
actually why this is a natural reaction
