 a little bit of grass just ok I 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.710
 due to a little bit of natural rosemary 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.579
 For this pleasure, I delicately 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.049
 put up in the plan you're going well side 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.220
 mustard and in fact we will do 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.220
 exactly the same operation 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.850
 on the other side the other side so I 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 give it to leon this is it's good 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.009
 impeccable 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.740
 I put a little grass there 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.810
 target father go and now we put back 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.689
 mustards on it again 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.110
 okay then we're going to look like the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.700
 devil and look at it I cut 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.710
 Roughly onions I do not think so 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.350
 too too small because otherwise it 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.479
 risk of burning I have a little carrot 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.040
 like I proof it in bevel what you 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.170
 have a room like that there is at least 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.240
 two hours of cooking 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.189
 internet is a big piece to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.830
 first degree besides then we go to 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.590
 preheat your oven to 180 Â° an agreement 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.120
 you see I couple elsewhere in shirt and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.060
 we will watch a little bit of garlic 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.560
 and on the edges on the sides and there I 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.750
 put my small carrots on the board 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.190
 Toc tank is celebrating and carrots 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.660
 onions garlic all that it brings back and 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.959
 perfume and that also brought a little bit 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.150
 a little water so there little paper 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.650
 alu on because it will keep 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.220
 humility we sell a palette that will 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.560
 less dry 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.510
 yeah and cooking on to preheat the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.160
 180 degree oven one goes leather two 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.739
 hours 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.730
 it will take colored wax conflict and that 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.620
 is going to be really too much too much and too much 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.620
 simple in more common accord to all of 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.130
 following a firecracker is there you exit the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.540
 palette 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.590
 I like it thick slices you 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.030
 in front of you it's good until then you see 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.560
 what I advise you to leave 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.950
 rest the meat a little before 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.180
 cut it 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.489
 because it's actually the judge will come 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:09.650
 grid missed the plane with the rest so a 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:11.959
 small 2 billion carry-overs 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.090
 to hang up from the port frankly 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.430
 it's the piece is clear to do when 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.200
 sarotti palette that mustard side that 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.549
 send them it's too good then 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.480
 now it's up to you and we're telling you 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.480
 Enjoy your meal
