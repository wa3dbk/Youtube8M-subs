00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.430
 they corridors are very important 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 exercise for your horse 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.699
 not just because that is in dressage 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.859
 booklet states what its just whole 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.349
 functional exercises to your horse 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.640
 more agile and to balance 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.989
 to train 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 each side corridor has its own 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.559
 function in this video we are going to you 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.960
 show where you are the different 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.760
 how to use the side aisles and how 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 in the side aisles you horse them optimally 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.149
 train as much as possible 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.469
 joke goes with vaseline it give way 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.210
 demonstrate 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.770
 neighborhood is a side corridor where you don't 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.379
 have so much bending but where 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.280
 a horse asks his legs to be sideways 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.140
 place 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.050
 with that you train other muscles than 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 that you let the horse move forward 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.170
 for example, he must in this case 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 his right hind leg 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.739
 bring it under his body and with it the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.900
 muscles on the inside full 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.650
 tighten right hind leg 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.240
 you like being once again demonstrate 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.520
 left leg 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.350
 for the looking right is set aside 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.000
 placed and with that you train the muscles 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.119
 the one on the outside of that leg 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.180
 walk with side aisles you train both 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.490
 strength agility as a balance and see to it 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 these four hunt bison for some effort 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.790
 has with his balance 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.070
 it seems that the agility is good 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.689
 allowing us to repeat this and to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.640
 correct every time you go over the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.409
 you will notice that you fall outside 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.939
 increasing balance is becoming more 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.590
 becomes stronger 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.390
 shoulder inward is a side walk on 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 three tracks that means it's inside 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.509
 the hindleg and the outer leg for one 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.619
 walk line 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.290
 important on the shoulder inwards 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.270
 is that the horse is broken from being 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.770
 ears up to his pelvis 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.840
 The reason it is so important is that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.450
 the horse is bent that it is also one 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 agility exercises is the hanz it is 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.560
 most flexible part of the horse and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.259
 it will bend the fast a little too much 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.930
 we want that in addition to the neck too 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.610
 in the back belly so also in the piece below 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.610
 the saddle and behind the saddle 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.930
 You can also go inside the shoulder 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.849
 vary in head-neck posture by it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.540
 occasionally raise or lower your horse 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.310
 set 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.810
 you also vary in the muscles that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.040
 being addressed 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.959
 and the way those muscles work 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.310
 being addressed 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.470
 do not drive the shoulder inwards 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.840
 only as you have to drive less test 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.069
 AC off in reintje slower pace 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.630
 and once a bit smooth 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.670
 set your horse a little higher or higher on you 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.720
 lower it in or leave it a little more 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.850
 damage 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.319
 do not rhyme neatly on three tracks but 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.060
 he also reassured him once in four 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.920
 traces a little more to your horse 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.330
 make it more flexible 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.549
 shoulder inward is not just one 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.620
 exercise for neck and back but also for 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.340
 the legs because the horse is not straight out 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.920
 runs 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.510
 use your other muscles the muscles that 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.220
 walk on the outside of the horse 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.209
 used to go outside with 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.860
 place 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.819
 the muscles that are on the inside of the 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.410
 legs walking 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.989
 are used to enter the b 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.730
 also place the stairs one so they go 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.320
 which requires a lot of bending 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.030
 and in which you again ask a question 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.549
 horse to properly flex his spine 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.709
 from his head to his pelvis 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.690
 muscle on the right 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.470
 muscle on the left will be on length 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.090
 brought 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.430
 This too is learning exercise in which you 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.430
 strength agility and balance training 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.600
 a subscription is also a side pass with 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040
 a lot of bending the errors often 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.569
 is made that is only the head 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.700
 is pulled aside and that the legs 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.139
 still paw but that we 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.049
 no more bowing in the rest of it 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.569
 body takes place then the exercise 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.420
 your question is much less efficient than one 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.650
 considerably less agility of your horse and 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.660
 he might do the exercise then 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.970
 only he will not know about it 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.889
 the make sure that when 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.889
 your horse is still going sideways 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.810
 stays bent around your inner leg 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.579
 in an opium and to the left it becomes 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.620
 horse on the left shorter that 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.109
 muscle tension on the muscle on the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.850
 right side become longer a nimble and 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.609
 the spine as a whole needs something 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.530
 bend to the left in a side aisle as one 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.870
 subscription you train the muscles again 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.890
 on the inside and outside of the 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.989
 legs 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.830
 the right front leg for now at 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.930
 brought by the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.370
 you on the right side of my leg and 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.700
 at the right hind leg that was 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.700
 exactly the same 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.370
 the left foreleg is now on cycle 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.170
 brought the muscles inside 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.650
 of the leg and the same applies to it 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.650
 hindleg 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.220
 most of his corridors are being tested 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.540
 trot asked to be only opium and 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.430
 sometimes asked in gallop 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.780
 However, that does not mean that you are at home 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.710
 sometimes quite different in training 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.150
 can do 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.340
 that can also work very well for one 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.110
 horse settled shoulder in too 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.910
 walk let run at a gallop 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.980
 or have stairs do it for it 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.250
 only more flexible and strong 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.780
 so alternate well in this too 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.370
 you good that if you side it to it 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.500
 drive that you are not alone 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.660
 for the picture in the test you want 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.640
 horse with side walks just die and 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.260
 make it more flexible if you are good at it 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.630
 thought then it is also whole 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.490
 logical that you have to vary a lot in this 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.070
 therefore also varies a lot here 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.740
 high neck posture much in pace and pay attention 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.150
 that your horse is correctly bent 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.670
 if you think carefully about which 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.590
 body parts often in those side corridors 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.660
 You can also use them again 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.730
 to make your horse very focused on certain 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.730
 places to make stronger or hirer
