though too much stress or a long period
of<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.479> develop<00:01:27.900> muscle<00:01:28.259> rich<00:01:28.439> knees

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
of time we develop muscle rich knees

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.969 
of time we develop muscle rich knees
which<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.420> bad<00:01:31.140> performance<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.920> the

which as a as bad performance of the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.740 
which as a as bad performance of the
muscles<00:01:32.369> muscle<00:01:32.729> rigidity<00:01:32.909> says<00:01:33.360> face<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
muscles muscle rigidity says face it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
muscles muscle rigidity says face it
like<00:01:33.869> hardening<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.829> tightening<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
like hardening and tightening of the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760 
like hardening and tightening of the
muscles<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.810> kids<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.259> make<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> mad

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
muscles you see kids will make it mad

muscles you see kids will make it mad
they<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.579> right<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.090> go

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
they go like this right here they go

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.179 
they go like this right here they go
like<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.130> tighten<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> stop<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.189> that's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
like just tighten up the stop and that's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.800 
like just tighten up the stop and that's
kind<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.700> our<00:01:44.790> muscles<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.299> doing<00:01:45.570> over

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
kind of what our muscles are doing over

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.219 
kind of what our muscles are doing over
time<00:01:47.360> neurotic<00:01:48.360> holding<00:01:48.659> patterns<00:01:49.020> that's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
time neurotic holding patterns that's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
time neurotic holding patterns that's
when<00:01:49.439> our<00:01:49.560> nerve<00:01:49.740> bundles<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.549> damaged<00:01:51.060> by

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
when our nerve bundles get damaged by

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690 
when our nerve bundles get damaged by
receiving<00:01:51.570> too<00:01:51.869> much<00:01:52.159> places<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.220> punk<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
receiving too much places like punk and

that<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.879> when<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.110> can't<00:02:13.319> read<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
that is when and if you can't read this

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.540 
that is when and if you can't read this
this<00:02:14.780> will<00:02:14.990> sematic<00:02:15.380> an<00:02:15.470> admission<00:02:15.890> that's

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
this will sematic an admission that's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.830 
this will sematic an admission that's
muscles<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.330> are<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.630> same

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
muscles that are in the same

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.220 
muscles that are in the same
neurological<00:02:18.260> loop<00:02:18.740> stop<00:02:19.100> working<00:02:19.550> properly

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
neurological loop stop working properly

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.710 
neurological loop stop working properly
okay<00:02:21.459> for<00:02:22.459> instance<00:02:22.940> when<00:02:23.150> people<00:02:23.420> are<00:02:23.510> having

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
okay for instance when people are having

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.750 
okay for instance when people are having
a<00:02:23.810> heart<00:02:24.080> attack<00:02:24.170> their<00:02:24.830> left<00:02:25.040> arm<00:02:25.250> goes<00:02:25.459> numb

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
a heart attack their left arm goes numb

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000 
a heart attack their left arm goes numb
it's<00:02:26.510> weird<00:02:26.750> because<00:02:26.959> my<00:02:27.260> heart's<00:02:27.500> here<00:02:27.740> not

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
it's weird because my heart's here not

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.460 
it's weird because my heart's here not
over<00:02:28.220> here<00:02:28.400> what's<00:02:28.850> going<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.240> that's<00:02:30.080> because

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
over here what's going on that's because

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.370 
over here what's going on that's because
you're<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.709> same<00:02:31.040> neurological<00:02:31.520> loop<00:02:32.380> your

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
you're the same neurological loop your

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.559 
you're the same neurological loop your

these nerve bundles takes a beating when

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.090 
these nerve bundles takes a beating when
we're<00:02:58.790> stressed<00:02:59.180> because<00:02:59.620> some<00:03:00.620> reason<00:03:01.010> our

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
we're stressed because some reason our

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.729 
we're stressed because some reason our
brain<00:03:01.340> loves<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.970> send<00:03:02.269> those<00:03:03.200> nerves<00:03:03.530> and

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
brain loves to send those nerves and

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.490 
brain loves to send those nerves and
enzymes<00:03:04.400> right<00:03:05.000> here<00:03:05.239> that's<00:03:05.930> why<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:06.319> get

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
enzymes right here that's why we get

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.900 
enzymes right here that's why we get
sick<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:07.010> lot<00:03:07.130> when<00:03:07.370> we're<00:03:07.550> nervous

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
sick a lot when we're nervous

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.509 
sick a lot when we're nervous
bless<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.569> see<00:03:08.750> actors<00:03:09.170> or<00:03:09.500> musicians<00:03:09.860> before

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
bless you see actors or musicians before

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.460 
bless you see actors or musicians before
they<00:03:10.700> take<00:03:10.910> stage<00:03:11.239> yeah<00:03:12.170> they're<00:03:12.350> in<00:03:12.410> the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
they take stage yeah they're in the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.259 
they take stage yeah they're in the
bathroom<00:03:12.620> puking<00:03:13.040> before<00:03:13.790> they<00:03:13.940> take<00:03:14.150> the

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
bathroom puking before they take the

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.340 
bathroom puking before they take the
stage<00:03:15.069> why<00:03:16.069> because<00:03:16.959> visceral<00:03:17.959> somatic

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
stage why because visceral somatic

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.220 
stage why because visceral somatic
inhibition<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.070> could<00:03:20.060> cause<00:03:20.329> muscles<00:03:20.989> to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
inhibition that could cause muscles to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.830 
inhibition that could cause muscles to
work<00:03:21.440> on<00:03:21.739> properly<00:03:22.280> now<00:03:22.519> have<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.660> been

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
work on properly now have you been

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.800 
work on properly now have you been
experiencing<00:03:24.410> lower<00:03:24.620> back<00:03:24.829> pain<00:03:25.630> pain<00:03:26.630> in

some<00:03:28.220> people<00:03:28.640> do<00:03:28.790> because<00:03:29.620> obviously<00:03:30.620> muscles

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
some people do because obviously muscles

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.509 
some people do because obviously muscles
hold<00:03:32.329> your<00:03:32.660> hips<00:03:32.870> together<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.560> place<00:03:34.160> in

this nerve vortex section stopped
working<00:03:39.950> properly<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:41.840> could<00:03:42.079> cause<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.410> to

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
working properly it could cause you to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.949 
working properly it could cause you to
