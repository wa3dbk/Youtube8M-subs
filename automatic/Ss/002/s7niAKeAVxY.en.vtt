Maximus platform and Maya 2013 to walk
you<00:00:21.359> through<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> typical<00:00:22.140> workflow

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
you through a typical workflow

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.450 
you through a typical workflow
okay<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:24.119> prior<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.689> launching<00:00:25.439> my<00:00:25.590> 2013

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
okay so just prior to launching my 2013

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.660 
okay so just prior to launching my 2013
I<00:00:26.960> configured<00:00:27.960> my<00:00:28.109> system<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.769> dedicate<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
I configured my system to dedicate the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.659 
I configured my system to dedicate the
quadrille<00:00:30.090> card<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:31.050> screen<00:00:31.890> interactivity

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
quadrille card for screen interactivity

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.870 
quadrille card for screen interactivity
and<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.270> tesla<00:00:33.660> card<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.380> compute<00:00:34.920> i'm<00:00:35.610> going

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and the tesla card for compute i'm going

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.430 
and the tesla card for compute i'm going
to<00:00:35.940> open<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.480> scene<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.290> we've

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to open up a scene here that we've

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.560 
to open up a scene here that we've
created<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.260> switch<00:00:40.469> over<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.570> render

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
created so if I switch over to my render

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.920 
created so if I switch over to my render
camera<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.370> this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.430> our<00:00:44.730> scene<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.239> going

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
camera and this is our scene I'm going

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.220 
camera and this is our scene I'm going
to<00:00:45.989> jump<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.760> render<00:00:47.760> settings<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.360> within

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
to jump up to render settings and within

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.650 
to jump up to render settings and within
render<00:00:49.680> settings<00:00:50.070> inside<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> common<00:00:51.420> tab

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
render settings inside the common tab

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
render settings inside the common tab
I'll<00:00:52.379> make<00:00:52.829> sure<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:53.340> set<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.680> 1920

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
I'll make sure that I'm set to be 1920

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740 
I'll make sure that I'm set to be 1920
by<00:00:55.800> 1080<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.520> we're<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> render<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.239> full

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
by 1080 so we're going to render a full

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
by 1080 so we're going to render a full
HD<00:00:58.020> frame<00:00:58.530> here

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
HD frame here

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.630 
HD frame here
and<00:01:00.020> then<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.500> over<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
and then I'm going to go over to the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.890 
and then I'm going to go over to the
arty<00:01:03.149> engine<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.760> this<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.570> have

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
arty engine and this right now we have

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
arty engine and this right now we have
the<00:01:07.020> option<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.619> choosing<00:01:07.950> CPU<00:01:08.580> OpenCL<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the option of choosing CPU OpenCL and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
the option of choosing CPU OpenCL and
CUDA<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.409> course<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.799> want<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.100> show<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.369> on

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
CUDA and of course we want to show it on

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.770 
CUDA and of course we want to show it on
CUDA<00:01:12.650> we<00:01:13.650> also<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> ability<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.780> down

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
CUDA we also have the ability to down

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.740 
CUDA we also have the ability to down
sample<00:01:16.320> our<00:01:16.500> GPU<00:01:17.100> textures<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.330> case<00:01:18.509> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
sample our GPU textures in the case that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.469 
sample our GPU textures in the case that
we<00:01:18.900> wanted<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.439> take<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.549> high<00:01:20.820> resolution

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
we wanted to take really high resolution

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.870 
we wanted to take really high resolution
textures<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.229> send<00:01:22.439> them<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> GPU<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
textures and send them to the GPU and a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.570 
textures and send them to the GPU and a
smaller<00:01:24.210> format<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.020> allow<00:01:25.290> us<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> use<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
smaller format to allow us to use the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
smaller format to allow us to use the
memory<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.270> better<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
memory a little bit better so and the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.530 
memory a little bit better so and the
way<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.369> turn<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:29.939> off<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.390> with

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
way we can turn that on and off is with

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.780 
way we can turn that on and off is with
this<00:01:30.750> checkbox<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.430> those<00:01:32.579> few

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
this checkbox so with just those few

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.940 
this checkbox so with just those few
settings<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.380> ahead<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> hit

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
settings I'm going to go ahead and hit

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.469 
settings I'm going to go ahead and hit
IPR<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.259> that's<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> launch<00:01:37.829> into

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
IPR and that's going to launch into

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.620 
IPR and that's going to launch into
v-ray<00:01:39.479> RT<00:01:39.590> what<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.710> happen<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.280> v-ray<00:01:42.000> RT<00:01:42.030> is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
v-ray RT what will happen is v-ray RT is

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.600 
v-ray RT what will happen is v-ray RT is
going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> take<00:01:43.110> all<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.310> information

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
going to take all of that information

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.630 
going to take all of that information
from<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> scene<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.100> port<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.189> over<00:01:47.490> directly

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
from the scene and port it over directly

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.990 
from the scene and port it over directly
to<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> GPUs<00:01:48.799> now<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.009> process<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.700> usually

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to the GPUs now this process can usually

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.170 
to the GPUs now this process can usually
take<00:01:51.710> 30<00:01:52.710> seconds<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.310> depending<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:54.000> how

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
take 30 seconds or so depending on how

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
take 30 seconds or so depending on how
big<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.630> scene<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.439> how<00:01:55.920> many<00:01:56.130> textures

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
big your scene is and how many textures

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.969 
big your scene is and how many textures
that<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.990> there

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that you have and there

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.310 
that you have and there
so<00:01:59.549> now<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.880> scene<00:02:00.179> is<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.659> giving<00:02:01.229> us

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
so now this scene is actually giving us

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.370 
so now this scene is actually giving us
a<00:02:01.469> full<00:02:01.770> ray<00:02:02.070> traced<00:02:02.460> frame<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.229> with

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
a full ray traced frame and this is with

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.319 
a full ray traced frame and this is with
glossy<00:02:04.859> reflections<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:05.880> global

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
glossy reflections with global

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.499

actually<00:02:26.580> doing<00:02:27.209> something<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> very

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
actually doing something for the very

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.440 
actually doing something for the very

first time we're using true instancing
with<00:02:30.720> v-ray<00:02:31.049> RT<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:32.130> we're<00:02:32.760> actually<00:02:33.000> able<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
with v-ray RT so we're actually able to

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.280 
with v-ray RT so we're actually able to
put<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.620> tremendous<00:02:35.190> amount<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:36.290> Polly's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
put in a tremendous amount of Polly's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.140 
put in a tremendous amount of Polly's
because<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.190> fact<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.519> they're<00:02:38.730> instant

ok<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.680> I've<00:02:49.950> opened<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.489> production<00:02:50.760> seen

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
ok so I've opened up a production seen

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.780 
ok so I've opened up a production seen
here<00:02:51.569> with<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.049> highly<00:02:52.650> detailed<00:02:52.829> robot<00:02:53.519> and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
here with the highly detailed robot and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.330 
here with the highly detailed robot and
when<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.569> start<00:02:55.140> working<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.530> look<00:02:55.799> development

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
when I start working on look development

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.830 
when I start working on look development
the<00:02:56.430> first<00:02:56.640> thing<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:56.849> I<00:02:57.000> would<00:02:57.120> do<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.569> add<00:02:57.810> a

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
the first thing that I would do is add a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.559 
the first thing that I would do is add a
v-ray<00:02:58.260> dome<00:02:58.500> light<00:02:58.769> with<00:02:59.069> an<00:02:59.190> HDR<00:02:59.579> that's<00:03:00.329> just

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
v-ray dome light with an HDR that's just

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.629 
v-ray dome light with an HDR that's just
going<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> give<00:03:00.989> me<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.410> general<00:03:02.069> environment

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
going to give me a general environment

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.759 
going to give me a general environment
light<00:03:02.880> next<00:03:03.780> thing<00:03:03.930> I'm<00:03:04.049> going<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.620> go

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
light next thing I'm going to do is go

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.039 
light next thing I'm going to do is go
to<00:03:04.829> my<00:03:04.920> render<00:03:05.340> settings<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.970> choose<00:03:06.870> the

enabled with that I'm going to launch
the<00:03:11.370> IPR<00:03:12.739> there<00:03:13.739> we<00:03:13.889> go<00:03:14.420> one<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.569> new

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
the IPR there we go one of the new

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.440 
the IPR there we go one of the new
features<00:03:15.959> inside<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.769> v-ray<00:03:17.519> RT<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:18.150> we've

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
features inside of v-ray RT is we've

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.020 
features inside of v-ray RT is we've
added<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.989> ability<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.470> use<00:03:20.190> v-ray<00:03:20.700> blend

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
added the ability to use v-ray blend

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.539 
added the ability to use v-ray blend
materials<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.380> particular<00:03:22.920> case<00:03:23.220> I've

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
materials in this particular case I've

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.089 
materials in this particular case I've
got<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:24.329> robot<00:03:24.569> looking<00:03:25.109> one<00:03:25.349> way<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.590> if<00:03:25.980> I

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
got the robot looking one way and if I

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.949 
got the robot looking one way and if I
drag<00:03:26.400> my<00:03:26.579> slider<00:03:26.970> all<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.269> way<00:03:27.419> to<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.780> right

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
drag my slider all the way to the right

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.589 
drag my slider all the way to the right
we<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:28.829> see<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.069> completely<00:03:29.549> alternate<00:03:30.269> set<00:03:30.480> of

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
we can see a completely alternate set of

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.349 
we can see a completely alternate set of
materials<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:32.310> once<00:03:32.579> we<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.000> shaders

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
materials so once we have the shaders

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.059 
materials so once we have the shaders
looking<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.810> way<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:34.079> want<00:03:34.290> them<00:03:34.380> we'll

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
looking the way we want them we'll

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.530 
looking the way we want them we'll
switch<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.700> start<00:03:35.819> working<00:03:36.299> on<00:03:36.419> our

I<00:03:56.970> enable<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.389> first<00:03:57.630> one<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:58.169> this<00:03:58.349> is

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
I enable the first one here this is

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.620 
I enable the first one here this is
going<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.859> a<00:03:58.889> blue<00:03:59.160> fill<00:03:59.459> light<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.849> we<00:04:00.599> can

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
going to be a blue fill light and we can

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.750 
going to be a blue fill light and we can
see<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.109> that<00:04:01.230> provides<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.769> bit<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.099> shading

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
see that that provides a bit of shading

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.059 
see that that provides a bit of shading

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
on the front of the robot then I'll turn

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.160 
on the front of the robot then I'll turn
on<00:04:05.220> our<00:04:05.489> rim<00:04:06.150> light<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:06.659> pull<00:04:06.870> out<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
on our rim light to pull out the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.500 
on our rim light to pull out the
silhouette<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.829> to<00:04:08.400> separate<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:09.030> character

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
silhouette and to separate the character

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.400 
silhouette and to separate the character
from<00:04:09.689> the<00:04:09.780> background

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
from the background

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.920 
from the background
got<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> bit<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.040> blue<00:04:11.310> rim<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.240> few<00:04:12.750> more

environment<00:04:13.530> lights<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.950> turn<00:04:14.130> on<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.610> we

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
environment lights to turn on and we

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.970 
environment lights to turn on and we
have<00:04:15.630> our<00:04:15.840> character<00:04:16.110> looking<00:04:16.560> pretty<00:04:16.739> good

once we're happy with the way things are
set<00:04:19.260> up<00:04:19.320> we<00:04:19.680> can<00:04:19.860> actually<00:04:20.040> take<00:04:20.610> a<00:04:20.640> look<00:04:20.850> at

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
set up we can actually take a look at

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.510 
set up we can actually take a look at
the<00:04:21.180> different<00:04:21.480> animated<00:04:21.989> frames<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:23.040> if<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.310> go

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
the different animated frames so if I go

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.980 
the different animated frames so if I go
to<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.760> different<00:04:24.150> position<00:04:24.270> here<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.870> our

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
to a different position here of our

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.750 
to a different position here of our
character<00:04:25.440> we<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:25.860> see<00:04:26.220> what<00:04:26.400> he<00:04:26.460> looks<00:04:26.700> like

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760

the power and scalability you need to

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.020 
the power and scalability you need to
produce<00:04:48.600> high-quality<00:04:49.220> iterations<00:04:50.220> spending

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
produce high-quality iterations spending

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.480 
produce high-quality iterations spending
less<00:04:51.300> time<00:04:51.330> waiting<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.170> more<00:04:52.740> time<00:04:53.010> being<00:04:53.340> an
