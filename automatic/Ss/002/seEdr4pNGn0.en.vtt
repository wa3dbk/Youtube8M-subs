hiking up these epic hillsides for the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.280 
hiking up these epic hillsides for the
past<00:00:37.190> like<00:00:37.489> two<00:00:37.700> days<00:00:37.880> I'm<00:00:38.750> kind<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:39.110> thinking

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
past like two days I'm kind of thinking

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.760 
past like two days I'm kind of thinking
like<00:00:39.710> better<00:00:40.700> beef<00:00:40.970> or<00:00:41.180> something<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:42.350> know<00:00:42.500> I

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
like better beef or something you know I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.020 
like better beef or something you know I
don't<00:00:43.190> know<00:00:43.250> if<00:00:43.309> you<00:00:43.460> ever<00:00:43.489> feel<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.850> way

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
don't know if you ever feel that way

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.370 
don't know if you ever feel that way
yeah<00:00:49.540> why<00:00:50.540> is<00:00:50.600> that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.160 

okay<00:00:54.820> do<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:55.880> feel<00:00:56.090> extra<00:00:56.540> pressure<00:00:56.810> to<00:00:56.960> get

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
okay do you feel extra pressure to get

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.780 
okay do you feel extra pressure to get
something<00:00:57.620> because<00:00:57.740> you're<00:00:58.490> female

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.580 

definitely<00:01:04.810> maybe<00:01:05.810> that's<00:01:06.020> why<00:01:06.200> I<00:01:06.229> kind<00:01:06.530> of

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
definitely maybe that's why I kind of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.920 
definitely maybe that's why I kind of
wanted<00:01:06.829> to<00:01:06.890> do<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.490> big<00:01:08.030> hunt<00:01:08.509> like<00:01:08.689> this

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
wanted to do a big hunt like this

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.500 
wanted to do a big hunt like this
instead<00:01:09.380> of<00:01:09.500> true<00:01:10.430> saying<00:01:10.670> hi<00:01:15.760> yeah<00:01:16.760> much<00:01:17.210> as<00:01:17.360> I

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
instead of true saying hi yeah much as I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.000 
instead of true saying hi yeah much as I
may<00:01:17.690> have<00:01:17.720> bitched<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.229> moaned<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.620> little<00:01:18.830> bit

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
may have bitched and moaned a little bit

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.649 
may have bitched and moaned a little bit
well<00:01:19.610> I<00:01:19.640> understand

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
well I understand

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.630 
well I understand
I<00:01:20.690> guess<00:01:20.960> there's<00:01:21.170> fewer<00:01:21.620> women<00:01:21.830> who<00:01:22.370> do<00:01:22.550> this

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
I guess there's fewer women who do this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.070 
I guess there's fewer women who do this
kind<00:01:22.880> of<00:01:22.909> stuff<00:01:23.090> because<00:01:23.420> hunting<00:01:23.930> is<00:01:24.050> a

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
kind of stuff because hunting is a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.520 
kind of stuff because hunting is a
tradition<00:01:24.620> that's<00:01:24.710> like<00:01:25.700> handed<00:01:26.060> down<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.530> the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
tradition that's like handed down to the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.260 
tradition that's like handed down to the
men<00:01:27.710> in<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.040> family<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.760> know<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.060> think

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
men in the family you know and I think

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.760 
men in the family you know and I think
that's<00:01:29.450> only<00:01:29.570> maybe<00:01:29.810> recently<00:01:30.409> started

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
that's only maybe recently started

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.289 
that's only maybe recently started
changing<00:01:30.979> yeah<00:01:32.140> there's<00:01:33.140> always<00:01:34.150> been<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.180> lot

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
changing yeah there's always been a lot

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.149 
changing yeah there's always been a lot
of<00:01:35.360> women<00:01:35.570> hunters

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
of women hunters

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.279 
of women hunters
very<00:01:36.460> vocal<00:01:36.880> about<00:01:36.969> it<00:01:37.149> yeah<00:01:37.600> but<00:01:38.049> it's

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
very vocal about it yeah but it's

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.380 
very vocal about it yeah but it's
definitely<00:01:38.829> more<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.729> no<00:01:39.969> matter<00:01:40.119> how<00:01:40.240> you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
definitely more now it no matter how you

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.289 
definitely more now it no matter how you
measured<00:01:40.840> it's<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.560> fast<00:01:42.219> growing<00:01:42.670> segment

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
measured it's a fast growing segment

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.190 
measured it's a fast growing segment
they<00:01:44.020> say<00:01:44.350> that<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.579> earth<00:01:45.789> all<00:01:45.969> had<00:01:46.539> less

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
they say that the and earth all had less

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.539 
they say that the and earth all had less
sexual<00:01:47.710> dimorphism<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:49.630> we<00:01:50.380> didn't<00:01:50.679> mean

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
sexual dimorphism then we didn't mean

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.429 
sexual dimorphism then we didn't mean
the<00:01:51.759> men<00:01:51.939> women<00:01:52.270> were<00:01:52.479> more<00:01:52.659> similar<00:01:52.990> in<00:01:53.229> size

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
the men women were more similar in size

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.719 
the men women were more similar in size
and<00:01:53.859> stature<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:55.270> some<00:01:56.079> people<00:01:56.729> speculate

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
and stature and some people speculate

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.520 
and stature and some people speculate

that than women hundred alongside the
men<00:01:59.709> they<00:02:00.310> seem<00:02:00.549> to<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.880> same<00:02:01.090> injuries

men they seem to have the same injuries

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.389 
men they seem to have the same injuries

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
and stuff on their skeletal remains

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.940 
and stuff on their skeletal remains
we're<00:02:04.240> very<00:02:04.359> like<00:02:04.659> confrontational<00:02:05.619> kind<00:02:05.829> of

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
we're very like confrontational kind of

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.980 
we're very like confrontational kind of
money<00:02:06.209> but<00:02:07.209> if<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.569> look<00:02:07.719> at<00:02:07.869> just

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
money but if you look at just

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.080 
money but if you look at just
traditional<00:02:08.709> Aboriginal<00:02:09.009> societies<00:02:09.970> were

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
traditional Aboriginal societies were

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.190 
traditional Aboriginal societies were
kind<00:02:10.269> of<00:02:10.299> like<00:02:10.420> living<00:02:10.690> on<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.019> same

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
kind of like living on the same

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.690 
kind of like living on the same
landscape<00:02:11.829> that<00:02:11.950> their<00:02:12.099> ancestors<00:02:12.579> have

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
landscape that their ancestors have

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.490 
landscape that their ancestors have
always<00:02:12.849> lived<00:02:13.239> on<00:02:13.360> living<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.780> same<00:02:13.959> basic

always lived on living the same basic

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.350 
always lived on living the same basic
life<00:02:14.709> patterns<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.430> see<00:02:15.459> not<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> lot<00:02:16.120> of

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
life patterns you see not a lot of

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.420 
life patterns you see not a lot of
female<00:02:16.660> hunting<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.470> see<00:02:17.620> very<00:02:17.799> like<00:02:18.010> rigidly

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
female hunting you see very like rigidly

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.490 
female hunting you see very like rigidly
enforced<00:02:18.579> gender<00:02:19.360> roles<00:02:19.540> some<00:02:20.049> way<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.379> our

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
enforced gender roles some way like our

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.860 
enforced gender roles some way like our
society<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.549> structure<00:02:22.180> now<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> kind<00:02:22.810> of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
society is the structure now to kind of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.539 
society is the structure now to kind of
liberate<00:02:23.319> people<00:02:23.590> from<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.129> traditional

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
liberate people from the traditional

liberate people from the traditional
gender<00:02:24.819> roles<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.530> mean<00:02:26.530> I'm<00:02:26.769> sure<00:02:26.799> there<00:02:27.220> are

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
gender roles I mean I'm sure there are

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.110 
gender roles I mean I'm sure there are
hundreds<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.510> women<00:02:28.690> who<00:02:29.019> couldn't<00:02:29.260> probably

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
hundreds of women who couldn't probably

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.210 
hundreds of women who couldn't probably
kick<00:02:31.120> my<00:02:31.299> ass<00:02:31.569> on<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:32.019> probably<00:02:32.650> deserve<00:02:33.069> to
