00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.200
 hello, let's make some crepes with a 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.450
 very basic and simple recipe as you see 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.180
 here I have the different ingredients 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.530
 flour that I'm going to place now in a 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.810
 mixer 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.189
 let's mix everything at once as 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.849
 I always put the link below with the 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.720
 exact recipe by adding sugar eggs 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.720
 whole 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.019
 here I have milk and butter that I'm going to 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.210
 use to cook them in the pan not 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.730
 I'll take here to the mix because no 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.730
 I put everything in the blender and lobato 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.829
 so that everything mixes well and I stayed 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.960
 a little girl so pretty chubby 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.670
 Well and then I have a 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.679
 pan how big you want we are going to 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.699
 place butter butter or if you want 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.190
 a little oil but with 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.769
 butter are richer we let that 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.329
 is based on medium heat more or less than 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.879
 cover the whole pan well because it is very 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.619
 important that they do not stick you have to 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.110
 use a non-stick pan the best 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.000
 pan that you have 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.460
 when we have all the oil or the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.140
 dissolved butter well let's put 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.480
 a little bit of dough just enough for 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.970
 cover the bottom of the pan the more 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.980
 fine better 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.290
 and we let it go little by little 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.910
 it's a good idea to have it on a low heat or 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.920
 half do not put it too high because it 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.140
 can burn you when you see that it is already 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.729
 made by one of the sides 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.240
 we turn it with a spatula 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.240
 big 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.329
 as you see shrinks a little 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.860
 we let it be done 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.070
 and give a little bit more than I have left 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.020
 little bit raw on the other side and already 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.560
 we would have our crack we put it in 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.560
 a dish 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.530
 meanwhile we will be placing a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 little bit more butter to go 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.790
 doing the following is this recipe that you 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.710
 I'm worth as much as about 8 crepes of this 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.990
 size that you are seeing 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.200
 butter is dissolved 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.689
 I put the mass and now the number option 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.069
 you can make some nutella crepes 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:14.099
 or cocoa cream nocilla as you call it 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.139
 with banana this is the favorite at home 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.239
 which we always ask when we buy 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.560
 crepes out there and good is delicious 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.749
 for there are many options as you then 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.659
 I will teach if we sing a capita no 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:26.069
 too thick of cocoa butter and 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.150
 now let's put slices of the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.150
 banana directly 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.630
 let's put them on one side of the pancake in 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.120
 half because we 're going to double it 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.070
 well, more or less, you do not get to the edges 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.630
 and now this is a way to fold it 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.540
 as you have seen in the middle and then 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.480
 we close optionally we can put 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.000
 a little icing sugar on top of us 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.860
 it would be like that there are many more options 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.320
 of presentation 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.970
 for example so folded in half and 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.500
 placing a little bit of chocolate or 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.340
 nutella over beige so in rolls 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.340
 with whipped cream 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.380
 or for example we can replace the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.620
 Nutella for caramel or dulce de leche 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.210
 also another option I'm going to make a 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.810
 little bit smaller and I'm going to make them 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.810
 rolled 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.569
 Here I have my believes that he has done the same 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.849
 that before 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.859
 and we roll it up we make the rolls 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.689
 Look how easy this is, I'm just going to 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.430
 do with nothing simply the mass are 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.749
 equally rich in filling in with nothing 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.989
 I'm going to put just a little bit of sugar 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:34.280
 over I make the second pancake I'm going 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.290
 to place it with a clean plate because 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.939
 these dishes are very greasy 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.340
 I place them and with normal sugar and 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.629
 current he put a little sugar 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.519
 above me it seems to me that 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.099
 great for example for a breakfast or 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.310
 a contraction snack with cherry 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.969
 and cherry juice a little bit of cinnamon 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.969
 strawberries with cream and chocolate 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.940
 the same but presented this way 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.030
 of triangle and with a little bit of sugar 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.830
 glas with the cream inside with good is 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.990
 that there are many presentations you can 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.650
 put them very well with other fruits like 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.040
 blackberries 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.110
 blueberries things from berries 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.540
 with the nutella that are great with 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.280
 orange and caramel or honey maple syrup 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.229
 maple maple syrup like a flame 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.989
 you say the michael syrup and see what idea 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.940
 a cake made with crepes they put the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.289
 crepes one on top of another one filled in 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.050
 for example with the nutella that I have 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.440
 said before the nocilla or with cream 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.449
 you can make it beige or with 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.449
 nice cream whatever you can think of and 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.639
 combined with fruits that is very good 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.860
 look at this I've taken it from a website 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.419
 a cafeteria but you have here the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.850
 different from options for pancakes 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.470
 sweet as you can see there are only nutella 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.280
 with nutella and banana which is what we have 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.229
 made us not fabric with strawberries the 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.080
 Nutella nutella with almonds and a 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.940
 little bit of shredded coconut with smoltz that 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.940
 They are mini marshmallows and some cookies 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.039
 and with strawberry and banana combined with the 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.510
 chocolate and you can also make crepes 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.130
 salty ones are also made in this 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.780
 I'm sorry, but I have 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.460
 I took this picture that would seem to me 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.620
 it looked super graphic 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.289
 you can do it you see with different 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.050
 vegetables with avocado ham spinach 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.940
 mushrooms a lot of mixed things 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.740
 and the truth is that the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.780
 very rich in a I think I 've eaten them 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.789
 also with salmon that is one of the most 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.800
 I like it and the normals of ham and cheese 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.599
 how warm they look really good and the 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.139
 Cheese melts a little as you see here 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:30.780
 these are ham and cheese and this is from 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.160
 mushrooms with cream and spinach as 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.590
 with a kind of bechamel 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.479
 let's try them let's see if 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.759
 like the little princess 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.030
 today is that you are making a mistake 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.030
 senate 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.969
 what 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.340
 good 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.230
 yes 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.440
 but better than forming your life or the 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:06:00.240
 second best 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.240
 the second good good 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.470

 peanut butter and cupcakes is
