 hello I'm a team hummingbird and I'm studying 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.110
 the birds and also their songs in the 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:13.170
 mountains of australia I'm on top of 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.570
 the trees and why am I here if 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.109
 listen very carefully we will be 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.890
 able to hear something very interesting 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.890
 bird songs 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.770
 they heard that sounded like the squeak of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.840
 the black cockatoo 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.930
 I'm in the woods and I can listen to 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:45.140
 someone who flies here and there and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.140
 listen listen can hear 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.210
 that is a tall and very strong song 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.710
 let's look a little further down in this 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.770
 tree 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.230
 alright now go to the middle of the tree 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.920
 and I think unless it's very 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.920
 wrong 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.780
 they heard that it sounded like a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.710
 a gala one of the most typical birds of 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 Australia 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.990
 I would like to observe it closely 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.630
 well I think if I can not see it from 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:30.729
 I'll have to listen to it close 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:34.329
 I'm in the woods and I can listen to 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:39.880
 someone who walks here over there 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.880
 listen listen can hear 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.990
 or if he is a galÃ¡n look at him well he has 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.810
 gray and pink feathers and sing gala 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.540

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.760
 the bush birds in australia fair 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.890

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.740
