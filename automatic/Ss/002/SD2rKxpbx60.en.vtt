 day when you have a video on with a 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.820

 Do not articulate and a microphone 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.530
 it sounds like you have two cans with you 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.180
 a stripe connects and that is that 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.949

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.900
