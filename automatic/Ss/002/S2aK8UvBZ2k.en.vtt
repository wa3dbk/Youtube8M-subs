00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.649 
they are a lot less cost if you're going
to<00:01:32.210> be<00:01:33.219> using<00:01:34.219> the<00:01:34.310> fish<00:01:34.520> out<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.119> water<00:01:35.149> so

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
to be using the fish out of the water so

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.929 
to be using the fish out of the water so
that<00:01:35.689> would<00:01:35.930> be<00:01:36.079> an<00:01:36.140> option<00:01:36.439> for<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:36.939> anyways

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
that would be an option for you anyways

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.520 
that would be an option for you anyways
here<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:38.360> again<00:01:38.600> I'll<00:01:38.869> take<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.170> legs<00:01:39.350> off

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
here it is again I'll take the legs off

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.649 
here it is again I'll take the legs off
and<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.920> few<00:01:40.130> times<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:41.210> can<00:01:41.360> see<00:01:41.539> the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
and on a few times and you can see the

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:57.789 
and on a few times and you can see the
difference<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.729> perspective<00:01:56.799> alright

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
difference in the perspective alright

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.319 
difference in the perspective alright
another<00:01:58.100> thing<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.399> can<00:01:58.549> point<00:01:58.729> out<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.090> on<00:01:59.240> the

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
another thing I can point out is on the

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.539 
another thing I can point out is on the
olympus<00:01:59.630> TG<00:01:59.959> 2<00:02:00.170> there<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.740> digital<00:02:00.979> filter

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
olympus TG 2 there is a digital filter

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.719 
olympus TG 2 there is a digital filter
that<00:02:02.539> allows<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.349> to<00:02:03.649> get<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.280> fisheye

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
that allows you to get the fisheye

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.550 
that allows you to get the fisheye
effect<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.959> is<00:02:06.080> what<00:02:06.259> you're<00:02:06.380> seeing

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
effect and that is what you're seeing

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.979 
effect and that is what you're seeing
right<00:02:06.830> now<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.429> try<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.090> do<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.599> think<00:02:08.630> it's

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
right now I try to do it I think it's

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.170 
right now I try to do it I think it's
terrible<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.519> be<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.759> judge<00:02:10.940> with

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
terrible you can be the judge with

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.910 
terrible you can be the judge with
yourself<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.750> seems<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:12.200> way<00:02:12.410> too<00:02:12.470> much<00:02:12.739> it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
yourself it seems in way too much it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.589 
yourself it seems in way too much it
seems<00:02:13.099> like<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.549> don't<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:14.060> get<00:02:14.180> less<00:02:14.420> of

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
seems like you don't get you get less of

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.240 
seems like you don't get you get less of
a<00:02:14.750> peripheral<00:02:15.530> than<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.830> would<00:02:16.040> with<00:02:16.160> a

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
a peripheral than you would with a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.500 
a peripheral than you would with a
regular<00:02:16.580> fisheye<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.209> right<00:02:17.780> now<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
regular fisheye so right now it's the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.400 
regular fisheye so right now it's the
fisheye<00:02:20.590> digital<00:02:22.120> filter<00:02:23.120> with<00:02:24.079> over<00:02:24.319> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
fisheye digital filter with over the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.900 
fisheye digital filter with over the
lens<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.829> I'm<00:02:25.040> going<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.220> try<00:02:25.340> right<00:02:25.549> now<00:02:25.579> with

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
lens on I'm going to try right now with

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.059 
lens on I'm going to try right now with
the<00:02:26.030> lens<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.450> see<00:02:26.599> what<00:02:26.690> we<00:02:26.780> get<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.200> see

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
the lens on to see what we get and see

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.470 
the lens on to see what we get and see
what<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.489> looks<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:29.209> going<00:02:29.329> to<00:02:29.390> try

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
what it looks like so I'm going to try

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.970 
what it looks like so I'm going to try
that<00:02:29.510> right<00:02:29.780> now<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.170> standing<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.799> same

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
that right now so standing the same

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.229 
that right now so standing the same
place<00:02:31.160> again<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.670> what<00:02:31.790> you're<00:02:31.910> seeing<00:02:32.060> right

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
place again so what you're seeing right

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.930 
place again so what you're seeing right
now<00:02:32.299> is<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:33.620> digital<00:02:34.100> filter<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:34.880> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
now is the digital filter for the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.759 
now is the digital filter for the
fisheye<00:02:35.390> that's<00:02:35.840> built<00:02:36.109> internally<00:02:36.410> into<00:02:36.680> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
fisheye that's built internally into the

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.240 
fisheye that's built internally into the
camera<00:02:37.040> horn<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:38.510> actual<00:02:39.260> lens<00:02:39.739> itself

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
camera horn and the actual lens itself

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.550 
camera horn and the actual lens itself
the<00:02:40.489> fisheye<00:02:40.850> lens<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.019> camera<00:02:42.380> right

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
the fisheye lens is on the camera right

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.729 
the fisheye lens is on the camera right
now<00:02:42.590> as<00:02:42.920> well<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.310> that's<00:02:43.579> what<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.850> get<00:02:44.739> so

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
now as well so that's what you get so

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.500 
now as well so that's what you get so
when<00:02:45.889> I<00:02:45.980> was<00:02:46.069> looking<00:02:46.370> at<00:02:46.459> these<00:02:46.670> Oh<00:02:46.940> ends<00:02:47.209> as<00:02:47.359> I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
when I was looking at these Oh ends as I

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.180 
when I was looking at these Oh ends as I
wasn't<00:02:47.840> able<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.079> find<00:02:48.290> too<00:02:48.410> many<00:02:48.590> examples<00:02:48.650> of

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
wasn't able to find too many examples of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.479 
wasn't able to find too many examples of
the<00:02:49.819> difference<00:02:50.150> between<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.889> lens<00:02:51.889> and<00:02:52.100> nonlin

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
the difference between a lens and nonlin

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.740 
the difference between a lens and nonlin
so<00:02:52.760> hopefully<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.120> helps<00:02:53.329> some<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.600> guys

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
so hopefully it helps some of you guys

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.390 
so hopefully it helps some of you guys
out<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.440> have<00:02:54.620> any<00:02:54.739> questions<00:02:55.160> feel<00:02:55.340> free

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
out and you have any questions feel free

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.670 
out and you have any questions feel free
