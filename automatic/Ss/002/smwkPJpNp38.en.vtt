00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
it I'll definitely make this again I

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.190 
it I'll definitely make this again I
think<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.300> addition<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.810> would<00:03:19.020> make

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
think one addition that I would make

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.360 
think one addition that I would make
that'd<00:03:19.380> be<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:19.740> bit<00:03:19.920> different<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.310> think

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
that'd be a little bit different I think

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.980 
that'd be a little bit different I think
I<00:03:20.670> might<00:03:20.820> add<00:03:20.970> some<00:03:21.150> chili<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.900> make

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
I might add some chili to this to make

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.540 
I might add some chili to this to make
this<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.200> little<00:03:22.410> bit<00:03:22.560> spicier<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.250> then<00:03:23.520> I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
this a little bit spicier and then I

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.030 
this a little bit spicier and then I
think<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.880> would<00:03:23.940> be<00:03:24.060> even<00:03:24.360> warmer<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.620> even

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
think it would be even warmer and even

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.250 
think it would be even warmer and even
more<00:03:26.190> satisfying<00:03:26.400> as<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> winter<00:03:27.240> dish<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
more satisfying as a winter dish the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.630 
more satisfying as a winter dish the
salt<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.650> found<00:03:28.830> was<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.010> good<00:03:29.400> really

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
balanced not overly salty and I should
