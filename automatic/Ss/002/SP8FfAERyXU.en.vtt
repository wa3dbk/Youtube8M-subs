00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.680
Alright!

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.841
This is John Kohler with GrowingYourGreens.com!

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:08.200
Had a question lately, the other day—and
I get it a lot actually so I’m making a

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.000
video for the first time about this subject.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.280
“Hey John, what do you do about that’s
stealing you food?”

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.760
Well let me tell ya!

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.020
If you’re gonna steal my food, you’re
gonna get the pitchfork!!

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.120
And this is a fiberglass handle so it’s
not gonna break when I’m hitting you over

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.120
the head!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.290
Okay, all joking aside, you know, I really
don’t have an issue with people stealing

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.350
any of the food here.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:38.160
I live in nice, middle-class neighborhood
here in suburbia in Northern California, so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.090
I’m not like in downtown LA or in New York
City or anything.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.080
And the other thing, you know, there is some
traffic walking up and down my street—it’s

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.079
not a busy street buy any means—but the
other thing is, you know, most people don’t

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.380
even think about food growing in the front
yard.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.380
“That’s ridiculous!

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.329
You grow a lawn in your front yard, you don’t
grow food in your front yard!

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.969
This isn’t stuff to eat!

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.589
This is all stuff to look at to make it look
pretty!

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.960
You know, food doesn’t come from the ground!

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.030
It comes from McDonald’s, and Burger King,
and all the fast food and restaurants—wait,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.430
maybe it even comes from the supermarket…

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.729
But it doesn’t come from the front yard!

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:19.729
That’s ridiculous!”

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.799
So most people it’s just out of their consciousness,
unfortunately, that all this is edible, organic,

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.049
and actually really high quality.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.189
So on the occasional person that comes by
and that’s admiring my garden and I happen

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.909
to be out here—and I’m out here a lot,
you know tending it, walking around, hanging

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.700
out, I was out eating lunch today—and they’ll
make comments on my garden and say “Wow,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.340
what’s that?” and in many cases, I’ll
offer people walking by free food to bring

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.340
home.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.740
I really like to introduce people to new tastes
and new varieties, you know.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.430
Last year, I gave some red Russian kale and
some dino kale to different people and told

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.250
them that they can eat it raw and they were
absolutely amazed!

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.630
Like “I could eat this raw?” and I’m
like “Yeah!

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.490
Just cut it up into small bits and put it
in a salad and it tastes really good.”

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.170
And that’s because the kale at the store,
it’s been picked a week, a week and a half,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.379
two weeks ago and it’s shipped to you and
then it starts to taste bitter.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.989
And that’s when it starts to go bad.

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.910
But fresh kale grown organically in the right
soil, and soil amendments, and rock dust minerals,

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.030
tastes really good.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.400
But yeah, I mean, I have flowers here and
most people would never think that you could

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.719
eat flowers, they’re just something that
you give at weddings or put on a table for

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.329
decorations, but all my flowers are edible.

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.120
And even these flowers are edible.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.379
Arugula flowers.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.109
And so I have arugula here in the front if
people think they could eat this.

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.459
They can certainly try.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.690
Most people might not love the taste, I like
the taste of fresh arugula.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.719
And it’s all edible.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:59.939
Now, if I did have some issues, if I did—I
generally believe people are good—and you

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.040
know I have had a couple of instances where
I have seen people pick tomatoes and that’s

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.549
where you’re gonna get into some challenges.

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.129
When you grow some more common crops, like
tomatoes or even peppers I think I’ve had

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.459
some issues with, corn, where people know
what the hell they are.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.269
Other people, they don’t know what arugula
is.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.529
They probably never seen spinach growing in
the ground!

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:27.829
Or dino kale, man, that thing’s really weird
and it’s all crinkled leaves!

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.919
Yeah, so most people don’t know…

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.049
But if I did have some issues and I’ve had
friends—talked to some friends that live

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.739
on a busy street or maybe lower income areas
that people actually eat vegetables in those

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.249
areas because they don’t have a lot of money
to buy the expensive stuff.

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:50.140
I would use something like this that I put
on my arbor here.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.400
This is basically hog fencing.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.680
It’s galvanized, or I would use hurricane
fencing around the perimeter of my lot and

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.389
then I would actually grow things up that,
so I actually have the community garden—I’ve

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.650
actually had some issues where some of my
food disappears because it’s basically a

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.019
walkthrough, a cut-through area and some of
my cucumbers have disappeared but it’s not

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.430
like they’re stripped.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.389
So I tend to plant things that are less desirable,
that I don’t particularly care for, on the

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.750
boundaries where there’s a lot of traffic
so things like green beans, not too into…

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.520
Fava beans, actually this season I’m planting
against the fence and toward the fences that

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.370
you can’t get to, that’s where I’ll
plant snow peas and other things that I really

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.370
like.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.020
So plant things that’ll vine up, that’ll
fill in, so people can’t see.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.819
And actually this place in the summertime,
I have a big melon trellis here that you couldn’t

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.250
really even see what I was growing in my yard
cause it’s great privacy.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.460
But I would do hurricane fencing or something
like this around the perimeter of your yard

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.340
so the literally can’t reach in or they
could reach in this far and, you know, plant

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.229
tomatoes and things out of reach.

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.600
But plant other edibles to grow up the fence.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.180
The other thing I’ll do is often times I’ll
go around to my neighbors and share food so

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.699
when I have bountiful harvest, especially
in the summertime, they all—who doesn’t

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:02.840
love cherry tomatoes?

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.240
So I’ll go around door to door and give
all my neighbors cherry tomatoes.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.210
I’ll also ask them “Hey, what’s your
favorite fruit or vegetable?” and I’ll

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.210
grow a couple plants for them.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.300
The lady over here liked eggplants and things
like that.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.850
So I don’t really have an issue with people
stealing my food maybe because I don’t really

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.740
even think about it, but someone asks or somebody’s
admiring and I’ll be happy to share as long

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.169
as I have bountiful harvests as I do with
many things.

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.979
Want to just point out one last thing, let’s
come over to this side…and actually, you

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:40.280
know, you could work with your neighbors too,
so if they’re admiring your food or there’s

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.169
a problem, you could actually offer to farm
their land.

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.699
So let’s come over here…and this is my
property line over here.

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.370
This is where it ends, this raised bed that
has the edging on it, and then if you just

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.660
go over a little bit further, this section
right here is my neighbor’s yard.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.210
So I talked to my neighbors and every year,
they loved tomatoes.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.039
So it started out with me having about twenty
extra tomato plants, or ten extra tomato plants,

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.110
and one year I offered “Can I plant these
tomato plants on your property?

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.099
You can harvest all the tomatoes from them
you want and I’ll maintain them and I’ll

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.909
even water them.”

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.860
They said sure, so I’m gonna do that again
this year, we’re getting ready for planting

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.990
the tomatoes out on their property again so
they could have lots of tomatoes.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.139
But in the off season, I planted more arugula.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.650
Arugula grows really well, we try to keep
this nice and maintained and looking nice

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.090
and it’s less that my neighbor basically
has to grow or weed whack, because this is

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.689
all basically crabgrass over here.

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:46.680
We do need to clean this up a little bit,
the arugula’s gone to bolt and flower…

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.639
So this is John Kohler with GrowingYourGreens.com.

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.069
Hope you’ve learned a little bit on how
I deal with people stealing my produce, which

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.469
doesn’t really happen.

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:55.830
So we’ll see you next time.
