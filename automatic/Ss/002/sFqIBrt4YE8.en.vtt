quicker I just touched up my face with a

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.050 
quicker I just touched up my face with a
little<00:05:07.360> bit<00:05:07.509> of<00:05:07.659> setting<00:05:08.020> powder<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:09.060> it

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
little bit of setting powder and it

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
little bit of setting powder and it
brought<00:05:10.389> down<00:05:10.659> some<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:12.479> shininess<00:05:13.479> I

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
brought down some of the shininess I

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.659 
brought down some of the shininess I
don't<00:05:14.889> think<00:05:15.219> it<00:05:15.400> made<00:05:16.150> me<00:05:16.710> become<00:05:17.710> too<00:05:18.219> oily<00:05:18.490> I

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
don't think it made me become too oily I

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.189 
don't think it made me become too oily I
thought<00:05:18.909> it<00:05:19.000> was<00:05:19.090> actually<00:05:19.389> gonna<00:05:19.509> be<00:05:19.900> the

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
thought it was actually gonna be the

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.839 
thought it was actually gonna be the
opposite<00:05:20.590> that<00:05:20.800> I<00:05:20.830> was<00:05:20.949> gonna<00:05:21.039> be<00:05:21.159> super<00:05:21.550> oily

opposite that I was gonna be super oily
throughout<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.270> day<00:05:22.419> but<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.110> actually

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
throughout the day but it actually

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.189 
throughout the day but it actually
wasn't<00:05:23.800> too<00:05:24.009> too<00:05:24.460> bad<00:05:24.639> which<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:25.240> I<00:05:25.509> like

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
wasn't too too bad which I I like

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.140 
wasn't too too bad which I I like
because<00:05:26.610> especially<00:05:27.610> if<00:05:27.759> I'm<00:05:27.849> going<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.060> be

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.159 
using a BB cream under my foundation for
more<00:05:30.340> coverage<00:05:30.699> or<00:05:30.849> to<00:05:31.180> act<00:05:31.360> as<00:05:31.539> a<00:05:31.569> primer<00:05:31.900> I

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
more coverage or to act as a primer I

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.240 
more coverage or to act as a primer I
don't<00:05:32.710> want<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.009> to<00:05:33.129> be<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.340> really<00:05:34.620> oily<00:05:35.620> base

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
don't want it to be a really oily base

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.649 
don't want it to be a really oily base
and<00:05:36.550> then<00:05:36.639> that<00:05:36.759> means<00:05:36.940> my<00:05:37.060> foundation<00:05:37.599> is

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
and then that means my foundation is

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.600 
and then that means my foundation is
gonna<00:05:37.810> be<00:05:37.990> oily<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.560> then<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.919> powers<00:05:39.340> that<00:05:39.430> I

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
gonna be oily and then the powers that I

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.519 
gonna be oily and then the powers that I
said<00:05:39.849> it's<00:05:40.120> still<00:05:40.360> all<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.900> oils<00:05:41.139> gonna<00:05:41.289> seep

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:41.529 
said it's still all the oils gonna seep

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:46.050 
said it's still all the oils gonna seep
through<00:05:41.770> so<00:05:42.310> that<00:05:43.090> is<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.389> plus<00:05:43.779> I<00:05:44.340> do<00:05:45.340> find<00:05:45.819> that

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
through so that is a plus I do find that

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.420 
through so that is a plus I do find that
I<00:05:46.210> think<00:05:46.599> I'm<00:05:47.020> becoming<00:05:47.469> more<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:47.949> more<00:05:48.009> okay

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
I think I'm becoming more and more okay

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.129 
I think I'm becoming more and more okay
with<00:05:48.639> the<00:05:48.759> color<00:05:49.060> it's<00:05:49.360> not<00:05:49.569> as<00:05:49.690> dark<00:05:49.930> as<00:05:50.050> I

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
with the color it's not as dark as I

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.990 
with the color it's not as dark as I
thought<00:05:50.349> it<00:05:50.529> was<00:05:50.680> what<00:05:51.159> I<00:05:51.190> did<00:05:51.460> like<00:05:51.669> about<00:05:51.699> the

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
thought it was what I did like about the

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.580 
thought it was what I did like about the
BB<00:05:52.240> cream<00:05:52.389> though<00:05:52.659> was<00:05:52.870> that<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.110> was<00:05:53.259> thicker

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
BB cream though was that it was thicker

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.290 
BB cream though was that it was thicker
and<00:05:54.009> I<00:05:54.099> didn't<00:05:54.460> know<00:05:54.550> if<00:05:54.669> I<00:05:54.729> would<00:05:54.880> like<00:05:55.060> this

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
and I didn't know if I would like this

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.120 
and I didn't know if I would like this
or<00:05:55.479> not<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:55.719> really<00:05:56.080> like<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.409> feeling<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:56.979> this

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
or not I really like the feeling of this

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.830 
or not I really like the feeling of this
BB<00:05:57.490> cream<00:05:57.610> when<00:05:57.849> you<00:05:57.940> put<00:05:58.120> it<00:05:58.210> on<00:05:58.419> it<00:05:58.690> was<00:05:58.810> like

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
BB cream when you put it on it was like

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.689 
BB cream when you put it on it was like
a<00:05:59.020> nice<00:05:59.440> moisturizer<00:06:00.430> almost<00:06:00.969> so<00:06:01.349> I<00:06:02.699> almost

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
a nice moisturizer almost so I almost

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.519 
a nice moisturizer almost so I almost
think<00:06:04.029> that<00:06:04.270> I<00:06:04.300> would<00:06:04.479> skip<00:06:04.750> my<00:06:04.900> moisturizer

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
think that I would skip my moisturizer

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.800 
think that I would skip my moisturizer
step<00:06:06.009> and<00:06:06.250> use<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.580> BB<00:06:06.729> cream<00:06:06.969> just<00:06:07.210> alone

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
step and use the BB cream just alone

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:08.999 
step and use the BB cream just alone
because<00:06:08.259> it<00:06:08.379> should<00:06:08.560> be<00:06:08.680> like<00:06:08.860> your

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
because it should be like your

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.300 
because it should be like your
moisturizer<00:06:09.490> your<00:06:09.759> primer<00:06:10.090> and<00:06:10.979> a<00:06:11.979> little<00:06:12.190> bit

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
moisturizer your primer and a little bit

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.649 
moisturizer your primer and a little bit
of<00:06:12.370> coverage<00:06:12.639> all-in-one<00:06:13.120> because<00:06:13.330> that<00:06:13.449> is

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
of coverage all-in-one because that is

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:15.089 
of coverage all-in-one because that is
what<00:06:13.870> a<00:06:13.900> BB<00:06:14.050> cream<00:06:14.199> is<00:06:14.440> supposed<00:06:14.500> to<00:06:14.710> do<00:06:14.860> so<00:06:15.069> I

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099

what a BB cream is supposed to do so I
did<00:06:15.250> like<00:06:15.610> that<00:06:15.639> because<00:06:16.360> when<00:06:16.479> I<00:06:16.539> put<00:06:16.750> it<00:06:16.870> on

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
did like that because when I put it on

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.200 
did like that because when I put it on
it<00:06:17.169> was<00:06:17.289> like<00:06:17.319> nice<00:06:17.860> coverage<00:06:18.520> I<00:06:18.669> felt<00:06:18.909> like<00:06:19.090> I

my<00:06:41.600> final<00:06:41.930> thoughts<00:06:42.110> on<00:06:42.230> this<00:06:42.350> BB<00:06:42.650> cream<00:06:42.800> are

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
my final thoughts on this BB cream are

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.040 
my final thoughts on this BB cream are
that<00:06:43.280> because<00:06:43.850> it's<00:06:44.090> still<00:06:44.330> a<00:06:44.360> drugstore

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
that because it's still a drugstore

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.990 
that because it's still a drugstore
product<00:06:45.500> yes<00:06:45.980> it's<00:06:46.190> definitely<00:06:46.370> higher<00:06:46.760> end

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
product yes it's definitely higher end

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.470 
product yes it's definitely higher end
because<00:06:47.270> this<00:06:47.480> did<00:06:47.780> cost<00:06:48.050> $29<00:06:48.890> I<00:06:49.130> still<00:06:50.120> think

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
because this did cost $29 I still think

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.060 
because this did cost $29 I still think
that<00:06:50.600> I<00:06:50.930> don't<00:06:51.230> think<00:06:51.470> it<00:06:51.530> would<00:06:51.650> be<00:06:51.770> worth

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
that I don't think it would be worth

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.210 
that I don't think it would be worth
buying<00:06:52.520> it<00:06:52.850> at<00:06:52.970> $29<00:06:53.810> if<00:06:54.050> it<00:06:54.380> acts<00:06:54.620> the<00:06:54.830> same<00:06:55.010> way

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
buying it at $29 if it acts the same way

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.670 
buying it at $29 if it acts the same way
that<00:06:55.370> a<00:06:55.550> $10<00:06:56.090> BB<00:06:56.480> cream<00:06:56.750> would<00:06:56.900> actually<00:06:57.410> I<00:06:57.440> did

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
that a $10 BB cream would actually I did

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.190 
that a $10 BB cream would actually I did
buy<00:06:57.860> it<00:06:57.920> at<00:06:58.220> 1450<00:06:59.000> for<00:06:59.180> like<00:06:59.300> four<00:06:59.600> items<00:06:59.990> which

buy it at 1450 for like four items which

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.390 
buy it at 1450 for like four items which
is<00:07:00.380> a<00:07:00.650> scorn

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 
is a scorn

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.830
