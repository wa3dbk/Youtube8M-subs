00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
different lines and ours is a Japanese I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:27.980 
different lines and ours is a Japanese I
don't<00:00:26.910> know<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.180> there's<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:27.779> say

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
don't know what there's what they say

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.230 
don't know what there's what they say
but<00:00:28.050> they're<00:00:28.410> from<00:00:28.590> Bandai<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.250> they're<00:00:30.090> kind

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
but they're from Bandai and they're kind

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.700 
but they're from Bandai and they're kind
of<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> model<00:00:30.779> kids<00:00:30.990> were<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.439> come<00:00:31.590> in

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
of like the model kids were they come in

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.860 
of like the model kids were they come in
pieces<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.910> had<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.149> snap<00:00:33.690> them

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
pieces and then you had to snap them

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.389 
pieces and then you had to snap them
together<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.770> would<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.100> bit<00:00:35.309> of

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

really<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.200> sticker<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.560> his<00:02:20.709> nose<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.610> I

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
really like the sticker on his nose so I

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.300 
really like the sticker on his nose so I
think<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.019> might<00:02:23.200> take<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.560> off<00:02:23.739> because<00:02:23.980> all

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
think I might take that off because all

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.890 
think I might take that off because all
it<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:25.000> yellow<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.750> then

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
it really is is just yellow and then

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.930 
it really is is just yellow and then

though<00:04:05.730> his<00:04:05.970> arms<00:04:06.330> do<00:04:06.570> little<00:04:07.140> arms<00:04:07.500> move<00:04:07.770> up

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
though his arms do little arms move up

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.870 
though his arms do little arms move up
and<00:04:08.070> down<00:04:09.380> his<00:04:10.380> mouth<00:04:10.710> opens<00:04:11.460> and<00:04:11.550> closes<00:04:13.880> and

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
and down his mouth opens and closes and

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.070 
and down his mouth opens and closes and
his<00:04:15.780> head<00:04:15.990> tilts<00:04:16.470> up<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.640> down<00:04:17.820> left<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.780> right

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.060 
and in his wings go up and actually
moved<00:04:21.810> together<00:04:21.959> so<00:04:22.410> when<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.650> flatten<00:04:22.920> one

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
moved together so when you flatten one

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.200 
moved together so when you flatten one
they<00:04:23.220> like<00:04:23.370> flock<00:04:23.640> together

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
they like flock together

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.320 
they like flock together
that's<00:04:25.050> neat<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:26.460> then<00:04:26.610> his<00:04:26.730> tail<00:04:26.970> is<00:04:27.150> three

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
that's neat and then his tail is three

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.750 
that's neat and then his tail is three
different<00:04:27.660> pieces<00:04:27.780> um<00:04:28.170> so<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:28.740> can<00:04:28.950> move<00:04:29.100> all

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
different pieces um so I can move all

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.550 
different pieces um so I can move all
the<00:04:29.910> way<00:04:30.000> around<00:04:30.300> like<00:04:30.450> left<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.050> right<00:04:31.290> and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
the way around like left to right and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.020 
the way around like left to right and
then<00:04:32.130> they<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.370> all<00:04:32.490> sit<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:32.730> know<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:32.970> you

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
then they can all sit you know that you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.970 
then they can all sit you know that you
can<00:04:33.180> bend<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.450> so<00:04:33.600> it's<00:04:33.750> like<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.080> like<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> wiggly
