it's a totally new device the ecosystem

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.749 
it's a totally new device the ecosystem
is<00:04:43.780> somewhat<00:04:44.229> already<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.740> place<00:04:44.949> and<00:04:45.580> we've

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
is somewhat already in place and we've

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.820 
is somewhat already in place and we've
also<00:04:45.940> signed<00:04:46.419> up<00:04:46.599> lots<00:04:46.930> of<00:04:47.080> partners<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.680> make

that's<00:04:50.160> what<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.370> think<00:04:50.670> will<00:04:50.850> change<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:52.110> the
