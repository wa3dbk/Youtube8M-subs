00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
above and that's just where I'm pretty

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.920 
above and that's just where I'm pretty
much<00:01:49.560> ruthless<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.399> try<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> win<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.750> many

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

times as possible with ain't not always

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.490 
times as possible with ain't not always
the<00:01:53.909> best<00:01:54.030> setups<00:01:54.420> definitely<00:01:54.930> no<00:01:55.079> Giants

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the best setups definitely no Giants

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
the best setups definitely no Giants
armor<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.009> that's<00:01:56.210> just<00:01:57.210> ridiculous

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
armor I think that's just ridiculous

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.569 
armor I think that's just ridiculous
it's<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> best<00:01:58.259> set<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.040> you're<00:01:59.250> wearing

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
it's the best set and if you're wearing

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.679 
it's the best set and if you're wearing
it<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.909> an<00:01:59.969> advantage<00:02:00.210> over<00:02:00.360> someone

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it you have an advantage over someone

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.870 
it you have an advantage over someone
who's<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:00.930> no<00:02:01.170> matter<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.670> really

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
who's not no matter what so it really

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.520 
who's not no matter what so it really
would<00:02:03.090> create<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> meta<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.200> anybody

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
would create a meta and if anybody

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.959 
would create a meta and if anybody
wanted<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.890> compete<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.430> meta<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.759> Dark

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
wanted to compete in the meta in Dark

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.609 
wanted to compete in the meta in Dark
Souls<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.659> would<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.899> really<00:02:07.079> boring<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.500> my

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
Souls it would be really boring in my

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.499 
Souls it would be really boring in my
opinion<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.099> everybody<00:02:08.759> wears<00:02:09.060> em<00:02:09.209> armor

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
opinion because everybody wears em armor

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.520 
opinion because everybody wears em armor
but<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.619> bonus<00:02:10.920> clip<00:02:11.220> like

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
but this is just a bonus clip like

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.520 
but this is just a bonus clip like
we<00:02:11.770> do<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.040> where<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.280> get<00:02:12.340> an<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:13.290> horrible<00:02:14.290> lag

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
we do this where I get an a horrible lag

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.040 
we do this where I get an a horrible lag
back<00:02:14.860> stack<00:02:15.190> for<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:16.150> right<00:02:16.330> Pierre<00:02:16.600> with<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
i've actually been playing some

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.280 
i've actually been playing some
minecraft<00:02:28.989> as<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.980> late<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.569> maybe<00:02:31.569> quite

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
minecraft as of late and maybe quite

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.660 
minecraft as of late and maybe quite
possibly<00:02:32.739> i<00:02:32.800> could<00:02:32.980> do<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.100> series<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.640> i

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
possibly i could do a series of that i

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.580 
possibly i could do a series of that i
actually<00:02:33.819> found<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.330> seed<00:02:34.600> where<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.260> makes<00:02:35.440> you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
actually found a seed where it makes you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.280 
actually found a seed where it makes you
this<00:02:35.680> giant<00:02:36.100> island<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.330> i<00:02:37.750> think<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
this giant island and i think it's a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.690 
this giant island and i think it's a
small<00:02:38.560> world<00:02:38.590> or<00:02:39.010> something<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.370> where

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
small world or something like that where

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.740 
small world or something like that where
I<00:02:39.730> found<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.000> seed<00:02:40.239> where<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.480> makes<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:40.720> a

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
I found the seed where it makes you a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.900 
I found the seed where it makes you a
giant<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.500> pretty<00:02:41.650> much<00:02:41.770> dying<00:02:42.010> island<00:02:42.400> it's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
giant it pretty much dying island it's

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.699 
giant it pretty much dying island it's
pretty<00:02:43.120> cool<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.390> was<00:02:44.050> exploring<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.500> earlier

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
pretty cool I was exploring it earlier

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:45.690 
pretty cool I was exploring it earlier
and<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:44.830> could<00:02:44.980> possibly<00:02:45.280> do<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:45.550> some

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
and I could possibly do like some

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.250 
and I could possibly do like some
hardcore<00:02:45.910> mode<00:02:46.300> on<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.720> or<00:02:46.870> something<00:02:47.170> like

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
hardcore mode on that or something like
