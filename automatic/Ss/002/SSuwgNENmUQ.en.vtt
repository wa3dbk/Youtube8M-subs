00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.130
 today we are going to prepare a dessert one 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.740
 snack in this case is a boob time 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.840
 or a coca legend very typical in 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.570
 valencia in the Valencian community but 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.760
 more in valencia, I'm going to teach 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.079
 what a simple way you are going to make a 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.050
 spectacular coca 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.109
 in this case we are going to use medium 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.220
 liter right 500 grams of flour 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.770
 cake shop 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:48.340
 also 500 grams of sugar 250 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.420
 milliliters of oil 100 milliliters of 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.870
 squeezed freshly squeezed orange 4 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.570
 large eggs we will also need or 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.630
 long-life soda paperines or 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.790
 yeast a sachet also a 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.460
 zest of a lemon from the rind of the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.510
 lemon and also the after face of a 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:14.229
 orange with this let's start in 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.600
 first place let's put the eggs in 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.220
 a big container because here 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.500
 we are going to incorporate all the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.560
 ingredients 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.920
 so we started putting the four 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920
 eggs 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.340
 and once we have 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.360
 let's beat a little 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.049
 and then we add the sugar 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.890
 of the 500 grams we will leave about 50 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.560
 grams because you'll see what they are for 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.229
 so of these 500 that we have I'm going to 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.229
 book about 100 100 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.890
 we add that I do not know why it seems to me that 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.890
 this bowl is going to be small and I'm going 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.230
 to have to move it but good a 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.610
 Once everything is integrated, let's add 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.610
 the zest of the soul 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.540
 good as you see I have changed the 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.349
 recipient and now let's go 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.790
 incorporating the flour while the 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:22.379
 we are sifting 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.610
 come on and we'll also put here you see the 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.370
 yeast 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.210
 as I already told you it can also be 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.450
 here in Valencia is used a lot 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.450
 what about envelope sodas 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.300
 we look at it and move 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.860
 so we will do 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.860
 what is half a kilo 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.590
 Well, here we have already put half a kilo 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.600
 of flour and as we have always put 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.930
 to heat or apply to encourage the oven to 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.830
 180 degrees now in a container that 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.250
 here in valencia is a container of 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.340
 tin 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.570
 just like this would be in this case it's 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.180
 round but usually here in 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.430
 Valencia is an angular plate 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.530
 but here we are not going to make spending we are going to 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.330
 use what we already have at home what 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.210
 we have put a little butter 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.610
 we have put flour and now we are going to 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.139
 add to the container 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.710
 well the mosque that I have 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.710
 prepared 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.520
 now we will overturn 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.100
 and as I say you always have to use 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.100
 what we have at home 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.119
 will come out 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:59.969
 spectacular and now with the sugar that 

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:02.300
 above what we had desired 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:05.620
 to throw over 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.620
 well enough 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.810
 a crust at the end 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.810
 of cooking 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.780
 now if we do not take it to the oven and what 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.310
 we will leave for about 40 45 minutes 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.770
 when we see that it is cooked it will be 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.360
 put it in and check in the hoops social 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.199
 at that moment we will have it ready 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.199
 to get out of me 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:35.159
 good and this is the rich end result
