00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.550
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.500
 maracasi and you watch the show chic 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.410
 position issue 41 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.039
 the first location is on the map 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.900
 hidden village in square b 9 you 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.019
 need a fast tank 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.930
 and also help allies need both 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.470
 at least two tanks to get you pushed 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.630
 and it certainly is a big disadvantage but 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.530
 he is from this place you can 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.469
 sweep 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.570
 vast territory and here you will not 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.059
 put in one place will be able to go 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 further attack and will shoot at 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.090
 enemies who shine in traffic accidents and at the same time 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.239
 no buildings do not disturb you you can 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.430
 cause much damage from here 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.770
 sweep through the vast territory but 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.260
 really worth noting that if you are here 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 light the opponents will also be able to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.789
 it's easy for you to shoot 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.880
 because shelter is a bit of a place 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.159
 open though as you can see it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 cities are one big and if you drive 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.650
 farther then it is likely you can 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.080
 find here some interesting 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.470
 for example, you will tank the tower 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.049
 due to uneven terrain or you can 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.220
 completely hide your tank and you will 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.790
 shoot at enemies 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.329
 when they are distracted well and generally very 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.759
 good position and here you can almost 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.710
 drive to the enemy base and you will be 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.890
 shoot opponents from another 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.079
 angle in the stern and sides but also stands 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.110
 note that it will deliver very well 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.610
 orton so be careful well so in 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.350
 Overall a very interesting direction 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.560
 The following location is on 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.500
 tundra map in square e9 and you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.610
 Be sure to need a fast tank with a strong 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.070
 For example, by a tower you are going to this place and 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.920
 meet hostile here aggressively 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.950
 tanks as soon as someone leaves 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.310
 you shoot him on board preferably a harp 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.340
 tim and drive off to cover 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.870
 opponents are starting to aggro on you but 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.840
 you can think that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.610
 climb a little higher and there is a great 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.130
 site where you can well tank the tower and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.069
 Of course for this position is very necessary 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.800
 team assistance is advisable to go here 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.380
 cocked for example you can pull 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.750
 opponents on themselves and sovzvodny below 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.269
 next to the stones will shoot at enemies 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.120
 who ride you well and generally 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.000
 great place besides here lacks 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.180
 orton but true I think that basically 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.090
 This tactic will give you a ride if you will 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.370
 top not in a very difficult battle and in such 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.910
 case you can just socks for 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.400
 drag in general such a daring tactic 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.700
 allows you to do not only a lot of damage 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.970
 0 also drag the fight unless of course you 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.860
 wisely everyone did a great chic 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.360
 position on which you can have fun and 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.109
 next we have a point on the map 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.900
 windstorm squared d 1 and you 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.540
 you need a very smart tank for example 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.660
 hellcat desirable us good angles 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.910
 vertical pickup I specifically 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.430
 show all the way here 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.170
 stop by because it's not so easy 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.130
 as it may seem 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.560
 and of course you will require time and 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.230
 a little effort but 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.829
 from here you can shoot all 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.959
 enemies who leave the city also 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.690
 from here you shoot very well 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.930
 enemies who attack the upper part 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.079
 cards and you can easily on them 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.329
 shoot and not even glow though if 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.790
 all the same opponents will drive up too 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.190
 close then most likely they will see you and 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.130
 In this case, you will have something like this 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.709
 hide but good there is such here 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.889
 small rough terrain for which 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.370
 you can even hide a tank 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.799
 but I think itâ€™s still open 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.930
 position and with light can all 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.980
 will end very sadly and you 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.430
 will destroy 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.100
 but if opponents are somewhere far away 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.920
 drive then you can without problems them 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:33.270
 shoot so let's say how 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:36.000
 sniper firing from afar next 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.240
 point is on the sandy river map in 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.440
 storm mode and you'll need quick 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.730
 light tanks for example 1390 and fly to 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.740
 square g5 at the beginning of the battle immediately 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:53.040
 warn tactics extremely risky 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.040
 and if suddenly the opponents will go exactly 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.230
 here to you and this happens quite often 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.530
 on this map you will have to be from here 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.110
 dump but if there's nobody there it is 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.200
 the place is just wonderful and from here you are 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.540
 will be able to shoot at enemies and at the same time 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.810
 most likely you won't even glow 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.600
 if you stand next to a bush of course well 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.870
 and if suddenly opponents start rashid 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.510
 square g1 then consider what you cut down 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.920
 jackpot as you can with ease 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.070
 stuff it into the sides 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.820
 if they light you there is where 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.460
 hide for example behind stones and in general 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.530
 just gorgeous but not worth it 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.170
 forget that here with ease gets 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.020
 art so better not stand if 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.880
 lit up and do not think that it is for you 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.420
 will not shoot because you are retinue 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.050
 doc 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.900
 Well, in general, very good. it is clear that 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.870
 not always be able to apply but in 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.910
 the whole is just gorgeous and the last 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.480
 location is on map 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.730
 ruinberg squared q 1 any 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.010
 a small tank preferably strong 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.830
 a tower or a good disguise 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.250
 get up here in this place and here you can 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.250
 Excellent tank tower can be completely 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.070
 hide your tank and if you have a good 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.980
 masking then it is likely opponents 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.340
 won't even shine you well if they have 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.770
 Of course a bad review and the most important thing is that 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.220
 from here you can shoot perfectly 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:29.400
 those places where opponents are most often 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.190
 Well, in general, smart position advise 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.230
 to all 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.870
