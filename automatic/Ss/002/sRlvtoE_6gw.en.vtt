excellent staff teaching staff provide
the<00:00:30.349> students<00:00:30.739> with<00:00:30.769> everything<00:00:31.369> they<00:00:31.460> need

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
the students with everything they need

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.300 
the students with everything they need
to<00:00:31.640> know<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.880> get<00:00:32.750> physics<00:00:33.170> working<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.130> do<00:00:34.190> it

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
to know to get physics working and do it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.360 
to know to get physics working and do it
well<00:00:34.490> but<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:35.300> has<00:00:35.330> to<00:00:35.570> come<00:00:35.630> from<00:00:35.870> both<00:00:35.990> sides

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
well but it has to come from both sides

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.590 
well but it has to come from both sides
students<00:00:37.370> if<00:00:37.520> they<00:00:37.700> put<00:00:37.910> in<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.120> hours

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
students if they put in the hours

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.690 
students if they put in the hours
then<00:00:39.080> we're<00:00:39.230> fairly<00:00:39.470> sure<00:00:39.590> they<00:00:39.890> can<00:00:40.070> become<00:00:40.670> a

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
then we're fairly sure they can become a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.490 
then we're fairly sure they can become a
successful<00:00:40.910> student<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:42.050> select<00:00:42.410> our

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
successful student we select our

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.080 
successful student we select our
students<00:00:42.950> based<00:00:43.430> on<00:00:43.580> their<00:00:43.640> a-level<00:00:44.060> results

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
students based on their a-level results

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.630 
students based on their a-level results
and<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:45.050> know<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.710> pretty<00:00:45.890> stiff<00:00:46.160> we<00:00:46.460> ask

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
and we know that the pretty stiff we ask

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.010 
and we know that the pretty stiff we ask
for<00:00:46.790> A's<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.150> B's<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:47.360> physics<00:00:47.900> and

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
for A's and B's in physics and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.260 
for A's and B's in physics and
mathematics<00:00:48.700> here<00:00:49.700> at<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.880> University<00:00:50.240> of

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
mathematics here at the University of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.210 
mathematics here at the University of
Leeds<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.780> key<00:00:51.080> feature<00:00:51.440> are<00:00:51.680> physically<00:00:52.100> I

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
Leeds the key feature are physically I

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.970 
Leeds the key feature are physically I
think<00:00:52.610> is<00:00:52.790> that<00:00:53.030> it's<00:00:53.630> research<00:00:54.110> focused<00:00:54.710> so

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
think is that it's research focused so

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.400 
think is that it's research focused so
we<00:00:55.100> take<00:00:55.460> an<00:00:55.670> a-level<00:00:56.180> students<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:57.050> we<00:00:57.140> build

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
we take an a-level students and we build

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.960 
we take an a-level students and we build
them<00:00:57.530> for<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.770> first<00:00:57.980> two<00:00:58.220> years<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.820> they're

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
them for the first two years so they're

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.250 
them for the first two years so they're
actually<00:00:59.210> able<00:00:59.390> in<00:00:59.720> their<00:00:59.840> third<00:00:59.990> and<00:01:00.170> fourth

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
actually able in their third and fourth

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.110 
actually able in their third and fourth
year<00:01:00.410> to<00:01:00.650> directly<00:01:01.130> contribute<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:02.030> the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
year to directly contribute to the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.850 
year to directly contribute to the

teaching<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.220> lot<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.699> research<00:03:29.209> that

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
teaching so a lot of the research that

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.960 
teaching so a lot of the research that
we<00:03:29.569> do<00:03:29.780> will<00:03:30.109> feed<00:03:30.409> into<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.769> lectures<00:03:31.280> so

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
we do will feed into the lectures so

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.479 
we do will feed into the lectures so
even<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:33.109> your<00:03:33.319> first<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.829> second<00:03:34.159> year<00:03:34.340> you

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080 
research led University and that's very
much<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.470> case<00:05:10.650> in<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:11.040> school<00:05:11.340> of<00:05:11.580> physics

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
much the case in the school of physics

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.290 
much the case in the school of physics
and<00:05:12.360> astronomy<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:13.530> one<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.340> features<00:05:15.270> of

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
and astronomy so one of the features of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.600 
and astronomy so one of the features of
our<00:05:15.690> degree<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.740> all<00:05:16.950> undergraduate

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
our degree is that all undergraduate

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.450 
our degree is that all undergraduate
will<00:05:18.120> do<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.570> research<00:05:19.080> project<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:20.070> that's

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
will do a research project and that's

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.760 
will do a research project and that's
not<00:05:20.910> just<00:05:20.970> something<00:05:21.480> that<00:05:21.510> we've<00:05:21.840> knocked<00:05:22.560> up

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
not just something that we've knocked up

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.470 
not just something that we've knocked up
years<00:05:23.040> ago<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.580> give<00:05:23.700> to<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.000> same<00:05:24.210> student

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
years ago and give to the same student

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.630 
years ago and give to the same student
time<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.140> time<00:05:25.320> again<00:05:25.530> but<00:05:26.100> it<00:05:26.220> means<00:05:26.430> the

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
time and time again but it means the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.700 
time and time again but it means the
student<00:05:27.060> actually<00:05:27.240> gets<00:05:27.600> embedded<00:05:28.200> into<00:05:28.530> one

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
student actually gets embedded into one

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.860 
student actually gets embedded into one
of<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:29.040> research<00:05:29.670> groups<00:05:30.060> in<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.600> school<00:05:30.840> of

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
of the research groups in the school of

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.540 
of the research groups in the school of
physics<00:05:31.320> and<00:05:31.410> astronomy<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.920> actually<00:05:32.370> gets

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
physics and astronomy and actually gets

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.220 
physics and astronomy and actually gets
involved<00:05:33.060> in<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.300> research<00:05:33.600> of<00:05:33.660> that<00:05:33.960> group

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
involved in the research of that group

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.090 
involved in the research of that group
of<00:05:34.470> doing<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> project<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:36.210> in<00:05:36.750> my<00:05:36.990> group<00:05:37.260> we<00:05:37.920> do

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
of doing a project so in my group we do

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.700 
of doing a project so in my group we do
both<00:05:38.310> theoretical<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.180> experimental

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
both theoretical and experimental

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.460 
both theoretical and experimental
research<00:05:40.760> more<00:05:41.760> theory<00:05:42.210> than<00:05:42.420> experiment<00:05:43.230> by

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
research more theory than experiment by

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.130 
research more theory than experiment by
the<00:05:43.500> staff<00:05:43.920> ratio<00:05:44.400> but<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.450> projects<00:05:45.900> that<00:05:45.930> we

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
the staff ratio but the projects that we

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.440 
the staff ratio but the projects that we
offer<00:05:46.320> are<00:05:46.620> genuinely<00:05:47.130> an<00:05:47.610> involvement<00:05:48.120> in

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
offer are genuinely an involvement in

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.840 
offer are genuinely an involvement in
one<00:05:49.050> of<00:05:49.200> our<00:05:49.260> aspects<00:05:49.800> of<00:05:50.040> research<00:05:50.190> so<00:05:50.670> we

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
one of our aspects of research so we

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.850 
one of our aspects of research so we
research<00:05:51.360> in<00:05:51.600> all<00:05:51.810> sorts<00:05:52.200> of<00:05:52.260> quantum

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
research in all sorts of quantum

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.980 
research in all sorts of quantum
information<00:05:52.980> physics<00:05:53.940> from<00:05:54.210> various
