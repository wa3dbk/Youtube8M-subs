it pops into place now the only problem

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.389 
it pops into place now the only problem
with<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:57.350> sometimes<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.649> doesn't<00:00:59.010> stay

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
with this is sometimes it doesn't stay

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.219 
with this is sometimes it doesn't stay
in<00:00:59.969> place<00:01:02.539> normally<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:03.719> you're<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.049> going

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
in place normally when you're like going

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.429 
in place normally when you're like going
really<00:01:04.650> hard<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.280> face<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.820> whatever<00:01:06.630> or

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
really hard on your face or whatever or

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.170 
really hard on your face or whatever or

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
so I'd recommend to keep them further

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.249 
so I'd recommend to keep them further
back<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:12.890> on<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.580> part<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.810> holding<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
back or on this part not like holding it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.899 
back or on this part not like holding it
like<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.159> holding<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.670> this

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
like this more like holding it like this

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.080 
like this more like holding it like this
I<00:01:18.770> do<00:01:19.770> recommend<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.610> brush<00:01:20.820> though

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
I do recommend to use this brush though

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690 
I do recommend to use this brush though
or<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> brush<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:22.560> similar<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.310> instead

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
or a brush very similar to this instead

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.070 
or a brush very similar to this instead
of<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> kabuki<00:01:24.450> brush<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> would

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
of like a kabuki brush which you would

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
of like a kabuki brush which you would
normally<00:01:25.409> use<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.830> makeup<00:01:26.280> because<00:01:27.180> this

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
normally use for my makeup because this

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.740 
normally use for my makeup because this
mineral<00:01:27.960> makeup<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.579> wet<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> wet

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
mineral makeup is wet it has a wet

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.050 
mineral makeup is wet it has a wet
texture<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.530> aqua<00:01:31.860> minerals<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
texture because it's aqua minerals so it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
texture because it's aqua minerals so it
applies<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> more<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.259> liquid

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
applies kind of more like a liquid

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.620 
applies kind of more like a liquid
foundation<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.670> when<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> apply<00:01:36.240> liquid

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
foundation and when you apply liquid

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.510 
foundation and when you apply liquid
foundation<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.290> brush<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.280> just

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
foundation on your brush you're not just

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.390 
foundation on your brush you're not just
like<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.060> using<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.960> kabuki<00:01:40.439> brush<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:41.100> do

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
like you know using a kabuki brush to do

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.969 
like you know using a kabuki brush to do
that<00:01:41.640> cuz<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> liquid<00:01:43.110> fine<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that cuz then the liquid fine I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.929 
that cuz then the liquid fine I
shouldn't<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.369> splotchy

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
shouldn't be splotchy

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.679 
shouldn't be splotchy
just<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:46.880> when<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.000> apply<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
just like this when you apply it it's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.569 
just like this when you apply it it's
like<00:01:48.960> more<00:01:49.320> condensed<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:50.100> you're<00:01:50.340> applying

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
like more condensed like you're applying

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.490 
like more condensed like you're applying
it<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.880> liquid<00:01:51.270> instead<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.720> taking<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.290> like

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it like liquid instead of taking it like

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.139 
it like liquid instead of taking it like
dip<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> minerals<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:53.970> doing

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
dip it in the minerals and then doing

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.999 
dip it in the minerals and then doing
like<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:55.229> would<00:01:55.470> make<00:01:55.649> its<00:01:55.799> Watchi

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009
