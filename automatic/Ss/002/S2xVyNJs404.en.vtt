00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.810
 she where everyone knows in their 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.879
 life we ​​find ourselves for the sixth 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.290
 farm episode with canvas evoked a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.970
 proposition a little bit special a little 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.700
 particular knowing that usually we have 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.219
 two dragons 51 marc barr 41 market and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.830
 68 goblins so we'll train with that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.510
 the dragons it was not just planned 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.699
 it was my troops in fact of the war 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.310
 of clans actually stuff that I them 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 train in addition so here we are at 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.369
 the update just after the house 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.400
 so I created there endlessly to build 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.130
 factory two black sisters to have the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 famous kind of tremor poison 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.370
 earth and speed that do not look 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.600
 badly but that does not seem in the end 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.399
 very very useful spent 1 a place of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 spells for something that goes faster on 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.219
 what hurts the opposing defenses 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.860
 then it makes a little shake 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.480
 buildings it happens that 10% I 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 prefers a good rabies spell or spell 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 of care so we left friends 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.120
 women to be there episode 6 we will close 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.280
 we will close like pigs I do not know 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.770
 like not what level of trophies I 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.040
 we're going to see that right after that so the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 no it's not enough and the little ones 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.610
 thalie mation when small 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.420
 vignettes fell changed friends so 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.729
 now nothing is not uncommon it's a 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.720
 little more stylish it looks like leroy access 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.280
 point it's really king 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 so it's nice so there I have no 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.890
 spells to attack or there is very 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 beautiful village Gaulish baguet otherwise 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.850
 at the level of news 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.780
 who got out so the news 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.610
 leagues it's not bad I think but 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.340
 saw that there are new lee champions 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.240
 three franks to the two champions a game 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.300
 pass here she sings we dance 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.380
 when I saw that finally brief titans and 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.930
 legends 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.820
 I think they should have 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.670
 think to increase the number of trophies 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.200
 that we win by simply attacking 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.930
 because there is more to give now 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.440
 more league 1 forgiveness after we say yes 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.509
 but if we win more 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.940
 trophies people will lose so much 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.100
 trophies say themselves more trophies yes 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.990
 Well, that seems normal to me because at 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.850
 relics that would seem normal to us 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.119
 there a very very good village friends 320 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.470
 3350 7000 so we will attack on one side 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.209
 to pierce we will attack on that side 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.010
 up because it's a little harder to break through 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.739
 because I knew where I did not crowd 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.060
 barabara market but it does not matter the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.700
 erwin you can put some money 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.880
 to destroy a little the defenses 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.200
 which at the beginning we will put even put 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.209
 the two dragons because really 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.860
 it's a very very good fucking we're going 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.590
 swing small groups not for who 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.269
 fart the walls simply 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.010
 and they're still pretty strong it's 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.000
 goblins so let's start the debate 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.709
 even that I launched a little far 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.549
 by the way, but it's okay, we're going 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.799
 see if it's going to be enough 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.610
 it's going to be enough that would surprise me 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.829
 will launch a little bit of 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.420
 goblins what the white ego is good 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.150
 the goblins is the good friends 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.160
 take a place and look to you but 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.450
 that's it still takes a lot of 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.370
 scarce resources would be enough 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.860
 I would be surprised we will raise a little bit 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.480
 of goblins because there really is 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.799
 a lot of resources to take 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 balance all that we are we are all 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.250
 friends we swayed 10 ten archers and lady 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.780
 barbarians see we're going all out for 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.310
 this attack because before that it's worth the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.769
 blow there are still three 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.459
 wow whenever I do my 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.320
 videos love them my camera for me here 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.670
 I know why the beach maybe that 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.980
 I put it where I do not know but in short 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.269
 you're used to the strength that one 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.090
 see so there's still 90 miles we're going 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.709
 try to take everything 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.290
 59 Email here it is a little warm we will 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.390
 leave two ways 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.299
 this is the method here is the saab to the giant 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.280
 if all my troops normally nothing 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.510
 we have had two hundred and sixty thousand 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.489
 three hundred and thirty six thousand with 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.590
 Barbarian archers and dragons 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.060
 goblins so we go there we restarted the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.819
 building troops I do not know if 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.170
 I take one on an ellipse actually 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.700
 friends or just we'll see them 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.230
 in attacks whose stub log 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.459
 ah so can you show something 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.349
 so yes we'll show you this one here hop 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.019
 there is 13h so see so it's a 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.450
 town 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.159
 you do not know if the mc alger but not 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.379
 his wooden debut with pink walls 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.209
 and puts a little bit of every level all 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.439
 simply and a village completely 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.819
 wade to make friends in their give 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.769
 Savor it could have been my top 5 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.780
 August of fire but no I chose for 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.009
 this famous for episode number 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.610
 six is friend so there you see that 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.720
 the striker brad on the move and that's where 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.520
 I did a little tour because via 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.840
 I have not enough if I need it 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.250
 of men before focusing on a 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.780
 can side with reindeers everywhere 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.849
 so I wanted you to see others 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.900
 the arrangement of the barbarians all around and 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.630
 archers just behind for 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.680
 complete in fact so see you do not know 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.750
 if I launched my barbarians right 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.360
 for this village I do not know I 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.669
 think so the sent really not bad 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.740
 what was 170000 I believe 200 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.449
 mines something like that 170 me extra 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.550
 10000 you'll see that really I 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.010
 will take everything friends and you 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.289
 about the clan we won a few 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.460
 yesterday we lost that one we had 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.250
 many have many more 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.889
 taxes 56 states against 36 for the 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.050
 enemies but that's not known or did not know 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.250
 deal with these stars 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.680
 so do not hesitate to sell the 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.110
 plan always on oneself by invitation 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.340
 be sure open it will depend a little bit low 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.900
 names of people who come in 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.949

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.970
 comment to bonus and we end up at 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.970
 the next is a track
