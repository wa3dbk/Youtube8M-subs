00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.620 
wielding combo with the daggers it
requires<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.710> timing<00:02:22.130> but<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.610> dps<00:02:23.120> is

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
requires the timing but the dps is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.720 
requires the timing but the dps is
definitely<00:02:24.140> worth<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.560> try<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:28.430> game<00:02:28.580> will

old<00:02:58.380> quiet<00:02:58.830> here<00:02:59.100> too

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:22.880 

I'm<00:03:03.660> not<00:03:03.990> leaving<00:03:04.500> without<00:03:04.650> answers

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.260 

this<00:03:23.890> one<00:03:24.070> here<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.460> different<00:03:25.060> type<00:03:25.240> of

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
this one here is a different type of

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.390 
this one here is a different type of
opponent<00:03:25.750> it's<00:03:26.320> bigger<00:03:26.530> stronger<00:03:27.010> more

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
opponent it's bigger stronger more

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.670 
opponent it's bigger stronger more
aggressive<00:03:28.000> but<00:03:28.180> also<00:03:28.480> he's<00:03:28.870> not<00:03:29.050> defending

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
aggressive but also he's not defending

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.500 
aggressive but also he's not defending
himself<00:03:29.830> so<00:03:30.370> we'll<00:03:30.490> try<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> different<00:03:31.300> type<00:03:31.480> of

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
himself so we'll try a different type of

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.320 
himself so we'll try a different type of
timing<00:03:32.170> with<00:03:32.320> this<00:03:32.530> guy<00:03:32.880> using<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.940> heavier

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
timing with this guy using a heavier

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.440 
timing with this guy using a heavier
gear<00:03:34.950> since<00:03:35.950> we're<00:03:36.130> not<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> slasher<00:03:36.970> certain

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
gear since we're not a slasher certain

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.660 
gear since we're not a slasher certain
things<00:03:37.720> will<00:03:37.900> not<00:03:38.110> work<00:03:38.440> like<00:03:38.800> washing<00:03:39.310> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
things will not work like washing the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.620 
things will not work like washing the
button<00:03:40.000> for<00:03:40.150> example<00:03:41.130> blocking<00:03:42.130> well<00:03:42.940> that

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
button for example blocking well that

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.300 
button for example blocking well that
probably<00:03:44.020> won't<00:03:44.350> get<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.709> far<00:03:44.740> in<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.160> long

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
probably won't get you far in the long

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.480 
probably won't get you far in the long
run<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:46.630> let's<00:03:47.530> set<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.920> pace<00:03:48.100> right<00:03:48.280> here

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
run so let's set the pace right here

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.510 
run so let's set the pace right here
I'll<00:03:48.760> get<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.300> wait<00:03:50.080> for<00:03:50.440> time<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.709> deal<00:03:51.070> slower

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
I'll get in wait for time to deal slower

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.790 
I'll get in wait for time to deal slower
and<00:03:51.790> stronger<00:03:52.270> strike<00:03:52.600> then<00:03:52.810> get<00:03:53.020> out<00:03:53.050> rinse

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
and stronger strike then get out rinse

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.040 
and stronger strike then get out rinse
and<00:03:54.130> repeat<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:55.060> quite<00:03:55.330> useful<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.810> heavy

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
and repeat it's quite useful with heavy

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.380 
and repeat it's quite useful with heavy
weapons<00:03:56.170> like<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.890> hammer<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.550> you<00:03:58.180> can

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
weapons like this hammer and you can

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.400

even<00:03:58.510> charge<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.260> attacks<00:04:01.170> another<00:04:02.170> one

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
even charge the attacks another one

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:24.379 
even charge the attacks another one
bites<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.800> dust

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389
