00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
foot and it comes off 4g and that is his
first<00:01:28.500> goal<00:01:28.799> i<00:01:28.829> believe<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:30.060> many<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> come

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
first goal i believe of many to come

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
first goal i believe of many to come
hopefully<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> goes<00:01:31.979> into<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> 90th

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
hopefully but it goes into the 90th

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
hopefully but it goes into the 90th
minute<00:01:32.670> i'm<00:01:32.909> waiting<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.299> neil<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.869> even<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
minute i'm waiting one neil so even if I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
minute i'm waiting one neil so even if I
miss<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.220> still<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> go<00:01:36.299> through

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
miss this I'm still going to go through

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.600 
miss this I'm still going to go through
but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> shot<00:01:37.409> across<00:01:37.500> goal<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:38.490> his

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
but I go for a shot across goal with his

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
but I go for a shot across goal with his
left<00:01:38.820> foot<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.270> does<00:01:39.479> miss<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.320> little

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
left foot and it does miss so a little

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
left foot and it does miss so a little
bit<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> point<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.670> didn't<00:01:41.939> put<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
bit of point in there they didn't put it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.639 
bit of point in there they didn't put it
away<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.509> still<00:01:42.810> won<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.229> nil<00:01:43.439> which

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
away but still won it one nil which

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.109 
away but still won it one nil which
means<00:01:44.009> we're<00:01:44.220> now<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.000> next

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
means we're now through to the next

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.969 
means we're now through to the next
round<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.780> silver<00:01:46.110> cup<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
round of the silver cup and I have to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.039 
round of the silver cup and I have to
dream<00:01:47.130> team<00:01:47.399> points<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
dream team points of which I have to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.719 
dream team points of which I have to
spend<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> non<00:01:49.710> rare<00:01:49.920> player<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.369> decided

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
spend on a non rare player and I decided

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.550 
spend on a non rare player and I decided
I<00:01:50.939> wanted<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.329> striker<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:52.049> I've<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.320> two

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
I wanted a striker because I've got two

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.889 
I wanted a striker because I've got two
cams<00:01:52.860> at<00:01:53.040> moment<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> striker

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
cams at moment so if I go for a striker

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.160 
cams at moment so if I go for a striker
I<00:01:55.229> should<00:01:55.680> keep<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.210> fairly<00:01:57.210> good<00:01:57.570> chemistry<00:01:58.020> if

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I should keep a fairly good chemistry if

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.539 
I should keep a fairly good chemistry if
you<00:01:58.259> understand<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> mean<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you understand what I mean you know the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.340 
you understand what I mean you know the
strike<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> probably<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> best<00:02:00.719> place<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
strike is probably the best place to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.109 
strike is probably the best place to
replace<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.740> moment<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.610> went<00:02:02.790> flock<00:02:03.000> has

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
replace that moment if a went flock has

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.429 
replace that moment if a went flock has
sent<00:02:03.360> her<00:02:03.420> back<00:02:03.570> or<00:02:03.780> something<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.229> i'm

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
sent her back or something like that i'm

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.440 
sent her back or something like that i'm
going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> lose<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> lot<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.159> chemistry<00:02:05.520> unless

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
going to lose a lot of chemistry unless

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.990 
going to lose a lot of chemistry unless
he's<00:02:06.659> obviously<00:02:06.930> french<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> go<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.759> player

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
he's obviously french so go for a player

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
he's obviously french so go for a player
called<00:02:09.239> vydra<00:02:09.539> off<00:02:09.810> believer<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.560> for

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
called vydra off believer going for

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.400 
called vydra off believer going for
about<00:02:10.830> 800<00:02:11.489> or<00:02:11.640> 850<00:02:12.450> coins<00:02:12.690> these<00:02:13.230> are

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
about 800 or 850 coins these are

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
about 800 or 850 coins these are
about<00:02:13.710> six<00:02:14.040> or<00:02:14.190> seven<00:02:14.370> chemistry<00:02:14.880> at<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
about six or seven chemistry at the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.990 
about six or seven chemistry at the
moment<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.020> his<00:02:16.980> first<00:02:17.250> few<00:02:17.430> games<00:02:17.640> will

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
moment so his first few games will

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.820 
moment so his first few games will
probably<00:02:18.270> be<00:02:18.390> not<00:02:19.020> as<00:02:19.110> good<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.470> he<00:02:19.650> will

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
probably be not as good as he will

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.610 
probably be not as good as he will
perform<00:02:20.160> later<00:02:20.490> in<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.030> series<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:22.380> I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
perform later in this series but I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.440 
perform later in this series but I
decided<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.220> know<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.460> needed<00:02:23.760> some<00:02:24.300> more

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
decided you know I needed some more

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.120 
decided you know I needed some more

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
contracts some more fitness classes and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.950 
contracts some more fitness classes and
stuff<00:02:26.370> like<00:02:26.490> that<00:02:26.550> why<00:02:27.240> not<00:02:27.390> open<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.720> quick

I'm going to take a quick moment to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.190 
I'm going to take a quick moment to

add moment i'm just uploading dream team
and<00:02:49.530> that's<00:02:49.830> what<00:02:49.980> i<00:02:50.010> want<00:02:50.250> my<00:02:50.370> channel<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.730> be

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
and that's what i want my channel to be

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.640 
and that's what i want my channel to be
based<00:02:51.060> around<00:02:51.210> but<00:02:51.900> also<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.230> guys<00:02:52.380> know<00:02:52.620> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
based around but also you guys know that
