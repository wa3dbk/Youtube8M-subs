00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.830
 in this video I want to show you the potential of the layer mask 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.600
 of photoshop combined with the color balance what I want to achieve e 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.290
 optimize this image to create a new image in which the mountains 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.240
 which you see above will have a shade while the sand you see in 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.999
 low tone test 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.449
 it is very simple to do this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.759
 make a copy of the layer called background 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.539
 at this point go to image color balance adjustments 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.350
 you must or only now concentrate on the color of the mountains 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 regardless of the color you see below on the sand just look at the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.600
 mountains or even 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.080
 I cover the sand to prevent you from looking 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.070
 the sand ein 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.350
 between you could be deceived so just look at the mountain 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.950
 cottages in although for example the red colors to have a more shade 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.850
 Violet 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.020
 alson you blue 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.130
 I could even go to act on the shadows to give even more disadvantage to that 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.440
 what I'm doing here right now seems to me that the mountains you see here 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440
 they have a color might go well maybe 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.719
 then boh still a little bit of 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.990
 blue deep blue perfume to give a little more pastel shades 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.900
 brico ok and how you see the mountain 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.850
 they have a very pleasant color while at the bottom this area is absolutely colored 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.940
 beetle too strong 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.550
 what I do so I deactivate the background pair level I go to the beautiful background 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.110
 I always go to image color balance adjustments right now 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.750
 kopron mountains my mind to not mislead and lonely woman 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.380
 my intention 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.899
 for editing re 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.390
 this area at the bottom of the sand 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.440
 increase therefore the percentage of yellows for example I'm doing just a few 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.390
 so tests are done in a minute 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.390
 the percentage of yellows in highlights is also increasing 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 here is how you see the image already so it could be fine 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.290
 let's take a look at some other changes to mount i'm so cool 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.860
 coldirect could go well propose they are deep enough just to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.860
 give a contrast of the two complementary colors 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.400
 here it is to say that it could go well this way and therefore now sees why the mountains 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.409
 they have lost a lot of detail while the area is below 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.409
 very gray sand 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.019
 I go back to the previous level 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.859
 i go up the level 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.479
 and I make a layer mask the shot 3 decide whether to show everything 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.079
 hide all this is your choice to invite me to read on my site 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.089
 www.marcotogni.it 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.860
 I can't explain the article 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.830
 when it's best to use show all when to use hide-all but more 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.499
 or less is the same thing in this case I do show everything 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.359
 I'm going to get the brush 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.519
 the black color at this time using the layer mask which 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.709
 you can learn to use new video malt voting 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.429
 padova simply to brush the area below 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.769
 right now what I'm doing is 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.340
 delete practically a part of the photograph that is on the level 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.109
 background couple to show 1 the part from photographs that is on the background 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.599
 simply swords to very quickly brush the area below and 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.419
 as you can see from this 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.019
 photography 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.099
 the mountains have a color a shade directly images at the bottom 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.210
 to a yellow shade creating 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.159
 so a kind of contrast of surreal image 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.459
 it is very particular with very little time and with this one 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.019
 layer mask allows you to make 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.379
 many changes to improve your photographs 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.590
 the original image was a bit flat with no wisely in this 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.370
 moment is the image jambÃ¨ mold I tell you stiff 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.309
 curiosity 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.719
 surely it is not a work of art also because clearly it is a done thing 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.929
 so albona but I assure you that with this modality you can effect 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.799
 lots of changes 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.150
 it is always possible to reduce any noise with the layer mask 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.499
 else 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:04.669
 agenda selectively on some areas of photography for others give me away 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.669
 I went out www.marcotogni.it 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.369
 and if you need, email me in the mix
