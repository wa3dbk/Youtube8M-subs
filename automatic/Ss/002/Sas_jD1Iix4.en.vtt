00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.919 
this time I've obviously no one's drove
around<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:27.800> track<00:00:27.980> or<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.189> layout<00:00:28.520> and<00:00:28.750> this<00:00:29.750> is

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
around a track or the layout and this is

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.179 
around a track or the layout and this is
basically<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:30.470> second<00:00:30.859> time<00:00:30.980> I've<00:00:31.070> actually

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
basically the second time I've actually

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.589 
basically the second time I've actually
looked<00:00:31.429> it<00:00:31.640> and<00:00:31.849> I've<00:00:31.970> not<00:00:32.119> walked<00:00:32.269> it<00:00:32.449> yet

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
looked it and I've not walked it yet

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.600 
looked it and I've not walked it yet
because<00:00:32.840> as<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:33.199> can<00:00:33.320> see<00:00:33.559> this<00:00:34.070> it's<00:00:34.460> pretty

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
because as you can see this it's pretty

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.100 
because as you can see this it's pretty
wet<00:00:34.940> from<00:00:35.180> a<00:00:35.210> lot<00:00:35.629> of<00:00:35.660> rain<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:35.989> had<00:00:36.080> yesterday

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
wet from a lot of rain we had yesterday

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.280 
wet from a lot of rain we had yesterday
so<00:00:36.790> kind<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:37.879> telling<00:00:38.420> you<00:00:38.480> this<00:00:38.660> blind<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.230> it

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
so kind of telling you this blind and it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.079 
so kind of telling you this blind and it
might<00:00:39.470> be<00:00:39.830> completely<00:00:40.010> false<00:00:40.519> information

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
might be completely false information

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.299 
might be completely false information
and<00:00:41.150> rubbish<00:00:41.449> but<00:00:41.739> it's<00:00:42.739> better<00:00:42.920> than<00:00:42.980> nothing

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
and rubbish but it's better than nothing

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.369 
and rubbish but it's better than nothing
so<00:00:43.820> we're<00:00:44.239> gonna<00:00:44.360> start<00:00:44.660> down<00:00:45.080> at<00:00:45.320> the

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
so we're gonna start down at the

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.990 
so we're gonna start down at the
start/finish<00:00:45.890> line<00:00:45.920> which<00:00:46.520> is<00:00:46.670> down<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:46.940> the

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
start/finish line which is down to the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.490 
start/finish line which is down to the
left<00:00:47.120> hand<00:00:47.329> side<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.600> track<00:00:47.809> now<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.200> was<00:00:48.320> on

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
left hand side the track now it was on

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.290 
left hand side the track now it was on
the<00:00:48.590> right<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.039> I<00:00:49.070> heard<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:49.940> move<00:00:50.120> it

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
the right but I heard that to move it

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.770 
the right but I heard that to move it
for<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:51.170> get<00:00:51.320> two<00:00:51.469> loops<00:00:51.710> in<00:00:51.890> or<00:00:51.980> something<00:00:52.280> so

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
for to get two loops in or something so

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.319 
for to get two loops in or something so
so<00:00:53.780> once<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:54.500> start<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:55.460> go<00:00:55.579> around<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:56.059> little

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
so once you start you go around a little

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.720 
so once you start you go around a little
bit<00:00:56.510> of<00:00:56.629> a<00:00:56.660> touring<00:00:56.960> car<00:00:57.110> section<00:00:57.530> there<00:00:57.730> quite

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
bit of a touring car section there quite

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.000 
bit of a touring car section there quite
a<00:00:59.030> nice<00:00:59.390> smooth<00:00:59.809> right-hander<00:01:00.649> should<00:01:00.920> be

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
a nice smooth right-hander should be

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.290 
a nice smooth right-hander should be
quite<00:01:01.190> good<00:01:01.340> cars<00:01:01.699> have<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.969> lot<00:01:02.090> of<00:01:02.180> grit

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
quite good cars have a lot of grit

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.570 
quite good cars have a lot of grit
around<00:01:02.480> there<00:01:02.629> maybe<00:01:02.809> grip<00:01:03.079> roll<00:01:03.489> into<00:01:04.489> a

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
around there maybe grip roll into a

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.050 
around there maybe grip roll into a
small<00:01:04.879> small<00:01:05.330> tabletop<00:01:05.660> after<00:01:06.020> there<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:08.000> be

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
small small tabletop after there to be

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.100 
small small tabletop after there to be
honest<00:01:08.300> at<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.450> moment<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:08.780> looks<00:01:08.840> pretty

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
honest at the moment it looks pretty

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.680 
honest at the moment it looks pretty
simple<00:01:09.500> just<00:01:10.190> try<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:10.430> land<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:11.180> direction

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
simple just try and land in direction

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.690 
simple just try and land in direction
where<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:11.899> want<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.200> go<00:01:12.320> hit<00:01:12.679> full<00:01:12.920> full<00:01:13.490> throw

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
where you want to go hit full full throw

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.850 
where you want to go hit full full throw
on<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.910> little<00:01:13.970> mini<00:01:14.270> straight<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.740> you're

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
on a little mini straight and in you're

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.710 
on a little mini straight and in you're
up<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.130> hairpin<00:01:16.429> section<00:01:16.820> which<00:01:16.970> is<00:01:17.119> pretty

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
up to a hairpin section which is pretty

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.969 
up to a hairpin section which is pretty
similar<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.110> what<00:01:18.439> they<00:01:18.500> had<00:01:18.650> at<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.830> raw

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
similar to what they had at the raw

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.760 
similar to what they had at the raw
Nationals<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.549> looks<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.229> be<00:01:21.229> nice<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:21.590> slow

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
Nationals it looks so be nice and slow

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.310 
Nationals it looks so be nice and slow
around<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.040> first<00:01:22.280> one<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:23.750> curbing<00:01:24.140> looks

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
around the first one the curbing looks

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.719 
around the first one the curbing looks
pretty<00:01:24.560> big<00:01:24.770> on<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:24.950> on<00:01:25.189> that<00:01:25.369> second<00:01:25.670> one

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
pretty big on that on that second one

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.490 
pretty big on that on that second one
there<00:01:25.970> maybe<00:01:26.180> if<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.750> clip<00:01:26.960> there<00:01:27.200> might

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
there maybe if you clip there might

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.990 
there maybe if you clip there might
might<00:01:27.950> roll<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.250> over<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.729> might<00:01:28.850> want<00:01:28.970> to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
might roll you over so you might want to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.990 
might roll you over so you might want to
watch<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:30.079> then<00:01:30.340> fast<00:01:31.340> round<00:01:31.579> into<00:01:31.970> the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
watch that and then fast round into the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.760 
watch that and then fast round into the
first<00:01:32.420> jump<00:01:32.659> section<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.110> you<00:01:33.200> hit<00:01:33.350> which<00:01:33.740> is

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
first jump section that you hit which is

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.060 
first jump section that you hit which is
double<00:01:34.640> into<00:01:34.939> a<00:01:34.970> triple<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.439> then<00:01:36.590> flat<00:01:36.890> out

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
double into a triple and then flat out

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.710 
double into a triple and then flat out
into<00:01:37.460> their<00:01:37.640> big<00:01:37.850> banked<00:01:38.240> corner<00:01:38.570> which<00:01:38.689> is

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
into their big banked corner which is

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.749 
into their big banked corner which is
which<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.170> pretty<00:01:39.439> cool<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.890> little<00:01:40.640> bit

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
which is pretty cool a little bit

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:41.679 
which is pretty cool a little bit
different<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.270> something<00:01:41.540> like<00:01:41.659> that

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
different to have something like that

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.090 
different to have something like that
here<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.229> guy's<00:01:42.409> been<00:01:42.649> riding<00:01:42.950> up<00:01:43.009> and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
here and the guy's been riding up and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.679 
here and the guy's been riding up and
down<00:01:43.189> all<00:01:43.579> these<00:01:43.670> quads<00:01:44.000> flattening<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.600> out

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
down all these quads flattening it out

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.300 
down all these quads flattening it out
which<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.290> think<00:01:45.649> he's<00:01:45.740> doing<00:01:45.920> for<00:01:46.070> enjoyment

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
which I think he's doing for enjoyment

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.359 
which I think he's doing for enjoyment
rather<00:01:46.790> than<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.090> full<00:01:47.270> purpose<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:49.100> once<00:01:49.280> you

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
rather than a full purpose so once you

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.340 
rather than a full purpose so once you
hit<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.549> guess<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.000> got<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.390> first<00:01:50.689> W<00:01:51.110> try<00:01:51.259> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
hit I guess you got the first W try and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.170 
hit I guess you got the first W try and
hit<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.500> downslope<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.430> fast<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.790> can't<00:01:53.000> over

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
hit the downslope as fast you can't over

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.359 
hit the downslope as fast you can't over
that<00:01:53.270> triple<00:01:53.600> into<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.990> bank<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.500> then<00:01:54.619> you

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
that triple into the bank and then you

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.800 
that triple into the bank and then you
drive<00:01:55.579> as<00:01:55.759> much<00:01:55.909> hard<00:01:56.210> as<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.540> off<00:01:56.689> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
drive as much hard as you can off the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.959 
drive as much hard as you can off the
bank<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.170> there's<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.350> small<00:01:57.710> small<00:01:58.670> little

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
bank and there's a small small little

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.719 
bank and there's a small small little
kicker<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.479> then<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.829> track<00:02:01.130> raises<00:02:01.579> up

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
kicker and then the track raises up

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.459 
kicker and then the track raises up
quite<00:02:01.939> a<00:02:01.969> bit<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.420> mean<00:02:02.780> from<00:02:02.960> here<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.290> can't

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
quite a bit I mean from here you can't

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.590 
quite a bit I mean from here you can't
really<00:02:03.649> tell<00:02:03.829> how<00:02:03.860> much<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.490> track<00:02:04.670> differs

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
really tell how much the track differs

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.359 
really tell how much the track differs
in<00:02:05.719> height<00:02:05.930> but<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.439> looks<00:02:06.649> like<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:07.009> changes

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
in height but it looks like it changes

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.819 
in height but it looks like it changes
quite<00:02:07.579> a<00:02:07.640> bit<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:09.140> for<00:02:09.320> now<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.709> on<00:02:09.769> a

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:09.829 
quite a bit so for now you get on a

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.530 
quite a bit so for now you get on a
straight<00:02:10.160> fast<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.000> can<00:02:11.150> under<00:02:11.360> straight

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
straight fast you can under straight

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.500 
straight fast you can under straight
away<00:02:12.310> up<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.700> jump<00:02:13.910> section<00:02:14.090> which<00:02:14.360> i

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
away up to the jump section which i

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.460 
away up to the jump section which i
think<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:14.780> going<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> be<00:02:15.049> one<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.350> most

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
think is going to be one of the most

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.199 
think is going to be one of the most
crucial<00:02:15.739> parts<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.519> of<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:16.940> track

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
crucial parts of the of this track

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.630 
crucial parts of the of this track
because<00:02:17.750> apparently<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.320> hit<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.680> big<00:02:19.340> table

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
because apparently you hit the big table

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.949 
because apparently you hit the big table
top<00:02:19.790> first<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.299> you<00:02:20.390> get<00:02:20.540> quite<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.750> bit<00:02:20.930> of

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
top first and you get quite a bit of

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.050 
top first and you get quite a bit of
height<00:02:21.170> but<00:02:21.980> what<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.220> need<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.489> do<00:02:22.609> is<00:02:22.820> land

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
height but what you need to do is land

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.569 
height but what you need to do is land
as<00:02:23.389> near<00:02:24.049> perfect<00:02:24.470> as<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.590> can<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.220> small

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
as near perfect as you can on that small

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.350 
as near perfect as you can on that small
down<00:02:25.790> rope

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
down rope

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.210 
down rope
down<00:02:26.570> ramp<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.110> get<00:02:27.260> into<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.710> next<00:02:27.830> triple

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
down ramp to get into the next triple

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.640 
down ramp to get into the next triple
fast<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.760> think<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.810> over<00:02:30.080> jump<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.470> you're

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
fast I think if you over jump it you're

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.960 
fast I think if you over jump it you're
not<00:02:30.740> going<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.950> make<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.160> triple<00:02:31.370> after<00:02:31.790> if

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
not going to make the triple after if

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.850 
not going to make the triple after if
even<00:02:32.600> if<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.870> know<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.110> have<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.410> double<00:02:33.740> out

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
even if you know you have to double out

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.560 
even if you know you have to double out
and<00:02:34.070> single<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.730> you're<00:02:34.970> gonna<00:02:35.060> lose<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.330> lot<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
and single it you're gonna lose a lot of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.240 
and single it you're gonna lose a lot of
time<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.020> it's<00:02:36.440> gonna<00:02:36.560> be<00:02:36.710> crucial<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.130> get

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
time so it's gonna be crucial to get

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.460 
time so it's gonna be crucial to get
that<00:02:37.370> bit<00:02:37.520> right<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.780> once<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:39.080> hit<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.350> right

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
that bit right and once you hit it right

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.840 
that bit right and once you hit it right
you'll<00:02:39.650> be<00:02:39.770> over<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.100> triple<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.640> you'll<00:02:40.760> be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
you'll be over the triple and you'll be

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.390 
you'll be over the triple and you'll be
fast<00:02:41.090> down<00:02:41.330> into<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.690> next<00:02:41.930> hairpin<00:02:42.260> which<00:02:42.470> is

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
fast down into the next hairpin which is

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.950 
fast down into the next hairpin which is
again<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.910> lot<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.390> national<00:02:44.750> they<00:02:44.840> had

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
again a lot like the national they had

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.320 
again a lot like the national they had
here<00:02:45.140> which<00:02:45.980> goes<00:02:46.160> into<00:02:46.400> kind<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.880> another

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
here which goes into kind of a another

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.850 
here which goes into kind of a another
jump<00:02:47.570> section<00:02:47.780> which<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.170> tabletop<00:02:48.620> into

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
jump section which the tabletop into

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.460 
jump section which the tabletop into
triple<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:50.120> jumps<00:02:50.390> quite<00:02:50.690> high<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
triple and it jumps quite high up on the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.370 
triple and it jumps quite high up on the
on<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.860> height<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.190> track<00:02:52.400> now<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.870> once

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
on the height of the track now so once

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.230 
on the height of the track now so once
you've<00:02:54.530> made<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:55.700> looks<00:02:55.940> pretty

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
you've made that it looks pretty

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.670 
you've made that it looks pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:56.540> now<00:02:57.110> I'll<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.380> bit<00:02:57.560> it's

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
self-explanatory now I'll but a bit it's

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.949 
self-explanatory now I'll but a bit it's
a<00:02:57.709> lot<00:02:57.860> more<00:02:57.980> difficult<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.430> looks<00:02:58.580> from<00:02:58.700> here

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
a lot more difficult it looks from here

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.750 
a lot more difficult it looks from here
then<00:02:59.959> you'll<00:03:00.080> going<00:03:00.290> downhill<00:03:00.530> into<00:03:01.130> another

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
then you'll going downhill into another

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.970 
then you'll going downhill into another
hairpin<00:03:02.180> them<00:03:02.390> back<00:03:02.540> on<00:03:02.720> yourself<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.680> quite

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
hairpin them back on yourself and quite

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.320 
hairpin them back on yourself and quite
a<00:03:04.010> bank<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.459> turn<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.880> might<00:03:05.000> not<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:05.180> able<00:03:05.270> to

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
a bank to turn you might not be able to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.610 
a bank to turn you might not be able to
tell<00:03:05.480> from<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.810> video<00:03:05.900> from<00:03:06.230> here<00:03:06.380> but<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
tell from the video from here but it

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.500 
tell from the video from here but it
looks<00:03:06.800> like<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.130> got<00:03:07.220> quite<00:03:07.400> quite<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.209> Bank

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
looks like it's got quite quite a Bank

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.790 
looks like it's got quite quite a Bank
on<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.170> going<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.380> pull<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.650> into

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
on it and it's going to pull you into

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.070 
on it and it's going to pull you into
the<00:03:09.950> pipe<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:11.360> know<00:03:11.510> you're<00:03:11.840> gonna<00:03:11.959> have

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
the pipe and you know you're gonna have

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.540 
the pipe and you know you're gonna have
to<00:03:12.140> go<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.260> lot<00:03:12.410> faster<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.860> you<00:03:13.040> can<00:03:13.220> go<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> lot

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
to go a lot faster and you can go a lot

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.440 
to go a lot faster and you can go a lot
faster<00:03:13.730> than<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.000> think

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
faster than you think

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.930 
faster than you think
and<00:03:15.290> after<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.800> try<00:03:16.520> and<00:03:16.580> miss<00:03:16.730> all<00:03:16.850> the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
and after that try and miss all the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.280 
and after that try and miss all the
puddles<00:03:17.270> that<00:03:17.330> they're<00:03:17.570> right<00:03:17.780> now<00:03:17.959> but<00:03:18.170> they

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
puddles that they're right now but they

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.650 
puddles that they're right now but they
they'll<00:03:18.709> get<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.100> for<00:03:19.250> tomorrow<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.760> we<00:03:20.510> go

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
they'll get to it for tomorrow and we go

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.750 
they'll get to it for tomorrow and we go
around<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.860> looks<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.130> like<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.340> double<00:03:22.580> in

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
around it looks just like a double in

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.580 
around it looks just like a double in
front<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.030> us<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.570> straight<00:03:23.870> into<00:03:24.020> an<00:03:24.200> angled

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
front of us and straight into an angled

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.470 
front of us and straight into an angled
table<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.130> think<00:03:25.430> you're<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.060> doubles<00:03:26.330> gonna

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
table I think you're the doubles gonna

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.729 
table I think you're the doubles gonna
be<00:03:26.570> pretty<00:03:26.720> easy<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.200> then<00:03:27.290> getting<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.590> good

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
be pretty easy and then getting a good

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.380 
be pretty easy and then getting a good
line<00:03:27.950> into<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.340> table<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:28.790> gonna<00:03:28.880> be<00:03:29.090> crucial

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
line into that table is gonna be crucial

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.710 
line into that table is gonna be crucial
to<00:03:29.780> how<00:03:30.290> fast<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.769> can<00:03:30.860> exit<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:32.420> as<00:03:32.510> long<00:03:32.630> as

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
to how fast you can exit so as long as

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.210 
to how fast you can exit so as long as
you<00:03:32.810> get<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:32.989> good<00:03:33.170> good<00:03:33.440> line<00:03:33.650> maybe<00:03:33.830> whip<00:03:34.100> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
you get a good good line maybe whip the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.920 
you get a good good line maybe whip the
car<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.430> little<00:03:34.730> get<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:34.940> little<00:03:35.120> bit<00:03:35.269> get

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
car a little get a little bit get

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.330 
car a little get a little bit get
opposite<00:03:36.290> lock<00:03:36.410> in<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.709> air<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:37.070> little<00:03:37.250> bit

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
opposite lock in the air a little bit

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.550 
opposite lock in the air a little bit
style<00:03:37.730> there<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.600> drive<00:03:38.900> as<00:03:39.019> hard<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.410> fast

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
style there and drive as hard and fast

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.830 
style there and drive as hard and fast
you<00:03:39.799> can<00:03:40.010> maybe<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.180> could<00:03:41.330> even<00:03:41.450> use<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
you can maybe you could even use the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.210 
you can maybe you could even use the
side<00:03:42.049> of<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.230> bank<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.620> table<00:03:43.010> at<00:03:43.100> the

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
side of the bank of that table at the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.039 
side of the bank of that table at the
heron<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.670> whip<00:03:44.000> yourself<00:03:44.360> into<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.780> next

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
heron and whip yourself into the next

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.530 
heron and whip yourself into the next
hairpin<00:03:45.350> sections<00:03:45.830> which<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:46.850> going<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.060> be<00:03:47.180> I

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
hairpin sections which is going to be I

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.759 
hairpin sections which is going to be I
think<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.930> place<00:03:48.049> where<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.410> could<00:03:48.530> grip

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
think a place where it could grip

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.800 
think a place where it could grip
rolling<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.940> from<00:03:50.120> here<00:03:50.299> it's<00:03:50.450> looking<00:03:50.690> like

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
rolling and from here it's looking like

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.960 
rolling and from here it's looking like
there's<00:03:51.019> gonna<00:03:51.650> be<00:03:51.860> no<00:03:52.040> marshals<00:03:52.459> near<00:03:52.760> that

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
there's gonna be no marshals near that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.750 
there's gonna be no marshals near that
that<00:03:53.180> first<00:03:53.450> hairpin<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.500> if<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.370> clip<00:03:55.580> that

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
that first hairpin so if you clip that

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.650 
that first hairpin so if you clip that
and<00:03:55.880> you're<00:03:55.970> over<00:03:56.209> you're<00:03:56.330> going<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.510> lose<00:03:56.630> a

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
and you're over you're going to lose a

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.570 
and you're over you're going to lose a
bucketload<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.590> time<00:03:57.860> there<00:03:58.100> if<00:03:58.250> they<00:03:58.370> can't

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
bucketload of time there if they can't

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.680 
bucketload of time there if they can't
get<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.760> your<00:03:58.910> car<00:03:59.120> or<00:03:59.269> if<00:03:59.330> someone's

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
get to your car or if someone's

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.840 
get to your car or if someone's
traveling<00:03:59.930> in<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.260> lane<00:04:00.440> next<00:04:00.799> year<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.190> it's

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
traveling in the lane next year so it's

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.340 
traveling in the lane next year so it's
another<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.330> be<00:04:02.480> wary<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:02.870> maybe<00:04:03.200> that's

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
another one to be wary of maybe that's

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.870 
another one to be wary of maybe that's
going<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.560> cause<00:04:03.709> some<00:04:03.739> drama<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.250> come<00:04:04.430> finals

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
going to cause some drama to come finals

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.550 
going to cause some drama to come finals
everyone<00:04:05.690> going<00:04:05.870> in<00:04:05.989> there<00:04:06.170> pretty<00:04:06.350> fast

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
everyone going in there pretty fast

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.440 
everyone going in there pretty fast
someone<00:04:07.400> gets<00:04:07.640> wing<00:04:07.850> from<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.180> back<00:04:08.330> it's

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
someone gets wing from the back it's

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.759 
someone gets wing from the back it's
gonna<00:04:08.540> be<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.720> lot<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:08.930> time<00:04:09.110> lost<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.620> could

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
gonna be a lot of time lost and could

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.070 
gonna be a lot of time lost and could
cause<00:04:10.040> them<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.250> race<00:04:10.430> victory<00:04:10.880> so<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.900> have<00:04:11.989> to

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
cause them a race victory so you have to

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.380 
cause them a race victory so you have to
watch<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.380> section<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.150> then<00:04:14.150> once<00:04:14.299> you've

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
watch that section and then once you've

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.729 
watch that section and then once you've
done<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.660> bit<00:04:14.810> your<00:04:15.080> background<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.680> you

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
done that bit your background and you

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.090 
done that bit your background and you
start<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.130> start<00:04:16.400> your<00:04:16.700> lap<00:04:16.790> again<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:18.260> that's

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
start you start your lap again so that's

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.890 
start you start your lap again so that's
the<00:04:19.190> lap<00:04:19.370> as<00:04:19.549> now<00:04:19.820> maybe<00:04:20.450> we'll<00:04:20.570> do<00:04:20.720> another

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
the lap as now maybe we'll do another

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.390 
the lap as now maybe we'll do another
little<00:04:21.200> video<00:04:21.290> after<00:04:21.680> practice<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.250> see<00:04:22.340> how

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
little video after practice and see how

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.130 
little video after practice and see how
wrong<00:04:22.640> I<00:04:22.760> was<00:04:22.790> on<00:04:23.150> guessing<00:04:23.600> which<00:04:23.750> bits<00:04:24.020> are

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
wrong I was on guessing which bits are

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.659 
wrong I was on guessing which bits are
good<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.500> bad<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.860> which<00:04:25.010> bits<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.400> look<00:04:25.520> out

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
good and bad and which bits to look out

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.030 
good and bad and which bits to look out
for<00:04:25.910> it's<00:04:26.479> probably<00:04:26.750> gonna<00:04:26.870> be<00:04:27.040> interesting

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
for it's probably gonna be interesting

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.760 
for it's probably gonna be interesting
one<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.400> mean<00:04:29.080> from<00:04:30.080> what<00:04:30.140> I<00:04:30.260> can<00:04:30.440> see<00:04:30.590> it's<00:04:30.740> a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
one I mean from what I can see it's a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.260 
one I mean from what I can see it's a
lot<00:04:30.890> different<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.340> warm-up<00:04:31.970> track<00:04:32.180> we

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
lot different to the warm-up track we

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.760 
lot different to the warm-up track we
had<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.690> size<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.110> it's<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.320> lot<00:04:33.440> different

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
had and the size of it's a lot different

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.380 
had and the size of it's a lot different
like<00:04:33.919> it's<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.130> lot<00:04:34.370> wider<00:04:34.640> than<00:04:34.940> we<00:04:35.060> had<00:04:35.210> at<00:04:35.330> the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
like it's a lot wider than we had at the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.480 
like it's a lot wider than we had at the
warmup<00:04:35.800> there<00:04:36.800> looks<00:04:36.979> like<00:04:37.070> it's<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.250> lot<00:04:37.340> more

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
warmup there looks like it's a lot more

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.040 
warmup there looks like it's a lot more
packed<00:04:37.760> into<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.150> track<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:38.660> looks<00:04:38.810> really

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
packed into the track it looks really

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.090 
packed into the track it looks really
nice<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.229> flowing<00:04:39.710> at<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.890> mo

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
nice and flowing at the mo

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.610 
nice and flowing at the mo
and<00:04:40.450> I<00:04:41.450> think<00:04:41.690> it'd<00:04:41.870> be<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.990> really<00:04:42.050> great<00:04:42.320> race

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
and I think it'd be a really great race

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.260 
and I think it'd be a really great race
