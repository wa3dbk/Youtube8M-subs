00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.190
 good 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.190
 OK 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.340
 Hello everyone, I'm just going to tell you what I 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.680
 has happened with my phone or not good I 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.869
 I have a data rate that was being 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.449
 spending very soon I was going to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.849
 the 15 days I was leaving had had 2 removed 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.220
 megas contracted with or not and I do not 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.619
 it lasted nothing then good 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.730
 the call to one and the order 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.620
 directly what happens to me with the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.390
 low department because if I'm 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.460
 paying a fee and I spend is like 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.730
 If I did not have it then the order 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.960
 download directly from the service 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.520
 asking for the withdrawal of the service 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.480
 directly the girl has offered me 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.150
 because of course if you talk to other people 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.739
 that they put as previous filters 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.440
 they entertain you they play music and 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.850
 end because a lot of people do not have time and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.440
 you can not attend 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.380
 then in the end many people just 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.870
 giving up and being satisfied with girlfriend 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.570
 The fact is that it came in this case 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.300
 I asked for the withdrawal and they gave me so that 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.310
 I go have given me an alternative that 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.810
 is to stay with or not and they give me 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.870
 free 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.310
 they give me a gig for me as 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.530
 for my wife who also have the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.350
 contract then good they have sent me 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.450

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.240
 I received an SMS to the mobile phone in the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.830
 that it was said that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.080

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.620

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.950

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.520
 new card 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.680
 and we get it out of transit 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.140
 here we have 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.840
 the extra card that washes in the direction 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.740
 that we can use the size that 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.780
 it suits us 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.500
 has the biggest have more 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.410
 you own the one that suits you 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.790
 in this case, it suits me the micro 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.790
 so I'm going to take out the micro 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.600
 talking to the phone the phone is being 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.600
 restarting 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.620
 he asks me for the pin and now I have the pin 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.620
 new 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.770
 21 will be low 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.770
 look directly gives me coverage 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.500
 I directly grabbed the other side 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.450
 try to see what happens now 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.959
 I'm supposed to have a gig of 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.959
 capacity 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 well this call has skipped the mailbox 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.510
 because my wife's phone is the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.230
 card is in my possession then the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.050
 hotel does not have a card because it's gone 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.910
 it has also been deactivated there is no no 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.700
 there had to be no special step 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.370
 simply ask for the cards that you 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.260
 granting services 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.150
 customer service this comes by 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.459
 mail two or three days 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.239
 When the mail arrives, you receive a 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.640
 email an SMS where the mail initial 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.519
 has already reported that it is delivered to 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.250
 card and two days later it 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.799
 cancel the current one and start and you have 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.269
 that put the new good I will keep 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.549
 done because you have new ones until what 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.650
 change as we said we have changed 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.410
 the card and we have two options 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.750
 Automatically configures or in the envelope 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.090
 that has sent us the card comes about 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.100
 data of the data that we have to put 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.470
 the configuration so that it works 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.389
 then to do it manually that is 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.199
 what we have to do internet put 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.910
 the data that they ask us we enter in 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:46.340
 configuration and we're going to 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.920
 reverse data mobile networks 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.580
 we have to put in the name him 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.120
 we say apn and now we have not add 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.120
 one pn 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.159
 Y 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.490
 whether connected , we have already been connected 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.889
 I did not have internet and it has already appeared 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.949
 I have disconnected 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.949
 here you see next 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.810
 next to the battery symbol the h more 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.280
 s 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.560
 sh more 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.550
 means that we have internet we are going to 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.550
 see I'm going to mark it 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.949
 and so not only put it and already with this well 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.449
 how good is this we have all 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.020
 manually configured following the 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.020
 very simple steps 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.940
