you could actually say that the choice
of<00:00:47.489> material<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.780> very<00:00:49.020> strange<00:00:49.440> as

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
of material is not so very strange as

the whole industry for the glassworks

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.189 
the whole industry for the glassworks
this<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> also<00:01:03.059> something<00:01:03.239> completely<00:01:04.170> new

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
this is also something completely new

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
this is also something completely new
but<00:01:05.159> something<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.850> would<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.150> very

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
but something that they would be very

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.050 
but something that they would be very
happy<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.689> continue<00:01:07.110> doing<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.830> despite<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
happy to continue doing and despite the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.550 
happy to continue doing and despite the
fact<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.689> manufactured<00:01:10.320> most

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
fact that they have manufactured most

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.460

things<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.159> over<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.520> years<00:01:11.610> these<00:01:12.420> bits<00:01:13.170> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
things here over the years these bits of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.230 
things here over the years these bits of
glass<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> most<00:01:15.030> difficult

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
things they have ever produced I was

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
things they have ever produced I was
excited<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.439> both<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.310> also<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
excited because both was also one of the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
excited because both was also one of the
absolutely<00:01:21.720> strongest<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.650> sweetest<00:01:23.130> brands

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
absolutely strongest the sweetest brands

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.200 
absolutely strongest the sweetest brands
and<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.420> cooperate<00:01:25.430> those<00:01:26.430> brands<00:01:26.759> together<00:01:27.090> i

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and to cooperate those brands together i

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.960 
and to cooperate those brands together i
think<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:28.140> amazing<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.189> also<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
think it's it's amazing and it's also a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690 
think it's it's amazing and it's also a
new<00:01:30.600> chance<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.229> us<00:01:31.259> i<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.710> i<00:01:32.070> mean<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
new chance for us i think i mean we do a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.600 
new chance for us i think i mean we do a
lot<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.939> different<00:01:33.090> products<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:33.930> ought<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
lot of different products from ought to

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.859 
lot of different products from ought to
tableware<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:36.119> things<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.750> have

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
tableware and all things but we have

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
tableware and all things but we have
never<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.590> far<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.950> i<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.909> involving

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
never as far as i know in involving

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.530 
never as far as i know in involving
course<00:01:39.960> before<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.680> very<00:01:40.799> exciting<00:01:41.540> but

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
course before so it's very exciting but

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.630 
course before so it's very exciting but
even<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.470> crystal<00:01:43.890> art<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> very
