 hello everyone with you anya how I sing 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.999
 He suffered a little hair and body 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.799
 highlight copyrights are lighter now 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:17.289
 for spring will come soon in our chain 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:24.810
 come so you want something 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:25.960
 change everyone wanna tell you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.939
 protonation 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.259
 but in a slightly different aspect I want 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.960
 tell you about toning style 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.390
 lamination lamination as we know 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.670
 this is adding shine to the hair when 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.539
 deboning them with proteins here 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.180
 get a little different means 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:45.670
 hair volume and will be increased due to 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.969
 the fact that it will be paid with paints 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.129
 toner but because it is more toner 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.030
 light dye that is inside the hair 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.340
 This hair almost never comes 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 about bonded surface this way 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.769
 increasing the diameter of a little hair 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.560
 smoothing cuticles and due to this voice 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.020
 getting more brilliant and what I want 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.110
 say it's also safer 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.479
 method to add shine strip means in 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.509
 any store you can find paint toner 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.299
 in which there is no ammonia and developer 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.900
 weak is usually one price nine 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.759
 tenths of a percent or 3 percent if you 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.259
 just want to add some glitter 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.570
 what you need means what color do you need 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.479
 which one you need is the usual how simple 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.310
 colorless and they are practically in 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.100
 any line especially such paints 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.680
 ammonia free toners 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.960
 this time the hair dye treatment can 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.719
 just be 10 15 minutes they are so like 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.130
 less instructions indicated 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.409
 horses all the same can be observed if 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.399
 you use paint out of the box they 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.360
 professional also when using 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.880
 professional paint is also not quite 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.329
 no need means to handle this 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.460
 case with the purpose of lamination hair 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.200
 keep all this time which 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.229
 put and just 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.709
 15 minutes is quite enough and such 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.340
 toning here lamination easy 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.790
 can be done 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.739
 every month without harm to hair because 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.629
 that as I already understood all these 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.849
 items that are really 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.040
 with hot tools they 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.390
 sometimes sometimes the process itself 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.769
 on me i have been going through two or three 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.760
 months, hair becomes lifeless 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.610
 sky 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.030
 he safer bestow means you can 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:39.280
 tint hair tons and then with what 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.840
 purpose then over he goes on that if you 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.480
 do you want to tear it for example 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.120
 spoon-two sixes and you want to make 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.459
 its more what a brilliant more 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.579
 saturated but not much change then 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.470
 searches from 1 to 10 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.700
 determining the level of your color here 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.980
 for example my last brown 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.290
 six to the blackest is edinichka 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.180
 most sacred 10 some paint line in 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.700
 12 shades well, it's just already 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.680
 use common sense and if i want 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.470
 a bit then all your hair color 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.810
 so I choose level 6 if i don’t 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.940
 I want to darken here I choose 2 levels 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.389
 above, for example, eight, that is, any 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.030
 toner desired shade 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:22.230
 usually the first digit will already be 8 this 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.230
 level name 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.629
 and the level number means everything else 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.319
 there is already golden-ash so on and on 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.989
 etc. 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.640
 that is, quite simply and without any 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.019
 the difficulties of all this you can easily 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.330
 make a house of unity that always 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.370
 bought enough game to make at home 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.930
 you may not have enough but boxes and 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.239
 can be avoided 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.150
 you can avoid disappointment if you 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.860
 buy 2 boxes let her if 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.459
 colorless to red will take you to 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.250
 the future and no need to say cs not 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.819
 Enough paints concerns so somehow 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.790
 looks very ugly and cheap and 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.269
 although the toner is more so not strong 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.970
 such 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.980
 gram dramatic and mean contrasting 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.230
 effect however always always when 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.970
 always dye your hair out of the box 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.150
 take enough paint better take 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.109
 more than less means if you steal 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.109
 is he on that yet 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.039
 will talk you a little over the dungeon 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.370
 your hair color on since it's tony 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:31.340
 this paint is translucent then of course 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.250
 it will wash faster than such 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.090
 farm fickle paint but you 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.069
 it will shine because it means 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.780
 hair diameter increases of course 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.889
 not like with such an ordinary 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.289
 lamination 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.990
 but also damage the hair much 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.520
 less, that is, for example, we are doing 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.470
 highlighting even when I do not do 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.360
 highlighting almost every month I 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.580
 I make such an easy Ménéra when 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.940
 tournament assistance and I wanted it 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.819
 tell you well, that's probably all 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.560
 told if skit questions become a thing 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.979
 in the comment I want to show it also 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.599
