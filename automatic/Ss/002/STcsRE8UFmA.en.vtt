I remember looking in the mirror for the
first<00:01:06.979> time<00:01:07.399> to<00:01:07.520> see<00:01:07.639> how<00:01:07.789> this<00:01:07.969> figured<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.539> was

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
first time to see how this figured I was

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:11.590 
first time to see how this figured I was
it<00:01:09.049> not<00:01:09.709> knowing<00:01:10.189> how<00:01:10.459> would<00:01:10.670> look<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:11.179> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600

future

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.910 
future
so<00:01:13.969> in<00:01:14.270> part<00:01:14.719> of<00:01:14.780> my<00:01:14.810> recovery<00:01:15.049> I<00:01:15.439> began<00:01:15.709> to

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
so in part of my recovery I began to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.609 
so in part of my recovery I began to
write<00:01:16.100> can't<00:01:16.789> therapeutic<00:01:17.450> for<00:01:17.630> me<00:01:17.749> but<00:01:18.590> I

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
write can't therapeutic for me but I

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.039 
write can't therapeutic for me but I
just<00:01:18.740> didn't<00:01:19.219> start<00:01:19.459> with<00:01:19.609> the<00:01:19.670> gas<00:01:19.880> fire<00:01:20.659> I

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
just didn't start with the gas fire I

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.660 
just didn't start with the gas fire I
decided<00:01:21.529> to<00:01:21.619> write<00:01:21.709> by<00:01:21.889> my<00:01:22.039> whole<00:01:22.279> life<00:01:22.549> and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670

all<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.909> challenges<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:23.389> I<00:01:23.539> had<00:01:23.779> like<00:01:24.139> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
all the challenges that I had like and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.279 
all the challenges that I had like and
so<00:01:25.219> the<00:01:25.850> man<00:01:26.060> who<00:01:26.179> set<00:01:26.389> himself<00:01:26.539> up<00:01:26.840> quite<00:01:27.109> is<00:01:27.259> a

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
so the man who set himself up quite is a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.989 
so the man who set himself up quite is a
metaphor<00:01:27.920> because<00:01:28.100> there's<00:01:28.639> a<00:01:28.700> lot<00:01:28.939> of

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999
