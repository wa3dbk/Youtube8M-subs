so<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.590> know<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:50.040> it's<00:03:50.190> powerful<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:51.000> I

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
so I know that it's powerful and I

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.270 
so I know that it's powerful and I
haven't<00:03:51.540> used<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:52.019> yes<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.560> may<00:03:52.980> take<00:03:53.250> a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
haven't used it yes so it may take a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.189 
haven't used it yes so it may take a
while<00:03:53.519> for<00:03:53.699> me<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.879> get<00:03:54.000> used<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.269> either<00:03:54.780> way

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
while for me to get used to either way

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.830 
while for me to get used to either way
I'm<00:03:55.470> going<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.280> do<00:03:56.459> an<00:03:56.669> early<00:03:56.940> comparison

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
I'm going to do an early comparison

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.050 
I'm going to do an early comparison
between<00:03:57.959> -<00:03:58.470> boom<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.829> flash<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.280> my<00:03:59.819> first

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
between - boom and flash just my first

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.390 
between - boom and flash just my first
impressions<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:00.870> then<00:04:01.199> over<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> long<00:04:01.980> period

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
impressions and then over a long period

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.159 
impressions and then over a long period
of<00:04:02.459> time<00:04:02.549> I'm<00:04:02.970> gonna<00:04:03.060> be<00:04:03.239> releasing<00:04:03.599> -<00:04:03.900> boom

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
of time I'm gonna be releasing - boom

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.720 
of time I'm gonna be releasing - boom
content<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:04.829> there<00:04:04.980> may<00:04:05.159> be<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.370> bit<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.639> a

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
content so there may be a bit of a

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.879 
content so there may be a bit of a
migration<00:04:06.359> -<00:04:06.659> -<00:04:06.780> boom<00:04:07.019> who<00:04:07.230> knows<00:04:07.440> there<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:07.769> a

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
migration - - boom who knows there is a

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.619 
migration - - boom who knows there is a
version<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.400> people<00:04:08.609> can<00:04:08.909> use<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.090> free<00:04:09.329> a

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
version that people can use for free a

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.229 
version that people can use for free a
student<00:04:10.620> version<00:04:10.799> or<00:04:11.069> like<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.250> watermark

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
student version or like a watermark

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.879 
student version or like a watermark
version<00:04:12.569> I<00:04:12.629> don't<00:04:12.840> know<00:04:12.900> what<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.109> is<00:04:13.199> but<00:04:13.349> you

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
version I don't know what it is but you

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.949 
version I don't know what it is but you
can<00:04:14.040> use<00:04:14.159> it<00:04:14.190> essentially<00:04:14.940> without<00:04:15.449> having<00:04:15.810> to

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
can use it essentially without having to

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.289 
can use it essentially without having to
pay<00:04:16.440> for<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:16.799> there's<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.669> benefit<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.269> that

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
pay for it so there's a benefit to that

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.729 
pay for it so there's a benefit to that
as<00:04:18.510> well<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.930> that's<00:04:19.079> one<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.470> reasons

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
as well and that's one of the reasons

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.020 
as well and that's one of the reasons
that<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.979> was<00:04:20.070> thinking<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.400> maybe<00:04:20.609> doing<00:04:20.729> that

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
that I was thinking of maybe doing that

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.180 
that I was thinking of maybe doing that
massive<00:04:21.419> flash<00:04:21.750> pack<00:04:22.349> with<00:04:22.860> all<00:04:22.889> the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
extensive tutorials on flash because it

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.170 
extensive tutorials on flash because it
would<00:04:25.260> be<00:04:25.380> like<00:04:25.560> my<00:04:25.889> way

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
would be like my way

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.510 
would be like my way
of<00:04:26.270> finishing<00:04:27.139> with<00:04:27.740> flash<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.280> saying

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
of finishing with flash and saying

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.629 
of finishing with flash and saying
goodbye<00:04:28.880> but<00:04:29.600> providing<00:04:30.229> something<00:04:30.500> with<00:04:31.430> my
