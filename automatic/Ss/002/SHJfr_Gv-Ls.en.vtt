00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.340 
first thing you want to do is find a
surface<00:01:52.759> I<00:01:53.390> usually<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:53.780> cutting<00:01:54.170> or

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
surface I usually just cutting or

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.649 
surface I usually just cutting or
acidity<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.090> today<00:01:56.090> we're<00:01:56.240> using<00:01:57.729> metal<00:01:58.729> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
acidity you today we're using metal and

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.859 
acidity you today we're using metal and
what<00:01:59.780> doesn't<00:02:00.049> work<00:02:00.079> we'll<00:02:00.920> see<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:02.530> know

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
what doesn't work we'll see you know

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.059 
what doesn't work we'll see you know
people<00:02:05.869> change<00:02:05.899> their<00:02:06.170> baby's<00:02:06.560> diapers<00:02:06.920> on

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
people change their baby's diapers on

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.589 
people change their baby's diapers on
these<00:02:07.189> tables<00:02:07.520> we're<00:02:08.179> fine

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
these tables we're fine

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.690 
these tables we're fine
so<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:09.110> usually<00:02:09.470> do<00:02:09.769> about<00:02:09.979> three<00:02:10.220> inches<00:02:10.459> under

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
so I usually do about three inches under

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.300 
so I usually do about three inches under
the<00:02:10.729> pits<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.390> that's<00:02:12.140> usually<00:02:12.650> right

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the pits and that's usually right

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.830 
the pits and that's usually right
underneath

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
underneath

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.380 
underneath
where<00:02:16.410> I'll<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.310> little<00:02:17.760> bit<00:02:17.970> showing

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
where I'll be like a little bit showing

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.259 
where I'll be like a little bit showing
you<00:02:19.019> can<00:02:19.140> go<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.349> little<00:02:19.560> bit<00:02:19.709> lower<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:21.120> go

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
you can go a little bit lower you can go

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.550 
you can go a little bit lower you can go
a<00:02:21.300> little<00:02:21.420> bit<00:02:21.599> higher<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.170> that's<00:02:22.260> where<00:02:22.500> I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
a little bit higher but that's where I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.130 
a little bit higher but that's where I
like<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.190> also<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.209> do<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.510> right<00:02:24.810> here

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
like it I also like to do it right here

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.759 
like it I also like to do it right here
so<00:02:25.670> about<00:02:26.670> half<00:02:27.090> way<00:02:27.420> from<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.290> collar

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
so about half way from the collar

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.949 
so about half way from the collar
some<00:02:29.220> people<00:02:29.430> go<00:02:29.519> up<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.910> collar<00:02:30.120> some

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
some people go up to the collar some

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.509 
some people go up to the collar some
some<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.349> mine<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.459> time

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
some of mine are like that but this time

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.949 
some of mine are like that but this time
I'm<00:02:32.790> just<00:02:32.879> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.090> show<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.269> literally<00:02:33.750> I'm

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
out the door this is what I do okay so I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.050 
out the door this is what I do okay so I
do<00:02:39.120> about<00:02:39.750> three<00:02:40.140> inches

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
do about three inches

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.089 
do about three inches
it<00:02:42.390> doesn't<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.870> perfect<00:02:43.230> or<00:02:43.980> you

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
it doesn't have to be perfect or you

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.010 
it doesn't have to be perfect or you
start<00:02:44.310> from<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.489> bottom<00:02:44.840> interesting<00:02:45.840> right

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
start from the bottom interesting right

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.930 
start from the bottom interesting right
here<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.680> then<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.099> just<00:02:47.310> do<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.640> Halfmoon

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
here and then I just do like a Halfmoon

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.180 
here and then I just do like a Halfmoon
looked<00:02:48.630> at<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> top

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.380

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's not a good cutting situation but

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.620 
it's not a good cutting situation but
that's<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.460> using<00:03:06.670> fixes<00:03:07.000> we<00:03:07.330> do<00:03:07.450> she'll

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.140 
take this piece and flip it and put on
the<00:03:53.810> other<00:03:53.900> side<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.260> cut<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.730> fold<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.120> a

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
the other side and cut it so fold and a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.130 
the other side and cut it so fold and a
half<00:03:56.270> is<00:03:56.420> good<00:03:56.600> I've<00:03:56.780> never<00:03:56.959> thought<00:03:57.080> about

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
half is good I've never thought about

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.270 
half is good I've never thought about
that<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.620> just<00:03:57.860> fold<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.220> in<00:03:58.310> half

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.710 

and<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.880> could<00:04:02.060> do<00:04:02.210> that<00:04:02.330> I've<00:04:02.510> done<00:04:02.660> that

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
and you could do that I've done that

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.540 
and you could do that I've done that
before<00:04:02.990> with<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.410> piece<00:04:03.620> but<00:04:03.950> when<00:04:04.310> I'm<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.490> a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
before with the piece but when I'm in a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.770 
before with the piece but when I'm in a
rush<00:04:04.730> like<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.120> don't<00:04:05.210> have<00:04:05.360> time<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.660> be

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
rush like I don't have time to be

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.050 
rush like I don't have time to be
literally<00:04:06.710> just<00:04:06.980> fold<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.430> go<00:04:07.550> no<00:04:07.880> this<00:04:07.970> is

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
literally just fold it and go no this is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.950 
literally just fold it and go no this is
a<00:04:08.120> good<00:04:08.210> idea<00:04:08.330> I've<00:04:08.570> never<00:04:08.750> even<00:04:08.840> thought

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
a good idea I've never even thought

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.050 
a good idea I've never even thought
about<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.320> this<00:04:09.410> way<00:04:09.650> I've<00:04:09.860> always<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.820> and

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
about it this way I've always it and

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.770 
about it this way I've always it and
then<00:04:11.420> I<00:04:11.750> kind<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:13.420> kind<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.510> go<00:04:14.600> like<00:04:14.750> a
