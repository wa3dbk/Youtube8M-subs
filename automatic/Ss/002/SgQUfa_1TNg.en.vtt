diagram you see this is a bumper player

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.120 
diagram you see this is a bumper player
it's<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.989> lot<00:04:04.200> bigger<00:04:04.350> than<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.709> 20

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
it's a lot bigger than the 20

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.410 
it's a lot bigger than the 20
that<00:04:05.670> had<00:04:06.650> their<00:04:07.650> also<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.950> lot<00:04:08.310> wider<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:09.270> when

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
that had their also a lot wider so when

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.000 
that had their also a lot wider so when
you<00:04:09.510> do<00:04:09.630> get<00:04:09.840> these<00:04:09.990> they<00:04:10.380> take<00:04:10.590> up<00:04:10.740> a<00:04:10.830> lot<00:04:10.980> of

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
you do get these they take up a lot of

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.320 
you do get these they take up a lot of
space<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.430> your<00:04:11.610> bar<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.760> that's<00:04:11.970> something

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
space on your bar and that's something

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.830 
space on your bar and that's something
that<00:04:12.420> you've<00:04:12.510> got<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.660> take<00:04:12.870> into<00:04:13.020> account

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
that you've got to take into account

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.199 
that you've got to take into account
they're<00:04:15.840> awkward<00:04:15.990> to<00:04:16.260> pick<00:04:16.440> up<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.739> be<00:04:16.860> honest

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
they're awkward to pick up to be honest

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.360 
they're awkward to pick up to be honest
especially<00:04:18.209> my<00:04:18.720> gym<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:19.380> really<00:04:19.680> tight<00:04:20.010> spear

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
especially my gym is really tight spear

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.979 
especially my gym is really tight spear
so<00:04:20.640> I<00:04:20.820> end<00:04:21.209> up<00:04:21.270> having<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.630> grab<00:04:21.810> them<00:04:21.959> like

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
so I end up having to grab them like

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.930 
so I end up having to grab them like
with<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.350> pinch<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.250> lift<00:04:23.460> them<00:04:23.610> up<00:04:23.700> at<00:04:23.850> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
with a pinch and lift them up at the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.060 
with a pinch and lift them up at the
side<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.480> can<00:04:24.660> be<00:04:24.750> quite<00:04:24.900> awkward<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.560> give<00:04:25.950> you

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
side and can be quite awkward I give you

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.730 
side and can be quite awkward I give you
a<00:04:26.130> little<00:04:26.550> bit<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:27.290> comparison<00:04:28.290> in<00:04:28.500> size

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
a little bit of a comparison in size

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.260 
a little bit of a comparison in size
just<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:29.070> show<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.400> what<00:04:29.700> they<00:04:29.850> are<00:04:29.970> active

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
just to show you what they are active

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.240 
just to show you what they are active
like<00:04:30.480> side<00:04:30.720> by<00:04:30.870> side<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.290> show<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.590> what<00:04:32.130> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
like side by side and show you what the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.530 
like side by side and show you what the
actual<00:04:32.370> differences<00:04:32.910> between<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.360> proper

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
actual differences between the proper

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.630 
actual differences between the proper
size<00:04:33.780> blur<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.860> cheap<00:04:35.070> layers<00:04:35.310> that<00:04:35.460> you

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
size blur and the cheap layers that you

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.060 
size blur and the cheap layers that you
can<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:37.110> like<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.410> can<00:04:37.560> see<00:04:37.710> there<00:04:37.920> there

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
can get so like you can see there there

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.590 
can get so like you can see there there
is<00:04:38.190> quite<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.520> clear<00:04:38.790> difference<00:04:39.150> between<00:04:39.240> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
is quite a clear difference between the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.050 
is quite a clear difference between the
sizes<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.050> these<00:04:40.200> two<00:04:40.410> plaits<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.950> this<00:04:41.850> does

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
sizes of these two plaits and this does

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.460 
sizes of these two plaits and this does
make<00:04:42.270> quite<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.660> lot<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:42.900> difference<00:04:43.290> when

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
make quite a lot of difference when

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.720 
make quite a lot of difference when
you're<00:04:43.590> doing<00:04:43.800> things<00:04:43.950> like<00:04:44.040> deadlifts<00:04:44.640> or

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
you're doing things like deadlifts or

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.480 
you're doing things like deadlifts or
Pendley<00:04:45.330> rows<00:04:45.600> things<00:04:45.960> like<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:46.370> so<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
Pendley rows things like that so the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.070 
Pendley rows things like that so the
other<00:04:47.640> type<00:04:47.790> ways<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.480> you<00:04:48.540> can<00:04:48.690> get<00:04:48.870> are

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
other type ways that you can get are
