00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.529
 while the seat is in Cairo a small boat using crutches of 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.639
 trucks 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.939
 the door 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.499
 two aces in that sense 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.559
 and logically there would be a loss of afp 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.849
 remove the drill 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.329
 l get rid of everything you have in your hands 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.589
 to ter the Belgian do not know why but it's like that 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.589
 lengthen the budget of the state reached not win the first course 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.810
 so percent of the voices what is truth 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.770
 they are 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 before you get there because if it's a bit complicated 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 so you have to hurry between agen 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.490
 so you're talking about the door 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.230
 a request that does not pull 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.330
 and after cakes so that momentum 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.380
 so the lousiane 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
 a lot relies on technical input directly you hang on europe 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.210
 in this case especially it's not there you're going to block you 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 this expert 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
 so here is the now the record in mourning 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.840
 it seems to me ko we can go far enough in space if they exist only the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.290
 core of pop 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290
 we are only asking for friendship 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.170
 here are especially along the edges 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.230
 and that it was not necessary to shoot him off camouflage everyone 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.600
 so we see in the distance 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 the lte 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 all our markets at the market 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.010
 inspired 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.370
 we can obviously cross a third we adopt a guy well 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.059
 thus I'll go 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.059
 horror and more in the tone you're not going to something acceptable 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.049
 you will go under the skin 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.049
 as what is desired 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.399
 and especially do not forget to jump over barriers that makes me 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.249
 lose to square viiip 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.249
 in case it makes me down 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.399
 so the stock market 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.409
 the armada to notice that there is to say invisible 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.669
 so you go on tour 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.669
 no one in the past year 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.969
 here 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.519
 after borat blocked on the road 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.219
 so there is the road 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.489
 so there is always the invisible mayor 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.719
 we continue and we continue we will continue 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.729
 and bring closer takes the institute the road 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.749
 so fear that after they learned yesterday 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.749
 al-gharani also at the bottom of the court 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.679
 in clear I could continue to hear 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.189
 m 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.779
 so that's the end of the lease
