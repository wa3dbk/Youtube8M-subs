Schultz of Arizona victory explains so
Roger<00:00:15.269> he<00:00:15.570> clearly<00:00:15.960> see<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> Harley<00:00:16.800> what

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
Roger he clearly see on the Harley what

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.650 
Roger he clearly see on the Harley what
they've<00:00:17.460> done<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.090> cylinders<00:00:18.510> are

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
they've done because the cylinders are

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.490 
they've done because the cylinders are
in<00:00:18.720> line<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.289> their<00:00:19.470> engine<00:00:19.859> they've<00:00:20.670> had<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
in line on their engine they've had to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.439 
in line on their engine they've had to
basically<00:00:22.500> hollow<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.789> connecting<00:00:24.210> rods

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
basically hollow out the connecting rods

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.720 
basically hollow out the connecting rods
so<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> rods<00:00:25.439> could<00:00:25.710> run<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.250> pin<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so that the rods could run on one pin to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.429 
so that the rods could run on one pin to
act<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.150> scissor<00:00:27.510> motion<00:00:27.689> because<00:00:28.199> they're

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
act in a scissor motion because they're

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
act in a scissor motion because they're
the<00:00:28.830> cylinders<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.429> aligned<00:00:29.699> which<00:00:30.150> all<00:00:30.359> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the cylinders are aligned which all that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.999 
the cylinders are aligned which all that
does<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.720> create<00:00:31.140> weak<00:00:31.320> points<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> rods

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
does is create weak points on the rods

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.190 
does is create weak points on the rods
if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.520> notice<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> how<00:00:33.690> hollowed<00:00:34.110> out

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
if you can notice that how hollowed out

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.959 
if you can notice that how hollowed out
the<00:00:34.380> rods<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.860> compared<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.670> victory

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the rods are compared to the victory

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.729 
the rods are compared to the victory
motor<00:00:36.180> next<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
motor next to it you can see the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.500 
motor next to it you can see the
strength<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> victory<00:00:38.760> motor<00:00:38.969> very

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
strength is in the victory motor very

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.240 
strength is in the victory motor very
simply<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.200> we're<00:00:40.410> running<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> same

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
simply because we're running on the same

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.340 
simply because we're running on the same
pin<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.120> Harley<00:00:42.390> does<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.020> since<00:00:43.260> our

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
pin as the Harley does but since our

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.110 
pin as the Harley does but since our
cylinders<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:43.950> offset<00:00:44.340> we're<00:00:44.520> able<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.910> run

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
cylinders are offset we're able to run

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.220 
cylinders are offset we're able to run
full<00:00:46.370> connecting<00:00:47.370> rods<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.879> our<00:00:48.420> motors<00:00:48.719> hence

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
full connecting rods on our motors hence

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.750 
full connecting rods on our motors hence
we<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.070> weak<00:00:50.250> link

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
we don't have that weak link

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.369 
we don't have that weak link
like<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> hardy<00:00:51.329> motor<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.930> Roger<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.320> know

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
like the hardy motor so Roger you know

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.069 
like the hardy motor so Roger you know
what<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.890> oh<00:00:53.070> that's<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.879> rod<00:00:54.090> well<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
what this is oh that's a rod well it is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.160 
what this is oh that's a rod well it is
a<00:00:55.199> push<00:00:55.440> rod<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> even<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.480> Ford<00:00:57.780> product

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
a push rod and even that Ford product

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
a push rod and even that Ford product
you're<00:00:58.289> driving<00:00:58.649> today<00:00:58.739> doesn't<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.760> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you're driving today doesn't have one of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
you're driving today doesn't have one of
these<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.180> their<00:01:00.300> motor<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.410> their<00:01:01.770> push

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
these in their motor this is their push

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.990 
these in their motor this is their push
rod<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:02.609> comes<00:01:02.820> off<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> lifter<00:01:04.549> up<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
rod which comes off a lifter up to the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.910 
rod which comes off a lifter up to the
rocker<00:01:06.360> assembly<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.080> operate<00:01:07.380> their<00:01:07.530> bowels

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
rocker assembly to operate their bowels

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.700 
rocker assembly to operate their bowels
victory<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.330> other<00:01:09.479> hand<00:01:09.720> there<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.530> no

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
victory on the other hand there are no

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.539 
victory on the other hand there are no
push<00:01:10.950> rods<00:01:11.250> its<00:01:11.790> overhead<00:01:12.210> cams<00:01:13.549> directly

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
push rods its overhead cams directly

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.100 
push rods its overhead cams directly
driven<00:01:14.700> off<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> cam<00:01:15.360> onto<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> rocker

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
driven off the cam onto the rocker

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
driven off the cam onto the rocker
assembly<00:01:16.710> that's<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> difference

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
assembly that's the difference

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.330 
assembly that's the difference
so<00:01:18.659> even<00:01:18.900> today's<00:01:19.140> automotive<00:01:19.770> technology

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
so even today's automotive technology

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.460 
so even today's automotive technology
has<00:01:20.520> virtually<00:01:20.970> eliminated<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.659> component

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
has virtually eliminated this component

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.760 
has virtually eliminated this component
out<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.979> their<00:01:23.100> motors<00:01:23.400> yet<00:01:23.880> Harley<00:01:24.770> still

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
out of their motors yet Harley still

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.120 
out of their motors yet Harley still
runs<00:01:26.009> them<00:01:26.159> today<00:01:26.600> 109<00:01:27.600> years<00:01:27.750> later<00:01:28.130> fuel

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
runs them today 109 years later fuel

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.030 
runs them today 109 years later fuel
injection<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:30.780> mentioned<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.829> firm

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
injection you mentioned you your firm

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.550 
injection you mentioned you your firm
believer<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.340> fuel<00:01:32.549> injection<00:01:32.939> stole<00:01:33.150> my

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
believer in fuel injection stole my

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.780 
believer in fuel injection stole my
carburation<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.950> don't<00:01:35.280> even<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.549> them<00:01:35.670> on

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
carburation I don't even like them on

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.969 
carburation I don't even like them on
lawn<00:01:35.970> mowers<00:01:36.180> anymore<00:01:36.659> okay<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.740> you'll

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
lawn mowers anymore okay if you'll

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.010 
lawn mowers anymore okay if you'll
notice<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.360> where<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.600> injectors

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
notice here this is where the injectors

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.450 
notice here this is where the injectors
are<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> Harley<00:01:40.770> they're<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> intake

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
are on a Harley they're on the intake

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.130 
are on a Harley they're on the intake
manifold<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> intake<00:01:42.570> between<00:01:42.960> both

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
manifold this is the intake between both

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.160 
manifold this is the intake between both
motors<00:01:43.530> yeah<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:45.240> reason<00:01:45.420> they're<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
motors yeah the reason they're here is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.109 
motors yeah the reason they're here is
because<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.189> motor<00:01:47.460> originally<00:01:48.000> was

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
because this motor originally was

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.060 
because this motor originally was
carbureted<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.810> our<00:01:49.229> most<00:01:49.439> other<00:01:49.710> motors

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
carbureted as our most other motors

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
carbureted as our most other motors
honda<00:01:50.670> Kawasaki<00:01:51.210> they<00:01:51.479> started<00:01:51.840> out<00:01:51.930> their

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
honda Kawasaki they started out their

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.050 
honda Kawasaki they started out their
life<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.649> engineered<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> carbureted

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

motor<00:01:54.270> what's<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> easiest<00:01:55.380> way<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> tell<00:01:55.829> you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
motor what's the easiest way to tell you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.499 
motor what's the easiest way to tell you
see<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.579> air<00:01:56.759> cleaner<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.240> you're<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
see this air cleaner or you're on the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.420 
see this air cleaner or you're on the
side<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> motor<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.469> okay

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
side of the motor I do okay

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.550 
side of the motor I do okay
whenever<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.030> mount<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.540> v-twin<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.110> any<00:02:01.259> kind

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
whenever you mount a v-twin of any kind

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
whenever you mount a v-twin of any kind
and<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.799> see<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> air<00:02:02.189> cleaner<00:02:02.430> stuck<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and you see the air cleaner stuck on the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270 
and you see the air cleaner stuck on the
side<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.509> engine<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.350> typically

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
side of the engine like that typically

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.469 
side of the engine like that typically
is<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.790> started<00:02:06.119> out<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
is because it started out as a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.900 
is because it started out as a
carbureted<00:02:07.140> engine<00:02:07.950> okay<00:02:08.340> here's<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
carbureted engine okay here's the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.820 
carbureted engine okay here's the
problem<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.259> air<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.770> to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
problem with that the air is going to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.220 
problem with that the air is going to
flow<00:02:11.039> across<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
flow across this

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.949 
flow across this
superhot<00:02:12.769> exhaust<00:02:13.159> pipe<00:02:13.430> which<00:02:13.670> can<00:02:13.849> be<00:02:14.030> 600

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
superhot exhaust pipe which can be 600

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.509 
superhot exhaust pipe which can be 600

800 degrees a thousand degrees they're

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.509 
800 degrees a thousand degrees they're
easy<00:02:16.760> across<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:17.810> very<00:02:18.019> hot<00:02:18.260> head<00:02:18.530> into<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
easy across it's very hot head into the

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.119 
easy across it's very hot head into the
air<00:02:19.640> cleaner<00:02:20.000> than<00:02:20.450> into<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.870> motor<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.379> let

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
air cleaner than into the motor and let

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.289 
air cleaner than into the motor and let
me<00:02:22.250> tell<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.549> as<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.760> probably<00:02:22.970> are<00:02:23.120> well

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
me tell you as you probably are well

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.180 
me tell you as you probably are well
aware<00:02:23.569> hot<00:02:24.110> air<00:02:24.349> is<00:02:24.470> not<00:02:24.620> what<00:02:24.799> makes<00:02:24.950> power

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
aware hot air is not what makes power

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.610 
aware hot air is not what makes power
it's<00:02:25.790> cold<00:02:26.150> air<00:02:26.360> now<00:02:27.170> let's<00:02:27.379> look<00:02:27.440> at<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
it's cold air now let's look at the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.170 
it's cold air now let's look at the
difference<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.430> see<00:02:28.580> your<00:02:28.700> throttle<00:02:29.030> body

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
difference you see your throttle body

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.360 
difference you see your throttle body
assembly<00:02:29.360> here<00:02:29.870> yeah<00:02:30.230> our<00:02:30.590> air<00:02:30.830> intakes<00:02:31.190> are

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
assembly here yeah our air intakes are

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.509 
assembly here yeah our air intakes are
here<00:02:31.640> our<00:02:32.480> fuel<00:02:33.260> injectors<00:02:33.769> go<00:02:34.099> right<00:02:34.280> here<00:02:34.459> in

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
here our fuel injectors go right here in

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.070 
here our fuel injectors go right here in
these<00:02:34.640> holes<00:02:34.849> where<00:02:35.030> my<00:02:35.120> fingers<00:02:35.450> go<00:02:35.599> okay

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
these holes where my fingers go okay

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.630 
these holes where my fingers go okay
they're<00:02:36.349> direct<00:02:36.650> injection<00:02:37.160> into<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.489> head

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
they're direct injection into the head

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.470 
they're direct injection into the head
why

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
why

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.600 
why
victory<00:02:39.410> motors<00:02:39.769> have<00:02:40.220> never<00:02:40.459> been

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
victory motors have never been

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.729 
victory motors have never been
carbureted<00:02:41.150> ever<00:02:41.329> and<00:02:41.629> cannot<00:02:41.959> be<00:02:42.170> carbureted

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
carbureted ever and cannot be carbureted

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.289 
carbureted ever and cannot be carbureted
unless<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.159> spend<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.459> gazillion<00:02:43.760> dollars<00:02:43.879> to

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
unless you spend a gazillion dollars to

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.420 
unless you spend a gazillion dollars to
do<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.540> they're<00:02:45.170> engineered<00:02:45.709> as<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> throttle

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
do it they're engineered as a throttle

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.990 
do it they're engineered as a throttle

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
example when your box system is on it

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.270 
example when your box system is on it
and<00:02:52.760> sits<00:02:53.750> up<00:02:53.930> here<00:02:54.140> like<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.500> if<00:02:54.769> you'll

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
and sits up here like this if you'll

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.369 
and sits up here like this if you'll
notice<00:02:55.670> our<00:02:55.879> air<00:02:56.120> intake<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:56.959> front<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.319> the

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
notice our air intake is in front of the

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.190 
notice our air intake is in front of the
motor<00:02:57.700> why<00:02:58.700> we're<00:02:59.329> sucking<00:02:59.599> in<00:02:59.840> nothing<00:03:00.170> but

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
motor why we're sucking in nothing but

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.789 
motor why we're sucking in nothing but
cool<00:03:00.530> fresh<00:03:00.859> air<00:03:01.129> in<00:03:01.370> Arizona<00:03:02.209> still<00:03:03.140> 115

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
cool fresh air in Arizona still 115

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.430 
cool fresh air in Arizona still 115
degrees<00:03:04.129> but<00:03:04.519> it's<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.760> lot<00:03:04.940> cooler<00:03:05.120> than<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> 500

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
degrees but it's a lot cooler than a 500

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.599 
degrees but it's a lot cooler than a 500
or<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.560> thousand<00:03:06.920> degrees<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.310> are<00:03:07.400> being

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
or a thousand degrees that are being

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.039 
or a thousand degrees that are being
sucked<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:07.940> by<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.120> holidays<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.690> Honda's

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
sucked in by the holidays and Honda's

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.479 
sucked in by the holidays and Honda's
and<00:03:09.170> everybody<00:03:09.500> else<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.310> why<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
and everybody else this is why the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.190 
and everybody else this is why the
victories<00:03:11.060> also<00:03:11.720> make<00:03:11.900> power<00:03:12.140> got<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:14.049> this<00:03:15.049> is

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
victories also make power got it this is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.140

inventory should probably heard your

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
o-ring or a gasket how many more times

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.590 
o-ring or a gasket how many more times
there<00:05:14.130> are<00:05:14.190> five<00:05:14.370> to<00:05:14.580> ten<00:05:14.760> times<00:05:14.970> more<00:05:15.180> prone

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
there are five to ten times more prone

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.689 
there are five to ten times more prone
to<00:05:16.199> an<00:05:16.320> opportunity<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.979> leak<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.340> that's<00:05:17.430> why

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
to an opportunity to leak and that's why

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.550 
to an opportunity to leak and that's why
that's<00:05:18.270> why<00:05:18.360> victories<00:05:18.810> don't<00:05:18.960> leak<00:05:19.199> that's

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
that's why victories don't leak that's

easily do in your driveway so as I was
mentioning<00:05:54.479> earlier<00:05:55.280> this<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.430> basically<00:05:56.849> set

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
mentioning earlier this is basically set

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.969 
mentioning earlier this is basically set
up<00:05:57.330> very<00:05:57.750> similar<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:58.289> what<00:05:58.410> you<00:05:58.530> saw<00:05:58.740> in<00:05:58.860> the

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
up very similar to what you saw in the

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.650 
up very similar to what you saw in the
earlier<00:05:59.190> years<00:05:59.820> with<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.060> Dodge<00:06:00.210> how<00:06:00.479> many

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
earlier years with the Dodge how many

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.689 
earlier years with the Dodge how many
that<00:06:01.050> they've<00:06:01.199> also<00:06:01.380> brought<00:06:01.710> back<00:06:01.919> out<00:06:02.160> got

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
that they've also brought back out got

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:03.830 
that they've also brought back out got
the<00:06:02.820> spark<00:06:03.060> plug<00:06:03.270> right<00:06:03.449> in<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.630> middle<00:06:03.780> of

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
the spark plug right in the middle of

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.750 
the spark plug right in the middle of
the<00:06:03.930> combustion<00:06:04.229> chamber<00:06:04.710> yep<00:06:05.099> this<00:06:05.699> is

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
the combustion chamber yep this is

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.460 
the combustion chamber yep this is
probably<00:06:06.120> one<00:06:06.240> of<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.389> big<00:06:06.570> reasons<00:06:06.810> that

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
probably one of the big reasons that

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.070 
probably one of the big reasons that
NASCAR<00:06:07.770> outlaw<00:06:08.430> outlawed<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.360> Dodge<00:06:09.539> Hemi<00:06:09.840> in

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
NASCAR outlaw outlawed the Dodge Hemi in

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.770 
NASCAR outlaw outlawed the Dodge Hemi in
the<00:06:10.470> 70s<00:06:10.949> because<00:06:11.099> that<00:06:11.490> engine<00:06:12.300> made<00:06:12.449> so<00:06:12.660> much

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
the 70s because that engine made so much

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.140 
the 70s because that engine made so much
power<00:06:13.080> compared<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.560> Ford<00:06:13.860> GM<00:06:14.160> that<00:06:14.849> they<00:06:14.970> said

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
power compared to Ford GM that they said

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.490 
power compared to Ford GM that they said
they<00:06:15.300> had<00:06:15.419> an<00:06:15.539> unfair<00:06:15.810> advantage<00:06:15.930> you<00:06:16.380> no

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
they had an unfair advantage you no

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.830 
they had an unfair advantage you no
longer<00:06:16.650> could<00:06:16.800> run<00:06:16.979> the<00:06:17.099> Hemi<00:06:17.250> motor<00:06:17.490> in<00:06:18.000> it<00:06:18.330> we

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
longer could run the Hemi motor in it we

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.300 
longer could run the Hemi motor in it we
don't<00:06:18.870> have<00:06:19.199> that<00:06:19.410> problem<00:06:19.560> with<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:19.949> victory

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
don't have that problem with the victory

don't have that problem with the victory
okay<00:06:20.760> they're<00:06:21.120> not<00:06:21.240> out<00:06:21.449> long<00:06:21.690> but<00:06:22.050> that's<00:06:22.380> one

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
okay they're not out long but that's one

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.260 
okay they're not out long but that's one
of<00:06:22.650> the<00:06:22.710> reasons<00:06:22.979> we<00:06:23.130> make<00:06:23.340> so<00:06:23.610> much<00:06:23.669> power<00:06:24.000> on

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
of the reasons we make so much power on

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.250 
of the reasons we make so much power on
these<00:06:24.389> motorcycles<00:06:25.080> excellent
