trigger has a long pull and then after

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.339 
trigger has a long pull and then after
the<00:01:59.899> slide<00:02:00.259> goes<00:02:01.250> back<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.789> chambers<00:02:02.149> around

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
after the slide operates one time it

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.669 
after the slide operates one time it
goes<00:02:06.349> from<00:02:07.239> it<00:02:08.239> goes<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.599> single<00:02:08.899> action<00:02:09.229> when

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
goes from it goes to single action when

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.520 
goes from it goes to single action when
the<00:02:09.799> slides<00:02:10.099> racked<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:11.599> cocks<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.140> spring

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the slides racked it cocks the spring

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.890 
the slides racked it cocks the spring
and<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:13.310> lightens<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.670> trigger<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.720> the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and it lightens the trigger so the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.890 
and it lightens the trigger so the
double<00:02:15.200> action<00:02:15.380> trigger<00:02:15.680> might<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.900> ten

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
double action trigger might be ten

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.770 
double action trigger might be ten
pounds<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.829> single<00:02:19.250> action<00:02:19.430> trigger<00:02:19.780> might

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
pounds the single action trigger might

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.890 
pounds the single action trigger might
be<00:02:20.989> four<00:02:21.410> pounds<00:02:21.829> so<00:02:21.970> that's<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.150> type<00:02:23.359> of<00:02:23.390> HK

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
be four pounds so that's the type of HK

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.400 
be four pounds so that's the type of HK
I<00:02:24.109> have<00:02:24.579> so<00:02:25.579> I<00:02:25.880> don't<00:02:26.209> think<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.630> tell<00:02:26.780> um<00:02:27.109> I

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
I have so I don't think it's a tell um I

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.599 
I have so I don't think it's a tell um I
don't<00:02:27.650> know<00:02:27.799> why<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.690> manual<00:02:30.230> says<00:02:30.620> lem<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.459> it

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
don't know why the manual says lem on it

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.430 
don't know why the manual says lem on it
it's<00:02:32.120> probably<00:02:32.540> one<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.660> those<00:02:32.810> manuals<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's probably one of those manuals that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.620 
it's probably one of those manuals that
just<00:02:33.620> cover<00:02:33.829> all<00:02:33.920> models<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:35.329> made<00:02:35.510> me

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
just cover all models and it made me

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.080

get a little trick of time now I know
the<00:04:35.610> HP<00:04:36.030> trigger<00:04:36.360> a<00:04:36.479> little<00:04:36.629> better<00:04:36.930> because<00:04:37.110> I

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
the HP trigger a little better because I

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.980 
the HP trigger a little better because I
just<00:04:37.439> shot<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.800> on<00:04:37.889> long<00:04:38.129> ago<00:04:38.539> and<00:04:39.539> that's<00:04:39.870> a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
just shot it on long ago and that's a

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.050 
just shot it on long ago and that's a

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
hell of a lot better I can get them all

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.170 
hell of a lot better I can get them all
in<00:04:45.120> that<00:04:45.330> first<00:04:45.599> circle<00:04:46.639> that<00:04:47.639> would<00:04:47.759> be<00:04:47.879> great

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
in that first circle that would be great

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.330 
in that first circle that would be great
but<00:04:48.389> that's<00:04:48.930> that's<00:04:49.289> not<00:04:49.560> bad<00:04:49.800> that's<00:04:50.069> not<00:04:50.219> bad

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
but that's that's not bad that's not bad

but that's that's not bad that's not bad
it's<00:04:50.819> still<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.090> sporadic<00:04:51.870> pattern<00:04:53.060> but<00:04:54.060> it's

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
it's still a sporadic pattern but it's

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.959

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969 
it's I'm happy with that I don't think I

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.070 
it's I'm happy with that I don't think I
would<00:04:57.150> get<00:04:57.599> that<00:04:57.840> result<00:04:58.110> yet<00:04:58.500> but<00:04:59.310> just<00:04:59.490> go

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
would get that result yet but just go

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:34.370 
would get that result yet but just go
alrights<00:05:01.080> do<00:05:01.259> it<00:05:01.379> again

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380
