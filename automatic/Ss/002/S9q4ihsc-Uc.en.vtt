wrong<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.530> everyone<00:02:05.010> about<00:02:05.280> weights

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:28.970 
wrong with everyone about weights
started<00:02:06.720> boxing<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:18.980> 14<00:02:19.980> stole<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
started boxing to 14 stole so the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.360 
started boxing to 14 stole so the
biggest<00:02:29.130> issue<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:29.580> most<00:02:29.700> boxers<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.210> find<00:02:30.510> is

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
biggest issue for most boxers I find is

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.670 
biggest issue for most boxers I find is
controlling<00:02:32.370> their<00:02:32.580> weight<00:02:33.560> when<00:02:34.560> they're

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
controlling their weight when they're
