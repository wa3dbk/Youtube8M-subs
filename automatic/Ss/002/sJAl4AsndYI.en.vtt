going to be the PlayStation 4 exclusive

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.999 
going to be the PlayStation 4 exclusive
now<00:01:21.240> personally<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:21.900> black<00:01:22.500> shield<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
now personally I think black shield and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.980 
now personally I think black shield and
widows<00:01:23.490> court<00:01:23.850> will<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.330> every<00:01:24.750> platform

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
widows court will be on every platform

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
widows court will be on every platform
because<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.680> are<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.979> new<00:01:26.189> locations<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
because there are on new locations and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609 
because there are on new locations and
it<00:01:27.119> would<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.659> mean<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.110> lock<00:01:28.290> off<00:01:28.439> these

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
it would be a bit mean to lock off these

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.620 
it would be a bit mean to lock off these
new<00:01:28.829> locations<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.610> PlayStation<00:01:30.150> users<00:01:30.450> only

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
new locations to PlayStation users only

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
new locations to PlayStation users only
but<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.259> any<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.250> my

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
but it could be any of these but my

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.710 
but it could be any of these but my
guess<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.119> either<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
guess is it will either be the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
guess is it will either be the
timekeeper<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.979> will<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.189> thieves<00:01:35.520> den

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
timekeeper or it will be thieves den

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
timekeeper or it will be thieves den
just<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.079> locations<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
just because these are in locations that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.350 
just because these are in locations that
we've<00:01:37.890> already<00:01:38.040> seen<00:01:38.430> before<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.970> they<00:01:39.180> won't

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
we've already seen before and they won't

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
we've already seen before and they won't
be<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.049> new<00:01:40.320> aesthetically<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> is

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
be like to new aesthetically so that is

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
be like to new aesthetically so that is
my<00:01:41.939> guess<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.990> could<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.380> any<00:01:43.590> one

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
my guess on it but it could be any one

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130 
my guess on it but it could be any one
of<00:01:43.950> these<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.670> course<00:01:45.060> Xbox<00:01:45.540> users<00:01:45.899> will

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.320 
you excited to play on them originally
when<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.009> saw<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> gameplay<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> black

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
when I saw the gameplay of the black

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
when I saw the gameplay of the black
shield<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.840> Phobos<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:10.830> still<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.250> was

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
shield on Phobos I actually still it was

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.020 
shield on Phobos I actually still it was
on<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> moon<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:12.090> taking<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.480> look<00:02:12.629> at<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> now

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
on the moon but taking a look at it now

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.610 
on the moon but taking a look at it now
we<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.300> realize<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.170> actually<00:02:14.380> on

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
we can realize that it is actually on

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.470 
we can realize that it is actually on
Phobos<00:02:14.980> because<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.310> can<00:02:15.459> see<00:02:15.670> mars<00:02:16.240> in<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
Phobos because you can see mars in the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.910 
Phobos because you can see mars in the
background<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.020> has<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.260> sort<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.500> orange

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
background it has this sort of orange

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.410 
background it has this sort of orange
glow<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.400> which<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.970> thought<00:02:19.120> was<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.300> bit

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
glow to it which I thought was a bit

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.180 
glow to it which I thought was a bit
unusual<00:02:19.569> for<00:02:19.870> being<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.530> moon<00:02:20.709> but<00:02:21.040> now<00:02:21.130> we

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
unusual for being on the moon but now we

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.220 
unusual for being on the moon but now we
know<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.819> is<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.240> black<00:02:22.450> shield<00:02:22.720> map<00:02:22.990> and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
know that it is the black shield map and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.050 
know that it is the black shield map and
we<00:02:23.319> know<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.590> other<00:02:23.920> map<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.340> probably<00:02:24.850> going

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
we know the other map is probably going

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.940 
we know the other map is probably going
