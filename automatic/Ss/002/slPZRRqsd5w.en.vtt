system very impressed with the age sixty
actually<00:01:44.450> it's<00:01:44.630> about<00:01:44.960> 25<00:01:45.530> percent

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
actually it's about 25 percent

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.640 
actually it's about 25 percent
improvement<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:47.479> temperatures<00:01:48.080> than<00:01:48.440> the

improvement and temperatures than the

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.609 
improvement and temperatures than the
age<00:01:48.920> 50<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.810> prices<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:50.840> come<00:01:51.140> down<00:01:51.200> which

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
age 50 and prices have come down which

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.430 
age 50 and prices have come down which
is<00:01:51.740> good<00:01:52.149> one<00:01:53.149> thing<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.540> remember<00:01:53.720> with<00:01:54.140> the

facility to fit a fan on the board which

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.620 
facility to fit a fan on the board which
is<00:02:00.110> recommended<00:02:00.440> if<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:02.060> don't<00:02:02.299> use<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:03.009> CPU

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
is recommended if you don't use a CPU

eight<00:02:31.880> seventy<00:02:32.480> which<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.650> slightly<00:02:33.860> better

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
eight seventy which is slightly better

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.860 
eight seventy which is slightly better
performance<00:02:34.610> now<00:02:35.209> obviously<00:02:35.540> with<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
performance now obviously with the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.160 
performance now obviously with the
newest<00:02:36.140> CPU<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.799> RAM<00:02:37.390> about<00:02:38.390> 25<00:02:38.870> percent

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
newest CPU and RAM about 25 percent

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.770 
newest CPU and RAM about 25 percent
increase<00:02:39.670> which<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.910> see<00:02:41.150> shortly

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
increase which we see shortly

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.340 
increase which we see shortly
and<00:02:42.070> again<00:02:43.070> there's<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.570> vortex<00:02:44.570> 3<00:02:44.930> for

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
and again there's the vortex 3 for

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.539 
and again there's the vortex 3 for
operating<00:02:46.130> systems<00:02:47.140> vortex<00:02:48.140> three<00:02:48.500> four<00:02:48.920> FS<00:02:49.250> X

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
storage and yeah pretty pretty pleased

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.220 
storage and yeah pretty pretty pleased
with<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:58.070> build<00:02:58.280> have<00:02:59.239> changed<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> front

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
with the build have changed the front

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.330 
with the build have changed the front
fans<00:03:01.810> for<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.870> nm<00:03:03.049> X<00:03:03.170> Vegas<00:03:03.650> fans<00:03:03.920> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
fans for the nm X Vegas fans and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.780 
fans for the nm X Vegas fans and
slightly<00:03:05.180> quieter<00:03:05.420> than<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.810> stock<00:03:06.760> had<00:03:07.760> a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
slightly quieter than the stock had a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.770 
slightly quieter than the stock had a
25%<00:03:08.540> improvement<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:09.290> CFN<00:03:10.359> reason<00:03:11.359> for

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
25% improvement in CFN reason for

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.289 
25% improvement in CFN reason for
replacement<00:03:12.350> was<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.709> old<00:03:12.890> LEDs<00:03:13.459> on<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.910> fans

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
replacement was the old LEDs on the fans

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.140 
replacement was the old LEDs on the fans
that<00:03:14.780> were<00:03:14.870> about<00:03:15.049> 18<00:03:15.410> months<00:03:15.620> old<00:03:16.150> were

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that were about 18 months old were

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.220 
that were about 18 months old were
beginning<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.690> fade<00:03:18.109> and<00:03:19.359> so<00:03:20.359> yeah<00:03:20.600> good<00:03:21.109> in

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
beginning to fade and so yeah good in

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.020 
beginning to fade and so yeah good in
good<00:03:21.560> improvement<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.459> front<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.820> think

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
good improvement on the front I think

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.340 
good improvement on the front I think
and<00:03:23.510> they're<00:03:23.930> still<00:03:24.140> running<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.530> all-in-one

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
and they're still running the all-in-one

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.050 
and they're still running the all-in-one
which<00:03:27.350> again<00:03:27.650> that's<00:03:28.370> been<00:03:28.549> going<00:03:28.760> for<00:03:28.910> that

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
which again that's been going for that

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.810 
which again that's been going for that
you<00:03:29.420> know<00:03:29.510> two<00:03:29.720> years<00:03:29.959> absolutely<00:03:30.769> no<00:03:31.459> problem

now CPU benchmark or nearly be done and

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.130 
now CPU benchmark or nearly be done and
it's<00:03:40.379> very<00:03:40.590> quickly<00:03:40.859> still<00:03:41.219> running<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.780> f6

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
it's very quickly still running the f6

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
little lighting is still there this will

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.660 
little lighting is still there this will
be<00:04:00.510> done<00:04:00.780> very<00:04:01.530> shortly<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.310> you're<00:04:02.459> shown

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
be done very shortly and you're shown

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.740 

there<00:04:23.250> we<00:04:23.460> go<00:04:23.639> okay<00:04:24.509> so<00:04:26.000> okay<00:04:27.000> so<00:04:27.300> we<00:04:27.539> have<00:04:27.629> a

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
there we go okay so okay so we have a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.360 
there we go okay so okay so we have a
very<00:04:28.020> quick<00:04:28.379> look<00:04:29.449> 4270<00:04:30.449> to<00:04:31.159> the<00:04:32.159> obvious

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
very quick look 4270 to the obvious

very quick look 4270 to the obvious
ystem<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.639> about<00:04:33.289> 2300<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.409> believe<00:04:35.000> get<00:04:36.000> rid<00:04:36.150> of

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
ystem is about 2300 I believe get rid of

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.140 
ystem is about 2300 I believe get rid of
that<00:04:36.360> very<00:04:36.599> quickly<00:04:37.699> all<00:04:38.699> right

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
that very quickly all right

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:47.679 
that very quickly all right

the red is the old QX and the Green is
the<00:05:00.840> new<00:05:01.050> i7<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:01.919> overall<00:05:03.949> marked<00:05:04.949> improvement

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
the new i7 so overall marked improvement

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.920 
the new i7 so overall marked improvement

yeah<00:05:29.190> pretty<00:05:29.460> happy<00:05:29.669> with<00:05:29.879> that<00:05:30.029> and

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
yeah pretty happy with that and

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.790 
yeah pretty happy with that and
noticeable<00:05:31.770> difference<00:05:33.229> this<00:05:34.229> mark<00:05:34.500> here

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
noticeable difference this mark here

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.779 
noticeable difference this mark here
obviously<00:05:35.520> is<00:05:36.029> for<00:05:37.339> velociraptor<00:05:38.339> compared

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
obviously is for velociraptor compared

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.990 
obviously is for velociraptor compared
to<00:05:39.029> the<00:05:39.270> vortex<00:05:39.990> three<00:05:40.409> and<00:05:40.919> then<00:05:41.039> ninety

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
to the vortex three and then ninety

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.619 
to the vortex three and then ninety
eight<00:05:42.089> point<00:05:42.330> eight<00:05:42.479> percent<00:05:42.629> improvement<00:05:44.629> on

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
eight point eight percent improvement on

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.769 
eight point eight percent improvement on
the<00:05:45.810> reads<00:05:46.050> so<00:05:46.589> yeah<00:05:47.180> good<00:05:48.180> hard<00:05:48.360> drive
