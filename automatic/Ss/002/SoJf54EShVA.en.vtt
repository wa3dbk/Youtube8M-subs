00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
makes sense so they all come from

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.229 
makes sense so they all come from
different<00:02:20.550> families<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:23.910> kind<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
different families but they all kind of

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.050 
different families but they all kind of
share<00:02:24.599> some<00:02:25.349> similar<00:02:25.860> qualities<00:02:26.430> that's<00:02:26.760> what

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
share some similar qualities that's what

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.850 
share some similar qualities that's what
gets<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.480> confusing<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.080> nursing<00:02:28.530> students

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
gets so confusing for nursing students

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.150 
gets so confusing for nursing students
but<00:02:29.760> as<00:02:29.970> long<00:02:30.930> as<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.230> guys<00:02:31.410> know<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.920> path

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
but as long as you guys know the path

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.400 
but as long as you guys know the path
though<00:02:32.430> where<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:32.910> started<00:02:33.390> from<00:02:33.569> you'll<00:02:34.260> be

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
though where they started from you'll be

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.500 
though where they started from you'll be
okay

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
okay

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.570 
okay
so<00:02:37.580> schizophrenia<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.580> disruption

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
so schizophrenia you have a disruption

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.940 
so schizophrenia you have a disruption
of<00:02:41.819> your<00:02:42.180> neurotransmitter<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.440> your<00:02:43.620> brain

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
of your neurotransmitter in your brain

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.670 
of your neurotransmitter in your brain
and<00:02:44.340> these<00:02:45.180> two<00:02:45.540> neurotransmitters<00:02:46.530> are

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and these two neurotransmitters are

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.770 
and these two neurotransmitters are
dopamine<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.790> serotonin<00:02:50.569> dementia<00:02:51.569> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
dopamine and serotonin dementia and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.940 
dopamine and serotonin dementia and
delirium<00:02:52.849> these<00:02:53.849> two<00:02:54.569> are<00:02:55.340> not<00:02:56.599> diseases

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
delirium these two are not diseases

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.809 
delirium these two are not diseases
these<00:02:58.950> two<00:02:59.430> are<00:02:59.989> more<00:03:00.989> diagnosed<00:03:01.950> by<00:03:02.280> signs

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
these two are more diagnosed by signs

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.259 
these two are more diagnosed by signs
and<00:03:03.060> symptoms<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:04.319> when<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> say<00:03:04.860> diseases<00:03:05.549> you

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
and symptoms so when I say diseases you

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.509 
and symptoms so when I say diseases you
have<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.920> clinical<00:03:08.060> diagnosis<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.180> very<00:03:09.720> firm

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
have a clinical diagnosis a very firm

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.500 
have a clinical diagnosis a very firm
dopamine<00:03:11.519> serotonin<00:03:12.049> vary<00:03:13.049> from<00:03:13.349> evidence<00:03:14.510> l

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
dopamine serotonin vary from evidence l

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.470 
dopamine serotonin vary from evidence l
sybers<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:16.739> plaque<00:03:17.129> on<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.489> brain<00:03:17.700> firm

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
sybers you have plaque on the brain firm

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.030 
sybers you have plaque on the brain firm
evidence<00:03:20.359> dementia<00:03:21.359> delirium<00:03:22.109> there's<00:03:22.709> no

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
evidence dementia delirium there's no

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.920 
evidence dementia delirium there's no
firm<00:03:23.730> evidence<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:26.040> we<00:03:26.549> diagnose<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.269> by<00:03:27.420> signs

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
firm evidence so we diagnose it by signs

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.819 
firm evidence so we diagnose it by signs
and<00:03:28.200> symptoms<00:03:29.930> delirium<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.019> very<00:03:31.230> short-term

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
and symptoms delirium is very short-term

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
the only thing different between

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.920 
the only thing different between
delirium<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.079> dementia<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.450> limits

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
delirium and dementia is this the limits

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.710 
delirium and dementia is this the limits
are<00:03:43.079> this<00:03:43.290> dementia<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.859> longer<00:03:44.340> term<00:03:44.720> usually

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
are this dementia is longer term usually
