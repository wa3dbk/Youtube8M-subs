 1987 Final Fantasy 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:33.579
 Since then I have left a big impression on the player's mind 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.000
 I thought that it rubbed of history its charm and par Fi's PC role-playing game 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.070
 right 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.500

 Another this world to the moment you enter Well power in Rutte Yappa promotion game show from the side 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:54.260

 It's not just the first shot 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 Various ways of Japan Sambo 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.350
 A place different from the high fantasy novel that came out 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.450
 It is however doing one trillion times the drum in such Chibi Chara error 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.380
 High 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:20.030
 Production is still being converted in the brain or rather delusion force 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:24.500
 Put up the command of the fighting game to the command which went up dramatically or 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.550
 Green project users embodied what I want you to do 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.720
