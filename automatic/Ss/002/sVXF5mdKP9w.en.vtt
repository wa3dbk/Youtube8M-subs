00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 and 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello youtube i am záiter are welcome 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.230
 to a new video well then in this 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.750
 chance let's see a very tutorial 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.779
 simple in which we will learn how to 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.849
 to be able to reproduce what are movies and 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.100
 series within the devices 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.789
 Apple mobile'm talking about the 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.010
 ipod and ipad iphone like all 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.910
 we know or if it is not that the majority in 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.220
 apple has not incorporated what is flash 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.590
 inside the device so that if 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.710
 we get from the browser 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.049
 Internet pages best known 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.930
 to see this kind of movies as they are 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:50.059
 cinetube series yonkis then we are not going to 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.510
 to be able to observe what movies are 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.089
 since they work under flash and as 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.820
 I repeat them on apple devices 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.710
 it does not work the flash does not have it 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.140
 incorporated so it's good that I gave myself to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.750
 the task of looking for two very alternative 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.180
 good that I want to tell you to be able to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.100
 play movies and series within 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.190
 Apple mobile devices will 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.520
 I repeat this works so much for the ipad 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.590
 and the ipad so it's good the first 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 option that I want to tell you is a 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.940
 application that is inside the app 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.820
 store we go in the search engine 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.740
 let's find the application that is 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.160
 flame cabbage 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.630
 enroll is r 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.530
 anyway I will forsake the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.730
 screen so that you can 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.710
 look for it 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.120
 we are going to look for the application and then as 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.090
 you can see it appears to us all these 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.610
 options we are going to download the first 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.320
 which is the icon in black is 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.610
 be here as a trade I have already 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.800
 downloaded I'm going to open it and then it's this 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.170
 the application as you can see then here 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.780
 inside her 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.980
 there are some very movies 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.950
 famous that this application what has 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.020
 is that recently it is going up more 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.750
 movies as you can see in the part 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.270
 lower show us four small 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.030
 tabs that are the start movies 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.400
 show and lists in which then 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.220
 we can look for some 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.670
 character of I do not know that we want 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.540
 or if not in the movies tab in the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.850
 upper part 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.770
 we can choose some kind 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.890
 how are action and science fiction 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.990
 comedy drama and well we can 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.400
 watch any of these movies 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.660
 that are within the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.790
 application 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.890
 free and without any problem and good 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.400
 because to put it is an example I do not know 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.620
 I'm going to play in this movie 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.330
 high impact once selected the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.730
 movie that we want because we 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.730
 shows some information like the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.940
 sorting the duration the gender and in 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.490
 the movie does not show them in two 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.620
 different languages ​​that are English and 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.210
 Spanish as we here in the part 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.660
 lower we will be able to choose 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.920
 what language do we want to listen to in 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.140
 this case then I'm going to put 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.180
 example in Spanish then we are going to 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.110
 choose the folded we will give in play 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.710
 and what follows is that he will show us 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:25.100
 advertising of the most viewed movies 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.680
 and more famous that include what is the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.680
 application once you finish what is 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.290
 this little advertising automatically 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.240
 the movie is going to start it's just about 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.490
 wait a few small seconds to 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.830
 pass this publicity and as you can see 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.690
 start loading what is the movie 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.290
 without any problem 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.390
 As if I advance him there will not be 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.790
 no problem the movie is going to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.250
 continue it seems to me that every 30 minutes 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.170
 the same is cut out of what the movie is 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.940
 and shows another 30 seconds of 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.410
 advertising there is no problem 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.190
 passing those 30 seconds of advertising 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.740
 the movie returns without any problem 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.530
 is that good as you can see then this is 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.300
 a very good option to hang out 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.270
 so we can observe some 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.280
 movie I do not know about family something like that 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.549
 this application I repeat it called 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.950
 crack him is a very good option very 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.709
 Well, if you look for any 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.980

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.440
 more than premiere this other method that will 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.470
 I'm going to show it also works for the 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.610
 ipod and ipad iphone devices that 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.960
 is what we are going to do ourselves 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.180
 let's put safari 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.430

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.430

 description of the video you click and 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.870

 this page is this as you can see then 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.520
 It also includes what are several 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:06.030
 movies equal to what some are 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.009
 genres of the eighties 90 70 animation 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.279
 old or all 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:15.669
 this application is better this this 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:18.879
 website does not work under flash if not 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:23.080
 it works below html5 this means 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:25.419
 that the html5 replaces flash inside 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.520
 from within the apple devices 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.939

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.919
 html5 if supported by 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.919

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:39.129
 Well, well, this page works

 under html5 what are the movies 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:45.789
 uploads here are in html5 and so is that 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.949
 well and here is still a bigger 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.800
 variety for us to choose 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.360
