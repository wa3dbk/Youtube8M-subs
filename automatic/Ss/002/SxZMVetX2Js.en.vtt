00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.090
 in the company of julie guichaoua I read 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.160
 you are responsible for communication of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.110
 the falcon brand specialized in pianos 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.570
 powerful and introduce you to the jets 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.260
 country the nexus that is your last 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.300
 cooking piano 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.849
 this one has some peculiarities 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.100
 what are they quite the nexus 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.060
 at 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.900
 it's a trick so first of all 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.100
 we have here a warming drawer 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.550
 specifically to lift the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.710
 paws 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.230
 it will be banned from grieg that one 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.720
 switched on one is one here simply 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.560
 and then it's a piano that has 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.100
 also a gray barbecue background with a 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.960
 grid that allows to vary the height 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.760
 to have a little more flexibility 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.010
 important there are four positions 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.100
 different next we do not have that in 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.400
 your conditioning the grid 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.920
 and then 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.930
 at the main oven we have that 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.850
 it's called a year of iraq which 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.050
 a little hanging on the strong that allows 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.930
 so check the cooking 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.150
 safely 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.720
 and then finally on the hob 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.470
 what is called louis petit others 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.960
 we have either a plancha use it 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.920
 like that we have gold medals and more 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.290
 seriously that we can use 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.660
 also 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.240
 for the see the design too is 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.490
 important this piano has lines a lot 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.200
 more contemporary some more models 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.350
 classics we will say falcon yes everything 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.510
 to very modern lines for 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.620
 adapt 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.330
 you can, however, because we have 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.100
 tend to think that the fact since his 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.230
 effect for traditional kitchens 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 but this is absolutely not the case and 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.720
 falcon really wanted to point out that the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.040
 cooking piano 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 suitable for contemporary kitchens 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.440
 what is her availability and she 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.710
 will then center the nexus as it 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.230
 is here in 110 cm with a gas table 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.790
 will be available in June 2014 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.370
 the 399 euros and it is then followed by 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.130
 an induction version 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.720
 a version in 90 cm also 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.720
