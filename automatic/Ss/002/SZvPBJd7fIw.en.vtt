00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
do you have to say to that Katrina this

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.860 
do you have to say to that Katrina this
is<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.040> team<00:03:26.250> here<00:03:26.579> for<00:03:26.940> VAR<00:03:27.120> b<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.329> india<00:03:27.720> and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
is the team here for VAR b in india and

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.229 
is the team here for VAR b in india and
i<00:03:27.989> think<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.380> they've<00:03:28.579> spoken<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.910> theory

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
i think that they've spoken in theory

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.660 
i think that they've spoken in theory
and<00:03:30.450> many<00:03:31.320> times<00:03:31.620> misunderstandings<00:03:32.549> and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and many times misunderstandings and

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.550 
and many times misunderstandings and
miscommunications<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:33.690> happen<00:03:34.110> but<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.320> think

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
miscommunications can happen but I think

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.030 
miscommunications can happen but I think
it's<00:03:34.680> very<00:03:34.739> adopt<00:03:35.400> or<00:03:35.670> now<00:03:36.500> does<00:03:37.500> not<00:03:37.680> try<00:03:37.980> and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
it's very adopt or now does not try and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.039 
it's very adopt or now does not try and
create<00:03:38.340> any<00:03:38.700> controversies<00:03:39.420> about<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.900> let's
