00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
say the least I don't love the fact that

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.000 
say the least I don't love the fact that
it's<00:01:47.150> uh<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:47.570> basic<00:01:48.080> activation<00:01:48.740> effect

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's uh it's basic activation effect

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
mean it seems kind of counterproductive

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.390 
mean it seems kind of counterproductive
on<00:01:53.450> two<00:01:53.659> levels<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:54.200> know<00:01:54.290> first<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.950> let

although<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.159> know<00:02:10.249> I<00:02:10.310> could

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
although you know I could

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
although you know I could
I<00:02:11.009> could<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.790> releasing<00:02:12.150> some<00:02:12.480> other

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

I could see them releasing some other
types<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.230> cards<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.769> have<00:02:14.099> their<00:02:14.340> effect<00:02:14.900> my

types of cards that have their effect my

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.289 
types of cards that have their effect my
guess<00:02:16.409> would<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.890> Konami<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.879> going<00:02:18.150> to

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
guess would be that Konami is going to

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.020 
guess would be that Konami is going to
release<00:02:18.560> some<00:02:19.560> cards<00:02:19.920> very<00:02:20.159> similar<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.670> dart

opponent's actions into maybe

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.410

they banished to these cards because as

what do I have to be concerned about

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.149

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
you're never going to win um I also

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.750 
you're never going to win um I also
think<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.750> Konami<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.079> probably<00:02:43.739> they<00:02:44.370> would

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
think that Konami is probably they would

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.430 
think that Konami is probably they would
also<00:02:44.910> be<00:02:45.150> wise<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.510> consider<00:02:45.840> some<00:02:46.140> sort<00:02:46.349> of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
also be wise to consider some sort of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.559 
also be wise to consider some sort of
search<00:02:46.680> card<00:02:47.010> because<00:02:47.400> expecting<00:02:48.329> you<00:02:48.450> to

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
search card because expecting you to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
draw three copies of this card is just

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.039 
draw three copies of this card is just
in<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:51.000> foreign<00:02:51.269> car<00:02:51.390> deck<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.720> flat-out

you gonna get to those three copies um I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.979 
you gonna get to those three copies um I
personally<00:03:11.879> think<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.209> they're<00:03:12.569> going<00:03:12.840> to

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
personally think that they're going to

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.509 
personally think that they're going to
release<00:03:13.230> something<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.980> said<00:03:14.190> earlier<00:03:14.310> I

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
release something like I said earlier I

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.159 
release something like I said earlier I
think<00:03:14.579> they're<00:03:14.849> going<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.030> make<00:03:15.209> some<00:03:15.840> sort<00:03:16.079> of

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
think they're going to make some sort of

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.379 
think they're going to make some sort of
way<00:03:16.319> for<00:03:16.919> you<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.099> destroy<00:03:17.519> cards<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.180> are<00:03:18.299> in

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
way for you to destroy cards that are in

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.330 
way for you to destroy cards that are in
your<00:03:18.720> debt<00:03:18.930> maybe<00:03:19.200> it's<00:03:19.380> going<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.709> some

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
your debt maybe it's going to be some

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.129 
your debt maybe it's going to be some
specific<00:03:21.000> action<00:03:21.419> like<00:03:21.569> your<00:03:21.690> opponent<00:03:22.109> has

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
specific action like your opponent has

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.229 
specific action like your opponent has
to<00:03:22.260> attack<00:03:22.650> me<00:03:22.859> directly<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.609> take<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
to attack me directly you take the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.909 
to attack me directly you take the
damage<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:24.989> destroy<00:03:25.349> one<00:03:25.530> card<00:03:25.739> in

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
damage and then you destroy one card in

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.500 
damage and then you destroy one card in
your<00:03:25.980> deck<00:03:26.040> which<00:03:26.370> would<00:03:26.549> be<00:03:26.669> bogus<00:03:27.269> by

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
your deck which would be bogus by

thoughts<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.370> card<00:03:47.669> is<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> fact

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
thoughts on this card is I like the fact

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.710 
thoughts on this card is I like the fact
that<00:03:49.139> it's<00:03:49.319> practical<00:03:49.609> sims<00:03:50.609> 1<00:03:51.000> uh<00:03:51.030> seems<00:03:51.660> a

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
that it's practical sims 1 uh seems a

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.839 
that it's practical sims 1 uh seems a
little<00:03:51.840> counterproductive<00:03:52.340> although<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
little counterproductive although the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.520 
little counterproductive although the
script<00:03:54.209> hasn't<00:03:54.629> been<00:03:54.750> written<00:03:54.989> on<00:03:55.139> this<00:03:55.260> card

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530

i<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.769> really<00:03:55.950> don't<00:03:56.519> see<00:03:56.910> any<00:03:57.299> way<00:03:57.569> that

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
i I really don't see any way that

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.690 
i I really don't see any way that
they're<00:03:58.349> just<00:03:58.379> going<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.799> release<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.250> solo

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
they're just going to release this solo

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.550 
they're just going to release this solo
you<00:03:59.910> know<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.180> maybe<00:04:00.389> not<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.810> primal<00:04:01.169> origins

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
you know it maybe not in primal origins

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.710 
you know it maybe not in primal origins
but<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.739> would<00:04:01.950> just<00:04:02.129> have<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.280> imagine<00:04:02.639> that<00:04:03.540> in

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
but I would just have to imagine that in

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.210 
but I would just have to imagine that in
the<00:04:03.750> set<00:04:04.079> after<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.620> they're<00:04:04.769> going<00:04:05.010> to

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the set after that they're going to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.460 
the set after that they're going to
release<00:04:05.370> at<00:04:05.669> least<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.030> couple<00:04:06.299> of<00:04:06.569> cards<00:04:06.810> to

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
release at least a couple of cards to

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.559 
release at least a couple of cards to
that<00:04:08.129> work<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.430> conjunction<00:04:08.609> with<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.419> my

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
that work in conjunction with this to my

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.030 
that work in conjunction with this to my
guess<00:04:09.810> would<00:04:09.959> be<00:04:10.019> again<00:04:10.349> they're<00:04:10.829> going<00:04:10.980> to

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
guess would be again they're going to

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.830 
guess would be again they're going to
make<00:04:11.190> some<00:04:11.519> way<00:04:11.699> for<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.000> blow<00:04:12.299> cards<00:04:12.660> up
