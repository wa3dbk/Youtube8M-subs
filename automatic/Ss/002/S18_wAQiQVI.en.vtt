sensor over here all of these things
have<00:01:30.299> codes<00:01:31.020> related<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.950> them<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.810> read

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
have codes related to them so you read

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.539 
have codes related to them so you read
the<00:01:34.049> codes<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.799> says<00:01:35.009> something<00:01:35.250> about

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the codes and it says something about

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.780 
the codes and it says something about
the<00:01:36.210> cam<00:01:36.900> sensor<00:01:37.290> i<00:01:37.680> doesn't<00:01:38.189> necessarily

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the cam sensor i doesn't necessarily

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
the cam sensor i doesn't necessarily
mean<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> cam<00:01:39.360> sensor<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.990> bad<00:01:40.229> could<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
mean the cam sensor is bad could be the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
mean the cam sensor is bad could be the
wire<00:01:41.400> leading<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.420> any<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> dozen

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
other things so what do you do well you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.920 
other things so what do you do well you
need<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.470> manual<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.280> does<00:01:47.490> two<00:01:47.790> things<00:01:47.930> first

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
