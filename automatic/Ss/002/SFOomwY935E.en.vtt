00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
have all the cameras we need now but how

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.609 
have all the cameras we need now but how
do<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.830> move<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.400> place<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.700> place

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619
