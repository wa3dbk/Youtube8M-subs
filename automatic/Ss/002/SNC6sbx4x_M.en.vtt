00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.510
MARY MURPHY: Well, definitely,
as they go along, the pressure

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.190
increases mainly because
of the wear

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.060
and tear on the bodies.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.060
The one good thing that they
have going for them this

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.420
season is the fact that
they got a break.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.720
They get to rest their body.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.510
We're two weeks off during
the Olympic Games.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.440
So again, the first time in
So You Think You Can Dance

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.240
history, dancers will be able
to heal themselves.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.820
DANIEL BAKER: I almost got a
concussion the other day

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.960
because I went to do one
of my moves on the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.900
pole and hit my head.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.900
It was just hard because we
didn't have much rehearsal

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.280
time with the prop, so
we really had to

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.130
get it together quickly.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.090
TIFFANY MAHER: It's
been really tough.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.290
I mean, slamming yourself on
the floor over and over and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.760
over again.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.510
It's really hard.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.960
And you get bruises and
things like that.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.330
But every night you got to
go home and ice yourself.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.686
But honestly, it's
all worth it.

00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:45.810
It's all worth it, and once you
get on that stage, every

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.240
time you perform, all of
the bruises, cuts,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.570
scars, they all go away.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.890
GEORGE LAWRENCE II: The first
time I was just breaking into

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.920
Sonya's style, it was so much.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.670
My body was breaking down.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.445
Second week, I felt like
it flowed naturally.

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:04.750
Her connection between
her students and--

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.850
it was just amazing.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.970
Everything she gives to us is so
genuine, and it just makes

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.660
you want to please her
and the audience.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.780
TIFFANY MAHER: What she brings
out of you, you can't even

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.160
believe it.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.250
Like, when she first taught us,
I was like, I don't know

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.120
if I can do it.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.745
But she brings it out of
you, and she makes

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:25.620
you grow in one week.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.610
SONYA TAYEH: The first minute
they walked in,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.400
they were so invested.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.880
So it was nothing but an
amazing, really calming

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.850
experience.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.970
Her effort, and her stamina,
she is such a beast.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.390
And she's two and
half feet tall.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.320
You know what I mean?

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.270
She's just compact.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.530
But she's so loving
and giving.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.770
And her eyes are really wide
and big, and there

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.630
are stars in them.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.670
And she just wants to learn.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.390
She's just a sponge.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.150
And she's one of the
most humble people

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.130
that I've ever met.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.710
JANELLE ISSIS: There were points
where we had to do this

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.990
routine four times in a row,
two-second break between.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.690
And by the end of it,
you're like, OK.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.646
DAREIAN KUJAWA: Yeah,
you're so toast.

00:01:58.646 --> 00:02:01.010
JANELLE ISSIS: You're literally
dizzy, blacking out.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.630
Your body is just
falling apart.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.650
But it made us so strong.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.500
I feel so good.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.025
Yeah, I feel like a warrior.

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:09.740
DAREIAN KUJAWA: Feel like
a straight-up warrior.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.210
When we found out we were paired
and that we got African

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.680
jazz, we were like, oh my
god, this is perfect.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.500
And so we worked so hard
on the routine.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.960
We put so much into it.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.600
And then you do it on stage and
it goes by in a second.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.090
You wish it could last longer.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.930
JANELLE ISSIS: Like, can
we do that again?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.170
TYCE DIORIO: It was tough to
find the right piece for

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.970
Cyrus, considering he's
never trained--

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.120
and balancing him with
Eliana who has.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.110
I think we found the right
combination within the music

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.610
and the storyline
and all that.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.170
And they delivered it within
performance quality.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.960
And it was a victory.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.850
So I'm really happy about it.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.990
ELIANA GIRARD: It was the
perfect medium between the two

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.980
styles, and we got so lucky.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.570
It was an incredible
experience.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.600
And we got to do based
off of Hairspray.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.480
Our piece was based off of
Hairspray, which is an

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.520
incredible movie and play.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.280
CYRUS SPENCER: Yeah,
definitely.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.185
It was a really, really
great piece.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.570
It was very tiring,
I tell you that.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.570
You had to have stamina
to conquer that piece.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.150
And you had to live
in the piece.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.090
You couldn't just
do the moves--

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.530
you have to become it.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.890
WILL THOMAS: Every lift that we
did, Tabitha did with me.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.810
She does not care--
well, she cares.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.960
And Napoleon's saying, you're
carrying my baby, you're

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.090
carrying my baby,
freaking out.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.580
It was so cute to watch
them in rehearsal.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.690
It's like, oh my god, stop it!

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.520
They're so awesome.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.420
They're so genuinely nice and
everything you'd ever wish for

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.780
to work with

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.860
TABITHA DUMO: I mean, I try to
be as full-out as I can be.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.100
But I am very limited
at this moment.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.420
But then I forgot that I am.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.210
So then I go full-out.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.560
I'm like, it should
be like this.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.320
And then I'm like,
OK, you got it?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.460
Because I can't do that again.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.600
BRANDON MITCHELL: It didn't
even change anything.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.730
She was eight months pregnant,
and she still moving like the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.050
best of them.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.970
Such a huge fan of Nappytabs.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.180
It was an honor to
work with them.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.682
They were my first big
choreographers that I wanted

00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:03.400
to work with on the show.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.320
Got a chance to do it,
dream come true,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.950
amazing, had a blast.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.730
NIGEL LYTHGOE: The
choreographers

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.810
help a great deal.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.120
But the dancers, too,
just stand out.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.860
Witney is still the
star for me.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.120
And that's the hardest point, to
open the show with a Samba.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.920
Samba never normally gets
a lot of votes, anyway.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.110
People don't get it.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.860
But you've got Witney
there and Chehon.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.850
Chehon is a brilliant
ballet dancer.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.540
He could be in trouble this
week because he was in the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.610
opening number doing a Samba,
for goodness sake.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.040
CHEHON WESPI-TSCHOPP: I think
that's really hard, especially

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.110
for your first show.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.130
I think it's important to
get people to like you

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.420
immediately.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.490
And for me, I open up more the
more you get to know me.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.080
But I guess on this show you
just have to be yourself

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.130
straight from the beginning and
not be afraid of letting

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.420
people know who you are.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.830
NICK BLOXSOM-CARTER: The first
day, our lesson, when we

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.970
learned the routine, it was
just a smack in the face.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.340
Like, wow.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.020
Let's get it together, Nick.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.170
Come on, let's do it.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.950
And I'm like, you know what?

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.730
I can do this.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.770
I'm going to be positive.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.000
This was rough, but I'm going to
practice my heart out, and

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.660
we're gonna do it.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.830
And we did it!

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.860
MATTHEW KAZMIERCZAK: Everybody's
routines looked

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.240
amazing tonight.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.840
AUDREY CASE: I loved
the Broadway one.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.230
I loved the African one.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.156
I loved the Cat one.

00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:14.082
I just loved all of them.

00:05:14.082 --> 00:05:15.008
MATTHEW KAZMIERCZAK:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:17.410
I don't have a favorite
or anything.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.650
During rehearsals for all this
when we were finally able to

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.660
see everybody's pieces, I was
just in shock at how strong of

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.340
an episode this was.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.520
Nobody's pieces were weak.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.890
Nobody looked bad.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.530
Everybody looked fantastic.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.860
Even though people were out of
their element in some things,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.510
nobody looked it.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.430
It was amazing.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.980
KENNY ORTEGA: For me the biggest
stand out of the

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.060
entire night-- and I think in
part because the night built

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.360
on itself, and it just kept
building on itself--

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.410
but the very end, Jason's
piece just

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.680
electrified the room.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.860
COLE HORIBE: We're so lucky
to have got Jason.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.350
When we found out, we were
like, thank you.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.130
Thank you so much.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.600
He is brilliant.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.330
LINDSEY ARNOLD: Going last, it
was hard sitting there and

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.670
just watching and being
like, I want to go.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.140
But at the same time, it was
awesome because we got to take

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.890
everyone's energy throughout
the whole show, and

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.700
it just built up.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.140
And I feel like that really
helped us in our performance.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.655
It went so well tonight.

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:06.150
And I think it's only gonna
get better from here.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150
And I know that's gonna be a
motivation for us to work

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.110
harder every single week.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.130
So I'm ready.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.030
COLE HORIBE: I feel like I'm
building stamina in my body.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.070
And everything is getting
stronger.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.941
I'd like to continue
going on this path

00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:17.360
and just keep growing.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.740
LINDSEY ARNOLD: I'm Lindsey.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.490
COLE HORIBE: And I'm Cole.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.740
BOTH: And you're watching
DanceOn.
