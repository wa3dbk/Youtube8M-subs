00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.790
 did not only do I quote amsta with times son roll 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.690
 teams like ever once this year it was active at the top of the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.590
 plus but if i started i start at over 550 he finds 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.910
 he plays in box 3 on demand even if it is, he had stosur anyway 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.560
 get five what xp before you go on 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.900
 we played with the misery in afghanistan, but it doesn't work afterwards 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.990
 was nice to stay at home to use 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.470
 from the many yellow caps on one also sees that it's best to use boost is in between 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.970
 the species 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.230
 so it is anyway an experienced surfers only play swings 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.440
 then you stand there the idea is that I have said it just twenty times 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.260
 a nice cool from reald's and playful and you will pay very easily 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 and from that point of view such a boys read beautiful couple it all smacked mac seedhead 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.170

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.059
 thank you again for the seems the previous week but the previous week again 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.370

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.320
 happy will perhaps seats but at the same time blissful 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.090
 we now go to number also find there again once you will normally it 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.230
 Peter was able to 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.720
 and in fourth place it says a congo always follows my name 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.560
 image state 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.340
 start but with my grandfather jack tretton had 15 points five times with one 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.770
 active athletes this is equal one 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.940
 and jarju he tries to make another kil but it doesn't work and when I'm sitting 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.920
 couple of course here your partner get to know the pd and that was the clip for that 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.040
 the post market there was a whole men who every time you have a nice one too 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.860
 that turned out to be birth piss-spots rain outside 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.720
 there is more in any case that suggests that theater concerts do show that 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.909
 that up five times 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.289
 Just as you do them, Jeff Coetzee may have been six men himself 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.759
 there how many years to the police live but his photo afp go to the first boat 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:37.860
 and know this too 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.150
 again a boat and what on the first boat more often not on TV too 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.499
 just now also becomes yourself now 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:45.939
 good friend of mine what I was it is again playing the field with the ns 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.169
 and c 1980s I once had a robot and I wanted to appease 

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:52.239
 I myself was going to win again he would only return this winter 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.359
 third see that after the party on the program with music martin also a lot with 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.739
 she and we are very and he stood outside and should pay attention to what then 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.660
 happened drum roll 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.540
 that is the same his own coin a chilly and he was really just stupid doing it 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.440
 just family to know themselves here still child death note when you go out 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.929
 with full of beautiful theater motown madskillz theater 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.219
 and to be able to take off last weekend, one kilometer apart 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.829
 he tried a steel walls try to get nice top athletes there is six red 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:16.299
 line 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.719
 but since he lifts himself we now move on to number three 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.329
 and on the possibility that the gallery cobalt is back on the name 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.069
 young designers and 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.469
 two years he is it also with the legs but yes I hear it is hot 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.219
 those properties and he has four times on 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.919
 Of course, a nice bike from which they carry on and in the rights 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.660
 union tension but at number two is going to cross in sat i sat pulled xx 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.990
 or does it make a difference I see that the state had a second set 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.450
 if that's the most five sets this year it should have none of it jolf pirlo or 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.569
 not with a five-setter 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.670
 he sows that mass and what she thinks party fashion five is not yet six 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.010
 Also there was a no-nonsense seven movie that you were still there 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.500
 agree on the culture from above it ended wonderful play that messers there 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.469
 of course also 20 pounds limit and murder right pr papendrecht because only 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.809
 the holes taylor comes to eat in the world 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.299
 and number one I enjoyed twenty-six years in the container park 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.060
 weekend is no culture tea at the club this time 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.650
 what the reapers can handle in this top five weeks but he takes the man with the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.260
 preparations he puts them reasoning for the drama and that picked up fund 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
 collette roll and yes I had the piste so far 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.379
 with the sorrow money with 41 departure is really a beautiful pale never have 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.459
 actually seen something like that on belfeld you immediately see very well everyone there 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.139
 Of course in everyone's NS terms and conditions just anyone can 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.169
 easy to buy 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.529
 and it was also just really time to be honest in seconds 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.319
 and you see that not only does it play in the mercury itself, but I can too 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.859
 a march copijn can scan to the and isaac soon the weapon knew where 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.529

 we will also send the club interview project out of the club 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.860
