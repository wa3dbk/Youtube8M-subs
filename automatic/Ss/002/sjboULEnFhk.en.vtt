00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.820 
put into this piece probably the coolest
part<00:02:50.209> about<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.540> statue<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.170> swishing

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
part about this statue is the swishing

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.930 
part about this statue is the swishing
cape<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.629> starts<00:02:53.629> off<00:02:53.950> curled<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.160> on<00:02:55.430> this

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
cape it starts off curled in on this

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.390 
cape it starts off curled in on this
side<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:57.129> swishes<00:02:58.129> out<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.580> way<00:02:59.200> to<00:03:00.200> be

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
side and it swishes out that way to be

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.860 
side and it swishes out that way to be
pointing<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.550> elevated<00:03:02.060> out<00:03:02.180> here<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.780> it

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
pointing and elevated out here so it

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.119 
pointing and elevated out here so it
really<00:03:03.050> looks<00:03:03.230> like<00:03:03.349> it's<00:03:03.560> blowing<00:03:03.769> in<00:03:04.010> the

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
really looks like it's blowing in the

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.540 
really looks like it's blowing in the
wind<00:03:05.830> probably<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.920> only<00:03:07.129> paint

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
wind probably the only paint

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.190 
wind probably the only paint
imperfection<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.269> could<00:03:08.420> find<00:03:08.660> on<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.930> statue

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
imperfection I could find on the statue

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.089 
imperfection I could find on the statue
is<00:03:09.530> right<00:03:10.310> at<00:03:10.939> the<00:03:11.269> base<00:03:11.569> of<00:03:11.599> his<00:03:12.019> ear<00:03:12.319> there's

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
is right at the base of his ear there's

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.570 
is right at the base of his ear there's
just<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.430> little<00:03:13.760> bit<00:03:13.879> of<00:03:14.120> white<00:03:14.329> showing<00:03:14.569> but

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
just a little bit of white showing but

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.010 
just a little bit of white showing but
not<00:03:15.670> much<00:03:15.940> an<00:03:16.180> easy<00:03:16.510> touch-up<00:03:17.020> could<00:03:17.200> fix<00:03:17.410> that

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
not much an easy touch-up could fix that

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.360 
not much an easy touch-up could fix that
