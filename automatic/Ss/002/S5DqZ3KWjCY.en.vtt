three grams a stream pattern is sixteen
by<00:00:16.500> nineteen<00:00:17.480> blaming<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.600> rocket<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
by nineteen blaming it's rocket the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.359 
by nineteen blaming it's rocket the
first<00:00:19.230> thing<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.529> noticed<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.070> real

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
first thing I noticed was the real

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.070 
first thing I noticed was the real
liveliness<00:00:20.880> coming<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> string<00:00:21.900> bed

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
liveliness coming out of the string bed

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.300 
liveliness coming out of the string bed
I<00:00:22.260> thought<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.439> could<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.800> lot<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> easy

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
I thought I could get a lot of the easy

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.160 
I thought I could get a lot of the easy
spin<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.150> lot<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.330> power<00:00:24.630> when<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> hit<00:00:24.990> my

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
spin and a lot of power when I hit my

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.439 
spin and a lot of power when I hit my
ground<00:00:25.439> strokes<00:00:25.740> yeah<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.580> found<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.150> too<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
ground strokes yeah I found that too I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.080 
ground strokes yeah I found that too I
mean<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.650> kind<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.039> Wilson's<00:00:29.609> answer

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
mean it's it's kind of Wilson's answer

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.799 
mean it's it's kind of Wilson's answer
to<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:31.080> pure<00:00:32.040> drive<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> extreme<00:00:33.180> but

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to the pure drive or the extreme but

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.930 
to the pure drive or the extreme but
it's<00:00:33.989> actually<00:00:34.290> got<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> thinner<00:00:34.739> beam<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it's actually got a thinner beam and the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.220 
it's actually got a thinner beam and the
thinner<00:00:36.149> beam<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.899> don't<00:00:37.079> know<00:00:37.140> about

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
thinner beam for me I don't know about

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
thinner beam for me I don't know about
you<00:00:37.440> Kobe<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.010> me<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> meant<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
you Kobe but for me it meant there was a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
you Kobe but for me it meant there was a
little<00:00:39.030> bit<00:00:39.239> more<00:00:39.450> control<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.350> still

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
little bit more control that it still

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
little bit more control that it still
had<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.190> forgiveness<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> in

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
had like the forgiveness of the in

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
had like the forgiveness of the in
between<00:00:42.870> racket<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> could<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.370> pick<00:00:44.550> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
between racket but I could I pick that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.130 
between racket but I could I pick that
up<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.270> thought<00:00:45.480> yeah<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.960> play

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
up and I just thought yeah I can play

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.810 
up and I just thought yeah I can play
with<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.100> had<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> play<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> tournament

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
with this if I had to play a tournament

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880 
with this if I had to play a tournament
I<00:00:48.239> could<00:00:48.870> give<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.200> fair<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
I could give it a fair go with that I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
I could give it a fair go with that I
mean<00:00:50.100> obviously<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.390> same

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
mean obviously you don't have the same

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
mean obviously you don't have the same
kind<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.430> feeling<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> would<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
kind of feeling that you would with a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.790 
kind of feeling that you would with a
racket<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.449> hit<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> time<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.649> as

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
racket you hit with all the time but as

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.080 
racket you hit with all the time but as
one<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> those<00:00:56.160> frames<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.640> does<00:00:56.789> everything

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
one of those frames that does everything

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.290 
one of those frames that does everything
well<00:00:57.890> tailor-made<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:58.920> players<00:00:59.699> like<00:01:00.030> we

open string pediment you could like pull

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
open string pediment you could like pull
your<00:01:21.900> opponent's<00:01:22.470> out<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.680> court<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.250> then

your opponent's out of court and then

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
your opponent's out of court and then
start<00:01:24.060> using<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.479> ground<00:01:24.720> strokes<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
start using your ground strokes and the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.660 
start using your ground strokes and the
open<00:01:25.560> string<00:01:25.830> pattern<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> move<00:01:26.400> them<00:01:26.580> around

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
open string pattern to move them around

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
open string pattern to move them around
but<00:01:27.360> strangely<00:01:27.750> enough<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.290> you've<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
but strangely enough if you've got a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
but strangely enough if you've got a
flat<00:01:29.009> swing<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.420> found<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.810> could<00:01:30.990> hit

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
flat swing and then I found I could hit

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
flat swing and then I found I could hit
the<00:01:31.470> ball<00:01:31.619> flat<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.070> us<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.369> well<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.700> really

said all of those positives it's not a

said all of those positives it's not a
frame<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.200> would<00:01:55.350> consider<00:01:55.619> changing<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> not

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
frame I would consider changing to not

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
frame I would consider changing to not
because<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.479> great<00:01:57.750> frame<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.590> if

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
because it's not a great frame but if

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350 
because it's not a great frame but if
you're<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.040> used<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> kind<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.000> modern

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you're not used to the kind of modern

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.060 
you're not used to the kind of modern

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
ball will fly on you a bit it's the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.999 
ball will fly on you a bit it's the
reason<00:02:06.299> why<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.450> never<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.590> changed<00:02:07.950> to

reason why I never kind of changed to

one<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.220> those<00:02:08.310> racquets<00:02:08.819> although<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.300> find

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
one of those racquets although I find

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.210 
one of those racquets although I find
them<00:02:09.929> very<00:02:09.959> easy<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.590> use<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
them very easy to use and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.360 
them very easy to use and
they<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:11.820> everything<00:02:12.330> while<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.980> controls

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
they do everything while the controls

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.800 
they do everything while the controls
always<00:02:14.670> an<00:02:14.790> issue<00:02:14.910> with<00:02:15.150> me<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.330> although

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
always an issue with me and although

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.060 
always an issue with me and although
this<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> little<00:02:16.230> better<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.890> thinner

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
this is a little better with the thinner

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.580 
this is a little better with the thinner
beam<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.490> still<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.150> there<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:19.230> lack<00:02:19.560> of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
beam I still think there is a lack of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.650 
beam I still think there is a lack of
control<00:02:20.130> similar<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.060> although<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.420> did

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
control similar to you although I did

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.420 
control similar to you although I did
enjoy<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.050> play<00:02:22.290> test<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.860> did<00:02:23.160> feel<00:02:23.400> like

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
enjoy this play test I did feel like

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.920 
enjoy this play test I did feel like
this<00:02:23.670> track<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.940> was<00:02:24.060> slightly<00:02:24.300> laughing<00:02:24.870> in

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
this track it was slightly laughing in

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.990 
this track it was slightly laughing in
control<00:02:25.290> however<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.250> do<00:02:26.310> feel<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
control however I do feel like the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.520 
control however I do feel like the
explosiveness<00:02:27.540> which<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.020> could<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.320> from<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
explosiveness which I could get from the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.080 
explosiveness which I could get from the
back<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.830> court<00:02:29.070> made<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.460> for<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
back of the court made up for that and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.640 
back of the court made up for that and
would<00:02:30.720> definitely<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> racket<00:02:31.560> I've

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
would definitely be a racket I've

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.550 
would definitely be a racket I've
consider<00:02:32.040> switching<00:02:32.250> to
