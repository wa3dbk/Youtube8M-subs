from<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.489> world<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.060> game<00:03:24.239> takes<00:03:24.510> place

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
from the world of the game takes place

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.050 
from the world of the game takes place

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
into this because it might have some

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.509 
into this because it might have some
spoilers<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.410> we<00:03:31.859> do<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.160> some<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.430> the

with<00:04:37.949> this<00:04:38.070> game<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:38.460> I'm<00:04:38.550> not<00:04:38.669> really<00:04:38.789> sure

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
with this game but I'm not really sure

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.460 
with this game but I'm not really sure
so<00:04:39.570> that's<00:04:39.720> that<00:04:39.840> we're<00:04:40.020> not<00:04:40.139> even<00:04:40.229> going<00:04:40.410> to

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.200 
so that's that we're not even going to
open<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:40.860> just<00:04:41.130> because<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.370> probably<00:04:41.970> won't

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
open this just because I probably won't

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.930 
open this just because I probably won't
be<00:04:42.389> playing<00:04:42.630> this<00:04:42.979> until<00:04:43.979> later<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.699> year

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
just because I'm going to be going back

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.749 
just because I'm going to be going back
to<00:04:46.199> school<00:04:46.440> soon<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:46.979> that's<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.460> actual<00:04:47.669> game
