what<00:00:05.630> you<00:00:05.720> call<00:00:05.930> warbird<00:00:06.260> restoration

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:06.860 
what you call warbird restoration

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.669 
what you call warbird restoration
started<00:00:07.340> in<00:00:07.430> the<00:00:07.840> 1960s<00:00:08.840> maybe<00:00:09.320> the<00:00:09.530> late

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
started in the 1960s maybe the late

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.100 
started in the 1960s maybe the late
1950s<00:00:10.459> were<00:00:10.690> individuals<00:00:11.690> were<00:00:11.780> buying

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
1950s were individuals were buying

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.259 
1950s were individuals were buying
surplus<00:00:12.679> aircraft<00:00:12.860> for<00:00:13.459> the<00:00:13.639> engines<00:00:14.030> and<00:00:14.179> the

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
surplus aircraft for the engines and the

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.369 
surplus aircraft for the engines and the
propellers<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:14.809> other<00:00:14.990> parts<00:00:15.259> and

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
propellers and other parts and

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.710 
propellers and other parts and
components<00:00:15.520> to<00:00:16.520> build<00:00:16.760> crop<00:00:17.000> dusters<00:00:17.390> or<00:00:17.510> some

components to build crop dusters or some
other<00:00:17.869> airplanes<00:00:18.289> and<00:00:18.800> they<00:00:18.949> found<00:00:19.189> that<00:00:19.279> they

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:19.429 
other airplanes and they found that they

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.550 
other airplanes and they found that they
could<00:00:19.460> actually<00:00:19.910> buy<00:00:20.720> an<00:00:20.990> airplane<00:00:21.140> for<00:00:21.410> about

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
could actually buy an airplane for about

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.779 
could actually buy an airplane for about
the<00:00:21.679> same<00:00:21.710> price<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.340> they<00:00:22.429> started<00:00:22.699> this

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
the same price and they started this

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.890 
the same price and they started this
movement<00:00:23.000> where<00:00:23.269> they<00:00:23.390> would<00:00:23.509> restore<00:00:23.840> the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
movement where they would restore the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.349 
movement where they would restore the
airplanes<00:00:24.259> back<00:00:24.439> to<00:00:24.560> flying<00:00:24.800> condition<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.029> at

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
airplanes back to flying condition so at

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.730 
airplanes back to flying condition so at
that<00:00:26.570> time<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:26.929> parts<00:00:27.199> were<00:00:27.259> plentiful<00:00:27.650> you

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
that time the parts were plentiful you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.929 
that time the parts were plentiful you
could<00:00:27.859> buy<00:00:27.980> spare<00:00:28.279> parts<00:00:28.609> you<00:00:28.669> could<00:00:28.820> buy<00:00:28.910> two

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
could buy spare parts you could buy two

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.669 
could buy spare parts you could buy two
or<00:00:29.210> three<00:00:29.330> airplanes<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:30.019> make<00:00:30.140> one<00:00:30.349> airplane

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
or three airplanes and make one airplane

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.260 
or three airplanes and make one airplane
out<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:30.919> three<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:31.640> that's<00:00:31.820> not<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.060> case

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
out of three and that's not the case

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.029 
out of three and that's not the case
anymore<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:32.720> spare<00:00:32.930> parts<00:00:33.200> don't<00:00:33.470> exist<00:00:33.829> so

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
anymore the spare parts don't exist so

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.889 
anymore the spare parts don't exist so
we're<00:00:34.789> using<00:00:34.940> modern<00:00:35.329> technology<00:00:35.870> to

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
we're using modern technology to

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.170 
we're using modern technology to
recreate<00:00:36.520> remanufactured<00:00:37.520> parts<00:00:37.700> either

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
recreate remanufactured parts either

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.510 
recreate remanufactured parts either
from<00:00:38.450> original<00:00:38.809> drawings<00:00:39.260> or<00:00:39.800> by<00:00:39.980> salvaging

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
from original drawings or by salvaging

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.209 
from original drawings or by salvaging
parts<00:00:40.940> that<00:00:41.690> were<00:00:41.899> formerly<00:00:42.530> thought<00:00:42.770> to<00:00:43.100> not

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
parts that were formerly thought to not

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.069 
parts that were formerly thought to not
be<00:00:43.399> salvageable<00:00:43.850> such<00:00:44.329> as<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.600> technology

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
be salvageable such as the technology

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.700 
be salvageable such as the technology
with<00:00:45.199> joining<00:00:45.440> technologies<00:00:47.590> when<00:00:48.590> the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
with joining technologies when the

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.170 
with joining technologies when the
engines<00:00:48.980> were<00:00:49.160> designed<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.969> built

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
engines were designed and built

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.229 
engines were designed and built
originally<00:00:50.780> they<00:00:51.109> had<00:00:51.140> overhauls<00:00:52.039> in<00:00:52.250> fine<00:00:52.430> so

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
originally they had overhauls in fine so

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.450 
originally they had overhauls in fine so
parts<00:00:53.750> could<00:00:53.960> be<00:00:54.019> inspected<00:00:54.920> on<00:00:55.039> an<00:00:55.160> overhaul

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
parts could be inspected on an overhaul

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.130 
parts could be inspected on an overhaul
and<00:00:55.730> for<00:00:56.269> instance<00:00:56.510> they<00:00:56.629> could<00:00:56.750> be<00:00:56.840> ground

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
and for instance they could be ground

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.889 
and for instance they could be ground
down<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.190> refinished<00:00:58.760> then<00:00:59.359> you<00:00:59.510> might<00:00:59.660> put

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
down and refinished then you might put

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.990 
down and refinished then you might put
in<00:00:59.989> an<00:01:00.109> oversized<00:01:00.500> bearing<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.730> type<00:01:01.969> of

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
in an oversized bearing that type of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.390 
in an oversized bearing that type of
thing<00:01:02.350> there's<00:01:03.350> only<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:03.829> many<00:01:03.890> times<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.370> can

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
thing there's only so many times you can

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.160 
thing there's only so many times you can
do<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:04.790> before<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.210> reach<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.420> limits<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
do that before you reach the limits the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.960 
do that before you reach the limits the
overhaul<00:01:06.500> limits<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.009> so<00:01:07.430> we're<00:01:07.670> at<00:01:07.790> that

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
overhaul limits and so we're at that

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.210 
overhaul limits and so we're at that
point<00:01:08.270> now<00:01:08.420> or<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.810> lot<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.049> these<00:01:09.200> parts<00:01:09.619> for

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
point now or a lot of these parts for

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.770 
point now or a lot of these parts for
these<00:01:10.369> engines<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.729> are<00:01:10.850> still<00:01:11.060> flying<00:01:11.330> 60

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
these engines that are still flying 60

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.330 
these engines that are still flying 60
and<00:01:11.900> 70<00:01:12.200> years<00:01:12.409> after<00:01:12.619> they<00:01:12.830> were<00:01:12.890> designed

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
and 70 years after they were designed

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.060 
and 70 years after they were designed
that<00:01:14.270> even<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.170> spare<00:01:15.439> parts<00:01:15.710> had<00:01:15.860> become

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
that even the spare parts had become

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.190 
that even the spare parts had become
worn<00:01:16.400> out<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:17.450> began<00:01:17.689> talking<00:01:17.930> about

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
worn out so we began talking about

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.289 
worn out so we began talking about
Michael<00:01:18.560> about<00:01:18.710> trying<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.460> find<00:01:19.700> ways<00:01:19.880> to

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
Michael about trying to find ways to

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.080 
Michael about trying to find ways to
salvage<00:01:20.900> these<00:01:21.590> parts<00:01:22.040> could<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:22.759> use<00:01:22.939> your

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
salvage these parts could we use your

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.690 
salvage these parts could we use your
advanced<00:01:23.360> technology<00:01:24.079> to<00:01:24.619> go<00:01:24.829> beyond<00:01:25.310> what

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
advanced technology to go beyond what

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.160 
advanced technology to go beyond what
would<00:01:25.850> be<00:01:25.909> considered<00:01:26.180> worn<00:01:26.689> out

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
would be considered worn out

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.109 
would be considered worn out
for<00:01:27.680> instance<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.220> cylinder<00:01:28.700> heads<00:01:28.939> right

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
for instance the cylinder heads right

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.090 
for instance the cylinder heads right
here<00:01:29.180> these<00:01:29.930> are<00:01:30.110> forged<00:01:30.439> aluminum<00:01:30.799> cylinder

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
here these are forged aluminum cylinder

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.950 
here these are forged aluminum cylinder
heads<00:01:31.369> if<00:01:31.520> they<00:01:31.640> develop<00:01:31.880> cracks<00:01:32.270> or<00:01:32.750> if<00:01:32.840> they

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
heads if they develop cracks or if they

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.560 
heads if they develop cracks or if they
wear<00:01:33.380> down<00:01:33.909> there's<00:01:34.909> nothing<00:01:35.240> you<00:01:35.329> can<00:01:35.479> do

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
wear down there's nothing you can do

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.969 
wear down there's nothing you can do
about<00:01:35.720> it<00:01:35.780> right<00:01:36.020> now<00:01:36.049> well<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:36.950> a

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
about it right now well this is a

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.120 
about it right now well this is a
forging<00:01:37.520> which<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.540> an<00:01:38.630> inator<00:01:38.930> machine<00:01:39.350> and

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
forging which is an inator machine and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.469 
forging which is an inator machine and
that's<00:01:40.250> how<00:01:40.490> we<00:01:40.549> started<00:01:40.880> speaking<00:01:41.060> with<00:01:41.240> you

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
that's how we started speaking with you

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.030 
that's how we started speaking with you
about<00:01:41.630> trying<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.170> save<00:01:42.380> these<00:01:42.590> cylinder

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
about trying to save these cylinder

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
changing the procedure because every

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.219 
changing the procedure because every

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
start is usually a little bit different
