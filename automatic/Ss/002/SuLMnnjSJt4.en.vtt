 according to you but we are prepared and our fishing seas 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.840
 above all regards crime 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.209
 we are ready to start working with San Diego figure 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.199
 have remember that this monastery of the tc and depending on the make and model 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.880
 Goodbye then start accusing them of the subprime by pressing the key acer 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.579
 okubo some other time 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.619
 New York values ​​immediately this sport 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.359
 efe so far we have never had a newly-mounted nick wass first step 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.009
 first thing you set 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.249
 but first efe 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.320
 see that here we can see that they exist there in this particular case as 5 sale 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.559
 nano five possibilities where to move to configure visit things not 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 remove the main 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.360
 advanced 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 power that refers to what would be the power system 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.070
 buck refers to the boot not from where we want to pick up first 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.540
 all that is meant boot configuration and quit going out that for 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.250
 save changes to put password st then first things first in the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.900
 month what would be the main 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.740
 here the first thing is to put if it does not come that often comes already on average in 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.260
 door in what would be the time and the day 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.180
 is right now 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.070
 what would be the time 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.140
 so he censored the c-10 at six to ten youth 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.170
 we write simply with the contours we place on 70 inc 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.170
 and for love we are not giving him the numbers and he is not jumping 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.030
 a little dot 17 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 n vienna 17 mar this kidnapping 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.110
 50 is also presented 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.760
 and I can not get through 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.770
 today ten days 1 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.240
 7 and av 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.240
 In 2002 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.280
 was subtracting enter numbers we are jumping and configuring what would be the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.020
 date 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.950
 by size to spend here 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 in main 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.690
 this makes reference to the míster not in the case that there is a disk drive supports 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.990
 most of the team no longer attract this one yet if I latre for questions 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.380
 of exhalation from a series of controllers that use 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.740
 the case is that we can giving instructions to the nation the inter 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.460
 it is always usual to use a good position to one line of the other 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.350
 to tell us so much the list we can see 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.960
 the different positions that I will not give cluso configuration could start what 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.610
 who remembers 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.160
 this competition yes of 54 in this case if you are sad really were not very 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.169
 very new 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.129
 they got it 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.159
 start we have it over 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.189
 but you know well that you do not expect it is a neighborhood, not just for mountains 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.309
 enable it 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:35.069
 in that case giving intro we would confirm puppets avoided winds ahead but 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.600
 even if I had a physical connection to the motherboard 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.800
 it would not do no good or acknowledge sinking in the case of 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.879
 disconnect it 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.219
 neither then in the operating system would be detected because recent effect 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.760
 here we configure everything that wolf the operating system up to running 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.749
 in this case we will leave it enabled and we will select once 1 point 44 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:57.219
 pearl which refers to the lifelong antequera that conforms 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.819
 the percent language really do not usually bring a lot doing language 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.160
 the Spanish I have not seen many and it is conspicuous by its absence 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.510
 well some laptops laptops and the laptop the computer 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.560
 beloved to the truth that na learns to day very very very changed bordalás him 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.200
 they changed life you can always change yes you can relatives of 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.999
 dams mezouar orchestra stored concise 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.299
 Ariane guys have to be very careful because it's a beautiful place 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.019
 moment for the green corridor if he wishes he can lose his life 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.250
 well will you manage the girl 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.839
 in what we eat 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.689
 and let's move on to what appears here 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.529
 here really where it puts primary and secondary lives of species from which 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:43.810
 all this are alphaville reference lottery to both the primary and 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.610
 secondary in ligue 1 and the idepa 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.890
 how each one has the connection where we can connect a hard drive and b 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.740
 that's why there are false data so that everyone does not explode, whatever the 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.749
 videos are the rich those who had before the data is this 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.019
 marquez 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.819
 and here we have another dilemma 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.459
 n a third and a fourth and b in this case in this pest although policy of doing 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.869
 reference to a sata hard drive so st highlight afp and I'll say loyally 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:11.999
 what rates and and everything comes at this point in the configuration 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.319
 here really this motherboard that have both has as jumps 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.099
 usually have a configuration point where we can define the characteristic 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.509
 that they would have the different Greek acts work 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.460
 we can define that we work in communities and that their function has to be 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.059
 connect a disc that recognizes it as a normal type 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:34.579
 or we can also selected in case it has to be done in this case 

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:38.050
 nobody should fulfill a kingdom put an example 100 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.080
 the consistory remembered how they went mostly little astete does not know if the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.300
 pioneering work an image exactly the same but in the case that percent 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.930
 working 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.580
 on the part of the company, according to whether the project disappears 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.770
 It includes both exactly the same information at the time of 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.770
 failure can even follow the equipment running 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.479
 here we can see in 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.059
 in that part of configuration within the mind mounted within the southern cone 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.919
 action comes 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.689
 how can we configure the serious 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.559
 like old leg tasting or how to kick out then he will handle it like 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:19.960
 jumps so that the disk sata is recognized perfectly 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.779
 and here in the configuration untied murray 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:27.449
 yes we select yes they will not appear a dinner another option is different 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.939
 and in this case only when we configure ata as rae 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.160
 will have to explain 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.590
 a separate menu similar to a life but something smaller and more basic 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.930
 where we will enter outside necessary to figure below that draws the beam in the mode 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.729
 that we have to wish in mode about 13 ray 0 6 1 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.790
 ovi store and yacyretá and acaray 15 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.870
 or something like that, it has to be said that for all those who have verified that this 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.309
 not too long ago the normal thing is that of every sata configuration 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:02.419
 and well there is not necessary for cases putin and jarrai except that toronto had 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.459
 backup or work with the computer and it is very important not to 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:08.379
 can allow them to be exchanged they discussed the information but 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.109
 also the machine that give an online service for example permanently and if 

00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:16.960
 it spoils of co2 and why I do not know where it is not really almost 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.370
 everything we have at home about having a hard drive we do not have more to 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.050
 keep partitions to keep my things but we hope to have a indicated no 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.850
 we remove another second hard drive or even a third 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.640
 to to do a whole global set of a guy or do anything 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.569
 perfect 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:33.400
 Santa Fe 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.950
 but for my mom to handle it percent do not select what not so that the disk 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.080
 it works like a standard hard drive 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.479
 otherwise and within that menu it is not necessary to know much more 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.949
 here the detection time 35 seconds you have selected for 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:50.839
 detect different said 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:55.540
 can be configured pleasant is the only one that will not stop 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.310
 less time for the meat with ozone what would be the disc 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.680
 hard connected 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.660
 but come on I think that pondering all this by default is enough 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:08.270
 to get out of this mess 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.990
 we should leave with escape 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.530
 backwards the escape always closed the intro forwards mistreating let's review 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.960
 systematic system this system language system 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.460
 floppy disk drives if the fall has been a good part of the future 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.400
 of the axis as an area as well explained by Juan 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.540
 that can configure united sata and in addition and is dispensed attack type of 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.119
 fraud 

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:35.369
 that is to say this has much more effective than 0 75 when armed on board we are not going to 

00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:36.189
 end life
