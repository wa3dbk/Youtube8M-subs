00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
something special in store so we're

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.729

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:06.709 
wide and I really like this double-wide

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.459 
wide and I really like this double-wide
just<00:01:07.159> because<00:01:07.459> the<00:01:07.670> big<00:01:07.880> Hills<00:01:08.209> it<00:01:08.450> has<00:01:08.659> I<00:01:08.959> mean

just because the big Hills it has I mean

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.989 
just because the big Hills it has I mean
it<00:01:09.590> doesn't<00:01:09.889> have<00:01:10.009> very<00:01:10.069> many<00:01:10.369> jumps<00:01:10.789> but<00:01:10.909> I<00:01:10.939> do

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:10.999 
it doesn't have very many jumps but I do

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:12.699 
it doesn't have very many jumps but I do
like<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.299> big<00:01:11.600> Hills<00:01:11.899> it<00:01:12.079> does<00:01:12.229> make<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.530> very

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:12.709 
like the big Hills it does make it very

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:15.669

coaster<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.169> I<00:01:45.859> really<00:01:46.459> really<00:01:46.639> like<00:01:46.909> this

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
coaster and I really really like this

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.179 
coaster and I really really like this
map<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:47.929> doesn't<00:01:48.169> have<00:01:48.289> any<00:01:48.409> jumps<00:01:48.799> but<00:01:49.069> it

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
map it doesn't have any jumps but it

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.370 
map it doesn't have any jumps but it
does<00:01:49.340> have<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.549> lot<00:01:49.849> of<00:01:49.909> spirals<00:01:50.659> lots<00:01:50.959> of<00:01:51.109> turns

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
does have a lot of spirals lots of turns

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.800 
does have a lot of spirals lots of turns
lots<00:01:51.799> of<00:01:51.950> banked<00:01:52.310> waves<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:52.969> things<00:01:53.689> that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
lots of banked waves and the things that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.419 
lots of banked waves and the things that
I<00:01:53.840> like<00:01:53.990> about<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.469> bank<00:01:54.679> ways<00:01:54.919> and<00:01:55.159> this<00:01:55.249> map

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
I like about the bank ways and this map

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.419 
I like about the bank ways and this map
is<00:01:55.459> they're<00:01:55.729> all<00:01:55.939> really<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.689> guess<00:01:57.590> as<00:01:58.039> I<00:01:58.219> said

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
is they're all really I guess as I said

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.389 
is they're all really I guess as I said
banked<00:01:58.989> you<00:01:59.989> know<00:02:00.109> because<00:02:00.319> a<00:02:00.349> lot<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.590> lot<00:02:01.369> of

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
banked you know because a lot of lot of

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.949 
banked you know because a lot of lot of
the<00:02:01.609> ups<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:01.969> downs<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.419> the<00:02:02.509> map<00:02:02.689> don't

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
the ups and downs in the map don't

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.419 
the ups and downs in the map don't
really<00:02:03.139> turn<00:02:03.349> they're<00:02:03.619> just<00:02:03.829> really<00:02:03.979> straight

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
really turn they're just really straight

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.129 
really turn they're just really straight
I<00:02:04.579> like<00:02:04.789> how<00:02:04.939> this<00:02:05.090> map<00:02:05.299> has<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.509> lot<00:02:05.719> of<00:02:05.749> turns

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.139 
I like how this map has a lot of turns

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.230 
I like how this map has a lot of turns
in<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.499> also<00:02:07.279> it's<00:02:07.399> really<00:02:07.609> banks<00:02:07.969> you<00:02:08.090> can

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
in it also it's really banks you can

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.990 
in it also it's really banks you can
pretty<00:02:08.450> much<00:02:08.540> go<00:02:08.840> at<00:02:09.500> full<00:02:10.310> speed<00:02:10.610> around<00:02:10.790> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
pretty much go at full speed around the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.050 
pretty much go at full speed around the
whole<00:02:11.180> thing<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.510> really

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
whole thing you really

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.850 
whole thing you really
never<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.750> slow<00:02:12.959> down<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.349> anything<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
never have to slow down for anything and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
never have to slow down for anything and
it<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.220> works<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:14.910> nicely<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.870> I

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
it just works really really nicely and I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
it just works really really nicely and I
like<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.890> lot<00:02:16.980> about<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.459> also<00:02:17.849> another

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
like that a lot about it also another

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.860 
like that a lot about it also another
feature<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.349> think<00:02:19.650> he<00:02:19.800> said<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.270> he<00:02:21.270> did

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
feature I think he said that he did

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.479 
feature I think he said that he did
something<00:02:22.140> with<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> struts<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.280> map

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
something with the struts in this map

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.280 
something with the struts in this map
like<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.880> drive<00:02:24.209> on<00:02:24.420> both<00:02:24.660> parts<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
like you drive on both parts of the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.320 
like you drive on both parts of the
struts<00:02:25.709> I'm<00:02:26.550> not<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:26.849> sure<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.209> that's

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
struts I'm not really sure what that's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.290 
struts I'm not really sure what that's
about<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:27.690> um<00:02:28.340> if<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.610> know<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.030> let<00:02:30.180> me

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
about but um if you know just let me

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.360 
about but um if you know just let me
know<00:02:30.420> Savior<00:02:30.840> also<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.680> map<00:02:31.890> was<00:02:32.010> made<00:02:32.069> with

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
know Savior also this map was made with

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.670 
know Savior also this map was made with
the<00:02:32.540> modded<00:02:33.540> wall<00:02:33.780> map<00:02:33.989> as<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.290> can<00:02:34.440> tell

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the modded wall map as you can tell

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.330 
the modded wall map as you can tell
there<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> tunnel<00:02:35.400> walls<00:02:36.920> single<00:02:37.920> walls<00:02:38.130> in

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
there is a tunnel walls single walls in

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.930 
there is a tunnel walls single walls in
this<00:02:38.459> map<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.530> reason<00:02:40.860> why<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.069> has

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
this map so that's the reason why it has

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
this map so that's the reason why it has
a<00:02:41.970> very<00:02:42.360> decent<00:02:42.660> lap<00:02:43.050> time<00:02:43.290> because<00:02:43.590> he<00:02:43.739> pretty

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
a very decent lap time because he pretty

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.080 
a very decent lap time because he pretty
much<00:02:44.040> has<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> thousand<00:02:45.239> walls<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:47.090> hundred

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
much has a thousand walls and a hundred

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.500 
much has a thousand walls and a hundred
blocks<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.690> build<00:02:48.720> with<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:50.330> overall<00:02:51.330> yeah

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
blocks to build with so overall yeah

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.870 
blocks to build with so overall yeah
just<00:02:51.810> great<00:02:52.170> map<00:02:52.410> one<00:02:53.160> part<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.610> is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
just great map one part of it that is

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.550 
just great map one part of it that is
little<00:02:54.150> consistent<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.080> spot<00:02:55.380> back

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
little consistent is that spot back

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.740 
little consistent is that spot back
there<00:02:55.590> there's<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.040> little<00:02:56.370> drop<00:02:56.700> down<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.269> he

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
there there's a little drop down and he

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.330 
there there's a little drop down and he
tried<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.019> put<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> one-way<00:02:58.680> shield<00:02:58.950> there<00:02:59.130> but

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
tried to put a one-way shield there but

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.280 
tried to put a one-way shield there but
sometimes<00:02:59.970> you're<00:03:00.269> going<00:03:00.540> too<00:03:00.690> fast<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.170> one

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
sometimes you're going too fast the one

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.320 
sometimes you're going too fast the one
with<00:03:01.470> shield<00:03:01.680> doesn't<00:03:01.890> even<00:03:02.130> faze<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.239> you

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
with shield doesn't even faze you so you

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.690 
with shield doesn't even faze you so you
can<00:03:04.170> run<00:03:04.560> off<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.769> side<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> map<00:03:05.489> if<00:03:05.670> you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
can run off the side of the map if you

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.460 
can run off the side of the map if you
hit<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> track<00:03:06.390> wrong<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.989> just<00:03:07.019> get<00:03:07.380> an

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
hit the track wrong and just get an

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.710 
hit the track wrong and just get an
unlucky<00:03:07.799> bounce<00:03:08.130> but<00:03:08.819> overall<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.510> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
unlucky bounce but overall it is a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.530 
unlucky bounce but overall it is a
really<00:03:10.019> nice<00:03:10.290> map<00:03:10.620> also<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.430> want<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.730> apologize

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
really nice map also I want to apologize

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.390 
really nice map also I want to apologize
if<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.840> hear<00:03:13.290> any<00:03:13.440> background<00:03:13.709> music<00:03:14.250> it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
know I live in Arizona and it is 113 it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.069 
know I live in Arizona and it is 113 it
was<00:03:19.680> 113<00:03:20.370> today<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.609> think<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.030> around<00:03:21.150> 95

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
was 113 today I think it's around 95

pretty lonely so I let her sit on my bed
while<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.250> was<00:03:29.459> recording<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.780> my<00:03:30.959> dog's

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
while I was recording this and my dog's

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.410 
while I was recording this and my dog's
name<00:03:31.799> is<00:03:31.980> Maisie<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.640> she's<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> yellow<00:03:33.120> lab

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
name is Maisie and she's the yellow lab

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.319 
name is Maisie and she's the yellow lab
in<00:03:33.630> case<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.989> were<00:03:34.109> wondering<00:03:35.060> also<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.090> think

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
in case you were wondering also I think

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.420 
in case you were wondering also I think
I<00:03:36.600> lied<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> bit<00:03:37.140> there<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:37.859> jump<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.310> this

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
I lied a bit there is one jump in this

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.160 
I lied a bit there is one jump in this
map<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> one<00:03:39.209> at<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.450> very<00:03:39.480> end<00:03:39.840> and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
map it is the one at the very end and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.580 
map it is the one at the very end and
that<00:03:40.230> little<00:03:40.650> one<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> mentioned<00:03:41.280> earlier

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
that little one that I mentioned earlier

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.470 
that little one that I mentioned earlier
anyways<00:03:43.590> this<00:03:43.709> next<00:03:44.130> map<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.579> called<00:03:44.850> saviors

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
anyways this next map is called saviors

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.660 
anyways this next map is called saviors
hollow<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.200> real<00:03:47.190> quick<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.639> can

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
hollow and real quick as you can

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.660 
hollow and real quick as you can
probably<00:03:48.000> tell<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.569> in<00:03:48.859> double<00:03:49.859> speed<00:03:50.340> or

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
probably tell it is in double speed or

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.720 
probably tell it is in double speed or
it's<00:03:51.150> sped<00:03:51.540> up<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.900> play<00:03:52.350> twice<00:03:52.620> as<00:03:52.829> fast<00:03:53.010> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
it's sped up to play twice as fast the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.970 
it's sped up to play twice as fast the
reason<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.000> did<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.329> because<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:55.019> cannot

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
reason I did that is because I cannot

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.240 
reason I did that is because I cannot
seem<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.639> race<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.420> map<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.680> extremely

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
seem to race on this map it is extremely

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.990 
seem to race on this map it is extremely
difficult<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.910> my<00:04:00.060> opinion<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:00.660> not<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.859> the

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
difficult in my opinion and not to the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.819 
difficult in my opinion and not to the
like<00:04:03.000> extreme<00:04:03.569> difficulty<00:04:04.139> level<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.650> he

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
like extreme difficulty level of he

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.410 
like extreme difficulty level of he
tried<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.220> make<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.430> intentionally

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
tried to make it intentionally

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.990 
tried to make it intentionally
impossible<00:04:07.319> like<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.530> challenge<00:04:07.889> track<00:04:08.340> it's

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
impossible like a challenge track it's

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.629 
impossible like a challenge track it's
just<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.389> think<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.840> maps<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.230> little<00:04:10.470> too<00:04:10.650> close

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
just I think the maps a little too close

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.900 
just I think the maps a little too close
together<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.450> mean<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.440> more<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.920> close

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
together I mean this is more of a close

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.529 
together I mean this is more of a close
CQ<00:04:15.630> our<00:04:15.930> map<00:04:16.919> close-quarter<00:04:17.729> racing<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.299> like

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
CQ our map close-quarter racing is like

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.050 
CQ our map close-quarter racing is like
to<00:04:18.720> call<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:18.959> instead<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.739> large<00:04:20.430> spread<00:04:20.880> out

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
to call it instead of a large spread out

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.570 
to call it instead of a large spread out
coaster<00:04:21.659> and<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.260> know<00:04:22.349> that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
coaster and you know that

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.770 
coaster and you know that
doesn't<00:04:22.819> make<00:04:22.939> this<00:04:23.060> map<00:04:23.270> bad<00:04:23.509> it's<00:04:23.720> just

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
doesn't make this map bad it's just

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.869 
doesn't make this map bad it's just
really<00:04:24.050> personal<00:04:24.590> preference<00:04:25.039> on<00:04:25.189> if<00:04:25.759> you

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:25.879 
really personal preference on if you

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.700 
really personal preference on if you
like<00:04:25.939> a<00:04:26.090> map<00:04:26.419> that's<00:04:26.780> really<00:04:27.050> close<00:04:27.409> together

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
like a map that's really close together

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.300 
like a map that's really close together
like<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.580> map<00:04:28.849> and<00:04:29.650> what's<00:04:30.650> another<00:04:30.889> one<00:04:31.099> all

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
like this map and what's another one all

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.999 
like this map and what's another one all
these<00:04:31.520> fun<00:04:32.270> box<00:04:32.539> that<00:04:33.289> one<00:04:33.469> these<00:04:33.680> are<00:04:33.710> really

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
these fun box that one these are really

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.129 
these fun box that one these are really
tight<00:04:34.759> locals<00:04:35.360> there's<00:04:35.539> ones<00:04:35.719> that<00:04:35.930> are<00:04:36.020> more

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
tight locals there's ones that are more

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.360 
tight locals there's ones that are more
spread<00:04:36.469> out<00:04:36.500> would<00:04:36.860> be<00:04:37.689> intervention<00:04:38.689> and

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
spread out would be intervention and

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.839 
spread out would be intervention and
what's<00:04:40.370> his<00:04:40.520> newest<00:04:41.180> 1i<00:04:41.389> think<00:04:41.569> it's<00:04:41.930> called

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
what's his newest 1i think it's called

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.600 
what's his newest 1i think it's called
let<00:04:43.849> me<00:04:43.939> check<00:04:44.180> here<00:04:45.250> velocity<00:04:46.250> those<00:04:46.430> are

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
let me check here velocity those are

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.159 
let me check here velocity those are
spread<00:04:46.939> out<00:04:46.969> maps<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:47.479> one's<00:04:47.719> really<00:04:47.900> close

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
spread out maps this one's really close

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.020 
spread out maps this one's really close
together<00:04:48.349> but<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.710> do<00:04:48.800> end<00:04:49.129> up<00:04:49.189> being<00:04:49.520> being

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
together but I do end up being being

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.490 
together but I do end up being being
able<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.419> finish<00:04:50.569> a<00:04:50.719> lot<00:04:50.930> but<00:04:51.110> I<00:04:51.139> did<00:04:51.319> died

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
able to finish a lot but I did died

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.040 
able to finish a lot but I did died
several<00:04:51.830> times<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:53.120> that's<00:04:53.449> why<00:04:53.599> I<00:04:53.629> sped<00:04:53.930> up

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
several times so that's why I sped up

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.980 
several times so that's why I sped up
the<00:04:54.439> map<00:04:55.009> though<00:04:55.250> very<00:04:56.150> well<00:04:56.479> for<00:04:56.719> words<00:04:56.900> I

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
the map though very well for words I

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.409 
the map though very well for words I
mean<00:04:57.110> for<00:04:57.319> the<00:04:57.409> tight<00:04:57.620> space<00:04:57.979> it<00:04:58.909> looks<00:04:59.150> really

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
mean for the tight space it looks really

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.040 
mean for the tight space it looks really
really<00:04:59.840> nice<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:00.849> like<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:02.030> forge<00:05:02.569> materials

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
really nice I like the forge materials

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.559 
really nice I like the forge materials
they<00:05:03.110> use<00:05:03.139> including<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:04.280> window<00:05:04.819> CC<00:05:05.300> I<00:05:05.360> think

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:05.569 
they use including the window CC I think

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:07.749 
they use including the window CC I think
they<00:05:05.690> look<00:05:05.900> really<00:05:06.110> nicely<00:05:06.669> you<00:05:07.669> know

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
they look really nicely you know

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.399 
they look really nicely you know
everything<00:05:08.300> overall<00:05:08.719> just<00:05:08.870> looks<00:05:09.080> really

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
everything overall just looks really

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.290 
everything overall just looks really
nice<00:05:09.560> together<00:05:09.879> one<00:05:10.879> thing<00:05:11.060> I<00:05:11.090> did<00:05:11.270> notice

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
nice together one thing I did notice

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.059 
nice together one thing I did notice
that<00:05:11.569> was<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.900> originality<00:05:12.349> on<00:05:12.680> this<00:05:12.889> map

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
that was the originality on this map

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.490 
that was the originality on this map
kind<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.460> lacks<00:05:13.699> because<00:05:14.090> it's<00:05:14.349> pretty<00:05:15.349> much

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
kind of lacks because it's pretty much

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.170 
kind of lacks because it's pretty much
there's<00:05:15.830> been<00:05:15.979> a<00:05:16.009> lot<00:05:16.250> of<00:05:16.279> maps<00:05:16.520> built<00:05:16.879> inside

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
there's been a lot of maps built inside

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.350 
there's been a lot of maps built inside
of<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.419> cave<00:05:17.629> now<00:05:18.039> not<00:05:19.039> to<00:05:19.490> mention<00:05:19.699> cavernous

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
of a cave now not to mention cavernous

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.159 
of a cave now not to mention cavernous
deep<00:05:20.599> but<00:05:21.849> moving<00:05:22.849> on<00:05:22.969> we<00:05:23.389> have<00:05:23.629> a<00:05:23.659> say<00:05:24.110> in

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
deep but moving on we have a say in

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.680 
deep but moving on we have a say in
final<00:05:25.069> map<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.490> I've<00:05:25.879> said<00:05:26.210> this<00:05:26.240> before<00:05:26.360> but

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
final map and I've said this before but

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.839 
final map and I've said this before but
this<00:05:26.930> map<00:05:27.139> is<00:05:27.169> called<00:05:27.590> velocity<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.550> this<00:05:28.639> map

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
this map is called velocity and this map

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.059 
this map is called velocity and this map
has<00:05:29.029> also<00:05:29.210> made<00:05:29.509> it<00:05:29.569> the<00:05:29.779> wall<00:05:30.020> mon<00:05:30.229> so<00:05:30.919> that's

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
has also made it the wall mon so that's

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.260 
has also made it the wall mon so that's
why<00:05:31.219> it<00:05:31.340> has<00:05:31.520> such<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.840> decent<00:05:32.840> amount<00:05:33.259> of<00:05:33.529> a

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
why it has such a decent amount of a

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.640 
why it has such a decent amount of a
decent<00:05:35.270> lap<00:05:35.449> time<00:05:35.750> sorry<00:05:36.259> I<00:05:36.319> don't<00:05:36.440> know<00:05:36.529> what

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
decent lap time sorry I don't know what

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.649 
decent lap time sorry I don't know what
I'm<00:05:36.770> saying<00:05:37.039> a<00:05:37.129> decent<00:05:37.460> lap<00:05:37.610> time<00:05:37.849> and<00:05:38.120> quite<00:05:38.599> a

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
I'm saying a decent lap time and quite a

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.019 
I'm saying a decent lap time and quite a
bit<00:05:38.870> of<00:05:38.960> walls<00:05:39.229> and<00:05:39.529> the<00:05:40.250> first<00:05:40.490> time<00:05:40.699> I<00:05:40.729> raced

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
bit of walls and the first time I raced

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:42.969 
bit of walls and the first time I raced
this<00:05:41.240> track<00:05:41.509> I<00:05:41.690> cannot<00:05:42.169> make<00:05:42.440> it<00:05:42.589> past<00:05:42.800> this

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
this track I cannot make it past this

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.100 
this track I cannot make it past this
part<00:05:43.190> that<00:05:43.460> I<00:05:43.490> just<00:05:43.909> drove<00:05:44.089> over<00:05:44.330> for<00:05:44.930> some

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
part that I just drove over for some

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.320 
part that I just drove over for some
reason<00:05:45.469> I<00:05:45.680> just<00:05:45.740> kept<00:05:46.250> flying<00:05:46.520> off<00:05:46.849> the<00:05:47.089> top<00:05:47.300> of

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
reason I just kept flying off the top of

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.480 
reason I just kept flying off the top of
the<00:05:47.539> hill<00:05:47.719> and<00:05:47.960> you<00:05:48.740> know<00:05:48.860> when<00:05:49.069> I<00:05:49.159> asked<00:05:49.430> him

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
the hill and you know when I asked him

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.649 
the hill and you know when I asked him
about<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.759> he<00:05:49.879> said<00:05:49.940> that<00:05:50.270> you<00:05:50.330> don't<00:05:50.479> have<00:05:50.569> to

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
about it he said that you don't have to

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.269 
about it he said that you don't have to
slow<00:05:50.900> down<00:05:50.930> but<00:05:51.080> I<00:05:51.289> find<00:05:51.620> that<00:05:51.830> if<00:05:52.009> you<00:05:52.099> don't

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 
slow down but I find that if you don't

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:53.829 
slow down but I find that if you don't
slow<00:05:52.460> down<00:05:52.610> you<00:05:52.849> pretty<00:05:53.060> much<00:05:53.180> fly<00:05:53.509> off<00:05:53.659> the

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:53.839 
slow down you pretty much fly off the

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.249 
slow down you pretty much fly off the
top<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.440> hill<00:05:55.339> every<00:05:55.819> time<00:05:56.029> so<00:05:56.330> I<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.719> prefer

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
top of the hill every time so I I prefer

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.300 
top of the hill every time so I I prefer
to<00:05:57.409> slow<00:05:57.589> down<00:05:58.330> um<00:05:59.330> just<00:06:00.169> because<00:06:00.529> I<00:06:00.560> died<00:06:00.740> when

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
to slow down um just because I died when

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.779 
to slow down um just because I died when
I<00:06:01.339> don't<00:06:02.020> as<00:06:03.020> I<00:06:03.199> said<00:06:03.259> before<00:06:03.680> on<00:06:04.460> his

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
I don't as I said before on his

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.790 
I don't as I said before on his
intervention<00:06:05.360> after<00:06:05.719> I<00:06:05.839> like<00:06:06.050> all<00:06:06.289> the<00:06:06.529> bank

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
intervention after I like all the bank

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.499 
intervention after I like all the bank
waves<00:06:07.069> that<00:06:07.310> he's<00:06:07.460> starting<00:06:07.669> to<00:06:07.819> use<00:06:08.029> now<00:06:08.210> also

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
waves that he's starting to use now also

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:09.999 
waves that he's starting to use now also
the<00:06:08.719> force<00:06:08.960> materials<00:06:09.409> like<00:06:09.560> part<00:06:09.919> i'm

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
the force materials like part i'm

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.129 
the force materials like part i'm
driving<00:06:10.370> on<00:06:10.490> right<00:06:10.699> now<00:06:10.729> how<00:06:11.690> he<00:06:11.750> switches

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
driving on right now how he switches

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.140 
driving on right now how he switches
between<00:06:12.379> the<00:06:12.770> two<00:06:13.009> by<00:06:13.159> two<00:06:13.219> flaps<00:06:13.699> and<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:14.000> two

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
between the two by two flaps and the two

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.260 
between the two by two flaps and the two
by<00:06:14.300> two<00:06:14.770> regular<00:06:15.770> i<00:06:15.949> think<00:06:16.190> there<00:06:16.339> might<00:06:17.210> be

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
by two regular i think there might be

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.999 
by two regular i think there might be
the<00:06:17.449> to<00:06:17.569> watch<00:06:17.719> you<00:06:17.870> short<00:06:18.169> not<00:06:18.710> really<00:06:18.889> sure

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
the to watch you short not really sure

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.589 
the to watch you short not really sure
but<00:06:19.159> i<00:06:19.219> like<00:06:19.400> how<00:06:19.550> he<00:06:19.610> kind<00:06:20.120> of<00:06:20.240> switches

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
but i like how he kind of switches

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.610 
but i like how he kind of switches
between<00:06:20.719> those<00:06:21.139> just<00:06:21.409> to<00:06:21.680> give<00:06:21.830> it<00:06:21.860> that<00:06:21.979> extra

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
between those just to give it that extra

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.200 
between those just to give it that extra
not<00:06:24.620> really<00:06:24.800> sure<00:06:24.919> describe<00:06:25.279> bigot<00:06:25.580> i<00:06:25.759> guess

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
not really sure describe bigot i guess

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.670 
not really sure describe bigot i guess
you<00:06:26.330> could<00:06:26.449> say<00:06:26.659> I<00:06:26.690> aesthetics<00:06:27.139> but<00:06:27.289> it's<00:06:27.500> not

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
you could say I aesthetics but it's not

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.129 
you could say I aesthetics but it's not
really<00:06:28.039> a<00:06:28.250> stag<00:06:29.029> it's<00:06:29.270> just<00:06:29.479> the<00:06:29.599> pieces<00:06:29.990> they

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
really a stag it's just the pieces they

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.220 
really a stag it's just the pieces they
used

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
used

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.160 
used
over<00:06:31.410> that<00:06:32.040> he<00:06:32.430> placed<00:06:32.910> which<00:06:33.660> made<00:06:33.900> it<00:06:34.020> kind

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
over that he placed which made it kind

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.220 
over that he placed which made it kind
of<00:06:34.290> cool-looking<00:06:34.670> but<00:06:35.670> overall<00:06:36.000> overall<00:06:36.420> the

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
of cool-looking but overall overall the

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.410 
of cool-looking but overall overall the
map<00:06:37.410> is<00:06:37.620> really<00:06:38.040> really<00:06:38.220> nice<00:06:38.490> everything's

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
map is really really nice everything's

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.200 
map is really really nice everything's
really<00:06:39.600> smooth<00:06:39.930> there's<00:06:40.230> minimal<00:06:40.530> tapering

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
really smooth there's minimal tapering

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.520 
really smooth there's minimal tapering
but<00:06:42.210> there's<00:06:42.390> some<00:06:42.720> parts<00:06:42.990> that<00:06:43.080> you<00:06:43.200> can<00:06:43.380> see

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
but there's some parts that you can see

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.010 
but there's some parts that you can see
but<00:06:43.770> not<00:06:43.920> enough<00:06:44.310> that<00:06:44.460> it<00:06:44.700> affects<00:06:45.060> you<00:06:45.270> also

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
but not enough that it affects you also

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.420 
but not enough that it affects you also
there's<00:06:46.230> some<00:06:46.350> nice<00:06:46.470> aesthetics<00:06:47.220> in<00:06:47.370> the

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
there's some nice aesthetics in the

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.740 
there's some nice aesthetics in the
background<00:06:47.940> and<00:06:48.300> as<00:06:48.990> I<00:06:49.170> said<00:06:49.350> before<00:06:49.380> the

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
background and as I said before the

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.140 
background and as I said before the
placement<00:06:51.750> of<00:06:51.900> the<00:06:52.140> blocks<00:06:52.470> and<00:06:52.770> walls<00:06:53.400> but<00:06:54.030> i

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
placement of the blocks and walls but i

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.960 
placement of the blocks and walls but i
think<00:06:54.420> the<00:06:54.690> aesthetics<00:06:55.260> and<00:06:55.440> the<00:06:55.910> kind<00:06:56.910> of

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
think the aesthetics and the kind of

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.030 
think the aesthetics and the kind of
like<00:06:57.180> scenic<00:06:58.020> pieces<00:06:58.410> in<00:06:58.500> the<00:06:58.590> background<00:06:58.950> is

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
like scenic pieces in the background is

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.040 
like scenic pieces in the background is
a<00:06:59.100> little<00:06:59.310> too<00:06:59.430> far<00:06:59.640> away<00:06:59.790> and<00:07:00.180> they're<00:07:00.870> kind

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
a little too far away and they're kind

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.200 
a little too far away and they're kind
of<00:07:01.170> off<00:07:01.410> the<00:07:01.440> map<00:07:01.950> in<00:07:02.190> my<00:07:02.430> opinion<00:07:02.730> so<00:07:02.970> I<00:07:03.000> wish

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
of off the map in my opinion so I wish

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.150 
of off the map in my opinion so I wish
you<00:07:03.240> would<00:07:03.450> have<00:07:03.480> put<00:07:03.570> them<00:07:03.840> closer<00:07:04.170> to<00:07:05.010> the

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
you would have put them closer to the

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.730 
you would have put them closer to the
map<00:07:05.340> but<00:07:06.000> it<00:07:06.120> would<00:07:06.480> be<00:07:06.630> hard<00:07:07.020> to<00:07:07.140> kind<00:07:07.470> of<00:07:07.530> fit

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
map but it would be hard to kind of fit

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.250 
map but it would be hard to kind of fit
a<00:07:07.920> lighthouse<00:07:08.430> into<00:07:08.940> the<00:07:09.060> map<00:07:09.240> so<00:07:09.480> maybe<00:07:10.050> if<00:07:10.170> he

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
a lighthouse into the map so maybe if he

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.230 
a lighthouse into the map so maybe if he
built<00:07:10.500> it<00:07:10.650> closer<00:07:10.920> to<00:07:11.070> the<00:07:11.190> ground<00:07:11.490> it<00:07:11.940> would

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
built it closer to the ground it would

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.520 
built it closer to the ground it would
have<00:07:12.330> been<00:07:12.360> better<00:07:12.510> but<00:07:12.930> you<00:07:13.350> know<00:07:13.500> I

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
have been better but you know I

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.830 
have been better but you know I
understand<00:07:14.250> is<00:07:14.430> difficult<00:07:14.910> especially<00:07:15.360> when

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
understand is difficult especially when

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.240 
understand is difficult especially when
you're<00:07:15.990> not<00:07:16.110> exactly<00:07:16.440> one<00:07:17.010> hundred<00:07:17.070> percent

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
you're not exactly one hundred percent

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.950 
you're not exactly one hundred percent
sure<00:07:17.550> with<00:07:17.880> the<00:07:17.910> layout<00:07:18.210> of<00:07:18.330> the<00:07:18.510> track<00:07:18.750> is

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
sure with the layout of the track is

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.540 
sure with the layout of the track is
because<00:07:19.560> think<00:07:19.770> with<00:07:19.890> this<00:07:19.980> map<00:07:20.220> you<00:07:20.370> just

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.550 
because think with this map you just

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.440 
because think with this map you just
kind<00:07:20.790> of<00:07:20.910> went<00:07:21.330> with<00:07:21.630> this<00:07:21.780> heart<00:07:22.020> I<00:07:22.310> guess

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.450 
kind of went with this heart I guess

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.920 
kind of went with this heart I guess
just<00:07:24.450> kind<00:07:24.720> of<00:07:25.280> built<00:07:26.280> freely<00:07:27.030> and<00:07:27.240> I<00:07:27.510> no<00:07:27.600> use

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
just kind of built freely and I no use

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.630 
just kind of built freely and I no use
he<00:07:28.350> didn't<00:07:28.560> use<00:07:28.650> rotations<00:07:29.130> and<00:07:29.280> that's<00:07:29.520> not

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.640 
he didn't use rotations and that's not

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.190 
he didn't use rotations and that's not
what<00:07:29.820> I<00:07:29.880> mean<00:07:30.120> by<00:07:30.270> built<00:07:30.540> freely<00:07:30.870> he<00:07:31.020> just

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200 
what I mean by built freely he just

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.680 
what I mean by built freely he just
built<00:07:31.380> where<00:07:32.340> the<00:07:32.430> map<00:07:32.610> took<00:07:32.880> him<00:07:33.060> i<00:07:33.270> guess<00:07:33.540> i

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
built where the map took him i guess i

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.660 
built where the map took him i guess i
can<00:07:33.870> say<00:07:34.020> that<00:07:34.200> i<00:07:34.230> mean<00:07:34.440> these<00:07:35.040> are<00:07:35.220> all<00:07:35.340> very

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:35.670 
can say that i mean these are all very

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.240 
can say that i mean these are all very
vague<00:07:36.060> statements<00:07:36.780> but<00:07:36.960> it<00:07:37.530> somewhat

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.250 
vague statements but it somewhat

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.120
