00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
I could probably just follow this

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.420 
I could probably just follow this
outside<00:00:59.609> edge<00:00:59.969> which<00:01:00.899> appears<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.890> yeah

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
outside edge which appears to be yeah

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.630 
outside edge which appears to be yeah
appears<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.239> edge<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:05.309> would<00:01:05.460> come

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
appears to be that edge so it would come

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
appears to be that edge so it would come
up<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.939> about<00:01:05.970> his<00:01:06.390> waist<00:01:08.360> but<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.930> them

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
you could do is you could

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.449 
you could do is you could
duck<00:02:14.120> where<00:02:15.079> he's<00:02:15.439> got<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.739> be<00:02:15.829> up<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.159> deck

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
duck where he's got to be up on the deck

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.920 
duck where he's got to be up on the deck
to<00:02:16.640> drive<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.239> that's<00:02:18.079> another<00:02:18.439> possibility

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
to drive it that's another possibility

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.800 
to drive it that's another possibility
so<00:02:20.930> great<00:02:21.439> big<00:02:21.650> ship<00:02:21.890> wheels<00:02:22.159> are<00:02:22.430> not

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
so great big ship wheels are not

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.240 
so great big ship wheels are not
historically<00:02:23.810> inaccurate<00:02:24.170> they<00:02:24.769> they

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
historically inaccurate they they

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.399 
historically inaccurate they they
actually<00:02:25.670> existed<00:02:26.209> from<00:02:26.420> from<00:02:27.079> what<00:02:27.260> I've

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
actually existed from from what I've

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.149 
actually existed from from what I've
seen

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
seen

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.199 
seen
so<00:02:28.790> um<00:02:30.129> some<00:02:31.129> of<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.310> throw<00:02:31.549> out<00:02:31.700> there<00:02:31.970> for

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
you guys um throw down the Comets would

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.349 
you guys um throw down the Comets would
you<00:02:35.510> rather<00:02:35.659> see<00:02:35.959> this<00:02:36.109> done<00:02:36.590> up<00:02:36.890> as<00:02:37.159> a

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
you rather see this done up as a

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.550 
you rather see this done up as a
shipwreck<00:02:38.359> with<00:02:38.599> this<00:02:38.780> thing<00:02:38.959> cut<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:39.319> half

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
shipwreck with this thing cut in half

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.890 
shipwreck with this thing cut in half
and<00:02:39.769> stick<00:02:39.950> out<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.189> the<00:02:40.250> water<00:02:40.430> because<00:02:41.329> I've

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
and stick out of the water because I've

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.899 
and stick out of the water because I've
always<00:02:42.139> wanted<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.560> graveyard<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:43.069> ships<00:02:43.129> but<00:02:43.879> I

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
always wanted a graveyard of ships but I

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.300 
always wanted a graveyard of ships but I
could<00:02:44.239> also<00:02:44.389> just<00:02:44.569> do<00:02:45.079> do<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> graveyard<00:02:46.069> of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
could also just do do a graveyard of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.819 
could also just do do a graveyard of
ships<00:02:46.370> raw<00:02:46.849> maybe<00:02:47.329> I'll<00:02:47.480> do<00:02:47.659> that<00:02:47.840> because

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
ships raw maybe I'll do that because

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.409 
ships raw maybe I'll do that because
this<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.099> really<00:02:49.310> nice<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.480> it's<00:02:50.900> done<00:02:52.419> the

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
this is really nice and it's done the

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.720 
this is really nice and it's done the
the<00:02:54.169> wood<00:02:54.439> is<00:02:54.650> even<00:02:55.010> got<00:02:55.159> a<00:02:55.189> little<00:02:55.430> bit<00:02:55.639> of

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the wood is even got a little bit of

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.030 
the wood is even got a little bit of
texture<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.389> it<00:02:56.419> I<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:57.200> dry<00:02:57.439> brush<00:02:57.650> up<00:02:57.829> that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
texture to it I can dry brush up that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.159 
texture to it I can dry brush up that
and<00:02:58.220> get<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.400> out<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.030> it's<00:02:59.750> got<00:02:59.930> wheels

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
could put a little wave here to like

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.129 
could put a little wave here to like
cover<00:03:05.419> that<00:03:05.659> up

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139
