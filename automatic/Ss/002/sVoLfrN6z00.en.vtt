00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 5 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.180
 when friends another group is good if 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.240
 I retrieve a game that calls 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.590
 front line command 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.840
 alain commands I do not know how they want it 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.640
 call but good is a game that is a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.730
 beginning I said fucking mother carlos duty 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.910
 black book I am by the image of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.010
 no but no but good and it 's a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.090
 a red type game tells us remember 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 the review that I did that you're just this one 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.510
 to kill others there are pvp but this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.910
 the mission is no longer completed as 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.190
 know what's up with this you can not 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 set things up to buy the whole not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 It serves once I tell them for the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.460
 who want to do it do not close to egg 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.050
 justice the peel is not a very game 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.650
 well it does not have good graphics just 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.650
 I'm going to whom 2 and we're going to see back 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.420
 there's a free good wish that's what 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.920
 download after we're going to play is web 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.630
 As I say, it has good graphics 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.270
 they have good weapons they have good realism 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.950
 and I liked everything in all that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.360
 aspect is not of these games that like 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.670
 I tell them you're standing but it attacks 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.740
 but in the end you get there you end up 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.910
 nailing in these games I'm not telling you 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.130
 because it has happened to me with the one 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.520
 robocop I finish it that everything has 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.530
 finished with schnyder cost me the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.530
 game to put this friend today 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:50.360
 of normal 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.470
 but good 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.970
 when you start playing in this kind of 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.680
 games there are many myths that came out and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.450
 which reach many downloads 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.690
 apart from that this game is totally 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.940
 free in the story and it has 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.880
 good graphics good effects the minutes 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.250
 fit well will be for sabers or for 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.380
 80 megabytes I think that nothing else weighs with 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.450
 that was downloaded a little more but but 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.310
 they are only 80 mb there is this game 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.690
 I recommend it that I hope you like it 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.610
 much 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.870
 well I do not have money so I'm 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.870
 poor is good right now I do not think 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.709
 so it's up to you if you like it 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.730
 or not, they can download it in 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.819
 the place bull I leave the direct link 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.769
 in the description of the video and well no 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:55.220
 I saw so that Android do not know if it's for 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:58.220
 android 2.3 or already asks four of the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.220
 android 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.490
 how they see the gun the machine gun that goes down 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.280
 very little life there is also a grenade 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.840
 pomegranate 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.830
 granada your partner that is here of 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.830
 where do you get from mate 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.599
 his partner during the block in the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.819
 first mission but you have more in a 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.760
 future can have more more friends by 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.299
 agile it is true that they are in the chaos 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.390
 marcano tetera only you live 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.390
 although not 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.590
 marcelo fuck 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.880
 in a good mood is more guys so 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.940
 I hope you like this connector game 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.770
 but with that the biennial pinche has had 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.170
 anger 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.069
 ace 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.069
 I do not give it 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.569
 the concealer 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.569
 if I'm going 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.900
 totally 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.640
 I do not give it, I'm an expert 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.630
 see this other is pathetic with the format 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.820
 to the effect 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.500
 and nothing guys but the fire has good 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.870
 graphics for the few that weigh is a 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.060
 monotonous game but this short guy does not 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.280
 I tell them they become very addictive and 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.740
 unlocking weapons and going to level e 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.390
 to improve everything because it is something that 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.860
 what is in all the games but not 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.450
 with these graphs as I say maybe in 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.670
 his other friends are missing two and I have 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.890
 two unlocked and two more are missing 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.740
 but nothing else reminds me this I'm going to 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.150
 something is me I flowers and I say goodbye 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.830
 we see in the criteria if they like it 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.850
 in the description freedom everything is a 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.840
 simple game good graphics and simple 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.280
 fun and it can be addictive if you 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.650
 they like this kind of games so nothing 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.650
 I say goodbye until next time we are
