00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.180
 good afternoon we are going to do today the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.620
 study of the mammary gland 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.260
 for the study of the mammary gland 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.889
 it is important to know what is where it is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.570
 how is your relationship shaped 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.130
 what is an innovation and what is the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.439
 way in which the lymph of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.810
 our mammary gland the gland 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.760
 mammary is an accessory gland for 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.010
 reproduction in women and it's 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.010
 rudimentary already functional in men 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.200
 the mammary gland will go what it is 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.630
 the second 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.370
 to the sixth rib 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.730
 You will have ligaments 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.120
 suspensorios that gave it firmly to 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.120
 the dermis 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.800
 then inside our gland 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.310
 mammary we will find from 15 to 20 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.410
 lobules 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.170
 that are going to drain ducts gal act 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.300
 fierce that they will get to the breasts gal 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.550
 act forums where the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 secretion to the end come out so 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.780
 is the nipple of the mammary gland 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.450
 when the mammary gland reaches 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.250
 what is the fox to the axillary fossa is going 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 to form what is an axillary process 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.880
 also called the spence process 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.880
 what will come in this form 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.300
 it is important to divide our gland 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.300
 mammary in four quadrants 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 we are going to divide it into what is the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.960
 upper quadrant quadrant 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.130
 medial inferior quadrant lateral 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.810
 upper and lower lateral quadrant 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.869
 the irrigation of our gland 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.630
 mammary is going to be given by the artery 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.430
 internal thoracic that will give your bouquets 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.730
 piercing to get 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.950
 alarte to the mammary gland this 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.310
 internal thoracic artery is ramia is 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.369
 branch of the sub key 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.320
 lateral to our mammary gland is going 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.960
 to water so it's the artery 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.350
 lateral thoracic which is a branch of our 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.350
 axillary artery 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.090
 the innervation of our gland 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.490
 Breast mammary 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.920
 going to go from what is from the second to the 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.120
 sixth intercostal nerve here not 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.470
 found but we can do 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.780
 reference to them so they are 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.690
 our costal cartilages are going to come out 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.440
 Perforating branches to preserve the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.440
 our mammary gland 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.920
 the lymph of the mammary gland will be 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.940
 collected as follows 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.410
 remembering how it is divided in our 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.770
 mammary gland in four quadrants 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.120
 more than 75 percent of the lymph goes to 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:46.690
 be picked up from the side so 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.500
 what is the axillary ganglia 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.650
 here we see ourselves well 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.360
 the rest of the lymph will be drained 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.360
 by the ganglia to externalize them 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 and part of the lower quadrants 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.870
 to be drained to the ganglia 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.870
 ABS 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.030
 it is very important to know this from the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.830
 lymph for the role he plays in 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.830
 metastasis of cancer cells 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.440
 and this was a brief explanation of what 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.440
 what is the mammary gland
