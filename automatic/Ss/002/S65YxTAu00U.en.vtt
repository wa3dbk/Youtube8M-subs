tub<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.690> her<00:00:52.680> mind<00:00:52.920> instinctively<00:00:53.670> she<00:00:53.820> smells

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
tub in her mind instinctively she smells

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.639 
tub in her mind instinctively she smells
or<00:00:55.170> tastes<00:00:55.770> those<00:00:56.100> eggs<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.050> she's<00:00:58.050> acting

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
or tastes those eggs and she's acting

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.389 
or tastes those eggs and she's acting
and<00:00:58.800> reacting<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.550> she<00:00:59.789> would<00:01:00.059> sort<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.399> sort

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and reacting like she would sort of sort

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.060 
and reacting like she would sort of sort
of<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> lower<00:01:03.449> level<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.379> she<00:01:04.710> kind<00:01:05.010> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
of on a lower level but she kind of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.649 
of on a lower level but she kind of
thinks<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.489> there's<00:01:05.670> eggs<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.000> there<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
thinks that there's eggs in there so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.899 
thinks that there's eggs in there so
basically<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.340> remove<00:01:08.700> the

starting<00:01:59.969> from<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.390> top<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.869> basically

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
starting from the top and basically

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.219 
starting from the top and basically
letting<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.040> water<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.640> drain<00:02:03.060> down<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
letting the water just drain down the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
letting the water just drain down the
body<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.770> snake<00:02:04.979> introduces<00:02:05.700> really

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
body of the snake introduces really

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.459 
body of the snake introduces really
drench<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.689> know<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> couple

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
drench it you know do that a couple

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.350 
drench it you know do that a couple
times<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:08.610> where<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> think

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
times and you think where you think

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
times and you think where you think
you've<00:02:09.569> rinsed<00:02:10.050> off<00:02:10.289> off<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.770> snake<00:02:10.979> well

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you've rinsed off off the snake well

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.020 
you've rinsed off off the snake well
enough

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
enough

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.720 
enough
then<00:02:12.290> rather<00:02:13.290> than<00:02:13.620> two<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.100> then<00:02:14.220> basically

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
then rather than two and then basically

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.250 
then rather than two and then basically
this<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.150> another<00:02:15.450> interesting<00:02:15.870> thing<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.230> I

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
this is another interesting thing what I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.760 
this is another interesting thing what I
do<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:17.069> take<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.490> snake's<00:02:17.910> head<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.770> tail

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
do is I take the snake's head and tail

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.160 
do is I take the snake's head and tail
when<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.670> snake<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:20.910> soaking<00:02:21.390> wet<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
when the snake is soaking wet and I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
when the snake is soaking wet and I
basically<00:02:22.470> kind<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.100> whipped<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.610> tail<00:02:23.819> whip

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
basically kind of whipped the tail whip

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.050 
basically kind of whipped the tail whip
the<00:02:24.270> body<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.319> snake<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.430> don't

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the body of the snake like this I don't

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.449 
the body of the snake like this I don't
let<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.450> snake's<00:02:27.750> head<00:02:28.140> drop<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.950> feel<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
let the snake's head drop and feel the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.940 
let the snake's head drop and feel the
full<00:02:29.730> centrifugal<00:02:30.420> force<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.110> want<00:02:31.860> to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
full centrifugal force I want to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.979 
full centrifugal force I want to
basically<00:02:32.250> maintain<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.090> head<00:02:33.270> remember<00:02:33.720> all

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
basically maintain the head remember all

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.390 
basically maintain the head remember all
the<00:02:34.110> waters<00:02:34.410> basically<00:02:34.830> don't<00:02:35.069> going<00:02:35.250> down

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the waters basically don't going down

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.370 
the waters basically don't going down
here<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:36.420> kind<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.780> shake<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.050> and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
here and I just kind of shake it and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.460 
here and I just kind of shake it and
then<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.980> take<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.459> snake<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:39.030> don't<00:02:39.840> put<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.290> in

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
then I take this snake I don't put it in

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.830 
then I take this snake I don't put it in
the<00:02:40.620> tub<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.370> was<00:02:41.550> in<00:02:41.819> when<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.270> laid<00:02:42.569> its

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the tub that it was in when it laid its

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.440 
the tub that it was in when it laid its
eggs<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:44.250> don't<00:02:44.310> put<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> same

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
eggs and I don't put it in the same

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.560 
eggs and I don't put it in the same
position<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.320> will<00:02:47.280> I'll<00:02:47.430> actually<00:02:47.760> take<00:02:48.300> that

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
position I will I'll actually take that

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.449 
position I will I'll actually take that
snake<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.260> was<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.739> here<00:02:50.010> I'm<00:02:50.160> gonna<00:02:50.280> go

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
snake that was in here I'm gonna go

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.790 
snake that was in here I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.670> put<00:02:50.880> her<00:02:50.940> back<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.330> for<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.050> I'm

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
ahead and put her back in for now I'm

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.560 
ahead and put her back in for now I'm
not<00:02:52.830> sure<00:02:53.160> where<00:02:53.370> my<00:02:53.459> better

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
not sure where my better

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.229 
not sure where my better
but<00:02:55.380> she'll<00:02:55.680> go<00:02:55.890> somewhere<00:02:56.370> else<00:02:56.489> rather<00:02:57.000> than

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
but she'll go somewhere else rather than

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.270 
but she'll go somewhere else rather than
to<00:02:57.300> put<00:02:57.510> her<00:02:57.630> back<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.500> same<00:02:58.769> time<00:02:59.069> I'll

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to put her back in in the same time I'll

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.170 
to put her back in in the same time I'll
switch<00:03:00.150> positions<00:03:01.140> with<00:03:01.230> somebody<00:03:01.709> else<00:03:01.890> and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
switch positions with somebody else and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.979 
switch positions with somebody else and
this<00:03:03.180> will<00:03:03.420> allow<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.810> snake<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:05.300> sort<00:03:06.300> of<00:03:06.480> get

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
this will allow the snake to sort of get

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.290 
this will allow the snake to sort of get
away<00:03:07.110> from<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.950> mentality<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:09.060> she's

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
away from that mentality that she's

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.340 
away from that mentality that she's
around<00:03:09.690> her<00:03:09.930> eggs<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.590> back<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.700> food<00:03:12.110> ASAP<00:03:13.110> I

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
around her eggs and back on food ASAP I

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.660 
around her eggs and back on food ASAP I
don't<00:03:13.860> know<00:03:13.920> if<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.069> notice<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.610> they

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
don't know if you notice that and they

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.729 
don't know if you notice that and they
look<00:03:14.880> pretty<00:03:15.060> skinny<00:03:15.450> well<00:03:15.989> she<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.170> dropped

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
look pretty skinny well she just dropped

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.440 
look pretty skinny well she just dropped
12<00:03:17.010> eggs<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:20.370> know<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.730> she<00:03:20.940> has<00:03:21.090> neaten

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
12 eggs and you know and she has neaten

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.060 
12 eggs and you know and she has neaten
for<00:03:21.660> about<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> month<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.440> half<00:03:22.470> or<00:03:22.769> whatever

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
for about a month and a half or whatever

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.740 
for about a month and a half or whatever
so<00:03:23.310> yeah<00:03:23.489> she<00:03:23.790> went<00:03:24.030> from<00:03:24.150> about<00:03:24.360> three

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
so yeah she went from about three

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.710 
so yeah she went from about three
thousand<00:03:25.200> grams<00:03:25.410> down<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.980> probably<00:03:26.730> 1,500

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
thousand grams down to probably 1,500

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.710 
thousand grams down to probably 1,500
right<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:29.579> anyway<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:29.910> will<00:03:30.180> put<00:03:30.420> her<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.630> a

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
right here so anyway I will put her in a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.130 
right here so anyway I will put her in a
different<00:03:31.079> tub<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.910> then<00:03:33.630> wash<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.959> out

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
different tub and and then wash this out

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.130 
different tub and and then wash this out
really<00:03:34.470> well<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.829> then<00:03:35.640> do<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> switch<00:03:36.660> with

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
really well and then do a switch with

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.430 
really well and then do a switch with
some<00:03:37.320> other<00:03:37.500> female<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:39.209> will<00:03:40.110> improve

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
some other female and that will improve

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.750 
some other female and that will improve
the<00:03:41.299> chances<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:43.200> getting<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.370> better
