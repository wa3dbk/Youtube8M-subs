00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.780
 my name is clarice may be and I am 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.510
 art teacher and today I'll bring 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.760
 for you so a little bit about the 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.619
 lace paper working inside the 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.650
 sciences the question also of the 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.830
 asymmetries well when we speak in 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.860
 Nothing, we 're talking about nothing. 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.860
 activities in which the student will 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.870
 develop creativity 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:45.430
 queue and mainly and taste for art 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.350
 We get a sheet fold the middle does. 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.770
 small cuts always having a 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.719
 adventure is certain that later we 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.940
 can see how we have created 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.640
 most interesting of the delegate is that he 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.770
 be personalized because you 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.050
 never give a ready shape when 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.600
 Are you going to work with the student? 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.229
 so the child can play 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.320
 in the most different ways and will 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.130
 also bring quiet tranquility and 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.159
 exploring shapes and colors 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.830
 What we are going to do first is the paper 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.680
 of a symmetry data that we call 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.909
 bilateral symmetry that when you 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:36.909
 has only the middle with two equal sides 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.500
 here we have a kind of symmetry to 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.140
 second the symmetry that I'm going to show 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.909
 For you, a lacy paper is the symmetry. 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:50.710
 that is when we work the 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.689
 from the middle of the folds 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.820
 then you can fold circles 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.369
 squares and rectangles 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.790
 the sheet you have and you're going to leave 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:05.340
 always from the middle that is our ray 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:11.510
 so here you go to work the way 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:15.080
 that you prefer doing the same thing 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.390
 covering shapes through the cutout I 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.489
 I prefer not to use drawings with pencil I 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:27.099
 I think the only creation and the surprise 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.099
 then that works the radial symmetry 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:35.060
 always remembering that identifying one side 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:43.040
 without a record that is one that does not leave 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:48.260
 the parties separate then we can 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:52.280
 put this in detail from posters of 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.579
 decorate party cards 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.139
 different shapes you can use 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:03.980
 so here we have the radial symmetry 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:06.440
 to put the role you are 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.359
 when you do a light job then 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.099
 Assembly 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.510
 both radial symmetry about the 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.049
 bilateral symmetry 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.090
 they are decorative but if you work 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.709
 the whole fine coordination exercise that 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.019
 is very important, especially in 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.590
 initial series 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.440
 It's worth remembering that we can use 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.230
 leftovers and xerox sheets for example ne 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.329
 It was what you would put out then 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.169
 Do you work there? You add a 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.000
 sheet racing right verse you can 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.739
 work with newspaper because the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.540
 thin sheet will always be easier 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.260
 handling is one thing 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.319
 extremely cheap and also the whole 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.910
 space left over for example 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.139
 here we made the square shape to 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.459
 from the sheet 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:57.530
 We also use nothing if we lose and the 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.540
 student can use to decorate his notebook 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.430
 make cards and right 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.750
 Good today, this is what I had for 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.750
 to teach you thank you very much
