believe<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:51.550> believe<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:52.239> crap<00:00:52.449> forever

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
believe I believe this crap forever

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.279

sides one objective put him in and I

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.349 
sides one objective put him in and I
think<00:00:56.980> this<00:00:57.250> is<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.399> pretty<00:00:57.670> good<00:00:57.910> deck<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.269> use

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359

like wants to duel if I get him out most
likely<00:01:07.240> I<00:01:07.300> win<00:01:07.630> but<00:01:08.160> not<00:01:09.160> always<00:01:09.580> guaranteed
