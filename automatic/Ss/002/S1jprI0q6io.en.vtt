00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.110
 welcome that I have today a video about 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.350
 tips for the line which is the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.940
 favorite so we started pique chords 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.500
 I think the first pick they have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 is to actually invoke a link a red and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.980
 medium but I wait a little longer to see if 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.050
 they decide to put language that does not flame world 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 like the green that places us 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.530
 no other means the son since it is a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.150
 very passive hero 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.760
 at the beginning of the game you have two 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.280
 options or go for the runes or blocks 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.000
 subscribe to me generally when I think 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000
 that we have enough 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.329
 and my person that we have is very good 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.110
 follow and the dagger of the 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.560
 of the pea 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.450
 here as they left the sun kim single large 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.170
 error although the old one grabbed you the 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.170
 Moon 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.440
 now if you stay to block the clips 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.590
 and torque color mind where I am 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.050
 press twice between one and so the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 camera will continue to press you once between 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.770
 some leaving it stuck and just 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.659
 they place in front of them pressing 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.999
 that that car 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.679
 if your rank script is on the hill 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:21.060
 make sure you are not close to him because 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.619
 as you see here in the photo has a 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.299
 small range of vision if you go through 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.869
 there the power the enemy will be able to operate 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.420
 the rank of the agro in you and you can talk 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.100
 one more hit towards him now we'll see the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.280
 window of each line for me the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.030
 radiance has more advantage of the medium than 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.799
 the bayern and we are right at 55 you 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.469
 you can stake this click on this 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.090
 camp and then change it if anything if 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.909
 it's going bad or if you're already looking good 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.610
 you can even improve your part 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.229
 eldar although he does not have the jungle near 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.560
 here you must show a video of why I 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.560
 like 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.270
 I usually go with more passive heroes 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.929
 for this when you are attacking 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.440
 banqueando you have a great possibility 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.330
 to hide 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.960
 As you can see I am killing almost the link 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.330
 searches and how apart it is at night is the 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.280
 the snap record and hides already 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.590
 I knew automatically that I will not be able to 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.540
 find them and stop looking for them but 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.470
 we are against a bubble of dark circles and 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.470
 I paid him dearly 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.620
 Now when you're banqueando says 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.980
 to always communicate with your team and 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.989
 have some advantage in the gift 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.090
 of the enemy that you go that if you have 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.810
 a vote or something like that or like me 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.840
 that I had an invisibility rune me 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.700
 I communicate with my seiquer killer and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.590
 we realize the great easily the destination 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.840
 it was then and the tunnel and next to kill 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.610
 in kind unfortunately I arrived as you see 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.019
 you could walk and do not attack while 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.970
 this happened the only thing he did was 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.269
 discover blame apologize I thought that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.810
 I'm going to kill him but he can not kill like that 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.160
 I lost time and lost experience 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.140
 so what I did was obviously 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.849
 buy me a tp and go back quickly 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.250
 line do not go walking treats is 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.970
 I always tried everything, do not lose 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.970
 experience nor now 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.219
 now is the importance of everything 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.620
 assault should have tp always but more 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:26.030
 that all you because you're going to have a 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.249
 highest level in the team and it is logical 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.480
 would help a lot in our lines as 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.790
 I would like a rotation of four 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.090
 people and in the end we turn and not 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.620
 we die none of us and we turn out 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.819
 in a superb for me and apart a 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.239
 good good amount of gold for not 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.239
 spoil 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.600
 Now for you you can ask for it 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.600
 simply to your team 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.740
 so it's coming to me and I'm going to try 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.720
 to start first because if the pp arrives 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.160
 will be able to kill him both I know that 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.620
 we are strong enough to 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.610
 kill two people 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.320
 pitifully that good ruling what of 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.520
 skill of him and we decide he's going to stay for 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.520
 you do not know let's risk ourselves 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:26.509
 now the agro this can be a weapon of 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.520
 double edged because like the one I was 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.220
 applying for agriculture but he committed the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.940
 error of standing right next to it what 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.190
 who is trying to grab the agro 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.200
 try other than that you are grabbing the 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.230
 area of ​​what you want to work blows 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.540
 with me they say all the amount of damage 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.940
 I did more with the three clips that 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.969
 they were hitting you be very careful 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.249
 when grabbing the clips 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.860
 and in this true of the middle line a 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:54.479
 summary that I'm going to leave this list of 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.610
 the 0 is that I recommend so that 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.499
 play media and practice them a lot 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.299
 I have many more other tips for 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.819
 other lines in the software and carrie 

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:05.339
 I hope you help them then leave the link 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:08.059
 in the upper right good 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.059
 values
