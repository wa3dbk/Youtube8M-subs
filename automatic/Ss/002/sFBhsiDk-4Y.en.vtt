between full cab and 540 cabs there's
really<00:00:16.410> two<00:00:16.710> main<00:00:16.740> differences<00:00:17.520> though<00:00:17.760> go

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
really two main differences though go

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.790 
really two main differences though go
into<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.050> then<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.760> first<00:00:21.390> off<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.020> want<00:00:22.560> to

is by putting caps there is a few

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.230 
is by putting caps there is a few
differences<00:01:58.299> between<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.869> 540<00:01:59.409> cabin

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
vocab - they're pretty easy once you get

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.430 
vocab - they're pretty easy once you get
540<00:02:18.340> cab<00:02:18.550> they're<00:02:18.940> like<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> 360<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:20.230> tap
