00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and then it's just built off of that

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
and then it's just built off of that
everything<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.770> pretty<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.250> based<00:01:32.549> off<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
everything is pretty much based off of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080
