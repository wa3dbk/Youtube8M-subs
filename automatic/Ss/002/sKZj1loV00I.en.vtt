this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> fantastic<00:00:16.800> time<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.340> be<00:00:17.430> buying<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
this is a fantastic time to be buying a

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.029 
this is a fantastic time to be buying a
little<00:00:18.570> sports<00:00:18.840> boat<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.890> much

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
little sports boat the so much

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.029 
little sports boat the so much
innovation<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:21.119> into<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:22.140> new<00:00:22.350> genre<00:00:22.859> of

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
innovation going into the new genre of

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.359 
innovation going into the new genre of
sports<00:00:23.490> boats<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.000> tenders<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.369> there's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
sports boats and tenders and there's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.670 
sports boats and tenders and there's
great<00:00:26.609> diversity<00:00:26.789> too<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.410> could<00:00:28.590> have

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
great diversity too now we could have

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
great diversity too now we could have
got<00:00:28.859> three<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:29.939> similar<00:00:30.269> boats<00:00:30.449> together

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
got three very similar boats together

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.510 
got three very similar boats together
but<00:00:31.019> instead<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.529> decided<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.189> three

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
but instead we decided to get three

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
but instead we decided to get three
completely<00:00:33.000> disparate<00:00:33.570> boats<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.290> pitch

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
completely disparate boats and pitch

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.799 
completely disparate boats and pitch
them<00:00:34.980> against<00:00:35.309> each<00:00:35.430> other<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.510> how<00:00:36.660> they

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
them against each other to see how they

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.470 
them against each other to see how they
fared<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> trio<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.300> together

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
fared so the trio that we got together

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.569 
fared so the trio that we got together
we're<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.350> as<00:00:40.590> diverse<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> could

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
we're about as diverse as you could

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.830 
we're about as diverse as you could
possibly<00:00:41.879> find<00:00:41.969> anywhere

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
possibly find anywhere

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
possibly find anywhere
now<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> Gulf<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.040> 23<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.850> sea<00:00:45.809> legs<00:00:46.050> 7.1<00:00:46.980> rib

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
now the Gulf is 23 the sea legs 7.1 rib

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.180 
now the Gulf is 23 the sea legs 7.1 rib
and<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.809> XO<00:00:49.559> 240<00:00:50.190> RS<00:00:50.899> on<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> Gulf<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> 23<00:00:53.010> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and the XO 240 RS on the Gulf is 23 that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
and the XO 240 RS on the Gulf is 23 that
we're<00:00:53.309> looking<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> moment<00:00:53.930> two

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
we're looking at at the moment two

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
we're looking at at the moment two
things<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.410> stand<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.820> course<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
things really stand out one of course is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.439 
things really stand out one of course is
it's<00:00:57.660> amazing<00:00:57.960> cutting-edge<00:00:58.859> styling<00:00:59.550> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it's amazing cutting-edge styling and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.090 
it's amazing cutting-edge styling and
the<00:01:00.480> other<00:01:00.660> thing<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.020> underneath<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.620> has<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the other thing is underneath it has a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.789 
the other thing is underneath it has a
very<00:01:02.760> efficient<00:01:03.300> double<00:01:03.870> stepped<00:01:04.170> hull<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
very efficient double stepped hull and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.190 
very efficient double stepped hull and
this<00:01:05.760> gives<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> highest<00:01:06.570> top<00:01:06.720> speed<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
this gives you the highest top speed of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.380 
this gives you the highest top speed of
the<00:01:07.320> trio<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.040> efficient<00:01:08.580> stepped<00:01:08.909> hull

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the trio that efficient stepped hull
