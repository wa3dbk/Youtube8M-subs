getting<00:06:15.580> on<00:06:15.669> the<00:06:15.760> cusp<00:06:16.030> of<00:06:16.210> like

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
getting on the cusp of like

getting on the cusp of like
philosophical<00:06:17.830> and<00:06:17.980> I<00:06:18.040> kind<00:06:18.940> I<00:06:19.090> like<00:06:19.300> getting

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
philosophical and I kind I like getting

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.810 
philosophical and I kind I like getting
little<00:06:20.260> philosophical<00:06:20.470> sometimes<00:06:21.100> but<00:06:21.280> isn't

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
little philosophical sometimes but isn't

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.320 
little philosophical sometimes but isn't
it<00:06:21.880> like<00:06:22.240> weird<00:06:22.570> that<00:06:22.870> you<00:06:23.110> know

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
it like weird that you know

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.210 
it like weird that you know
you<00:06:23.479> can<00:06:23.870> see<00:06:23.990> so<00:06:24.169> many<00:06:24.229> similarities<00:06:24.560> between

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
you can see so many similarities between

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.309 
you can see so many similarities between
different<00:06:26.000> species<00:06:26.180> even<00:06:26.599> though<00:06:26.780> we<00:06:26.900> have<00:06:27.050> no

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
different species even though we have no

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.439 
different species even though we have no
idea<00:06:27.710> what<00:06:28.189> they're<00:06:28.430> thinking<00:06:28.789> I'm<00:06:29.210> sure

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
idea what they're thinking I'm sure

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
there's going to be some comments that

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.950 
there's going to be some comments that
we<00:06:31.639> do<00:06:31.819> with<00:06:32.090> it<00:06:32.240> no<00:06:32.449> you<00:06:32.659> really<00:06:32.990> do<00:06:33.289> you<00:06:33.650> know

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
we do with it no you really do you know

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.650 
we do with it no you really do you know
