 hello very good guys all how about 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.780
 How are you welcome? Welcome to 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.129
 our channel tai shan to court tv 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.410
 I am a sergio, you can find me in 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.790
 twitter for es navas 10 and in this video 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.349
 It had been a long time since we needed 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.080
 no tweet and we're going to go for it 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.760
 let's go analyze a pretty tweet 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 pretty cool and quite powerful and that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.039
 can be very productive is called a cut 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.420
 a cut or water sign us that is in 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.460
 the beatbox repository has a 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.070
 price of three dollars and it seems like a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 authentic based on productivity it 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.920
 active by activator of agreement let's go 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.140
 make an asset gesture and I will do 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.190
 a double tap on the work and note that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.320
 now an icon will appear 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 through us we are talking and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.530
 talking, we're going to be able to throw things 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.530
 example let's say safari 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.190
 home 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.500
 you are here 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.180
 home 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.220
 look guys, it's a pretty tweet 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.870
 pretty cool that just because 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.240
 voice commands we can tell you 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.190
 to do certain tasks we do not activate it 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.720
 with activator I have it configured 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.610
 with double tap the now now I explain it 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.130
 and notice that with another double tap the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.510
 now we could disable it let's go to 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.070
 go to the settings let's try 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.990
 configure this tweet because the truth is 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.940
 which is very very cool and very easy to 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.650
 use we are not going to go to the tweet that 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.000
 is this from here of qt and note that 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.340
 we here can launch different 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.530
 phrases I have put safari I have 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.180
 put home and I have all of us 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.040
 we could simply add a new 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.170
 in this way we would give 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.640
 put anything awaits you and already 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.590
 it's just here we're going to 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.420
 activator and active and we will be able to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.729
 set up the first thing I have it 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.860
 set up with a double tap on 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.869
 the clock now that it activates me as 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.369
 you are seeing and from here you can see 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.590
 that all the phrases appear above me 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.420
 that I have introduced in here not of such 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.369
 way that I for example with safari you 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.410
 I would say that I open safari simply 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.810
 here I would look for the safari application and 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.580
 here we have it not with home for example 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.649
 I have the start button set as 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.600
 you are seeing and in you are I have 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.909
 put the option of multitasking 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.770
 a very simple tweet guys and girls but 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.049
 that can make us a little bit more 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.520
 productive works well in accordance 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.380
 but from time to time it has made me 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.569
 some respite and that is the officer of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.770
 payment that I bought it and good as 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.569
 you are looking up in the play 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.489
 appears now safari is more overlayed 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.020
 have some small fault I hope what 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.760
 correct soon because it 's a tweet 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.440
 new but I 'm sure that in the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.520
 next version all this will work a 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.500
 little bit better and as you are seeing 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.880
 Wonder really works 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.230
 good guys here I say goodbye I hope that 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.760

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.360
