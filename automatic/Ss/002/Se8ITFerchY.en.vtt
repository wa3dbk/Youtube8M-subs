00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.530 
these are 12 I did start with a 14
originally<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.840> lost<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.559> 14s<00:00:35.250> and

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
originally but I lost the 14s and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.150 
originally but I lost the 14s and

thought you know what whatever and just
went<00:00:38.550> straight<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:40.079> regular<00:00:40.410> size<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
went straight from the regular size to a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.250 
went straight from the regular size to a
12<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.030> admit<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.750> kind<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.079> stupid

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.360 
the other one and I lost the backing to
this<00:02:23.170> which<00:02:24.170> kind<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.650> sucked<00:02:24.890> because<00:02:25.220> I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
this which kind of sucked because I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.600 
this which kind of sucked because I
actually<00:02:25.700> really<00:02:26.090> did<00:02:26.270> like<00:02:26.450> these<00:02:27.310> but<00:02:28.310> upon

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
actually really did like these but upon

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.700 
actually really did like these but upon
going<00:02:28.760> through<00:02:29.060> my<00:02:29.360> medicine<00:02:30.200> cabinet<00:02:30.620> I

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
going through my medicine cabinet I

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.520 
going through my medicine cabinet I
found<00:02:31.040> these<00:02:31.690> which<00:02:32.690> are<00:02:32.870> also<00:02:33.140> eights

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
found these which are also eights

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.350 
found these which are also eights
they're<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.010> little<00:02:34.250> bit<00:02:34.370> blinged<00:02:34.760> out<00:02:34.910> for<00:02:35.210> me

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
they're a little bit blinged out for me

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.990 
they're a little bit blinged out for me
I<00:02:35.420> don't<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.350> but<00:02:36.680> they<00:02:37.640> did<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:37.970> job

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
I don't like that but they did the job

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.570 
I don't like that but they did the job
and<00:02:38.420> that's<00:02:38.750> all<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.990> matters

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
and that's all that matters

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.720 
and that's all that matters
so<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:40.880> found<00:02:41.330> these<00:02:41.450> sixes<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.830> have<00:02:43.220> these<00:02:43.430> also

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
so I found these sixes I have these also

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.650 
so I found these sixes I have these also
in<00:02:43.970> eights<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.540> lost<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.110> eights<00:02:45.320> I<00:02:46.660> just

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660
