ride<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.340> my<00:00:50.370> car<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.000> couldn't<00:00:51.239> see

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
ride in my car and if they couldn't see

from<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.440> car<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> was

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
from that what a good car it was
