decision is where to stop the color I'm
just<00:02:48.500> gonna<00:02:48.800> let<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.250> brush<00:02:49.550> kind<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:49.970> run<00:02:50.240> out

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.810 

so<00:02:57.530> we're<00:02:57.710> all<00:02:57.770> done<00:02:58.010> using<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.430> brush<00:02:58.640> like

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.780 
so we're all done using the brush like
this<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.300> using<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.810> vertically<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.860> kind<00:03:01.640> of

this and using it vertically and kind of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.840 
this and using it vertically and kind of
feathering<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.600> up<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.370> gets<00:03:04.610> that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
feathering it up so that it gets that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:25.990 
feathering it up so that it gets that
fade<00:03:05.330> thing<00:03:05.900> some<00:03:07.060> alright<00:03:08.060> y'all

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.740 

oh<00:03:29.860> my<00:03:30.860> gosh<00:03:31.070> I'm<00:03:31.340> really<00:03:31.400> really<00:03:32.240> happy<00:03:32.540> with

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
oh my gosh I'm really really happy with

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.190 
oh my gosh I'm really really happy with
how<00:03:32.930> they<00:03:33.110> turned<00:03:33.140> out<00:03:33.530> oh<00:03:33.800> I<00:03:34.580> tried<00:03:35.120> um<00:03:35.270> I'm<00:03:35.810> in

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
how they turned out oh I tried um I'm in

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.750 
how they turned out oh I tried um I'm in
I<00:03:36.530> actually<00:03:36.680> have<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.040> trim<00:03:37.280> them<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.520> little

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
I actually have to trim them a little

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.590 
I actually have to trim them a little
bit<00:03:38.110> but<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.910> think<00:03:40.910> they<00:03:41.150> turned<00:03:41.300> out<00:03:41.450> really

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
bit but I think they turned out really

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.630 
bit but I think they turned out really
cool<00:03:42.020> like<00:03:42.320> my<00:03:42.500> hair<00:03:42.709> is<00:03:42.740> a<00:03:42.830> lot<00:03:42.980> meaner<00:03:43.220> than<00:03:43.520> I

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
cool like my hair is a lot meaner than I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.270 
cool like my hair is a lot meaner than I
usually<00:03:43.790> wear<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:44.900> think<00:03:45.740> when<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.100> wear

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
usually wear it so I think when I wear

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.870 
usually wear it so I think when I wear
it<00:03:46.400> messy<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.360> wavy<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.560> little<00:03:49.250> bit<00:03:49.370> more<00:03:49.610> of<00:03:49.850> a

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
it messy and wavy a little bit more of a

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.470 
it messy and wavy a little bit more of a
straight<00:03:50.450> they'll<00:03:50.720> blend<00:03:50.990> in<00:03:51.230> better<00:03:51.459> but

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
straight they'll blend in better but

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.090 
straight they'll blend in better but
it's<00:03:53.480> pretty<00:03:53.600> cool<00:03:53.959> but<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.320> color<00:03:54.530> is<00:03:54.650> really

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
it's pretty cool but the color is really

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.920 
it's pretty cool but the color is really
bright<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.370> think<00:03:55.580> I<00:03:56.000> might<00:03:56.480> watch<00:03:56.690> them<00:03:56.900> a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
bright I think I might watch them a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.479 
bright I think I might watch them a
couple<00:03:57.080> more<00:03:57.290> times<00:03:57.470> kind<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:57.950> dull<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.340> up<00:03:58.459> a

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
couple more times kind of dull it up a

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.229 
couple more times kind of dull it up a
little<00:03:58.670> bit<00:03:58.940> cause<00:03:59.720> it's<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.959> little<00:04:00.050> bit<00:04:00.230> too
