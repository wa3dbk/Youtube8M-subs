00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
in high heels all the time the whole

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.650 
in high heels all the time the whole
movie

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
movie

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.480 
movie
and<00:04:22.750> then<00:04:23.380> we're<00:04:23.500> like<00:04:23.590> god<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:23.950> must<00:04:24.190> be<00:04:24.220> so

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
and then we're like god that must be so

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.060 
and then we're like god that must be so
hard<00:04:24.520> how<00:04:25.030> unrealistic<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:26.320> heels<00:04:26.590> on<00:04:26.860> those

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
hard how unrealistic the heels on those

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.159 
hard how unrealistic the heels on those
shoes<00:04:27.370> were<00:04:27.580> like<00:04:27.730> that<00:04:28.030> big<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.419> guys<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:29.050> was

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
shoes were like that big you guys it was

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.340

think<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.590> would<00:04:32.710> be<00:04:32.770> particularly<00:04:33.070> difficult

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
think it would be particularly difficult

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.700 
think it would be particularly difficult
actually<00:04:34.000> I'm<00:04:34.780> gonna<00:04:34.930> risk<00:04:35.169> some<00:04:35.440> more<00:04:35.620> of

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
actually I'm gonna risk some more of

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.080 
actually I'm gonna risk some more of
this<00:04:35.830> even<00:04:36.130> though<00:04:36.250> last<00:04:36.460> time<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:36.850> sort<00:04:37.030> of

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
this even though last time it sort of

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.530 
this even though last time it sort of
sent<00:04:37.270> me<00:04:37.330> into<00:04:37.450> anaphylactic<00:04:37.960> shock<00:04:38.080> oh<00:04:39.419> oh

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
sent me into anaphylactic shock oh oh

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.200
