the line then I'm just gonna do a little

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.670 
the line then I'm just gonna do a little
bit<00:02:01.760> of<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.880> kick<00:02:02.150> so<00:02:02.870> we<00:02:02.990> were<00:02:03.080> working<00:02:03.320> across

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
bit of a kick so we were working across

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:15.809 
bit of a kick so we were working across
this<00:02:04.010> way<00:02:04.190> but<00:02:04.400> now<00:02:04.430> we're<00:02:04.610> turning<00:02:04.760> around

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.660 

that's<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:16.750> my<00:02:16.900> basic<00:02:17.140> shape<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:20.489> I'm<00:02:21.489> just

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
that's just my basic shape and I'm just

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.759 
that's just my basic shape and I'm just
going<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.879> join<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.299> in<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:26.379> you<00:02:26.469> can<00:02:26.500> bring

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
going to join it in and you can bring

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.679 
going to join it in and you can bring
this<00:02:26.920> liner<00:02:27.219> out<00:02:27.489> as<00:02:27.700> far<00:02:27.909> as<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.150> want<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:28.569> as

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
this liner out as far as you want but as

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.000 
this liner out as far as you want but as
you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.930> see<00:02:29.109> when<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.859> disappears

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
you can see when I do this it disappears

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.250 
you can see when I do this it disappears
but<00:02:30.969> when<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:31.689> really<00:02:31.900> obvious

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
but when I do that it's really obvious

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.960 
but when I do that it's really obvious
so<00:02:32.409> it<00:02:32.530> kind<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.709> depends<00:02:33.010> on<00:02:33.189> how<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.430> feel

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
so it kind of depends on how you feel

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.059 
so it kind of depends on how you feel
next<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.450> want<00:02:34.599> to<00:02:34.629> take<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.930> black<00:02:35.260> pencil<00:02:35.319> liner

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
next I want to take a black pencil liner

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.740 
next I want to take a black pencil liner
you<00:02:36.310> can<00:02:36.370> use<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.849> gel<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.329> in<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.599> inner

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
you can use the gel one in the inner

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.000 
you can use the gel one in the inner
portion<00:02:38.079> of<00:02:38.140> your<00:02:38.260> eye<00:02:38.349> but<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.650> won't<00:02:38.829> get

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
portion of your eye but you won't get

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.280 
portion of your eye but you won't get
the<00:02:39.129> same<00:02:39.310> benefit<00:02:39.760> as<00:02:39.879> if<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.569> use<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.930> pencil

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the same benefit as if you use a pencil

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.500 
the same benefit as if you use a pencil
so<00:02:42.189> I'm<00:02:42.310> going<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.519> let<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> pencil<00:02:43.209> run

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
so I'm going to let the pencil run

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.849 
so I'm going to let the pencil run
across<00:02:44.400> my<00:02:45.400> waterline<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.650> want<00:02:47.799> to

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
across my waterline and then I want to

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.679 
across my waterline and then I want to
close<00:02:48.010> my<00:02:48.069> eyes<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.909> I'm<00:02:49.180> going<00:02:49.359> to<00:02:49.420> run<00:02:49.599> it

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
close my eyes and I'm going to run it

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.539 
close my eyes and I'm going to run it
across<00:02:49.780> again<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.769> way<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.069> get<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
across again and this way you get the

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.690 
across again and this way you get the
upper<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:53.230> lower<00:02:53.260> waterline<00:02:54.099> at<00:02:54.519> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
upper and the lower waterline at the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.729 
upper and the lower waterline at the
same<00:02:54.939> time<00:02:55.209> which<00:02:55.689> really<00:02:55.720> dark<00:02:56.439> in<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
same time which really dark in the

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.800 
same time which really dark in the
deeper<00:02:57.010> ends<00:02:57.099> this<00:02:57.280> look<00:02:57.489> you're<00:02:58.389> also<00:02:58.540> going

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
deeper ends this look you're also going

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.849 
deeper ends this look you're also going
to<00:02:58.870> bring<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.169> just<00:02:59.650> where<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.250> lashes<00:03:00.430> are<00:03:00.849> so

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
to bring it just where the lashes are so

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.240 
to bring it just where the lashes are so
just<00:03:02.859> bring<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.129> down<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.310> little<00:03:03.609> bit<00:03:03.790> lower

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
just bring it down a little bit lower

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.080 
just bring it down a little bit lower
I'm<00:03:06.250> going<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.489> take<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.730> brush<00:03:06.909> we

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
I'm going to take the brush we

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.240 
I'm going to take the brush we
originally<00:03:07.659> did<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.260> kind<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.739> liquid<00:03:09.069> with

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
originally did the kind of liquid with

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.339 
originally did the kind of liquid with
and<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:10.239> because<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:10.659> pretty<00:03:10.810> much<00:03:10.930> clean

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
and just because it's pretty much clean

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.559 
and just because it's pretty much clean
we're<00:03:12.129> just<00:03:12.310> going<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.519> smudge<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.030> and

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
we're just going to smudge that and

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.690 
we're just going to smudge that and
smoke<00:03:14.079> it<00:03:14.290> out<00:03:14.409> a<00:03:14.439> little<00:03:14.650> bit<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.459> getting

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
smoke it out a little bit just getting

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.849 
smoke it out a little bit just getting
right<00:03:16.000> underneath<00:03:16.419> the<00:03:16.540> lashes<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:17.169> general

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
right underneath the lashes a general

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.559 
right underneath the lashes a general
rule<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.819> should<00:03:18.849> have<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.329> slightly

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
rule is that you should have it slightly

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.300 
rule is that you should have it slightly
lower<00:03:19.959> on<00:03:20.229> the<00:03:20.319> outer<00:03:20.530> portion<00:03:21.099> of<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.280> eye

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
lower on the outer portion of the eye

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.979 
lower on the outer portion of the eye
and<00:03:21.669> then<00:03:21.819> bring<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.239> kind<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.540> swooping

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
and then bring it kind of swooping

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.020 
and then bring it kind of swooping
inwards<00:03:23.409> so<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:24.280> should<00:03:24.459> be<00:03:24.579> a<00:03:24.609> little<00:03:24.849> bit

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
inwards so it should be a little bit

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.390 
inwards so it should be a little bit
higher<00:03:25.329> as<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:26.409> get<00:03:26.590> closer<00:03:26.889> to<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.220> inner

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
higher as you get closer to the inner

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.920 
higher as you get closer to the inner
portion<00:03:27.699> of<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:27.940> eye<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.359> that<00:03:28.540> way<00:03:28.659> you<00:03:28.720> get

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
portion of the eye and that way you get

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.800 
portion of the eye and that way you get
kind<00:03:29.109> of<00:03:29.139> a<00:03:29.229> more<00:03:29.379> of<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.500> balanced<00:03:29.919> look<00:03:30.810> put

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
kind of a more of a balanced look put

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.339 
kind of a more of a balanced look put
some<00:03:32.019> mascara<00:03:32.139> just<00:03:32.769> on<00:03:32.919> the<00:03:33.010> bottom<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.780> then

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
some mascara just on the bottom and then

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.240 
some mascara just on the bottom and then
right<00:03:36.220> at<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.489> top<00:03:36.729> on<00:03:37.889> average<00:03:38.889> she<00:03:38.919> usually

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
right at the top on average she usually

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.420 
right at the top on average she usually
wears<00:03:39.639> about<00:03:39.879> three<00:03:40.269> sets<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.959> lashes<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.069> I've

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
wears about three sets of lashes so I've

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.920 
wears about three sets of lashes so I've
only<00:03:42.609> put<00:03:42.879> one<00:03:42.909> on<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.510> I'm<00:03:43.569> just<00:03:43.659> going<00:03:43.840> to

only put one on and I'm just going to
leave<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.109> at<00:03:44.229> that<00:03:44.260> but<00:03:44.530> if<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.709> do<00:03:44.919> want<00:03:45.190> to

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
leave it at that but if you do want to

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.770 
leave it at that but if you do want to
get<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.519> kind<00:03:45.729> of<00:03:45.760> full<00:03:46.030> look<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.389> would<00:03:46.569> say<00:03:46.720> to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
get the kind of full look I would say to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.930 
get the kind of full look I would say to
put<00:03:46.989> about<00:03:47.290> two<00:03:47.560> on<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.949> basically<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:48.909> just

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
put about two on and basically you just
