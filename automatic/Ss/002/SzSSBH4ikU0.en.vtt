00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.170 
what's just come through the door it
looks<00:00:03.449> like<00:00:03.659> it's<00:00:03.870> my<00:00:04.049> Nexus<00:00:04.830> bumper<00:00:05.490> so<00:00:06.060> it

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
looks like it's my Nexus bumper so it

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.820 
looks like it's my Nexus bumper so it
did<00:00:06.330> actually<00:00:06.450> only<00:00:06.779> take<00:00:07.049> two<00:00:07.290> days<00:00:07.529> even

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
did actually only take two days even

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.680 
did actually only take two days even
though<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.160> said<00:00:08.429> one<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.910> two<00:00:09.090> weeks<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.630> it

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
though it said one to two weeks so it

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.970 
though it said one to two weeks so it
looks<00:00:09.750> like<00:00:09.929> Google<00:00:10.410> are<00:00:10.530> covering

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
looks like Google are covering

as<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.370> say<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> boson<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.690> head

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
as you say the boson here then I head

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.670 
as you say the boson here then I head
sir<00:00:46.800> let's<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> try<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:51.500> come<00:00:52.500> on

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
sir let's get it out and try it come on

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:05.560 
sir let's get it out and try it come on
down<00:00:52.860> you<00:01:00.710> hate<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.829> plastic<00:01:02.309> damn<00:01:02.520> case

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.750 

there<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:07.580> okay<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:10.369> here<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.549> it's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
there we go okay so and here it is it's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.140 
there we go okay so and here it is it's
literally<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.790> bit<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.909> plastic

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
literally just this a bit of plastic

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.510 
literally just this a bit of plastic
that<00:01:15.689> goes<00:01:16.470> around<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> phone<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.189> protects

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that goes around the phone and protects

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.050 
that goes around the phone and protects
it<00:01:17.790> from<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:19.009> drop<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.430> let's<00:01:20.610> test

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
it from you know drop it so let's test

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.789 
it from you know drop it so let's test
it<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.960> let's<00:01:27.960> make<00:01:28.110> sure<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.320> put<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.619> on

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it out so let's make sure I put this on

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.539 
it out so let's make sure I put this on
the<00:01:28.829> right<00:01:29.040> way<00:01:29.990> guess<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.229> gonna<00:01:31.560> slip

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the right way guess it's just gonna slip

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
the right way guess it's just gonna slip
in<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:37.670> yeah<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> go<00:01:40.100> looks<00:01:41.100> done

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
in here yeah and there we go looks done

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
in here yeah and there we go looks done
so<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.570> basically<00:01:42.750> does<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.500> can

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
so what this basically does is you can

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.310 
so what this basically does is you can
see<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.100> don't<00:01:44.280> lose<00:01:44.520> any<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> nice<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:46.079> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
see you don't lose any the nice back in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560 
see you don't lose any the nice back in
front<00:01:46.740> adds<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.549> bit<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> bulk<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
front adds a little bit of bulk to it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
front adds a little bit of bulk to it
but<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> lot<00:01:49.110> probably<00:01:49.860> less<00:01:50.009> than<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.369> case

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
but not a lot probably less than my case

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.539 
but not a lot probably less than my case
did<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.780> don't<00:01:52.590> know<00:01:52.680> how<00:01:52.829> well<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
did I don't know how well it's going to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.010 
did I don't know how well it's going to
protect<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.090> guess<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.570> protect

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
protect it I guess it will just protect

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
protect it I guess it will just protect
it<00:01:55.140> from<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.439> corner<00:01:55.950> drops<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> stuff<00:01:56.700> like

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it from like corner drops and stuff like

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
it from like corner drops and stuff like
that<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.689> screen<00:01:57.990> i'll<00:01:58.140> still<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.439> scratched

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that the screen i'll still get scratched

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.649 
that the screen i'll still get scratched
and<00:01:58.979> possibly<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> back<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.240> slightly

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and possibly the back it's slightly

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.350 
and possibly the back it's slightly
raised<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.189> should<00:02:02.579> stop

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
raised as you can see so it should stop

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.700 
raised as you can see so it should stop
stock<00:02:03.659> from<00:02:03.840> touching<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
stock from touching the back of the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.479 
stock from touching the back of the
phone<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:06.079> actually<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.489> table

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
phone when it is actually on the table

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.059 
phone when it is actually on the table
if<00:02:08.580> i<00:02:08.640> show<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.379> yeah<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.739> there<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
if i show you that yeah it is there is a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.880 
if i show you that yeah it is there is a
little<00:02:11.370> gap<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:12.510> feels<00:02:12.840> quite<00:02:13.050> all<00:02:13.230> made<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
little gap it feels quite all made the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.140 
little gap it feels quite all made the
volume<00:02:14.310> rocker<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.670> stuff<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.090> that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
volume rocker and stuff like that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.970 
volume rocker and stuff like that
actually<00:02:15.450> feels<00:02:15.750> very<00:02:16.110> nice<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.830> can

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
actually feels very nice here you can

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.300 
actually feels very nice here you can
see<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.900> all<00:02:18.900> working<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.890> should<00:02:19.920> be

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
see it's a all working as it should be

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.610 
see it's a all working as it should be
it<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.480> i<00:02:21.600> said<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.870> adds<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.170> little<00:02:22.319> bit<00:02:22.500> of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it like i said it adds a little bit of

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620 
it like i said it adds a little bit of
bulk<00:02:22.920> we're<00:02:23.130> probably<00:02:23.310> less<00:02:23.670> than<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.150> case

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
bulk we're probably less than this case

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.199 
bulk we're probably less than this case
that<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.900> had<00:02:25.050> before<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.730> quite<00:02:27.090> happy

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
that I had before so I'm quite happy

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.890 
that I had before so I'm quite happy
with<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.690> whether<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.380> not<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.860> worth<00:02:29.900> 19

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
with it whether or not it's worth 19

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.020 
with it whether or not it's worth 19
pounds<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> different<00:02:31.890> story<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.370> don't<00:02:32.850> know

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
pounds is a different story I don't know

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.460 
pounds is a different story I don't know
because<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.450> don't<00:02:33.510> know<00:02:33.720> how<00:02:33.810> protective<00:02:34.050> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
because I don't know how protective it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.510 
because I don't know how protective it
really<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:35.959> but<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.290> actual<00:02:37.800> design<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
really is but the actual design of the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.970 
really is but the actual design of the
case<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.000> know<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.300> nice<00:02:39.510> silver<00:02:40.110> rim

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
case you know this nice silver rim

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.830 
case you know this nice silver rim
around<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.880> quite<00:02:42.180> nice<00:02:42.360> i<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.750> to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
around it is it's quite nice i have to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.830 
around it is it's quite nice i have to
say<00:02:42.989> myself<00:02:43.410> i<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> fact<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.660> can

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
say myself i like the fact that you can

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.860 
say myself i like the fact that you can
still<00:02:46.050> see<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> shiny<00:02:46.620> nexus<00:02:47.160> back<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:48.420> there

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
still see the shiny nexus back but there

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.510 
still see the shiny nexus back but there
it<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.110> guys<00:02:49.350> there's<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.770> bumper<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.280> let<00:02:50.430> me

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
it is guys there's the bumper and let me

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.840 
it is guys there's the bumper and let me
just<00:02:50.700> stir<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.500> yeah<00:02:53.070> it's<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.400> lot<00:02:53.550> lesser

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
just stir so yeah it's a lot lesser

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.180 
just stir so yeah it's a lot lesser
slidy<00:02:54.750> than<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.170> was<00:02:55.290> before<00:02:55.470> basically<00:02:56.130> if

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
slidy than it was before basically if

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.699 
slidy than it was before basically if
you<00:02:56.310> put<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.670> back<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.510> table<00:02:57.870> without

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
you put the back on the table without

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.130 
you put the back on the table without
the<00:02:59.040> bumper<00:02:59.310> case<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.730> slides<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.630> anything

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the bumper case it slides like anything

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.320 
the bumper case it slides like anything
and<00:03:01.320> we'll<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.650> vibrate<00:03:02.250> off<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.880> screen

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
and we'll just vibrate off the screen

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.630 
and we'll just vibrate off the screen
with<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:03.959> bumper<00:03:04.380> case<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:04.830> unlikely<00:03:05.370> to

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
with the bumper case it's unlikely to

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.370 
with the bumper case it's unlikely to
happen<00:03:05.760> as<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.090> does<00:03:06.390> give<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.900> little<00:03:07.140> bit

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
happen as it does give it a little bit

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.070 
happen as it does give it a little bit
more<00:03:07.620> grip<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.400> see<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.690> curve

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
more grip and you can see on the curve

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.050 
more grip and you can see on the curve
see<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.500> does<00:03:10.739> curve<00:03:11.100> around<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.700> edge<00:03:11.850> that's

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
see it does curve around the edge that's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.060 
see it does curve around the edge that's
quite<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> good<00:03:12.570> shot<00:03:12.900> there<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.769> see<00:03:13.980> it

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
quite a good shot there you see it

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.420 
quite a good shot there you see it
definitely<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.519> sunk<00:03:14.910> back<00:03:15.180> into<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
definitely is sunk back into it so the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.940 
definitely is sunk back into it so the
back<00:03:17.610> actually<00:03:17.820> isn't<00:03:18.180> touching<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.709> surface

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
back actually isn't touching the surface

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.039 
back actually isn't touching the surface
when<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.430> put<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.730> down<00:03:20.970> which<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.329> its<00:03:21.750> decent

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
when you put it down which is its decent

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.539 
when you put it down which is its decent
so<00:03:22.410> should<00:03:22.620> protect<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.950> camera<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.400> stuff

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
so should protect the camera and stuff

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.190 
so should protect the camera and stuff
like<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:26.030> decent<00:03:27.030> doesn't<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:27.900> too<00:03:28.079> much

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
like that decent doesn't have too much

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.810 
like that decent doesn't have too much
bulk<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.709> actually<00:03:28.950> quite<00:03:29.100> nice<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.640> does

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
bulk it's actually quite nice it does

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.750 
bulk it's actually quite nice it does
add<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.299> little<00:03:31.019> bit<00:03:31.260> but<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.430> know<00:03:32.549> it's<00:03:32.700> a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
add a little bit but you know it's a

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.810 
add a little bit but you know it's a
case<00:03:32.970> that's<00:03:33.000> what<00:03:33.329> we<00:03:33.450> expect<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.110> yeah<00:03:34.980> your

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
case that's what we expect so yeah your

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.370 
case that's what we expect so yeah your
decision<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.450> whether<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:36.870> worth<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.260> money

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
decision on whether it's worth the money

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.020 
decision on whether it's worth the money
I<00:03:38.120> quite<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:40.040> 19<00:03:41.040> pounds<00:03:41.070> possibly<00:03:42.000> a

I quite like it 19 pounds possibly a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
little bit steep but that's what you get

little bit steep but that's what you get
