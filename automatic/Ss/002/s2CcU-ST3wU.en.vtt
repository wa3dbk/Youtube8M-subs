00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.940
 presenting my first minecraft assembly 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.190
 This is pkk assembly version 1 0 here such 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 mods like divine rpg wife in general we 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:23.519
 Now let's see what there are fashion in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.130
 moss section this version is 147 at 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.220
 moment this latest version and so 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 optifine minecraft forge need fight ops 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.200
 3 to 5 tr. this is all clear armor status 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.570
 time about it is all such standard 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.180
 small fashions 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 line king mod mod which adds two 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.329
 new measurements minekravt minekravt in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 general mods and based on the cartoon 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.250
 lonking and quite interesting 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.859
 big enough mod i decided in dubai 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.199
 assembly and I think it will be interesting 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.030
 split i can you see in explay by 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.610
 name adventurers on my 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 channel and so build craft as 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 additional mod adds 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.420
 automation well everyone knows but i think 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 it makes no sense to tell the pages 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.939
 a small small addition addon to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.659
 build craft backpack is a sword indicator 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.100
 shows how much damage mobs 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.590
 not at all health here 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.350
 divine r pigi 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.189
 probably the main mod in this build and 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.960
 gallente csync extra mod it 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.710
 you can not use in principle but he 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.750
 quite useful x3 biomes 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.630
 forestry industrial craft like 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.990
 extra 2 hitting mod like build 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.509
 craft 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.810
 if you want you can do indonesia without 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.689
 problems like 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.880
 Andy Three Two x Starcraft Locust 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.039
 as extra as it is 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.560
 what industrial craft craft craft &amp; 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.360
 steve calcium and there kraft magic mod 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.590
 I think this mod is very good 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.649
 combined with devine rpg g and so i 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.269
 he added it too and everything is enough 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.690
 how well I wanted to say everything 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.290
 works fine there are some bugs now 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.810
 I'll tell her twilight forest and here too 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.310
 add new dimensions and so we 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.959
 now create a new world think it 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.560
 a lot of time will not take i want you 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.380
 to show 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.360
 rather not show and tell one 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.209
 I noticed a bug in this 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.730
 assembly I do not know this is a new sofa so 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.239
 changed something remember monsters 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.950
 either it is specifically in this build case 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:54.410
 that mobs from the sofa stoves will be remembered 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.579
 very rarely at first I think that they 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.370
 do not spawn at all 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.549
 when already assembled assembly and test flew 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.269
 there as if checking for performance 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.730
 for some reason I can not do on the first 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.340
 then not all the same noticed mobs from the couch 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.100
 pidzhi but they are very rare I 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.880
 I do not know what it is possible because 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.390
 the fact that there might be from other mods 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.709
 although 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.450
 although I hardly mean zombies there 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.519
 crafting because it's probably 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.880
 the only one that can be added 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.920
 third-party mods other but all 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.049
 works fine but unfortunately that's how 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.079
 since i say mobs from devayna before 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.489
 is very rare here we see 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.620
 a crab that is, he got through 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.400
 ok but for some reason cyclops are not visible 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.350
 although usually there should be a lot 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.950
 here is such a tank there are more blogs i 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.950
 didn't notice 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.930
 this is our cinema byda lonking there 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.940
 can you get into the measurement if you don't 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.960
 knows well here's the actual build if you 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.270
 know how to fix the bug so that not 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.970
 Spawn mobs from devayna that is 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.709
 remember very rarely write 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.930
 Please also write in the comments 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.720
 in the comment which mods are worth 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.600
 add to this build and next version 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.459
 assembly 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.220
 I think there will be some new interesting 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.360
 mods that you write in the comments 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.100

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.300

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.090
 finish everyone thanks for watching this
