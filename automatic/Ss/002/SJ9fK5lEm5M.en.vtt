00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone here we are for a new one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.000
 recipe today I'll show you how I cook 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.859
 I polenta a dish typically 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.860
 winter that in these cold days 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:19.289
 there is just fine with ingredients 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:20.970
 we need 250 g of polenta and a half 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.189
 chopped onion 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.519
 I've already omeleted about 60 grams of it 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.059
 gorgonzola about a pound of mortadella 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.350
 which I will then go to make oil cubes 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 and salt 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.610
 let's see the procedure as 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 first step we have to put to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.390
 boil every liter of water in the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.629
 In the meantime let the water boil 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.110
 sautÃ©ed with onion before we put it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110
 oil 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:07.659
 our onion in the meantime we come back 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:18.220
 the 27 about 100 grams of mortadella a 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:20.170
 cubes bring it water starts at 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.050
 boil add slowly the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.899
 our polenta and with a wooden spoon 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.899
 jia in order not to form lights 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.450
 let's go on like this until we put it all 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.760
 five minutes before pulling it off 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.360
 net break we add our 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:13.620
 onions ceiling and we continue to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.930
 mix our polenta and ready 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 we remove the stove we add the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:36.330
 costa mortadella mix we add 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.320
 our village nzolo we mix in a 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:50.160
 platter 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:52.290
 put our polenta and try to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.200
 smooth them out once we have more or 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.500
 the less paved our polenta 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.270
 let it cool for about 5 minutes 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.580
 once past five minutes they were st 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:08.630
 polenta is a little cooled 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.630
 let's cut rectangles like this 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:29.490
 we take our plate with the help 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.490
 of a small spoon we take some carmine 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.890
 let's add his 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:16.280
 a little bit of Parmesan and I would say that 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:21.800
 they have polenta with sauce but also 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:26.180
 white is very good and ready I hope so much 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:29.170
