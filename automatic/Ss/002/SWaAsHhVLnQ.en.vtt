00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.620
 if today you do not have the life you want 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.960
 surely there is something that you have to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.700
 change and many people wonder 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.799
 well what do I do that is the first thing that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.109
 I have to change and they change 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.750
 Behaviors before changing thoughts 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.910
 It is very important that you observe what is 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.460
 what do you think about the things that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.990
 you want about if you can or if not 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.359
 you can if you have the ability or the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.429
 skill developed in any of 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.859
 these cases one of the first things 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.079
 that you have to change is to learn to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.910
 listen more your thoughts to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.489
 look for thoughts that are more 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.800
 productive and more constructive to your 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.440
 rows the second thing that you have to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 change is the knowledge many times 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.980
 it's not that we can not do things 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.930
 that we do not have the knowledge 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.430
 appropriate and today in this era of the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.710
 information the knowledge can be 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.530
 acquire in many ways and the internet is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.969
 a very good tool to do it 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 then I would invite you during the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.129
 next three days to the task of doing 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.530
 a kind of log or carry a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.360
 sort of notebook where you go 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 noting day by day what they are 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.620
 thoughts that you are getting to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.330
 please the things that you want to change and 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.910
 that you can also detect what are 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.460
 the knowledge that you could require 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.130
 get and give yourself the task of looking for them 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.290
 I know that phrases can be pretty 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 and that brief reflections can be 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.060
 interesting however what is more 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.250
 powerful to improve your life is that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.650
 learn to think in favor that you learn to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.750
 look for more appropriate information of things 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.840
 that you can improve and that of course you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.790
 put yourself in a constant practice safe 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 I'm doing these three things 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.350
 of thinking please find new 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.509

 days and take action to put in 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.660
 practice what you are learning 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.940
 undoubtedly day by day will go 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.070

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.500

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.220
