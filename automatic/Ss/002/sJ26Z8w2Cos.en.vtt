got four iPads here we've got four

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.099 
got four iPads here we've got four
different<00:00:58.820> screen<00:00:59.820> shields<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.629> two

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
different screen shields we have two

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.460 
different screen shields we have two
iPad<00:01:01.980> threes<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.699> two<00:01:02.969> iPad<00:01:03.480> -<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.229> you're

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
iPad threes and two iPad - so you're

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.649 
iPad threes and two iPad - so you're
just<00:01:04.500> gonna<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.430> imagine<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
just gonna have to kind of imagine the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.500 
just gonna have to kind of imagine the
incremental<00:01:07.470> differences<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.180> iPad

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
incremental differences going from iPad

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170 
incremental differences going from iPad
2<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.810> iPad<00:01:10.200> 3<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.460> wanted<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
2 to iPad 3 I just wanted to kind of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
2 to iPad 3 I just wanted to kind of
give<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.500> perspective<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
give you a perspective on this

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
give you a perspective on this
so<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.540> first<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
so here up first we're going to have the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.719 
so here up first we're going to have the
new<00:01:16.979> ultra<00:01:17.549> optics<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> new<00:01:19.860> iPad<00:01:20.340> okay

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
new ultra optics for the new iPad okay

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.039 
new ultra optics for the new iPad okay
this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.299> different<00:01:21.810> than<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this is a little different than the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.950 
this is a little different than the
original<00:01:22.530> ultra<00:01:22.830> optics<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> iPad<00:01:23.939> 2<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
original ultra optics for the iPad 2 so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.210 
original ultra optics for the iPad 2 so
we'll<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.229> into<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:25.860> bit

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
we'll get into that in a little bit

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.539 
we'll get into that in a little bit
next<00:01:27.150> we'll<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.750> ultra<00:01:28.590> fine<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.280> stein

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
next we'll have the ultra fine the stein

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.330 
next we'll have the ultra fine the stein
hell<00:01:29.790> ultra<00:01:30.150> fine<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> new<00:01:30.900> iPad<00:01:31.380> again<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
hell ultra fine for a new iPad again a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.950 
hell ultra fine for a new iPad again a
little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.909> different<00:01:33.329> than<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> original

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
little bit different than the original

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.910 
little bit different than the original
iPad<00:01:34.140> ultra<00:01:34.740> fine<00:01:35.210> then<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.020> stein

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
iPad ultra fine then we have the stein

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.700 
iPad ultra fine then we have the stein
Hill<00:01:38.159> crystal<00:01:38.970> clear<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.479> ultra<00:01:39.900> crystal<00:01:40.320> for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
Hill crystal clear or ultra crystal for

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.090 
Hill crystal clear or ultra crystal for
the<00:01:40.799> new<00:01:40.920> iPad<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.079> older<00:01:43.680> ultra

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the new iPad and we have the older ultra

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.450 
the new iPad and we have the older ultra
optics<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> iPad<00:01:45.509> 2<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.590> new<00:01:46.740> iPad<00:01:47.220> as

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
optics for the iPad 2 and a new iPad as

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.330 
optics for the iPad 2 and a new iPad as
you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.720> packaging<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> older

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
you can see the packaging on the older

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.139 
you can see the packaging on the older
ultra<00:01:50.729> optics<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.680> more<00:01:52.680> green<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.970> new

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
ultra optics is more green and the new

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.530 
ultra optics is more green and the new
ultra<00:01:54.570> optics<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.700> no<00:01:56.700> seafoam<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
ultra optics is kind of no seafoam I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.319 
ultra optics is kind of no seafoam I
guess<00:01:57.869> we're<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.140> call<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.369> let's

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
guess we're going to call it so let's

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420 
guess we're going to call it so let's
kind<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.719> into<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.110> first<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.070> ultra

on the crystal clear now keep in mind
this<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.440> an<00:03:37.560> iPad<00:03:37.950> 2<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.639> you<00:03:39.420> know<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.600> have

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
this is an iPad 2 so you know you have

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.390 
this is an iPad 2 so you know you have
to<00:03:39.900> take<00:03:40.109> into<00:03:40.290> account<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.130> doesn't

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
to take into account that it doesn't

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.580 
to take into account that it doesn't
have<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.549> Retina<00:03:41.940> display<00:03:42.329> now<00:03:42.959> when<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.440> go

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
have the Retina display now when you go

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.309 
have the Retina display now when you go
over<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.660> ultrafine<00:03:45.660> on<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:47.250> iPad<00:03:47.700> 3

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
over to the ultrafine on the iPad 3

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.490 
over to the ultrafine on the iPad 3
you're<00:03:49.319> going<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.500> notice<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:49.859> it<00:03:50.250> has<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.700> lot

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
you're going to notice that it has a lot

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.830 
you're going to notice that it has a lot
less<00:03:52.500> fingerprints<00:03:53.370> okay<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.790> ultrafine<00:03:54.630> is

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
less fingerprints okay the ultrafine is

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.830 
less fingerprints okay the ultrafine is
a<00:03:54.870> little<00:03:55.410> more<00:03:55.590> anti<00:03:56.010> fingerprint<00:03:56.639> but<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.690> is

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
a little more anti fingerprint but it is

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.379 
a little more anti fingerprint but it is
going<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.079> degrade<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.950> quality<00:03:59.239> just<00:04:00.239> a

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
going to degrade the quality just a

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.120 
going to degrade the quality just a
little<00:04:00.630> bit<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:01.109> if<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.380> have<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.650> five<00:04:01.980> to

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
little bit so if you have the five to

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.030 
little bit so if you have the five to
give<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.370> percentage<00:04:02.910> on<00:04:03.299> what<00:04:04.170> percentage

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
give you a percentage on what percentage

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.670 
give you a percentage on what percentage
of<00:04:05.069> quality<00:04:05.850> degradation<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:07.019> this<00:04:07.260> ultra

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
of quality degradation is on this ultra

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.550 
of quality degradation is on this ultra
fine<00:04:07.889> I<00:04:08.130> would<00:04:08.579> say<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.239> roughly<00:04:09.720> five

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
fine I would say it's roughly five

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.430 
fine I would say it's roughly five
percent<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.209> see<00:04:12.450> it's<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.930> really

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
percent so you can see it's a really

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.430 
percent so you can see it's a really
nice<00:04:14.000> anti<00:04:15.000> fingerprint<00:04:15.689> we've<00:04:16.080> got<00:04:16.229> some

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
nice anti fingerprint we've got some

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.640 
nice anti fingerprint we've got some
pictures<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.890> scotch<00:04:17.159> dog<00:04:17.489> here<00:04:17.909> so<00:04:18.269> it

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
pictures of scotch dog here so it

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.120 
pictures of scotch dog here so it
really<00:04:19.070> sharp<00:04:19.370> even<00:04:20.560> when<00:04:21.560> it's<00:04:21.709> got<00:04:21.919> an

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
really sharp even when it's got an

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.689 
really sharp even when it's got an
ultrafine<00:04:22.639> anti<00:04:23.360> fingerprint<00:04:23.990> type<00:04:24.229> of

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
ultrafine anti fingerprint type of

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.760 
ultrafine anti fingerprint type of
screen<00:04:25.699> shield<00:04:25.910> on<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.300> when<00:04:26.900> we<00:04:27.020> go<00:04:27.169> over<00:04:27.560> to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
screen shield on it when we go over to

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.210 
screen shield on it when we go over to
the<00:04:27.889> ultra<00:04:28.250> optics<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:29.000> ultra<00:04:29.360> optics<00:04:30.220> is

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
the ultra optics the ultra optics is

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.270 
the ultra optics the ultra optics is
designed<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.789> little<00:04:31.910> bit<00:04:32.060> differently<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.900> is

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
designed a little bit differently it is

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.210 
designed a little bit differently it is
got<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.490> texture<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:36.350> does<00:04:36.560> have<00:04:36.800> a

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
little bit of a I don't want to say a

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.730 
little bit of a I don't want to say a
squeak<00:04:41.090> but<00:04:41.449> if<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.690> listen<00:04:42.050> really<00:04:42.320> close

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
squeak but if you listen really close

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.260 
squeak but if you listen really close
you<00:04:42.979> can<00:04:43.009> hear<00:04:43.160> your<00:04:43.520> finger<00:04:43.789> going<00:04:43.970> across

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
you can hear your finger going across

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.760 
you can hear your finger going across
the<00:04:44.539> screen<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:44.990> that's<00:04:45.139> just<00:04:45.380> because<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
the screen and that's just because the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.219 
the screen and that's just because the
design<00:04:46.160> how<00:04:46.699> the<00:04:46.759> light<00:04:47.150> is<00:04:47.180> let<00:04:47.600> out<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.050> let

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
design how the light is let out and let

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.350 
design how the light is let out and let
through<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:49.160> screen<00:04:49.610> shield<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.090> when<00:04:50.270> you

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
through the screen shield so when you

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.750 
through the screen shield so when you
look<00:04:50.539> at<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.900> ultra<00:04:51.260> optics<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.889> can<00:04:52.490> tell

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
look at the ultra optics you can tell

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.480 
look at the ultra optics you can tell
okay<00:04:53.300> no<00:04:53.870> fingerprints<00:04:54.620> or<00:04:54.770> very<00:04:55.010> little<00:04:55.280> I

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
okay no fingerprints or very little I

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.040 
okay no fingerprints or very little I
should<00:04:55.520> say<00:04:55.910> you're<00:04:56.419> still<00:04:56.630> gonna<00:04:56.720> have<00:04:56.900> some

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
should say you're still gonna have some

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.450 
should say you're still gonna have some
fingerprints<00:04:57.650> okay<00:04:57.949> so<00:04:58.010> we're<00:04:58.190> going<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.340> go

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
fingerprints okay so we're going to go

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.490 
fingerprints okay so we're going to go
to<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.669> Photos<00:04:59.060> app<00:04:59.090> here<00:04:59.630> and<00:04:59.810> we're<00:05:00.410> gonna

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
to the Photos app here and we're gonna

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.750 
to the Photos app here and we're gonna
pull<00:05:00.830> up

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
pull up

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.439 
pull up
let's<00:05:02.389> see<00:05:02.600> pictures<00:05:03.139> of<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.350> kids<00:05:07.060> so<00:05:08.060> as<00:05:08.270> you

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
let's see pictures of the kids so as you

let's see pictures of the kids so as you
can<00:05:08.600> see<00:05:08.860> game<00:05:09.860> with<00:05:10.310> cupcake<00:05:11.240> all<00:05:11.419> over<00:05:11.660> her

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
can see game with cupcake all over her

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.170 
can see game with cupcake all over her
face<00:05:12.080> we<00:05:13.010> have<00:05:13.039> some<00:05:13.430> really<00:05:13.729> nice<00:05:13.940> pictures

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
face we have some really nice pictures

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.779 
face we have some really nice pictures
of<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.570> kids<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.260> let's<00:05:15.500> get<00:05:15.680> to<00:05:15.919> something

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
of the kids and let's get to something

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.580 
of the kids and let's get to something
really<00:05:16.970> clear<00:05:17.449> there's<00:05:17.690> like<00:05:17.900> a<00:05:17.930> screen<00:05:18.349> shot

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
really clear there's like a screen shot

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.839 
really clear there's like a screen shot
you<00:05:18.650> guys<00:05:18.889> all<00:05:19.070> know<00:05:19.190> what<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.340> screen<00:05:19.639> shot

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
you guys all know what a screen shot

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.300 
you guys all know what a screen shot
looks<00:05:20.090> like<00:05:20.380> so<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.410> would<00:05:21.710> say<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:21.979> percentage

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
looks like so I would say the percentage

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.909 
looks like so I would say the percentage
of<00:05:22.580> degradation<00:05:22.760> on<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.449> ultra<00:05:23.900> optics<00:05:24.380> would

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
of degradation on the ultra optics would

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.620 
of degradation on the ultra optics would
be<00:05:25.070> about<00:05:25.280> three<00:05:25.550> percent<00:05:25.760> as<00:05:26.090> opposed<00:05:26.389> to<00:05:26.539> the

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
be about three percent as opposed to the

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.950 
be about three percent as opposed to the
five<00:05:26.870> on<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.199> ultrafine<00:05:27.710> thing<00:05:28.780> and<00:05:29.780> then

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
five on the ultrafine thing and then

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.920 
five on the ultrafine thing and then
over<00:05:30.380> here<00:05:30.410> we<00:05:30.979> have<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.490> older<00:05:32.360> ultrafine

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
over here we have the older ultrafine

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.870 
over here we have the older ultrafine
which<00:05:33.320> is<00:05:33.560> still<00:05:33.830> not<00:05:33.860> an<00:05:34.190> issue<00:05:34.310> guys<00:05:34.580> so<00:05:34.789> if

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
which is still not an issue guys so if

whatever you guys want to call them and
we

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
we

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.290 
we
got<00:06:28.940> the<00:06:29.120> older<00:06:29.540> ultra<00:06:29.900> optics<00:06:30.380> the

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
got the older ultra optics the

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.740 
got the older ultra optics the
crystal-clear<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:33.320> ultra<00:06:33.860> fine<00:06:34.130> and<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:35.180> new

crystal-clear the ultra fine and the new

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.650 
crystal-clear the ultra fine and the new
I<00:06:36.050> guess<00:06:36.350> redesigned<00:06:37.070> ultra<00:06:37.520> optics<00:06:37.940> and<00:06:38.300> they

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
I guess redesigned ultra optics and they

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.050 
I guess redesigned ultra optics and they
range<00:06:38.960> from<00:06:39.050> twenty<00:06:39.560> one<00:06:39.680> ninety<00:06:40.070> nine<00:06:40.100> to

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
range from twenty one ninety nine to

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.870 
range from twenty one ninety nine to
twenty<00:06:41.450> eight<00:06:41.480> ninety<00:06:42.050> nine<00:06:42.340> so<00:06:43.340> I<00:06:43.670> hope<00:06:43.850> that

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
twenty eight ninety nine so I hope that

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.520 
twenty eight ninety nine so I hope that
