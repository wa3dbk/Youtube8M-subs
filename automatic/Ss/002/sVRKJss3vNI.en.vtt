at<00:00:53.219> individual<00:00:53.730> cuts<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.660> take<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.170> at

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
at individual cuts and take a look at

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.010 
at individual cuts and take a look at
the<00:00:55.320> tumor<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> full<00:00:56.579> screen<00:00:56.910> view<00:00:57.180> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the tumor on the full screen view so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.450 
the tumor on the full screen view so
it's<00:00:58.230> almost<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.100> hold<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it's almost as if you can hold the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.990 
it's almost as if you can hold the
anatomy<00:00:59.879> in<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.059> hand<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.820> we're<00:01:02.969> just

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
anatomy in your hand so we're just

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.539 
anatomy in your hand so we're just
hoping<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.480> scalp<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.530> we're<00:01:05.489> gonna

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
hoping the scalp up now and we're gonna

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310 
hoping the scalp up now and we're gonna
separate<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> scalp<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> muscle<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
separate the scalp and the muscle so

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.840 
separate the scalp and the muscle so
that<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.680> make<00:01:07.920> our<00:01:08.189> opening<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that we can make our opening and the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.960 
that we can make our opening and the
bone<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> right<00:01:09.570> spot<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.580> up<00:01:11.580> right<00:01:11.760> on

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
bone in the right spot and up right on

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.350

top<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> tumor<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.360> exactly

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
top of the tumor here this is exactly

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.179 
top of the tumor here this is exactly
this<00:01:15.630> patient's<00:01:16.110> Anatomy<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.920> see<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
this patient's Anatomy we can see the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
this patient's Anatomy we can see the
tumor<00:01:17.520> outlined<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.560> its

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
tumor outlined and we can see its

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.679 
tumor outlined and we can see its
relationship<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> blood<00:01:21.090> vessels<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
relationship to all the blood vessels in

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.120 
relationship to all the blood vessels in
the<00:01:21.750> neighborhood<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> tumor<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.009> we're

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the neighborhood of the tumor so we're

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.969 
the neighborhood of the tumor so we're
gonna<00:01:23.220> use<00:01:23.310> an<00:01:23.549> electric<00:01:23.970> drill<00:01:24.619> to<00:01:25.619> open<00:01:25.650> up

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
gonna use an electric drill to open up

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
gonna use an electric drill to open up
the<00:01:26.070> bone

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the bone

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
the bone
and<00:01:28.350> try<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> come<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.399> down<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.729> top

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and try to come right down on top

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.899 
and try to come right down on top
without<00:01:30.360> getting<00:01:30.960> any<00:01:31.799> bleeding<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.759> can

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
without getting any bleeding so we can

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.719 
without getting any bleeding so we can
see<00:01:33.149> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> upper<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:34.320> hand<00:01:34.350> corner<00:01:34.770> the

see in the upper right hand corner the
back<00:01:35.909> edge<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.329> where<00:01:36.450> we're<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.079> tumors

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
back edge of where we're going in tumors

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.789 
back edge of where we're going in tumors
just<00:01:38.039> coming<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:38.820> view<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
just coming into view there so this is

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.710

normal<00:01:52.979> brain<00:01:53.130> tissue<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.569> the<00:01:54.750> tip

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
normal brain tissue you can see the tip

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.600 
normal brain tissue you can see the tip
of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> probe<00:01:55.740> where<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> cross<00:01:56.340> hairs

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of the probe where the cross hairs

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.639 
of the probe where the cross hairs
intersect<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.539> shows<00:01:57.750> me<00:01:57.780> where<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> am

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
intersect and that shows me where I am

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.039 
intersect and that shows me where I am
inside<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.520> tumor<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.659> now<00:02:00.810> we're<00:02:00.959> just

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
inside the tumor and now we're just

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.230 
inside the tumor and now we're just
going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.319> separate<00:02:01.709> it<00:02:01.830> off<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.909> looks<00:02:03.090> like

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
going to separate it off it looks like

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.160 
going to separate it off it looks like
it's<00:02:03.420> completely<00:02:03.869> free<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:04.470> ready<00:02:04.619> to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.610 

what<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.200> find<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:12.010> if<00:02:12.460> I<00:02:12.700> can<00:02:13.060> visualize<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
what I find is if I can visualize the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.850 
what I find is if I can visualize the
whole<00:02:14.800> operation<00:02:15.550> before<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:16.000> do<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.930> then<00:02:17.710> the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
whole operation before I do it then the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.680 
whole operation before I do it then the
operation<00:02:18.370> almost<00:02:18.670> invariably<00:02:19.240> goes<00:02:19.480> very

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
operation almost invariably goes very

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.840 
operation almost invariably goes very
well<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.650> this<00:02:20.800> kind<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.190> image<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.580> really

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
well and this kind of image it really

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.310 
well and this kind of image it really
helps<00:02:22.150> helps<00:02:22.690> me<00:02:22.840> do<00:02:23.020> that

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
helps helps me do that

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.020 
helps helps me do that
