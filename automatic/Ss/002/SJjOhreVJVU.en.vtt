00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello everyone my name jose only 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.960
 and this is going to be a quick guide for 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.800
 start with guitar and lincoln let's 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.210
 use the player version for free 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.890
 although it is limited in the number of 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.689
 particular component has only 23 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.580
 that are more than enough to 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.039
 practice especially if you're starting 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.160
 and use it as a simple amplifier 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.650
 virtual 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.960
 good to know the first step would be 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.530
 set the audio 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.440
 for this we go to the audio menu 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.440
 2007 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.770
 and here we select the sound driver 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.260
 either an empty type 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.120
 for example, they were or another of a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.180
 external usb interface that you have 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.980
 installed 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.240
 otherwise we choose those of the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.750
 sound card 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.880
 is integrated in the pc 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.720
 down here we can see the sum of 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.030
 delay that the signal suffers 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.400
 or what is the same latency and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.430
 we have the possibility 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.990
 to adjust it 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.890
 Now if you have the guitar connected 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.900
 it should ring 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.380
 and here in the general bar of the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.090
 Headboard 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.090
 we have a monitor of the signal of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.369
 entrance and another one of the exit 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.359
 the idea would be that by playing loudly the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.159
 guitar both input and output 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:34.300
 were near the red zone but 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.050
 without touching her 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.050
 not to saturate 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.900
 here we also have a noise door 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.100
 to eliminate background buzz 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.620
 below the level 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.940
 Adjustment of this button 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.940
 we can also turn it off 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.290
 this indicator shows us the percentage 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.910
 performance of the cpu 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.000
 and we can activate and deactivate the 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.780
 processed signal process as well as 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.780
 increase the quality 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.590
 It does not allow it 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.650
 and now we're going with the main part of 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.350
 program the rack 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.120
 is this area on the right 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.110
 and this is where I point out the components 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.550
 that will process my sound 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.920
 and where we will have a representation 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.010
 visual of 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.879
 of these elements 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.879
 the sound chain 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.150
 we have a series of components that are 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.280
 fixed and we can hide and visualize 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.130
 using the buttons on this bar 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.670
 tools 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.180
 we have the fixed component 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.849
 after they go to the beginning of the king 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.489
 before all the aspects and other three 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.030
 that went to the end after all the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.030
 effects 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.070
 at the beginning we have a pre-recorder 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.070
 player 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.790
 a tuner 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.540
 and a metronome 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.640
 after the effects set use the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.370
 final 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.410
 we have a volume of that life 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.010
 a post recorder player 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.480
 and the master fx serves to add effects 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.480
 at the end of the rack block 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.680
 now we go with the side section 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.890
 left 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.130
 in this section 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.340
 different contents are shown according to 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.310
 the button that we have active 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.060
 well present components 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.060
 options 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.700
 let's see how it would be configured 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.890
 manually the rack 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.819
 having components 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.970
 from this section 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.200
 for this we are going to components 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.150
 and categories 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.150
 to begin we will add an amplifier 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.260
 we drag and drop 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.110
 we can see includes a head and a 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.110
 two speakers screen 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.650
 now for example we incorporate a 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.650
 distortion in front of the amplifier 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.590
 we drag and drop in front 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.590
 here the top 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.210
 and finally we insert a river 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.840
 that we will place after the 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.840
 amplifier 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.760
 now we would have to adjust each 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.000
 component according to our preferences 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.740
 every time we play the guitar 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.740
 and checking the result 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.969
 as you can see each component has 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.009
 three buttons on the right 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.900
 It's time to control the ignition and 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.650
 off 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.040
 this minimizes or more similar component 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.190
 and this unfolds or folds the societies 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.130
 advanced of each 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.760
 also the king himself there are two buttons 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.230
 one to minimize and maximize all 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:17.110
 block components 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.110
 and another to eliminate them all 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.140
 the other way of operating with the rack and of 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.490
 add components using the 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.130
 present 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.660
 which are sets of effects that already 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.900
 are configured and saved 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.780
 if we activate the button dam 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.020
 we will see a list of categories 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.639
 in which they are organized 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.470
 For example, we have amplifiers 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.000
 guitar bass amps 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.000
 songs styles 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.689
 when selecting a category for example 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:57.300
 style in the column on the right we 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:00.270
 subcategories appear 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.810
 in this case the styles available 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.990
 to select a style 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.090
 metal for example 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.409
 in the lower list we see all the 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.319
 presets that includes that category 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:16.150
 these would be all the prices of the 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.870
 version but 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.830
 but you are using the player version 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.020
 some of us have it marked as demo 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.140
 indicates that they would only work for 30 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.140
 minutes 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.080
 if we want to deactivate it, we would go to 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:40.380
 options and we would put in og 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:43.020
 the option to show the content of 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.560
 now we would simply see the prices 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.560
 free 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.940
 to charge a pressure 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:54.740
 we would double click on him 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.889
 and all its components will appear 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.840
 ready to use 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:04.020
 we can also save preset 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.400
 well from a manual composition 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.080
 or from a modified prisoner 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.970
 once we have the rack configured 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.300
 and we have adjusted the controls to our 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.390
 taste 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.210
 we can save it 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.700
 for example this 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.270
 how 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.270
 we give the name 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.349
 and we would give to save 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:33.240
 now the same category appears and 

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:33.240
 marked as user presets
