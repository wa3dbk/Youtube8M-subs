00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
so what we do we take one of these
stickers<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.680> pop<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.980> onto<00:00:53.219> the

stickers and we just pop it onto the
back<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.699> device<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:56.100> stretch

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
back of the device and then we stretch

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.619 
back of the device and then we stretch
this<00:00:57.000> cover<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> goes<00:00:58.050> over<00:00:59.629> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
this cover so that it goes over the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.049 
this cover so that it goes over the
device<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.199> our<00:01:01.859> phone<00:01:02.219> will<00:01:02.370> sit<00:01:02.550> inside<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
device and our phone will sit inside it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.789 
device and our phone will sit inside it
now<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.750> might<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.229> yourself<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
now you might think to yourself this is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.830 
now you might think to yourself this is
a<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.280> fiddly<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.360> can't<00:01:06.630> risk

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
a little bit fiddly you can't risk

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
a little bit fiddly you can't risk
tearing<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.250> plastic<00:01:08.700> bag<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030

actually quite durable so let's get this

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.039 
actually quite durable so let's get this
into<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.180> does<00:01:15.420> take<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.810> bit<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
into here it does take a little bit of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.510 
into here it does take a little bit of
fiddling<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.670> bit<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:19.200> oops<00:01:20.159> I'm

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

possible<00:02:03.330> all<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.170> way<00:02:04.289> around<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> device

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
possible all the way around the device

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.570 
possible all the way around the device
if<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> easiest<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.550> the

world<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.030> admittedly<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.900> take

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
world to do admittedly and then you take

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.570 
world to do admittedly and then you take
one<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.350> these<00:02:16.440> sealing<00:02:16.890> strips<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.370> back

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
one of these sealing strips on the back

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.470 
one of these sealing strips on the back
and<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.390> seal<00:02:18.630> up<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.900> hole<00:02:20.239> now<00:02:21.239> bear<00:02:21.450> in

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and you seal up that hole now bear in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.850 
and you seal up that hole now bear in
mind<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.840> depending<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.380> which<00:02:22.500> way<00:02:22.650> around

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
mind that depending on which way around

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.070 
mind that depending on which way around
you've<00:02:23.010> popped<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.840> going<00:02:24.989> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
you've popped this on it is going to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.020 
you've popped this on it is going to
cover<00:02:25.319> up<00:02:25.530> or<00:02:26.160> make<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.519> camera<00:02:26.730> slightly

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
cover up or make the camera slightly

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.449 
cover up or make the camera slightly
more<00:02:27.209> difficult<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.750> use<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:28.350> what<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.250> then

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
more difficult to use but what you then

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.820 
more difficult to use but what you then

about<00:02:43.650> getting<00:02:43.799> moisture<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.400> there<00:02:44.579> like<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
about getting moisture in there like I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.259 
about getting moisture in there like I
say<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.230> use<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.709> indicator<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.760> if

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
say you can use this indicator and if

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.660 
say you can use this indicator and if
when<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.900> first<00:02:49.109> go<00:02:49.290> near<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.070> source<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.489> water

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
when you first go near a source of water

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.410 
when you first go near a source of water
this<00:02:51.299> terms<00:02:52.079> changes<00:02:52.890> color<00:02:53.100> then<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:54.000> know

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
this terms changes color then you know

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.699 
this terms changes color then you know
that<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> seal<00:02:54.900> hasn't<00:02:55.290> been<00:02:55.440> good<00:02:55.560> enough

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that the seal hasn't been good enough

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.229 
that the seal hasn't been good enough
and<00:02:56.100> you'll<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.640> again<00:02:56.880> take<00:02:57.090> it

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
and you'll have to do it again take it

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.000 
and you'll have to do it again take it
back<00:02:57.359> out<00:02:57.510> now<00:02:58.019> they<00:02:58.260> reckon<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.799> can

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
back out now they reckon that you can

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.530 
back out now they reckon that you can
use<00:02:59.310> each<00:02:59.489> one<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.760> these<00:02:59.880> bags<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.209> couple<00:03:00.480> of

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
use each one of these bags a couple of

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.080 
use each one of these bags a couple of
times<00:03:00.780> which<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.290> why<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.470> get<00:03:01.739> two<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.970> each

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
times which is why you get two in each

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.699 
times which is why you get two in each
packet<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.570> get<00:03:03.690> two<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.900> these<00:03:04.140> covers

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
packet you get two of these covers

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.229 
packet you get two of these covers
that's<00:03:05.010> not<00:03:05.100> good<00:03:05.250> enough<00:03:05.400> for<00:03:05.459> four<00:03:05.850> uses

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
that's not good enough for four uses

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.890 
that's not good enough for four uses
basically<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.930> four<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.950> these<00:03:08.280> sealing<00:03:08.900> tabs

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
basically and four of these sealing tabs

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and four of the water indicators and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.069 
and four of the water indicators and
