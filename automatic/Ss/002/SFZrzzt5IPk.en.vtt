00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
amazed when they came up with such a

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.920 
amazed when they came up with such a
brilliant<00:01:51.560> idea<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.310> taking<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.450> remote<00:01:53.780> and

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
brilliant idea of taking the remote and

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.230 
brilliant idea of taking the remote and
making<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.740> your<00:01:54.860> skateboard<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.790> he<00:01:56.000> turned

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
making it your skateboard and he turned

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.960 
making it your skateboard and he turned
it<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.450> turn<00:01:56.840> back<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.830> manual<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.520> then

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
it to turn back to manual and then

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.640 
it to turn back to manual and then
everything<00:01:59.420> from<00:01:59.600> there<00:01:59.750> it's<00:02:00.170> almost<00:02:00.350> like

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
everything from there it's almost like

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.499 
everything from there it's almost like
the<00:02:00.770> finger<00:02:01.040> boards<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.430> we<00:02:01.550> play<00:02:01.729> with<00:02:01.970> same

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
the finger boards that we play with same

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.810 
the finger boards that we play with same
idea<00:02:02.890> we<00:02:03.890> actually<00:02:04.250> work<00:02:04.460> with<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.670> company

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
idea we actually work with a company

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.540 
idea we actually work with a company
called<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.509> live<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.160> added<00:02:07.520> so

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
called a I live and that is added so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.130 
called a I live and that is added so
much<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.090> us<00:02:08.270> because<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:08.720> actually<00:02:08.869> has<00:02:09.110> a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
much to us because it actually has a

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.320 
much to us because it actually has a
memory<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.800> learns<00:02:10.009> how<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.340> play<00:02:10.759> so<00:02:11.180> it's

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
memory and learns how you play so it's

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.910 
memory and learns how you play so it's
going<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.510> learn<00:02:11.690> what<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.050> want<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.380> do<00:02:12.500> and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
going to learn what you want to do and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.590 
going to learn what you want to do and
what<00:02:13.040> you're<00:02:13.190> trying<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.580> do<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.850> that's<00:02:14.420> of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
what you're trying to do and that's of

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.430 
what you're trying to do and that's of
that<00:02:15.370> it's<00:02:16.370> very<00:02:16.880> immediate<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:17.930> when<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.170> pop

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
that it's very immediate so when you pop

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.590 
that it's very immediate so when you pop
an<00:02:18.620> ollie<00:02:18.709> your<00:02:19.520> guy<00:02:19.670> pops<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.120> all<00:02:20.209> right

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
an ollie your guy pops in all right

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.120 
an ollie your guy pops in all right
along<00:02:20.810> with<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.110> doesn't<00:02:21.590> feel<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> whole<00:02:22.040> lot

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
along with you doesn't feel a whole lot

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.940 
along with you doesn't feel a whole lot

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.460 
okay it looks like a skateboard we have
to<00:02:40.790> figure<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.180> out<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:41.959> we've<00:02:42.110> had<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.410> for

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
to figure that out so we've had that for

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.590 
to figure that out so we've had that for
about<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.860> month<00:02:43.070> now<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.580> we've<00:02:44.120> already<00:02:44.330> got

an<00:03:54.340> idea<00:03:54.730> for<00:03:54.910> something<00:03:54.940> totally<00:03:55.540> different
