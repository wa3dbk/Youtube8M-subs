 good evening to all you will have understood we are in Abidjan in Ivory Coast 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.380
 for a special page dedicated to Disability Prevention Week 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.720
 renal a week organized by the kalou foundation 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.380
 today in Ivory Coast kidney diseases are taking 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.150
 disturbing proportions 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.780
 and for the treatment of kidney failure there are only three centers 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.230
 hemodialysis above abidjan also acted cocody yopougon and very safe 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.850
 she knows that some private centers ready custom 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.909
 care is therefore still the major problem in the fight against 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.800
 disease 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.869
 General kidney disease are well supported 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.470
 Sadly 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 most often these diseases lead to kidney failure 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.460
 at this level we have a lot of problems and support 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.070
 Heidfeld 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.460
 especially in dialysis since only 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.580
 pusan of our patients 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.260
 barely kidney failure 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.070
 benefits from dialysis 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.720
 it's huge and you have to fill that gap 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.490
 and to fill this void it is essential to create dialysis centers 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.490
 and have the ability to make them work 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.079

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.099
 go to 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.269
 our difficulty of men 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.069
 can not dream better how does it feel like supporting this disease 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.579
 and therefore the association's mission is to mobilize the means 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.439
 and become themselves 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.789
