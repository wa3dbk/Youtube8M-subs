00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.790 

the<00:00:26.910> pancreas<00:00:28.760> is<00:00:29.900> an<00:00:30.900> organ<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.439> upper

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the pancreas is an organ in the upper

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.500 
the pancreas is an organ in the upper
abdomen<00:00:33.410> which<00:00:35.630> has<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> shape<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:38.510> goes

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
abdomen which has a shape that goes

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.880 
abdomen which has a shape that goes
across<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.110> upper<00:00:40.620> abdomen<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:42.559> and

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.720 

this<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.949> to<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.150> right<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.730> human

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
this is to the the right of the human

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.439 
this is to the the right of the human
body<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.080> the<00:00:52.199> left<00:00:54.650> so<00:00:56.449> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
body and this is to the left so the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.860 
body and this is to the left so the
division<00:00:58.019> of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.199> pancreas<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.269> and<00:01:00.269> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
division of the pancreas is it and the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.080 
division of the pancreas is it and the
head<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:02.610> neck<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.860> body<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:07.049> tail<00:01:08.090> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
head the neck the body and the tail the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.490 
head the neck the body and the tail the
spleen<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.690> present<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:11.159> here

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.860 

so<00:01:16.100> these<00:01:16.250> are<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.520> divisions<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.120> the

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
so these are the divisions of the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.450 
so these are the divisions of the
pancreas<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:20.330> when<00:01:20.780> we<00:01:20.900> have<00:01:20.930> tumors<00:01:21.590> or

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
pancreas and when we have tumors or

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.870 
pancreas and when we have tumors or
malignancies<00:01:23.620> in<00:01:24.620> different<00:01:25.250> parts<00:01:25.430> this

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
malignancies in different parts this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.210 
malignancies in different parts this
allows<00:01:26.210> us<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:27.140> communicate<00:01:27.380> with<00:01:27.890> each<00:01:27.920> other

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
allows us to communicate with each other

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.300 
allows us to communicate with each other
as<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.060> location<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.810> these<00:01:30.440> tumors<00:01:31.130> or

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
as to the location of these tumors or

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.359 
as to the location of these tumors or
malignancies<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:34.840> pancreas<00:01:36.250> has<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.580> large

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
malignancies the pancreas has a large

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:46.020 
malignancies the pancreas has a large
duct

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.420 

that<00:01:46.570> looks<00:01:46.780> something<00:01:47.020> like<00:01:47.140> this

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.180 

and<00:01:52.550> this<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:53.510> duct<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.960> called<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.520> worsen

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
and this this duct is called the worsen

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.770 
and this this duct is called the worsen
worsened<00:01:58.190> duct<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:01.280> common<00:02:02.030> bile<00:02:02.240> duct<00:02:02.540> has

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
worsened duct the common bile duct has

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.050 
worsened duct the common bile duct has
an<00:02:02.930> intra<00:02:03.260> pancreatic<00:02:03.890> portion<00:02:06.460> which<00:02:07.460> joins

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
an intra pancreatic portion which joins

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.790 
an intra pancreatic portion which joins
to<00:02:08.899> form<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.289> common<00:02:09.560> channel<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:11.500> this<00:02:12.500> this

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
to form a common channel and this this

superior mesenteric vein they join

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.550 
superior mesenteric vein they join
together<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.510> form<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.950> portal<00:05:17.490> vein<00:05:18.560> this

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
together to form the portal vein this

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.650 
together to form the portal vein this
becomes<00:05:19.920> important<00:05:20.550> when<00:05:20.640> doing<00:05:20.910> pancreatic
