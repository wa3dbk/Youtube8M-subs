00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:14.949
 The set-top box my computer screen that rely on being connected to the Internet 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:20.080
 After saying that you can commit suicide without a distant TV and say something like this 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.750
 Connection is also possible with the dvi terminal hdmi for connecting to the screen 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.580
 Sound sweater 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:30.590
 usb turn lan cable it is usp what to use 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:36.290
 This is if it is the Internet re-connected to the remote house that will be explained later 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:40.520
 Connect the lan cable it only in your PC screen is dedicating to TV 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.740
 You can beat jass via TV 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.070
 now 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:48.150
 It is spread throughout the internet 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.230
 It's a long half I personal computer use people in the senior layer 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.840
 So even if you put a PC 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.890
 I can not use it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.920
 If there are such people living nearby, I will tell you every day and explain how to use it 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.440
 But it is impossible when it is apart 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.760
 It is convenient to use at this time. If you use this, you will gradually get used to the computer 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.090
 You can get 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:17.330
 Or a net shopping First What a fit screen out the screen of your PC 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.880
 Or show the photos or kneading a trip plan 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.479
 Well call 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.430
 It is an operation while looking at the screen with each other in the feeling whether you want to buy something or something while talking in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.850
 Only it is carried out in here 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.070
 Toka Do good here of clothes in the analyst is a good color is better left 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.760
 I bought because travel anywhere is good not just are you Ah this number 5 is good I go up hit this 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.979
 The 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:46.450
 I'm going to operate while listening to something Well operate the personal computer while watching the TV screen with this 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.450
 While even while watching it screen that is moving your computer talk but not 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.990
 I think first and wonder if the first step of the that can be rotated 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.140
 Next, when you want to send a photo, when you want to give a printed copy 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.090
 I will print it out here 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:07.580
 There is a port of the description of usb this wine also send by mail 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:12.769
 If a printer is connected here, ordinary documents will be printed if you use a PC temporary 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.980
 As it comes out of printer of Oita of photograph younger brother day, we can see immediately 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.819
 Is the second stage 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.719
 It's the third stage This is a breakthrough 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.170
 Connect keyboard and mouse to this usb 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:31.530
 Then you can operate the computer from here on the other hand 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.249
 So, in the third step, operate the PC while looking at each other, and this will help you improve your usage of the PC 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.810
 Come 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:43.630
 I'll finally give you a real PC on the other side 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.440
 It's like this way, so if it's over there, it's more than this garbage, or something like that 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.569
 It is not 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.790
 I can still use it 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:55.850
 Place a computer at Grandpa and connect Dairyu to this TV 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:02.510
 On the contrary, what can you do with the source to be connected from the other side? 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:04.080
 If you do not know the fourth step , connect the mouse and keyboard 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.880
 I will destroy 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:12.320
 I can do something like move it while explaining it over the phone 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:19.210
 So don't use it for the first time just try operating here 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:39.200
 Next, have the printer and printer perform simple operations for printing with the other mouse and keyboard 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:45.000
 So'm akie and women when they are no longer genuine Pakon Gangwon 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.170
 It is a breakthrough that can be used all the time because I get it back and leave it in my own house 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.330
 Hmm 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:56.489

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:03.780

 Entrance that made the product 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.520
 It is only the postage 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.560
 10,002 of thousands in some cases from this only in turning 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.010
 About 150,000 exposed roads 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.100
