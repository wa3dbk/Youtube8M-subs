now one gripe I do have room is that
when<00:01:57.970> he<00:01:58.030> sent<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.390> me<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.780> was<00:01:58.899> in<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.380> box

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
when he sent it to me it was in a box

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.490 
when he sent it to me it was in a box
just<00:01:59.979> butt-naked<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.509> if<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.899> think<00:02:02.229> if<00:02:02.350> he<00:02:02.469> had

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
just butt-naked so if I think if he had

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.350 
just butt-naked so if I think if he had
sent<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.100> me<00:02:03.219> with<00:02:03.250> some<00:02:03.729> kind<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.119> plastic

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
sent it to me with some kind of plastic

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.240 
sent it to me with some kind of plastic
wrapping<00:02:04.990> around<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.439> or<00:02:05.590> some<00:02:05.920> bubble<00:02:06.219> wrap

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
wrapping around it or some bubble wrap

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.859 
wrapping around it or some bubble wrap
or<00:02:06.549> something<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:07.119> paint<00:02:07.360> would<00:02:07.540> have<00:02:07.689> come

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
or something the paint would have come

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.569 
or something the paint would have come
off<00:02:08.019> over<00:02:08.320> here<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.709> could<00:02:08.979> just<00:02:09.160> touch<00:02:09.340> that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 
off over here so I could just touch that

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.640 
off over here so I could just touch that
up<00:02:09.729> it's<00:02:09.940> not<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.119> big<00:02:10.179> deal<00:02:10.570> at<00:02:10.750> all<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:11.530> how

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
up it's not a big deal at all like how

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.110 
up it's not a big deal at all like how
the<00:02:11.709> I<00:02:11.920> came<00:02:12.250> out<00:02:12.400> over<00:02:12.640> here<00:02:12.790> which<00:02:12.940> i<00:02:13.090> think

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the I came out over here which i think

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.990 
the I came out over here which i think
is<00:02:13.480> pretty<00:02:13.630> much<00:02:13.810> how<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.530> lizard<00:02:14.920> looks<00:02:15.670> all

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
is pretty much how the lizard looks all

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.520 
is pretty much how the lizard looks all
by<00:02:16.150> itself<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.780> know<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.019> mouth<00:02:17.260> is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
by itself and I know the mouth is

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.440 
by itself and I know the mouth is
already<00:02:17.739> like<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.670> lizard<00:02:19.030> figure

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
already like that for the lizard figure

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.449 
already like that for the lizard figure
but<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.140> like<00:02:20.440> how<00:02:20.530> he<00:02:20.590> sculpted<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.130> beak<00:02:21.340> and

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
but I like how he sculpted the beak and

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.490 
but I like how he sculpted the beak and
the<00:02:21.579> horn<00:02:21.820> on<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.120> guy<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.600> really<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.350> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the horn on this guy I really have to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.710 
the horn on this guy I really have to
commend<00:02:23.590> his<00:02:23.920> work<00:02:24.130> over<00:02:24.280> here<00:02:24.459> because<00:02:25.390> even

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
commend his work over here because even

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.030 
commend his work over here because even
though<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:25.959> looks<00:02:26.019> a<00:02:26.260> little<00:02:26.350> globby<00:02:26.769> right

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
though this looks a little globby right

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.740 
though this looks a little globby right
here<00:02:27.340> he<00:02:27.699> did<00:02:27.910> keep<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.329> wrist<00:02:28.540> articulation

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
here he did keep the wrist articulation

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.220 
here he did keep the wrist articulation
over<00:02:29.500> here<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:29.949> I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
over here so I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.290 
over here so I
think<00:02:30.349> that<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.680> fantastic<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.849> think<00:02:32.150> that's

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
think that is fantastic I think that's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.149 
think that is fantastic I think that's
really<00:02:32.480> cool<00:02:32.750> then<00:02:33.230> some<00:02:33.500> parts<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.890> could

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
really cool then some parts you could

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.220 
really cool then some parts you could
see<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.700> niala<00:02:35.209> swing<00:02:35.450> color<00:02:35.720> coming<00:02:36.110> out

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
see the niala swing color coming out

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.780 
see the niala swing color coming out
underneath<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.129> looks<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.489> paint

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
underneath and it looks like paint

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.280 
underneath and it looks like paint
shading<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.299> I<00:02:38.330> really<00:02:38.599> like<00:02:38.810> how<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.110> just

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
shading so I really like how that just

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.470 
shading so I really like how that just
naturally<00:02:39.500> came<00:02:40.069> through<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.760> think<00:02:41.299> that's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
naturally came through I think that's

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.520 
naturally came through I think that's
very<00:02:41.599> very<00:02:41.840> cool

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
very very cool

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.710 
very very cool
I<00:02:42.560> like<00:02:42.920> how<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.099> scaled<00:02:43.519> lizard<00:02:44.000> sculpt

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
I like how the scaled lizard sculpt

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.690 
I like how the scaled lizard sculpt
looks<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.440> know<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.159> pants<00:02:46.549> I<00:02:46.640> don't

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
looks you know in the pants I don't

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.369 
looks you know in the pants I don't
think<00:02:47.060> he<00:02:47.180> did<00:02:47.360> anything<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> pants<00:02:48.290> I'm

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
think he did anything to the pants I'm

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.570 
think he did anything to the pants I'm
not<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> hundred<00:02:48.799> percent<00:02:48.920> sure<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.549> I

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
not a hundred percent sure on that I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.280 
not a hundred percent sure on that I
don't<00:02:49.700> have<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.299> ultimate<00:02:50.569> lizard<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.140> don't

really<00:02:51.410> care<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.860> have<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.190> but<00:02:52.879> I<00:02:52.910> still<00:02:53.239> like

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
really care to have it but I still like

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.509 
really care to have it but I still like
how<00:02:53.629> this<00:02:53.810> looks<00:02:54.110> looks<00:02:54.530> very<00:02:54.769> very<00:02:54.950> good

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
here's a look at the back of the figure

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.640 
here's a look at the back of the figure
over<00:03:11.060> here<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.900> can<00:03:12.019> see<00:03:12.200> what<00:03:12.349> he<00:03:12.410> did

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.530 
over here and you can see what he did
with<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.890> tail<00:03:13.129> so<00:03:13.459> he<00:03:13.489> sculpted<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.269> thing

on<00:04:56.730> a<00:04:56.760> flight<00:04:57.090> standard<00:04:57.690> this<00:04:57.810> is<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.140> little<00:04:58.560> on

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
on a flight standard this is a little on

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.380 
on a flight standard this is a little on
the<00:04:58.740> tricky<00:04:59.040> side<00:04:59.220> because<00:04:59.700> there's<00:04:59.850> no<00:05:00.060> whole

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
the tricky side because there's no whole

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.030 
the tricky side because there's no whole
peg<00:05:00.660> or<00:05:00.840> anything<00:05:01.020> like<00:05:01.230> that<00:05:01.260> but<00:05:01.680> it's<00:05:01.860> not<00:05:01.920> a

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
peg or anything like that but it's not a

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.040 
peg or anything like that but it's not a
big<00:05:02.220> deal<00:05:02.370> just<00:05:02.430> get<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.730> rubber<00:05:02.940> band<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.570> wrap

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
big deal just get a rubber band and wrap

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.840 
big deal just get a rubber band and wrap
it<00:05:04.260> around<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.740> displaced<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.760> then

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
it around the displaced and and then

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.060 
it around the displaced and and then
it'll<00:05:06.030> be<00:05:06.150> set<00:05:06.690> so<00:05:07.230> I'll<00:05:07.380> show<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.620> off<00:05:07.920> at

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
it'll be set so I'll show that off at

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.200 
it'll be set so I'll show that off at
the<00:05:08.190> end<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.520> video<00:05:08.790> though<00:05:09.000> in<00:05:09.120> the

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
the end of the video though in the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.480 
the end of the video though in the
pictures<00:05:09.540> so<00:05:10.140> with<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.440> horn<00:05:10.740> he<00:05:10.980> stands<00:05:11.310> out

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
pictures so with the horn he stands out

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.160 
pictures so with the horn he stands out
about<00:05:11.700> just<00:05:12.150> under<00:05:12.330> eight<00:05:12.600> inches<00:05:12.900> taller

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
about just under eight inches taller

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.660 
about just under eight inches taller
something<00:05:13.590> like<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:13.980> just<00:05:14.010> going<00:05:14.490> by<00:05:14.640> the

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
something like that just going by the

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.920 
something like that just going by the
top<00:05:14.880> of<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.060> head<00:05:15.180> it's<00:05:15.300> about<00:05:15.450> seven<00:05:15.750> inches

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
top of the head it's about seven inches

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.500 
top of the head it's about seven inches
tall<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:16.170> I<00:05:16.350> think<00:05:16.530> that's<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.800> good<00:05:16.950> height<00:05:17.510> and

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
tall so I think that's a good height and

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.780 
tall so I think that's a good height and
here<00:05:18.660> he<00:05:18.750> is<00:05:18.780> standing<00:05:19.170> next<00:05:19.320> to<00:05:19.500> kazar<00:05:20.250> Zabu

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
here he is standing next to kazar Zabu

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.030 
here he is standing next to kazar Zabu
and<00:05:21.060> Seana<00:05:21.510> so<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.050> think<00:05:22.470> they<00:05:22.560> look<00:05:22.800> worked

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
and Seana so I think they look worked

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.560 
and Seana so I think they look worked
really<00:05:23.280> really<00:05:23.370> well<00:05:23.610> with<00:05:23.850> regular-sized

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
really really well with regular-sized

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.760 
really really well with regular-sized
figures<00:05:24.900> as<00:05:25.050> you<00:05:25.170> know<00:05:25.350> this<00:05:25.560> guy<00:05:25.710> is

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
figures as you know this guy is

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.610 
figures as you know this guy is
basically<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.310> SHIELD<00:05:26.700> agent<00:05:26.850> body<00:05:27.600> so<00:05:28.350> I<00:05:28.380> think

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
basically a SHIELD agent body so I think

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.280 
basically a SHIELD agent body so I think
that<00:05:29.010> height<00:05:29.280> works<00:05:29.640> really<00:05:30.060> really<00:05:30.180> well<00:05:30.480> so

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
that height works really really well so

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.030 
that height works really really well so
