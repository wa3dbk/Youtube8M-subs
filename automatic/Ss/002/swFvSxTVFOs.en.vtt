00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.009
 for their opening games 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.150
 the delegates vote 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.240
 loud 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.240
 Belm 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.879
 what is going on people first again your Max CIO de Gaming and their image 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.349
 Protect safety 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.580
 the idea you saw it is a gas customer and that's why they have 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.719
 not or do you just do not make the ripcord yes that you can yes 

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.329
 Actually joining forces always counts as a master 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.659
 but of course I'm glad it's good to be allowed to do it again and I want to 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.150
 of course, at the beginning first 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.030
 this was thanks in addition to Pakistan 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.160
 Vinegar Minor could give something of a chance to become somewhat better known 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.370
 to live more 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.720
 and calling processes will also determine if and how often they are far more important 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.569
 a concert on the fun though 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.889
 Well, Shell owe it to you that is that under her the opera La 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:50.279
 Frontera is definitely following the opera "Lear" 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.540
 So today I do not like to imagine something the video but before that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.970
 I would like to bring you some more about SG texts about yourself 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.429
 is a chic multiply the best job in the world 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.380
 one of my favorite city actually 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.350
 and would 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.369
 that is what i can say is that his dad is always spending some extra time in 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.110
 houses of Parliament 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.579
 I have the files 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.680
 14 with formats 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.590
 and old are true if I'm not all right what we did or 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 pull us 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.579
 and on it 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.840
 is still if place but well 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.920
 then I have as a driver if full professional pro 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.550
 Pound less per 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.960
 in Provence just because I was annoyed what exactly that could 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.160
 all are distributed and of course happy if he stops by but 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.980
 of course, the Eurofighter 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.230
 Of course we did not like that, of course you can not pass that one can 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.300
 He also closes when one counts one and one 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.310
 I said that from the beginning of the video and I repeat myself 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 but that's what I know about it 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.799
 is now also because she did not know a topic and sees it here 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.220
 String stacks through so 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.270
 important to researchers today 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.470
 what do I have Max of Max Göldi Gaming as certainly charming of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.480
 mentioned 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.310
 You can not all be exclusive about purchases Juti percent 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.119
 Act but I will too 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.830
 or I invite others too 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.370
 Spilok is far too late but they are not there yet where I still have 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.619
 Passed by land because when Belka Dreibus comes because moment I have not 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.489
 the accomplice Rech have enough money coming in 1 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.429
 and but 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.429
 I do not want it where as many as it is because I played 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.199
 Not so often games in the morning jewelry Polittalks the educational game I 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.039
 Also like Manner &amp; Comp YouTube one and FPK 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.229
 the damn taste addressed because I also invite in the title fights 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.879
 high with the colleague of mine polished up Schubert 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.409
 even better known 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.260
 then I'll load something easily and I could if you want 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.350
 it is clear Reto 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.809
 but well, it's always so important to me to argue 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.619
 Of course my main focus is on Court 2 titles that's me too 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.669
 a cool guy track accomplices so dapd 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.529
 do you come to me Kolev gives that can some close 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.239
 yes that's it 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.319
 Jettmar mixes with what Hunsrück is all about 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:58.680
 15 years young and I've been doing this for about two months now 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:59.889
 but unfortunately that was the case 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.889
 four weeks that is unfortunately not quite enough and four weeks vacation 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.659
 and that's why not so many videos are now uploaded on one channel 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.889
 were 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.319
 yet up to 24 12 12 players shopper his copyrights against copyright 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.279
 had broken 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.499
 and I can do it quite well his scenes both left the fourth part 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.909
 She did not think it was exaggerated, so it still existed 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:21.979
 fought for 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.489
 and the world of the show business of the managers does not go out but you will be in 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.239
 Course of the game to see everything 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.009
 since i come from Essen this is a very nice city 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:35.969
 but where exactly I come from stork I do not say I'm going to high school and I'm 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.249
 I should also be interested in the wrong word at school wrong i should 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.249
 do not think so, but now it does not matter 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.539
 So the gameplay is chic then 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.180
 but that is not further than sometimes 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.289
 then I invite 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:51.459
 as I said I get a lot but not 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.539
 only the normal cup-coup with highest 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:57.029
 Live commented and that's something special a channel 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.880
 Lotte does not easily come up very high 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.109
 with class suppose I can say question in blue Facebook is buzzing 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.799
 or instead of him with the comments 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.979
 the classroom comes to use solves 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.539
 the master men comes height and thus directly the first thing played 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:17.249
 but so who would not take such a culprit plays first time does not say 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:19.640
 I can not take that badly and so 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.990
 I'm not that kind of person if people are the first choice 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.330
 I find it in the other little funny man approaching Markus Riesterer or 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.479
 the playful frequencies 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.139
 I think that's good 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.139
 and so are actually pretty much at the bottom of me 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.879
 Ideas come now announcing you miss what money left No you 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.590
 now here 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.620
 15 crew or rice Schopper of the parties have 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.810
 I do not have a show full of music Dr unfortunately the paper will come with it 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.930
 Safety already Misik the background that also what other channel 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:53.469
 what you know, I do not know any that I always win in the background 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.499
 Music I use drives my argument a few more ceded 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:58.249
 Subscribers also reasonably 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.370
 so the kings suggest which 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.620
 I will also use the descriptions for the descriptions of victory 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.059
 concrete face Maximin was in Trier 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:09.229
 but I kept making it louder 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.440
 Music but so that one still understands a computer 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.189
 is of course in the foreground because I'm also income falls down 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.779
 on 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.830
 the music goes 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.960
 Yakin Lemke already sees that I'm on the atomic bomb player and the chauffeur 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.470
 her luggage is a year ago what can I do now I can anticipate 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.029
 takes 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.830
 now happig 23 now 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.159
 and how many more two and I seats at home that gives tailwind should he 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.539
 plays have so 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.289
 first new plans exactly 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.699
 it's at home and I'm very tense because she thought oh that was it 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.470
 Television knows him very bad and nato-bomber Bohmann No the SPD through 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.710
 the atomic bomb is com 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.020
 there is no mast in order but it was still seeing Capgemini properly 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.250
 already in points Windhose 200 artist Michael Scriba and there I was already 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.420
 something is still tense 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.510
 and here I felt very home direct compensation did not get any 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.360
 they were playing with that would be over then 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.150
 Beautiful with the title I'm just happy Cheerful just believe a bit 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.180
 has been so far 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.469
 and the gameplay is over now 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:09.039
 even though you come here is the mean he comes as a men's gameplay 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:09.900
 liked 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.800
 and of course I'm happy if he does not look past anyone 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.860
 a big thank you to the "Iceman" PSS had uploaded 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.729
 and I hope we'll take a look at my channel 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.139
 and then Marcus Danner says
