I'll just go get myself killed real
quick<00:02:24.390> first<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.630> have<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.810> set<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.290> have<00:02:26.770> to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
quick first I have to set it I have to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.160 
quick first I have to set it I have to
change<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.730> time<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.270> that's<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.630> mobs<00:02:28.960> will

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
change the time so that's a mobs will

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:40.860 
change the time so that's a mobs will
spawn<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:40.030> time<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.270> think<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.690> actually

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
spawn and this time I think I actually

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.250 
spawn and this time I think I actually
had<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.710> bit<00:02:41.830> more<00:02:42.190> trouble<00:02:42.910> getting<00:02:43.210> killed

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.720 

I'm<00:02:47.260> sure<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.710> probably<00:02:48.100> should<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.490> had<00:02:48.610> an

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
I'm sure I probably should have had an

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.190 
I'm sure I probably should have had an
iron<00:02:48.880> armor<00:02:49.120> or<00:02:49.360> something<00:02:49.720> or<00:02:49.900> likely

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
iron armor or something or likely

leather<00:02:50.440> armor<00:02:50.800> something<00:02:51.280> weak<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.590> don't

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
leather armor something weak but I don't

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.460
