phone big with LG staying a little bit
smaller<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.759> iPhone<00:00:15.089> 6<00:00:15.120> plus<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.630> just

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
smaller and the iPhone 6 plus is just

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.849 
smaller and the iPhone 6 plus is just
way<00:00:16.139> too<00:00:16.199> massive

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the iPhone 6 plus may seem like a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360 
the iPhone 6 plus may seem like a
fantastic<00:00:45.960> idea<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.320> Apple<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.100> already

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
fantastic idea for Apple it's already

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.770 
fantastic idea for Apple it's already
been<00:00:47.489> done<00:00:47.700> before<00:00:48.030> by<00:00:48.180> many<00:00:48.390> others<00:00:48.750> like

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
been done before by many others like

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.040 
been done before by many others like
Samsung<00:00:49.620> HTC<00:00:50.190> LG<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.180> lot<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
Samsung HTC LG and a lot more but the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.930 
Samsung HTC LG and a lot more but the
way<00:00:52.170> Apple<00:00:52.620> did<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> unlike<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> rest

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
way Apple did it is unlike for the rest

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.580 
way Apple did it is unlike for the rest
of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.149> pack<00:00:54.360> using<00:00:54.870> their<00:00:54.989> engineer<00:00:55.410> should

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
of the pack using their engineer should

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
of the pack using their engineer should
construct<00:00:55.920> yet<00:00:56.160> another<00:00:56.520> beautiful<00:00:56.940> iPhone

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
construct yet another beautiful iPhone

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
construct yet another beautiful iPhone
with<00:00:57.660> great<00:00:57.960> materials<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.010> said<00:00:59.070> both

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
with great materials but as I said both

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.160 
with great materials but as I said both
of<00:00:59.550> these<00:00:59.730> devices<00:00:59.940> take<00:01:00.390> completely

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
of these devices take completely

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.349 
of these devices take completely
different<00:01:01.590> approaches<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.250> making<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.699> phablet

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
different approaches to making a phablet

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.020 
different approaches to making a phablet
so<00:01:03.510> let's<00:01:03.719> start<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> LG<00:01:04.589> g3<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.369> g3<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so let's start with the LG g3 the g3 is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240 
so let's start with the LG g3 the g3 is
a<00:01:06.060> beautiful<00:01:06.750> device<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.320> its<00:01:07.439> own<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:08.010> but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
a beautiful device in its own right but

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.690 
a beautiful device in its own right but
the<00:01:08.340> vice<00:01:08.520> spans<00:01:08.850> 5.76<00:01:09.840> inches<00:01:10.290> tall<00:01:10.619> 2.9<00:01:11.460> 4

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the vice spans 5.76 inches tall 2.9 4

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.130 
the vice spans 5.76 inches tall 2.9 4
inches<00:01:11.939> wide<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.510> eight<00:01:12.750> point<00:01:13.080> nine

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.590 
inches wide and eight point nine
millimeters<00:01:13.860> thick<00:01:14.130> its<00:01:14.430> display<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.330> full

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
millimeters thick its display is a full

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.530 
millimeters thick its display is a full
5.5<00:01:16.530> inches<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.759> how<00:01:18.000> much<00:01:18.240> work

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
5.5 inches so you can see how much work

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.840 
5.5 inches so you can see how much work
has<00:01:18.810> done<00:01:18.990> into<00:01:19.500> keeping<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> bezels<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.610> bare

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
has done into keeping the bezels a bare

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.030 
has done into keeping the bezels a bare
minimum<00:01:21.210> also<00:01:21.750> its<00:01:21.900> display<00:01:22.320> has<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.770> pixels

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
minimum also its display has more pixels

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.120 
minimum also its display has more pixels
