a scale can you turn the scale on for us

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.590 
a scale can you turn the scale on for us
go<00:00:34.829> ahead<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.420> let<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.450> go<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> 0<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.380> then

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
go ahead and let it go to 0 and then

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.240 
go ahead and let it go to 0 and then
mature<00:00:39.600> Bowl<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.559> we're<00:00:40.770> measuring<00:00:40.980> the

ketchup is organic and from Whole Foods
and<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.860> lot<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.190> people<00:00:53.430> think<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.699> really

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and a lot of people think it's really

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
and a lot of people think it's really
healthy<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.600> organic<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
healthy because it's organic but it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.680 
healthy because it's organic but it
still<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.699> four<00:00:57.000> grams<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.390> sugar<00:00:57.629> per

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
still got four grams of sugar per

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
still got four grams of sugar per
serving<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> problem<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.340> four

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
serving but the problem with this four

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.549 
serving but the problem with this four
grams<00:01:00.449> doesn't<00:01:00.750> sound<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.109> much<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.469> don't

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
grams doesn't sound like much I don't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.260 
grams doesn't sound like much I don't
even<00:01:01.710> know<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:01.949> 4<00:01:02.160> grams<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.030> honest

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
even know what 4 grams is to be honest

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.750 
even know what 4 grams is to be honest
with<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.199> grams

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
with you because I don't think in grams

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.010 
with you because I don't think in grams
so<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:05.939> where<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.270> labels<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.900> get

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so that's where these labels can get

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.130 
so that's where these labels can get
confusing<00:01:07.580> but<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.630> did<00:01:09.840> one

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
confusing but if you just did one

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.649 
confusing but if you just did one
tablespoon<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.850> enough<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
tablespoon that's not really enough to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
tablespoon that's not really enough to
even<00:01:12.990> bother<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.409> ketchup<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.150> would

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
even bother with ketchup so you would

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.090 
even bother with ketchup so you would
have<00:01:15.360> multiply<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> by<00:01:16.140> 3<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:16.770> that's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
have multiply that by 3 because that's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.950 
have multiply that by 3 because that's
three<00:01:17.520> servings<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.390> ketchup<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:18.810> there

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
three servings of ketchup right there

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.740 
three servings of ketchup right there
and<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.200> doesn't<00:01:19.530> look<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:20.330> that<00:01:21.330> much<00:01:21.600> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and that doesn't look like that much I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.999 
and that doesn't look like that much I
would<00:01:21.900> totally<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.470> through<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.770> ketchup

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
would totally go through that ketchup

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.100 
would totally go through that ketchup
because<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.400> love<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.750> saying<00:01:25.020> not
