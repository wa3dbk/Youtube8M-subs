00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.699 
here we have the wall charger with the
plug<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.690> let's<00:02:47.930> get<00:02:48.079> all<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:48.440> out<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
plug so let's get all this out of the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.740 
plug so let's get all this out of the
way<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:49.150> take<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.360> look<00:02:50.630> at<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.049> device<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
way and take a look at the device you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:06.220 
way and take a look at the device you
get<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.079> out<00:02:57.319> here<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:59.000> says<00:02:59.150> push<00:02:59.480> up<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.959> the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
get this out here it says push up so the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.780 
get this out here it says push up so the
device<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.620> pretty<00:03:06.829> small<00:03:07.100> in<00:03:07.130> hand<00:03:07.430> it's<00:03:07.639> got

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
device is pretty small in hand it's got

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.819 
device is pretty small in hand it's got
a<00:03:07.819> small<00:03:08.239> screen<00:03:08.600> relative<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.230> newer<00:03:09.530> devices

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
a small screen relative to newer devices

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.440 
a small screen relative to newer devices
that<00:03:10.069> are<00:03:10.190> coming<00:03:10.430> out<00:03:10.519> like<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.880> touch

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
that are coming out like the touch

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.099 
that are coming out like the touch
diamond2<00:03:11.870> or<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.889> even<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.340> touch<00:03:13.519> HD<00:03:14.109> it

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
diamond2 or the even the touch HD it

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.110 
diamond2 or the even the touch HD it
feels<00:03:15.410> just<00:03:15.769> like<00:03:15.829> an<00:03:16.040> eat-in<00:03:16.340> glofish<00:03:16.790> device

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
feels just like an eat-in glofish device

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.539 
feels just like an eat-in glofish device
I<00:03:17.329> mean<00:03:17.480> if<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.630> remember<00:03:18.049> acer<00:03:18.530> bought<00:03:18.829> eaten

I mean if you remember acer bought eaten

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.069 
I mean if you remember acer bought eaten
and<00:03:19.760> they're<00:03:19.970> glofish<00:03:20.389> line<00:03:20.600> now<00:03:20.870> they're

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
and they're glofish line now they're

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.229 
and they're glofish line now they're
just<00:03:21.230> all<00:03:21.410> called<00:03:21.769> acer<00:03:22.069> devices<00:03:22.489> let's<00:03:23.090> see

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
just all called acer devices let's see

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.199 
just all called acer devices let's see
what<00:03:23.389> what's<00:03:23.810> behind<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.319> battery<00:03:25.209> well

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
what what's behind the battery well

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.400 
what what's behind the battery well
wouldn't<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.569> wouldn't<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:26.989> know<00:03:27.049> it<00:03:27.260> there

wouldn't you wouldn't you know it there
are<00:03:27.530> two<00:03:27.769> slots<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.790> sim<00:03:29.000> card<00:03:29.030> here<00:03:29.420> one

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
are two slots for the sim card here one

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.800 
are two slots for the sim card here one
here<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.959> one<00:03:30.139> here<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.850> quite<00:03:32.420> simply<00:03:32.600> you

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810

here and one here so quite simply you
put<00:03:33.079> in<00:03:33.170> your<00:03:33.260> two<00:03:33.410> sim<00:03:33.650> cards<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.760> course

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
put in your two sim cards and of course

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.979 
put in your two sim cards and of course
we're<00:03:35.060> gonna<00:03:35.180> have<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.359> talk<00:03:35.540> about<00:03:35.690> what

we're gonna have to talk about what
happens<00:03:36.410> in<00:03:36.680> terms<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.250> software<00:03:37.700> once<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.000> do

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
happens in terms of software once you do

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.479 
happens in terms of software once you do
have<00:03:38.329> two<00:03:38.510> phone<00:03:38.720> lines<00:03:38.750> on<00:03:39.170> your<00:03:39.200> device<00:03:39.560> so

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
have two phone lines on your device so

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.250 
have two phone lines on your device so
let's<00:03:40.670> get<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:41.000> back<00:03:41.209> back<00:03:41.660> on<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:42.109> take<00:03:42.230> a

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
let's get the back back on and take a

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.750 
let's get the back back on and take a
look<00:03:42.410> at<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.799> comparison<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.609> other

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
look at it in comparison to other

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.300 
look at it in comparison to other
devices<00:03:43.970> we<00:03:44.900> have<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.170> fresh<00:03:45.530> new<00:03:45.829> diamond

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
devices we have the fresh new diamond

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.370 
devices we have the fresh new diamond
too<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.660> course<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:47.989> has<00:03:48.109> a<00:03:48.139> bigger

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
too and of course this has a bigger

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.410 
too and of course this has a bigger
screen<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.190> really<00:03:49.400> shows<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.180> in

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
screen and it really shows in this in

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.470 
screen and it really shows in this in
this<00:03:50.630> view<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:52.489> DX<00:03:52.760> 900<00:03:53.359> is

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
this view and the DX 900 is

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.449 
this view and the DX 900 is
significantly<00:03:54.079> bigger<00:03:54.349> and<00:03:54.680> then<00:03:55.220> we<00:03:55.340> have

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
significantly bigger and then we have

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.229 
significantly bigger and then we have
the<00:03:55.549> big<00:03:55.730> ol<00:03:55.880> touch<00:03:56.870> HD<00:03:57.290> which<00:03:57.530> of<00:03:57.739> course<00:03:57.769> as<00:03:58.130> a

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
the big ol touch HD which of course as a

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.509 
the big ol touch HD which of course as a
massive<00:03:59.239> screen<00:03:59.620> so<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.650> lot<00:04:00.859> more<00:04:01.009> to<00:04:01.130> come<00:04:01.160> on

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
massive screen so a lot more to come on

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.460 
massive screen so a lot more to come on
the<00:04:01.639> acer<00:04:01.910> d<00:04:02.090> x<00:04:02.209> 900<00:04:02.750> we're<00:04:03.079> really<00:04:03.259> going<00:04:03.410> to

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
the acer d x 900 we're really going to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.750 
the acer d x 900 we're really going to
take<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.709> look<00:04:03.979> at<00:04:04.190> how<00:04:04.729> this<00:04:04.940> works<00:04:05.299> with
