00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
if you're on a PC then you might have to

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
but now you can go over to whatever

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.250 
but now you can go over to whatever

virtual machine you're using we'd like
VMware<00:02:19.710> fusion<00:02:19.740> I'm<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:20.760> going<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.030> go<00:02:21.150> ahead

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
VMware fusion I'm just going to go ahead

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.760 
VMware fusion I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:02:21.980> suspend<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.750> close<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
and suspend this and close out of it and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.260 
and suspend this and close out of it and
you<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:28.890> see<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.460> virtual<00:02:29.970> machines

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
you can see here the virtual machines

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.030 
you can see here the virtual machines
that<00:02:30.360> currently<00:02:30.660> have<00:02:30.840> installed<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.500> this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
that currently have installed and this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 
that currently have installed and this
is<00:02:32.160> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> differ<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.910> little<00:02:33.210> bit<00:02:33.450> based<00:02:33.690> on

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
is going to differ a little bit based on

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.500 
is going to differ a little bit based on
which<00:02:34.050> virtual<00:02:34.500> machine<00:02:35.130> you're<00:02:35.550> using<00:02:35.820> but

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
which virtual machine you're using but

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.840 
which virtual machine you're using but
basically<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:37.080> go<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.470> file<00:02:37.740> hit<00:02:38.310> new<00:02:38.550> or

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
basically just go up to file hit new or

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.900 
basically just go up to file hit new or
just<00:02:39.090> find<00:02:39.330> wherever<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.750> new<00:02:39.900> button<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.350> and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
just find wherever the new button is and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.320 
just find wherever the new button is and
then<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:42.600> whatever<00:02:42.810> option<00:02:43.350> as<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.800> do<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.850> be

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
then do whatever option as you do to be

vo<00:02:56.550> 3<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.720> 0<00:02:57.960> that's<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.860> one<00:02:58.980> we<00:02:59.160> used<00:02:59.430> and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
vo 3 is 0 that's the one we used and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.020 
vo 3 is 0 that's the one we used and
then<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.680> hit<00:03:01.860> open<00:03:02.070> now<00:03:02.790> I've

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.760 
then you can just hit open now I've
already<00:03:03.240> installed<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.440> I'm<00:03:04.500> not<00:03:04.620> going

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
already installed that so I'm not going

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.200 
already installed that so I'm not going
to<00:03:04.830> do<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.040> again<00:03:05.100> but<00:03:05.790> then<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.090> just

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
to do it again but then you can just

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.820 
to do it again but then you can just
follow<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.660> installation<00:03:06.960> instructions

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
follow the installation instructions

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.550 
follow the installation instructions
it'll<00:03:08.160> just<00:03:08.430> ask<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.790> how<00:03:08.940> much<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.560> memory

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
it'll just ask you how much like memory

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.350 
it'll just ask you how much like memory
and<00:03:10.920> disk<00:03:11.130> space<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:11.550> want<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.910> give<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.240> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
and disk space you want to give to it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.410 
and disk space you want to give to it
and<00:03:12.510> yeah<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.830> simple<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.240> just

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
and yeah it's that simple you can just

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.960 
and yeah it's that simple you can just
like<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.230> said<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.770> not<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.220> functional<00:03:17.550> but

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
like I said it's not that functional but

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.729 
like I said it's not that functional but
it's<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.450> cool<00:03:19.050> little<00:03:19.230> trick<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.530> thought

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
it's just a cool little trick I thought

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.740 
it's just a cool little trick I thought
