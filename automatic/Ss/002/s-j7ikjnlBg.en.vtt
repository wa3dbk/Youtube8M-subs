I<00:02:51.290> don't<00:02:52.290> want<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.769> particularly

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
I don't want this to be a particularly

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.729 
I don't want this to be a particularly
stark<00:02:53.910> line<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:54.780> I'm<00:02:54.959> going<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.109> go<00:02:55.290> ahead<00:02:55.410> and

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
stark line so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.560 
stark line so I'm going to go ahead and
keep<00:02:56.040> blending<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.640> as<00:02:56.790> I'm<00:02:56.940> applying<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.450> so

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
keep blending it as I'm applying it so

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.819 
keep blending it as I'm applying it so
that<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.750> doesn't<00:02:57.959> get<00:02:58.049> enough<00:02:58.260> time<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.650> sort

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
that it doesn't get enough time to sort

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.400 
that it doesn't get enough time to sort

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
I can get into a nice faded line I'm

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.590 
I can get into a nice faded line I'm
going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> take<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.609> all<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.850> way<00:03:05.970> around<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
going to take it all the way around the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.560 
going to take it all the way around the
gold<00:03:06.900> as<00:03:07.200> well<00:03:07.579> following<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.730> contour<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.540> my

I'm just gonna pull it slightly onto the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.869 
I'm just gonna pull it slightly onto the
lid<00:03:16.890> itself<00:03:17.340> as<00:03:17.670> well<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.700> got

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
lid itself as well so then I got

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.240 
lid itself as well so then I got
something<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.799> next<00:03:22.799> I'm<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.159> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
something like this next I'm going to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.860 
something like this next I'm going to
delve<00:03:23.489> into<00:03:23.640> my<00:03:23.879> ELF<00:03:24.090> palette<00:03:24.480> which<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.719> have

as well just into this contour color
down<00:05:02.039> here<00:05:02.099> and<00:05:02.630> slightly<00:05:03.630> into<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.710> wing<00:05:04.919> as

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
down here and slightly into the wing as

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.999 
down here and slightly into the wing as
well<00:05:05.460> or<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.940> accent<00:05:06.530> then<00:05:07.530> I'm<00:05:07.740> going<00:05:07.949> to

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
well or the accent then I'm going to

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.740 
well or the accent then I'm going to
take<00:05:08.190> this<00:05:08.400> color<00:05:08.699> here<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.180> second<00:05:09.509> one<00:05:09.539> in

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.029 
take this color here the second one in
and<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:09.930> actually<00:05:10.080> find<00:05:10.289> this<00:05:10.440> is<00:05:10.590> much<00:05:10.740> more<00:05:10.949> of

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
and I actually find this is much more of

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.060 
and I actually find this is much more of
a<00:05:11.159> sort<00:05:11.550> of<00:05:11.669> gray<00:05:12.270> black<00:05:12.690> Brown<00:05:13.349> rather<00:05:13.770> than

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
a sort of gray black Brown rather than

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.100 
a sort of gray black Brown rather than
sort<00:05:14.310> of<00:05:14.370> like<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.520> warm<00:05:14.880> brown<00:05:15.479> like<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.900> last

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
sort of like a warm brown like the last

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.649 
sort of like a warm brown like the last

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
one on the palette here so then I'm

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.360 
one on the palette here so then I'm
going<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.840> take<00:05:19.020> this<00:05:19.199> and<00:05:19.470> literally<00:05:19.949> just

blend all the shadows together and

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500 
blend all the shadows together and
there's<00:05:46.890> no<00:05:47.070> harsh<00:05:47.400> lines<00:05:47.730> and<00:05:48.090> it's<00:05:48.180> all<00:05:48.330> nice

beautifully<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.570> pristinely<00:05:52.850> and<00:05:53.850> so<00:05:54.060> I

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
beautifully and pristinely and so I

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.710

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.620 
brush that I was using earlier on the
eyelid<00:06:43.950> and<00:06:44.070> just<00:06:44.490> press<00:06:44.790> it<00:06:44.970> into<00:06:45.150> this<00:06:45.360> pink

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
eyelid and just press it into this pink

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.940 
eyelid and just press it into this pink
and<00:06:45.870> I<00:06:45.930> find<00:06:46.169> that<00:06:46.229> it<00:06:46.380> gives<00:06:46.560> it<00:06:46.680> a<00:06:46.740> really

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
and I find that it gives it a really

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.150 
and I find that it gives it a really
nice<00:06:47.220> sort<00:06:47.490> of<00:06:47.610> bronze<00:06:48.330> sort<00:06:49.020> of<00:06:49.160> steampunky

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
nice sort of bronze sort of steampunky

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.250 
nice sort of bronze sort of steampunky
look<00:06:50.490> to<00:06:50.790> the<00:06:50.940> pink<00:06:51.180> and<00:06:51.360> it<00:06:51.419> also<00:06:51.570> softens<00:06:52.140> it

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
look to the pink and it also softens it

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.930 
look to the pink and it also softens it
a<00:06:52.320> little<00:06:52.500> bit<00:06:52.680> because<00:06:52.800> it<00:06:53.040> can<00:06:53.610> be<00:06:53.760> a<00:06:53.790> little

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
a little bit because it can be a little

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.090 
a little bit because it can be a little
bit<00:06:54.180> too<00:06:54.360> hot<00:06:54.660> pink<00:06:54.990> so<00:06:55.470> then<00:06:55.650> as<00:06:55.860> a<00:06:55.890> final

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
bit too hot pink so then as a final

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.830 
bit too hot pink so then as a final
little<00:06:56.370> step<00:06:56.729> I<00:06:56.910> take<00:06:57.150> the<00:06:57.270> same<00:06:57.450> highlight
