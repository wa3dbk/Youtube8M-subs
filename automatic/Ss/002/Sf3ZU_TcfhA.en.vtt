00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.950
 one of my fans really appreciated 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.809
 serena explained how to tease 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.750
 correctly the hair and now I show you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.610
 how to do it I decided not to do it 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.520
 I personally why it wouldn't be one 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.439
 very real thing so I tried to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.560
 reproduce what would happen at home 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.420
 asked my model for help vi 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.699
 I'll explain how it's done and then she 'll do it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.340
 see practically to do the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.369
 topping you can use one of 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.430
 these two tools at home definitely 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 all of you will have a tail comb while 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.230
 this a lot more brush 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.230
 professional 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.250
 in this case I'll show you with the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.719
 still generally comb the area that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 it must be returned to the upper area of ​​the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.190
 head where you may want to get the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.170
 right volume and remember that it is a lot 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.539
 important to establish the area you want 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.010
 tease because from this area you have to 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.799
 separate a small amount of hair 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.750
 which in this case to this one here that 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 will serve to cover the topping that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.049
 otherwise it would be visible would be one 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.479
 part of the hair that they are not are not 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.869
 ordered once the lock is separated 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.509
 which will cover the topping 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.310
 take the hair to tease if there 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.490
 very large area you can do it in addition 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490
 sections 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.940
 raise the lock upwards 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.930
 the disheveled good to hold still i 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.450
 hair with your left hand in this 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.030
 case seeing that they are right 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.180
 insert the comb in the center of the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.180
 lock 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.720
 and bring it down let it out 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.810
 the comb reinserted into the hair and there 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:04.940
 do the same movement and this until 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.470
 don't get the right photoning now 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.350
 my model will do it alone will make you 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.130
 see how to establish the area that 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.960
 you want to tidy up remember to keep 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.640
 a small amount of hair that 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 they will then cover yours 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.960
 cotonatura 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.700
 and tina telani capri upwards 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.450
 keep your hair with your hand where not 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.340
 you have the comb insert the comb not 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.140
 too high otherwise you won't succeed 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.180
 to bring the cotton to the root 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.970
 at this height it's fine 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.740
 push the curtains down, do it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.570
 exit hair reinserted repeats it 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.530
 same movement until you get the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.530
 desired volume 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.880
 once obtained this type of 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.530
 topping place hair back 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.630
 and if these that I know will go 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:01.110
 back and cover her with that hair 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.820
 we left free 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.510
 in this way to cover the 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.310
 topping to have just done like 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.860
 see we got a great volume 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.270
 at this point the topping is used 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.270
 precisely to obtain municipalities 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.860
 if you want to make sure this is this 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.590
 volume will remain you can add a little 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.510
 of lacquer and I always recommend the boat 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.020
 flexible from a lacquer not too much 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.280
 rigid so it will not create an effect 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.080
 too originated hair but remaining 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.760
 very natural and go to apply it 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.110
 with the remote muscle bit in the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.110
 area that you donated 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.300
 I hope the explanation has been 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.550
 clear I showed it both 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.760
 personally modeling it on itself 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.860
 same and try and let me know how it goes 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.290
 then a very last tip 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.030
 important that is to dissolve the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.860
 I advise you to do this with one 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.390
 bristle brush and not with a comb 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.520
 so as not to stress too much 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.380
 hair and not to warn too much 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.820
 pain very often will choose one 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.250
 topping is not a very thing 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.500
 nice I hope my explanation 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.209
 was clear and detailed 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.250
 keep asking me questions like he did 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.810
 serene so that even limited cues 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.460
