00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.919
 insole for this mandate you are 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.000
 only the fate to present dot 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.639
 very important or rather I am 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.099
 indeed delighted with verrayes 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.090
 look at the upload date for 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.880
 this video that June 2014 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.039
 poor god why or how you have 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.369
 quoted easily note from the title today 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 I'm looking like the anniversary of the first 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.929
 video in which I showed my face 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.880
 in fact another fa was not a year ago 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.260
 Exactly for gartner they loaded the 8 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.630
 June 2013 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 the real blog, however, because I say a year ago 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.129
 because I had done it the following Saturday 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.230
 then Saturday following the day in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.969
 which even the finish was over at school 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.120
 on Friday because I do all 6 hours 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.010
 days except Friday 8 so I wanted to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.949
 do the same thing this year then 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.780
 today I am going to introduce you to the blog or 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.480
 better my video anniversary 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.579
 first blog and I'm really glad it was 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.199
 retinal because in the end I still 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.220
 you know we know each other better then 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.439
 I think that's enough 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.479
 tactic really looks like what I say 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.280
 another thing if you know how to know if 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.600
 you have noticed that the environment is a bit 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.250
 different because my video 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 special I could n't do it where I was 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.840
 we do therefore every day in the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.490
 distance in fact today I am in the mind 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.659
 has not hosted another jobs sta 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.000
 passing 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.940
 I think it went but it's a moment 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.530
 because readers denounce me 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.810
 better performing as you well know 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.670
 I to make my videos like a 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.740
 crystal saying that today punctually 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.700
 different because they are used as 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.350
 but in my garden 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.970
 in the environment my garden why 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.940
 they are in fact the impacts of mine 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.680
 garden here is this idea of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.630
 change a cover this special video 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.310
 he likes in part you're selling yen and 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.740
 because I will look towards my garden 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.040
 one thing quite tactical then another 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.490
 thing 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.470
 today and anniversaries and doubly magical 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.830
 because because today technically speaking 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.050
 having to reach 60 thousand to write 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.540
 or my god boys we still reached 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.520
 but three are missing from you 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.740
 I usually do more than thirty writings 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.250
 day today talking will structure 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.590
 reach 60,000 child members 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.230
 they really were more words than you are 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.900
 fantastic but the nice thing is that now 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.270
 160 subscribers and a site bill agreement of 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.600
 50 thousand thanks for this 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.040
 then how could I do it any more 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.060
 when it was over school is over 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.130
 yesterday and then a lot of it would have run 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.930
 time for recorded and then details 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.140
 devices devices such as 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.150
 the gopro I'm trying to buy 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.820
 on the internet sting taken pro I believe that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.080
 resume, then, we flatten today 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.300
 the passes well then we will obviously try 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.670
 to stay beyond is possible and will seek 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.350
 obviously to bring it to you before May 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.810
 reaching another goal 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.790
 even if the thing didn't fall difficult 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.860
 because maybe we should find 12 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.739
 precisely to register to find who I am 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.230
 i eat sync 58 definitely i think carmi 9 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.180
 to register a sort of tiffany 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.080
 so the alt will be something really 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.569
 pica 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.489
 last thing from 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.310
 he shares the lost magazine almost as much as I wanted 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.049
 say let's finish episode 4 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.700
 I only recorded this 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.260
 small problem a great player 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.719
 which I managed to solve only later 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.389
 quite a lot and I believe that they never load it 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.769
 lots of tactics and if you can of what 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.819
 greens leave only if this also 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.400
 blog for why we say I want to see them 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.319
 also in other types of videos my case 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.969
 our debt that supports me because of me 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.340
 I connect another than a failure of 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:36.819
 this video I much for nothing either 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.530
 been loaded many faces in mean 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.269
 the sense because from you I will go in 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.620
 study vacation maybe to load the 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.239
 videos while I'm on vacation study 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.859
 or even when I'm on vacation 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.870
 continue miss or when we say 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.609
 noticeable making videos because here in 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.439
 summer because we have so many more 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.959
 more because so many other things to do 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.760
 and i can upload both liked it for 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.299
 keep in touch so if you have 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.040
 let me know if you'd like 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.709
 however watch these thrills that 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.719
 so don't be serious survive and if 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.669
 instead it was discussed sandblasted operations 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.889
 during the summer there will be some sort of 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.419
 small change is bad though 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.980
 change however the videos of 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.860
 fifa warehouses milano 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.470
 in mind this is the reason 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.799
 so guys said i have nothing to 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.810
 to say 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.210
 I thank you for another 1,300 60 thousand 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.070
 subscribers I remind you that a year ago 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.380
 exact uploaded my first video in a 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.600
 treasure changed so much since a year not 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.699
 I know about you and so I say this 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.970
 Pisano I tell you, you can talk to the mayor 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.949
 vito bono and the boys rightly like a 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.720
 year is even better to say hello because 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.810
 if you remember blog 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.870
 a year ago they started going down 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.280
 the music starts on the screen then like 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.960
 another opportunity to say something else 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.580
 if my hair is quite obscene 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.440
 it's because I woke up recently and not 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.250
 I really wanted to refer to the boulder 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.060
 so the best greetings are useless 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.060
 pollock
