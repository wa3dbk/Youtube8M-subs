00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.000
 good to all kids welcome to a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.380
 new video again with news and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.059
 let's come with the news about 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.530
 new camouflages that have been filtered 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.720
 here we are going to have the first one 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.810
 I would call mystery here you see we are going to 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.420
 try one by one so you can see how 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 they work as you see is a camouflage 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.529
 that it's okay that he's cool he's 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.140
 quite colorful this news the fly 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.369
 a flash is has caught by surprise 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.680
 it seems that they are inside the game I do not know 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.050
 know if they will be free or charge for them 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.330
 Later we will have to wait for 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.910
 see it and I tell you this first one is called 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.730
 mystery here we have the second ice 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.410
 blue that means blue ice like you see 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.700
 you can observe is very cool about 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 all in areas where less 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.270
 luminosity you see how is a tone 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.399
 neon blue bordered by letters 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.710
 white white shapes here you go to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.940
 see later on another weapon too 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 it is very cool 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.900
 It varies a lot depending on the weapons 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.700
 it has to be said 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.370
 and good as you can see is 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.830
 very cool and we will go with the next 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.930
 camouflage that is a camouflage that I 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.190
 I would call changing because you can change 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.890
 Color choose to change the color 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.780
 continuously basic colors the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.400
 basic colors you know any 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.200
 Basic color can be changed 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.340
 continuously coming out blue red 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 purple green yellow and so on any 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.150
 color would be a basic set with what 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.530
 which I think they will not charge for these 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.320
 as classes because they are nothing 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.330
 spectacular and good here as what 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.010
 you are watching is fine this 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.890
 maybe it's one of the best that is a 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.810
 sort of residue I think it's called 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.660
 they call residue camouflage residue 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.369
 zombie camouflage residue the truth is 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.200
 that is a bit strange is a bit weird 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.390
 but it's cool everyone is one of the most 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.790
 pimps may be together with the first 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.130
 and well I hope you like it here you have 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.770
 pretty good the truth and we're going to 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.320
 proceed with him to go with the two 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.450
 last camouflages that for me the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.170
 remaining camouflages are let's say that 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.030
 the worst 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.010
 this is the sahara 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.380
 You can see Sahara because that is how 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.679
 earth texture desert texture 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.390
 Sahara desert so it will be called and as 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.270
 you can observe it is very normal and I 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.950
 He does not have anything else either but he's going to 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.470
 come after maybe it's still going to be 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.120
 less then it is even less showy than 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.160
 this one because as we can observe this 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.920
 have a little but now let's go with 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.170
 the blue tiger or water tiger like this is going 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.450
 to call this this camouflage which is the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.090
 last as it is to observe has nothing of 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.730
 peculiar, so nothing, I'm going to leave you 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.830
 here with what little remains and I hope that 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.370
 you like to vote the video and even another 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.370
 companions
