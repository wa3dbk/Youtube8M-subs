short stack but he survived he doubled
up<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.540> was<00:03:54.600> Martin<00:03:54.870> Cole<00:03:55.200> sob<00:03:55.440> who<00:03:55.770> went

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
up and it was Martin Cole sob who went

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.450 
up and it was Martin Cole sob who went
out<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.250> night<00:03:56.459> when<00:03:56.700> he<00:03:56.790> rang<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:56.970> Queen

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
out in night when he rang the Queen

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.270 
out in night when he rang the Queen
in<00:03:57.550> two<00:03:57.730> aces<00:03:58.150> bizarrely<00:03:58.600> an<00:03:59.110> ace-high<00:03:59.590> flop

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
in two aces bizarrely an ace-high flop

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.700 
in two aces bizarrely an ace-high flop
so<00:04:01.000> he<00:04:01.180> bobbles<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.540> final<00:04:01.930> table<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.560> other

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
so he bobbles the final table the other

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.560 
so he bobbles the final table the other
eight<00:04:02.920> players<00:04:03.190> advance<00:04:03.460> should<00:04:04.210> point<00:04:04.360> out

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
eight players advance should point out

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.180 
eight players advance should point out
that<00:04:04.750> because<00:04:05.050> they<00:04:05.200> played<00:04:05.470> nine<00:04:05.680> handed<00:04:06.010> for

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
that because they played nine handed for

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.430 
that because they played nine handed for
so<00:04:06.430> long<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.210> blinds<00:04:07.660> have<00:04:07.870> kind<00:04:08.200> of<00:04:08.290> caught

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440
