okay<00:00:27.490> so<00:00:27.880> now<00:00:28.089> our<00:00:28.269> model<00:00:28.570> is<00:00:28.689> imported<00:00:29.230> let's

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
okay so now our model is imported let's

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.769 
okay so now our model is imported let's
apply<00:00:30.099> some<00:00:30.400> materials<00:00:30.939> to<00:00:31.000> it<00:00:31.300> you<00:00:31.480> can<00:00:31.630> make

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.590 
the model you want to apply the material
to<00:00:40.210> then<00:00:40.690> open<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.559> materials<00:00:41.980> panel<00:00:42.309> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
to then open the materials panel and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.780 
to then open the materials panel and
