as<00:01:20.040> most<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.140> still

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
as most of you know and I'm still

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.199 
as most of you know and I'm still
learning<00:01:22.500> something<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.670> used<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.940> do<00:01:24.060> was

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
learning something I used to do was

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.389 
learning something I used to do was
always<00:01:24.569> pull<00:01:24.899> with<00:01:24.929> my<00:01:25.259> back<00:01:25.530> rather<00:01:26.220> than

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
always pull with my back rather than

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.660 
always pull with my back rather than
activating<00:01:27.209> with<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.479> glutes<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> hamstrings

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
activating with my glutes and hamstrings

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
activating with my glutes and hamstrings
and<00:01:29.670> another<00:01:29.970> thing<00:01:30.179> I<00:01:30.270> never<00:01:30.619> really<00:01:31.619> focused

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and another thing I never really focused

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.830 
and another thing I never really focused
on<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.520> husband<00:01:32.880> noticed<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.539> that<00:01:33.660> I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
on that my husband noticed is that I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.660 
on that my husband noticed is that I
don't<00:01:33.959> pull<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.679> slack<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.190> from<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.490> bar

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
don't pull the slack out from the bar

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.460 
don't pull the slack out from the bar
before<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.030> liked<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.569> just<00:01:36.690> kind<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> yank<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
before I liked it I just kind of yank it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.410 
before I liked it I just kind of yank it
off<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> ground<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.190> go<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.300> that's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
off the ground and go on so that's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.960 
off the ground and go on so that's
something<00:01:39.630> I've<00:01:39.810> been<00:01:39.929> focusing<00:01:40.380> on

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
something I've been focusing on

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.140 
something I've been focusing on
as<00:01:41.030> well<00:01:41.770> screwing<00:01:42.770> my<00:01:42.890> feet<00:01:43.190> into<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.550> ground

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
as well screwing my feet into the ground

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.530 
as well screwing my feet into the ground
bringing<00:01:45.110> my<00:01:45.170> knees<00:01:45.410> out<00:01:45.650> slightly<00:01:46.420> lots<00:01:47.420> of

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
bringing my knees out slightly lots of

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.060 
bringing my knees out slightly lots of
different<00:01:47.810> things<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.290> learn<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.950> to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
different things to learn and to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.850 
different things to learn and to
incorporate<00:01:49.910> and<00:01:50.270> with<00:01:51.110> doing<00:01:51.380> these<00:01:51.560> they

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
incorporate and with doing these they

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.070 
incorporate and with doing these they
just<00:01:51.890> look<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:52.520> much<00:01:52.640> more<00:01:52.700> fluid<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:53.930> much

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
just look so much more fluid so much

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.460 
just look so much more fluid so much
smoother<00:01:54.710> than<00:01:54.920> they<00:01:55.040> did<00:01:55.990> just<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.080> few<00:01:57.110> months

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
smoother than they did just a few months

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.620 
smoother than they did just a few months
ago<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.220> I'm<00:01:58.610> really<00:01:58.880> happy<00:01:59.030> with<00:01:59.300> what<00:01:59.480> I've

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
ago so I'm really happy with what I've

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.140 
ago so I'm really happy with what I've
been<00:01:59.780> proved<00:02:00.110> on<00:02:00.260> my<00:02:00.800> Mac<00:02:00.980> so<00:02:01.250> far<00:02:01.430> it's<00:02:01.610> 2:15

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
been proved on my Mac so far it's 2:15

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.050 
been proved on my Mac so far it's 2:15
for<00:02:02.450> two<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:03.160> haven't<00:02:04.160> tried<00:02:04.280> maxing<00:02:04.670> out<00:02:04.760> in<00:02:04.940> a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
for two I haven't tried maxing out in a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.420 
for two I haven't tried maxing out in a
while<00:02:05.300> but<00:02:05.660> we'll<00:02:06.260> see<00:02:06.440> helping<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.980> possibly

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
while but we'll see helping to possibly

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.800 
while but we'll see helping to possibly
get<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.610> 300<00:02:08.270> -<00:02:09.259> let's<00:02:09.560> see<00:02:09.710> where<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:10.130> get

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
get to 300 - let's see where I get

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.600 
get to 300 - let's see where I get
