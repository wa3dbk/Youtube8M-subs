ease the handle of this knife is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.460 
ease the handle of this knife is
skeletonized<00:01:09.149> so<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.509> does<00:01:09.660> not<00:01:09.840> provide<00:01:10.200> you

with much of a solid grip but a section

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
with much of a solid grip but a section
of<00:01:13.020> cord<00:01:13.290> comes<00:01:13.530> included<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.460> knife

so<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> could<00:01:15.299> wrap<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> handle<00:01:16.229> although

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
so you could wrap the handle although

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.560 
so you could wrap the handle although
wrapping<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> handle<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.939> typically<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
wrapping the handle is typically the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
wrapping the handle is typically the
course<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> action<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.590> recommend<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.220> most

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
course of action I recommend with most

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.820 
course of action I recommend with most
knives<00:01:20.820> such<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.200> skeletonized

knives such as this the skeletonized
handle<00:01:23.220> actually<00:01:23.729> works<00:01:23.909> quite<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.329> with

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900

the overall construction of this knife

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.210 
the overall construction of this knife
given<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.020> would<00:01:28.200> recommend<00:01:28.680> using<00:01:28.920> the
