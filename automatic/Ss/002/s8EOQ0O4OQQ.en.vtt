00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
price I do understand that but I just

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.970 
price I do understand that but I just
classify<00:02:29.720> more<00:02:29.930> as<00:02:29.990> an<00:02:30.260> app<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.680> do<00:02:30.740> as

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
classify more as an app that I do as

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.870 
classify more as an app that I do as
anything<00:02:31.250> else<00:02:31.460> because<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.950> concept<00:02:34.670> is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
anything else because the the concept is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.860 
anything else because the the concept is
just<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.810> fish<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.560> guess<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:37.370> would<00:02:37.640> say<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.090> if

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
just so a fish I guess I would say so if

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.300 
just so a fish I guess I would say so if
