okay<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:44.270> little<00:02:44.600> tangled<00:02:45.500> down<00:02:45.800> here

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:13.880 

okay<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:09.400> lose<00:04:09.790> here<00:04:10.090> when<00:04:10.240> I<00:04:10.330> do<00:04:10.390> that

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.949 

that's<00:04:14.890> why<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.100> don't<00:04:15.250> do<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:15.730> often<00:04:18.900> now<00:04:19.900> you

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
that's why I don't do it often now you

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.020 
that's why I don't do it often now you
see<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.290> difference<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.900> braid<00:04:23.200> this<00:04:24.030> and

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
see the difference I can braid this and

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.730 
see the difference I can braid this and
because<00:04:25.300> i<00:04:25.330> already<00:04:25.540> have<00:04:25.930> plenty<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.440> hair

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
because i already have plenty of hair

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.680 
because i already have plenty of hair
milk<00:04:27.010> in<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.520> don't<00:04:28.150> even<00:04:28.240> have<00:04:28.420> to<00:04:28.510> put

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
milk in it I don't even have to put

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.860 
milk in it I don't even have to put
anything<00:04:28.870> else<00:04:29.170> on<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.410> I<00:04:29.680> can<00:04:29.980> just<00:04:30.130> braid<00:04:30.460> it

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
anything else on it I can just braid it

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.750 
anything else on it I can just braid it
and<00:04:31.870> it'll<00:04:32.080> take<00:04:32.350> on<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.710> waves<00:04:32.980> from<00:04:33.700> the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
and it'll take on the waves from the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.320 
and it'll take on the waves from the
braid<00:04:34.060> out<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:35.280> that'd<00:04:36.280> be<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.430> nice<00:04:36.640> look<00:04:37.030> for

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
braid out and that'd be a nice look for

00:04:37.330 --> 00:05:03.780 
braid out and that'd be a nice look for
today<00:04:57.030> that's<00:04:58.030> how<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.270> stretch<00:04:58.780> my<00:04:58.810> hair<00:05:02.790> when
