remember<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.670> an<00:01:20.790> art<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.840> don't<00:01:22.320> join<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
remember this is an art you don't join a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.460 
remember this is an art you don't join a
martial<00:01:23.400> art<00:01:23.610> studio<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.540> become<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> black

belt in one day it takes practice it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
belt in one day it takes practice it
takes<00:01:27.900> patience<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.650> takes<00:01:28.680> time<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.610> takes

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
takes patience it takes time it takes

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.600 
takes patience it takes time it takes
energy<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.810> takes<00:01:31.079> effort<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.100> practice

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
energy and it takes effort so practice
