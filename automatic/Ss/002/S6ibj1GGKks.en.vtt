 ok once you have installed this 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.520
 now let's go to the section of 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.050
 packages 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.510
 they were going to need this called ipad already 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.780
 that we are going to install some 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.120
 I breathe on your device and now we go 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.560
 to go to good here is a point 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.270
 important since in the description of 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.220
 video I will leave a package in the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.130
 which contains all the images that 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.040
 we will use as notifications in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.140
 our device are in fact they are 180 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.340
 images as I mentioned them until the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.650
 download link in the description of 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.880
 video and you will be able to install it 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.979
 your device or from your 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.300
 computer as it is easier for them 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.910
 this case we are going to how can it 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.800
 install from your device ok that's why 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.190
 they are going to go to safari they are going to give tap in 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.960
 the one of what is being the one in the link 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.060
 of download and you will see them in this way 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.220
 simply to a person who says open 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.490
 in ai file and will direct them towards 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.569
 application let's give tap here and let's 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.909
 to dzeko 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.769
 the art where says viewer if you are 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.269
 simply one selected or they will 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.780
 adapt where it says here in the part 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.109
 lower right and they will give cover that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.420
 it says extract all the files and you're going 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.969
 to be all the images here in 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.920
 our on this route in this folder that 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.769
 you are not going to give plugs to edit 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.049
 they are going to select all the files that 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.079
 are the images in this case are going to 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.579
 give copy they will select the van 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.569
 here you will appear the option 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.120
 to copy 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.950
 I in this case, well, I do not have it. 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.610
 I did because I already have them installed and 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.300
 now we are going to the next route 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.310
 do not go out to the hoop 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.160
 the main folder and we're going to go to this 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.720
 route that exist 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.640
 bookstore 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.000
 we come here to the folder that says 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.280
 frame words 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.690
 and let's slide the bottom part goes 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.520
 to have a folder that says the kit 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.740
 framework 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.240
 and in this folder they are going to edit and go 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.090
 to paste here absolutely all the 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.610
 images as they realize in the part 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.630
 from below I already have all the images that 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.630
 they will serve as our 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.010
 notifications ok once they have 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.349
 done this procedure this 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.550
 step let's go now to adjustments 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.200
 when we download what's coming 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.420
 being our tweet that is going to 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.599
 add or add a small one 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.459
 tab with the name of that tweet and 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.650
 we have open do not tiff 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.720
 to select and we will configure it 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.090
 this way obviously it should be 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.730
 enabled this tab that is so that 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.319
 tweet work and here gives us the 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.420
 option that if we want it to appear 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.860
 the silent mode icon that our 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.170
 status neighborhood in this case here not what 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.239
 I have selected but well you 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.340
 they can enable without any problem 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.930
 let's use a little bit and let's go 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.720
 here where it says notifications of 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.600
 Applications 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.490
 and how did you mention them you are going to 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.740
 power 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.440
 add the image to any of your 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.620
 Applications 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.009
 since good as you mentioned there is a 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.009
 great variety of images 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.270
 good you can add those images to 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.039
 the native applications 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.389
 the apps that have downloaded the app 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.139
 store like that in mind that is the 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.630
 app store section for example here in 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.760
 the twitter or tweetbot application 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.560
 I only added in this case the 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.849
 images that I use the most to not have 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.979
 all but you can go 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:58.399
 and selecting the for example here 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.319
 I have this one that says here you Herbert or 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:03.379
 well anything else on twitter 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.309
 of tweetbot or if I want to change the 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.009
 image that is to your liking 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:08.990
 simply the selection and so they will 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.779
 go adding one by one to your 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.129
 applications are going to come out and if they see that 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.949
 the changes arise immediately 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.240
 well I would advise you to make a 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.369
 sprint and ready if you are going to show off your 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.020
