another tour because that looked on the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.619 
another tour because that looked on the
on<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.770> unboxing<00:00:50.730> video<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> wasn't

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
on my unboxing video and it wasn't

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.099 
on my unboxing video and it wasn't
really<00:00:53.120> didn't<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.300> show<00:00:54.510> everything<00:00:55.050> I
