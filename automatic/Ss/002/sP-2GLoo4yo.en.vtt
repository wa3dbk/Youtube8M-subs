00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
next ideas you know you know to do

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.009 
next ideas you know you know to do
geothermal<00:04:00.099> there's<00:04:00.969> many<00:04:01.239> ways<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.599> doing<00:04:01.659> it

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
geothermal there's many ways of doing it

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.530 
geothermal there's many ways of doing it
but<00:04:02.939> why<00:04:03.939> is<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.209> so<00:04:04.480> dark<00:04:05.879> how<00:04:06.879> can<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.120> get<00:04:07.359> that

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
but why is it so dark how can I get that

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.399 
but why is it so dark how can I get that
little<00:04:07.870> lighter<00:04:09.719> it's<00:04:10.719> not<00:04:10.870> gonna<00:04:10.989> get<00:04:11.200> much

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
little lighter it's not gonna get much

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.740 
little lighter it's not gonna get much
lighter<00:04:11.709> than<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.129> good<00:04:12.489> god<00:04:13.030> man
