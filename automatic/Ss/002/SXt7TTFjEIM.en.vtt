reason why I made this video is to make

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.709 
reason why I made this video is to make
a<00:01:53.820> rant<00:01:54.090> um<00:01:54.500> I<00:01:55.500> remember<00:01:55.890> pulling<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.759> around

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
a rant um I remember pulling this around

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.560

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
like the beginning of September and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.819 
like the beginning of September and
crush<00:02:03.420> card<00:02:03.630> virus<00:02:03.659> had<00:02:04.079> been<00:02:04.229> banned<00:02:04.439> already

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829

March panelists for 2010
um<00:02:12.640> but<00:02:13.510> does<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.900> really<00:02:13.959> make<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.230> difference

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
um but does it really make a difference

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.910 
um but does it really make a difference
because<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.430> can<00:02:15.610> use<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.879> right<00:02:15.909> now<00:02:16.120> um<00:02:16.920> in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
because you can use it right now um in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.410 
because you can use it right now um in
your<00:02:18.069> opinion<00:02:18.459> do<00:02:18.579> you<00:02:18.700> think<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.180> crush

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
your opinion do you think that crush

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.949 
your opinion do you think that crush
card<00:02:19.629> virus<00:02:19.689> should<00:02:20.110> be<00:02:20.260> danced<00:02:21.450> because<00:02:22.450> I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
card virus should be danced because I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.720 
card virus should be danced because I
really<00:02:23.379> don't<00:02:23.530> think<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.799> should<00:02:24.040> first<00:02:24.579> of

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
really don't think it should first of

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.229 
really don't think it should first of
all<00:02:25.200> getting<00:02:26.200> cross<00:02:26.470> border<00:02:26.739> virus<00:02:27.069> is<00:02:27.760> not

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
all getting cross border virus is not

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.849 
all getting cross border virus is not
really<00:02:28.480> too<00:02:28.599> easy<00:02:28.780> since<00:02:29.109> it's<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.379> pretty

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
really too easy since it's a pretty

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.729 
really too easy since it's a pretty
expensive<00:02:30.099> card<00:02:30.519> it's<00:02:30.819> pretty<00:02:31.030> rare<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.530> if

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
expensive card it's pretty rare and if

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.020 
expensive card it's pretty rare and if
you're<00:02:32.890> thinking<00:02:33.159> like<00:02:33.189> I'll<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.819> card

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
you're thinking like I'll get the card

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.589 
you're thinking like I'll get the card
so<00:02:34.209> easily<00:02:34.420> well<00:02:34.810> think<00:02:35.170> about<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.470> it's<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.950> um

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
so easily well think about it it's a um

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.259 
so easily well think about it it's a um
pretty<00:02:37.599> rare<00:02:37.780> foil<00:02:38.170> card<00:02:38.409> I<00:02:38.939> can't<00:02:39.939> really<00:02:40.060> get

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
pretty rare foil card I can't really get

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.910 
pretty rare foil card I can't really get
it<00:02:40.359> too<00:02:40.450> easily<00:02:40.629> if<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.319> want<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.530> buy<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.650> as<00:02:41.890> a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
it too easily if you want to buy it as a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.729 
it too easily if you want to buy it as a
single<00:02:42.310> card<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.760> kind<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.030> expensive<00:02:43.739> too

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
single card to be kind of expensive too

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:45.899 
single card to be kind of expensive too
expensive<00:02:44.769> but<00:02:45.310> you're<00:02:45.459> pretty<00:02:45.639> expensive

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
expensive but you're pretty expensive

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.569 
expensive but you're pretty expensive
okay<00:02:46.359> so<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.680> think<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:47.980> should<00:02:48.099> be<00:02:48.159> banned

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
okay so do you think it should be banned

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.369 
okay so do you think it should be banned
first<00:02:49.359> of<00:02:49.510> all<00:02:49.599> just<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:49.959> case<00:02:50.049> you<00:02:50.170> don't<00:02:50.319> know

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
what it does ensure you know where those

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.930 
what it does ensure you know where those
oh<00:02:51.819> but<00:02:52.060> just<00:02:52.209> in<00:02:52.480> case<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:53.530> tribute<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.069> dork

monsters have attack at 1,500 more than

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.879 
monsters have attack at 1,500 more than
they<00:03:12.879> also<00:03:13.060> get<00:03:13.329> destroyed

they also get destroyed

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:19.259 
they also get destroyed
so<00:03:14.889> yeah<00:03:15.750> beast<00:03:16.750> of<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:16.959> core<00:03:17.169> here<00:03:17.379> I<00:03:18.239> mean<00:03:19.239> I

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
so yeah beast of the core here I mean I

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.819 
so yeah beast of the core here I mean I
understand<00:03:19.720> like<00:03:20.019> why<00:03:20.199> they<00:03:20.440> banned<00:03:20.650> it

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
understand like why they banned it

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.319 
understand like why they banned it
because<00:03:20.889> of<00:03:21.310> all<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.519> things<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:21.940> destroys

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
because of all the things that destroys

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.080 
because of all the things that destroys
but<00:03:22.889> tributing<00:03:23.889> a<00:03:24.069> dork<00:03:24.340> monster<00:03:24.790> with<00:03:24.940> an

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
but tributing a dork monster with an

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.729 
but tributing a dork monster with an
attack<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:25.840> 1000<00:03:26.319> or<00:03:26.410> more

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
attack of 1000 or more

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.039 
attack of 1000 or more
I<00:03:26.769> mean<00:03:27.040> 1000<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.549> us<00:03:27.669> it's<00:03:28.389> pretty<00:03:28.659> hard<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:28.930> do

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
I mean 1000 of us it's pretty hard to do

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.490 
I mean 1000 of us it's pretty hard to do
because<00:03:29.230> usually<00:03:30.069> monsters<00:03:30.849> will<00:03:31.500> like

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
because usually monsters will like

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.470 
because usually monsters will like
whether<00:03:32.739> 1000<00:03:33.400> attacks<00:03:33.639> can<00:03:34.060> get<00:03:34.180> destroyed

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
whether 1000 attacks can get destroyed

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.229 
whether 1000 attacks can get destroyed
pretty<00:03:34.720> easily<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:35.199> mean<00:03:35.379> honestly<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:37.090> yeah

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
pretty easily I mean honestly but yeah

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.970 
pretty easily I mean honestly but yeah
this<00:03:37.359> is<00:03:37.419> perfect<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:38.139> like<00:03:38.260> zombie<00:03:38.620> backs

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
this is perfect for like zombie backs

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.539 
this is perfect for like zombie backs
um<00:03:39.280> pretty<00:03:39.940> good<00:03:40.150> for<00:03:40.329> like<00:03:40.449> dark<00:03:40.810> text<00:03:40.989> too

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
um pretty good for like dark text too

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.280 
um pretty good for like dark text too
