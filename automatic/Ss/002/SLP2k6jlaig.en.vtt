one<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> most<00:00:15.120> important<00:00:15.780> processes<00:00:16.379> in

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
one of the most important processes in

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.950 
one of the most important processes in
development<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> cell<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.300> divide<00:00:18.420> an

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
development is for a cell to divide an

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.929 
development is for a cell to divide an
increase<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.500> number<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.980> generate<00:00:20.340> an<00:00:20.490> entire

proliferating

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
proliferating
and<00:00:27.180> take<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.810> some<00:00:27.990> kind<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.230> specialized

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and take on some kind of specialized

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.830 
and take on some kind of specialized
function<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.910> might<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.539> become<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
function and this might be to become a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080 
function and this might be to become a
neuron<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.529> nerve<00:00:31.980> cell<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> muscle<00:00:32.579> cell

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and this choice between proliferation so

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.190 
and this choice between proliferation so
increasing<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.500> number<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:39.200> differentiation

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
increasing in number and differentiation

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.520 
increasing in number and differentiation
becoming<00:00:40.950> specialized<00:00:41.840> lies<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> very<00:00:43.200> heart

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
becoming specialized lies the very heart

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.150 
becoming specialized lies the very heart
of<00:00:43.800> developmental<00:00:44.489> biology

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
of developmental biology

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
of developmental biology
so<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.309> geneticists<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.030> interested<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
so when geneticists are interested in a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.500 
so when geneticists are interested in a
process<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:50.129> look<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.489> situations<00:00:50.700> when<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
process they look for situations when it

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.020 
process they look for situations when it
has<00:00:51.660> gone<00:00:51.840> wrong<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.309> work<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.670> why

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
has gone wrong we can then work out why

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.760 
has gone wrong we can then work out why
things<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.629> gone<00:00:54.750> wrong<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.260> ultimately

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
things have gone wrong and ultimately

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.220 
things have gone wrong and ultimately
understand<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.670> about<00:00:56.910> how<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.840> process

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
understand more about how the process

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.310 
understand more about how the process
normally<00:00:58.469> works<00:00:58.940> what<00:00:59.940> we<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.660> use<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> tiny

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
normally works what we do is use a tiny

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
normally works what we do is use a tiny
worm<00:01:01.680> called<00:01:01.980> scenario<00:01:02.309> titus<00:01:02.760> elegant<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
worm called scenario titus elegant and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929 
worm called scenario titus elegant and
it<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.170> mutants<00:01:04.589> those<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.400> worms<00:01:05.580> where

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it for mutants those are worms where

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.850 
it for mutants those are worms where
there<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.180> mistakes<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.750> their<00:01:06.900> DNA<00:01:07.080> where

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
there are mistakes in their DNA where

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
there are mistakes in their DNA where
the<00:01:07.950> control<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.760> cell<00:01:09.330> proliferation<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the control of cell proliferation and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.570 
the control of cell proliferation and
differentiation<00:01:10.500> has<00:01:11.159> gone<00:01:11.369> wrong

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.680 

so<00:01:19.580> I'm<00:01:19.700> going<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.000> show<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.270> some<00:01:20.510> really

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
so I'm going to show you some really

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.350 
so I'm going to show you some really
cool<00:01:20.990> worms<00:01:21.290> these<00:01:22.280> worms<00:01:22.610> are<00:01:22.850> wild<00:01:23.120> type

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
cool worms these worms are wild type

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.000 
cool worms these worms are wild type
worms<00:01:23.630> they're<00:01:24.080> normal<00:01:24.410> worms<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.890> they're

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
worms they're normal worms and they're

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.860 
worms they're normal worms and they're
quite<00:01:25.250> happy<00:01:25.310> wiggling<00:01:26.120> around<00:01:26.240> on<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.660> plate

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
quite happy wiggling around on the plate

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.010 
quite happy wiggling around on the plate
now<00:01:27.580> I'm<00:01:28.580> not<00:01:28.820> particularly<00:01:29.270> interested<00:01:29.960> in

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
now I'm not particularly interested in

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.660 
now I'm not particularly interested in
the<00:01:30.140> whole<00:01:30.320> worm<00:01:30.560> I'm<00:01:31.010> interested<00:01:31.550> in

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
the whole worm I'm interested in

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.650 
the whole worm I'm interested in
specific<00:01:32.300> cell<00:01:32.540> type<00:01:32.840> called<00:01:33.140> seam<00:01:33.380> cells<00:01:33.680> and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
specific cell type called seam cells and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.070 
specific cell type called seam cells and
these<00:01:35.660> are<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.900> bit<00:01:36.080> like<00:01:36.290> stem<00:01:36.590> cells<00:01:36.920> now

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
these are a bit like stem cells now

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.670 
these are a bit like stem cells now
these<00:01:39.080> normal<00:01:39.620> worms<00:01:39.830> have<00:01:40.460> 16<00:01:41.300> seam<00:01:41.630> cells<00:01:41.900> we

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
these normal worms have 16 seam cells we

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.320 
these normal worms have 16 seam cells we
can<00:01:42.800> see<00:01:43.040> these<00:01:43.220> cells<00:01:43.520> because<00:01:43.880> we<00:01:44.030> tagged

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
can see these cells because we tagged

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.970 
can see these cells because we tagged
the<00:01:44.570> gene<00:01:44.810> with<00:01:45.260> a<00:01:45.290> green<00:01:45.680> fluorescent

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
the gene with a green fluorescent

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.690 
the gene with a green fluorescent
protein<00:01:47.170> now<00:01:48.170> I'm<00:01:48.530> going<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.920> show<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.340> type

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
protein now I'm going to show you a type

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.700 
protein now I'm going to show you a type
of<00:01:49.880> mutant<00:01:50.270> which<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.540> quite<00:01:50.690> interesting

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.890 

these<00:01:54.710> worms<00:01:55.070> have<00:01:55.580> fewer<00:01:55.910> than<00:01:56.150> 16<00:01:56.630> seem

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
these worms have fewer than 16 seem

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.840 
these worms have fewer than 16 seem
cells<00:01:57.230> and<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.160> because<00:01:58.460> there's<00:01:58.670> been<00:01:58.700> a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
cells and that is because there's been a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.240 
cells and that is because there's been a
mutation<00:01:59.330> so<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.110> DNA<00:02:00.410> sequence<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.100> not

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
mutation so the DNA sequence is not

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.420 
mutation so the DNA sequence is not

show<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.820> mutant<00:02:23.450> which<00:02:24.020> has<00:02:24.260> too<00:02:24.590> much

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
show you a mutant which has too much

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.610 
show you a mutant which has too much
runt<00:02:25.250> one<00:02:25.489> gene<00:02:25.790> product<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.110> one<00:02:27.320> has

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
runt one gene product so this one has

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.750 
runt one gene product so this one has
over<00:02:28.040> expression<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:28.970> runt<00:02:29.180> one<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:31.520> these

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
over expression of runt one so these

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.000 
over expression of runt one so these
worms<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:32.360> too<00:02:32.570> many<00:02:32.750> seen<00:02:33.110> cells<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.680> this

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
worms have too many seen cells and this

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.310 
worms have too many seen cells and this
is<00:02:34.190> because<00:02:34.520> too<00:02:35.030> much<00:02:35.209> runt<00:02:35.540> one<00:02:35.750> protein<00:02:36.140> is

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
is because too much runt one protein is

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.940 
is because too much runt one protein is
being<00:02:36.470> made<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.810> essentially<00:02:39.260> I've<00:02:39.560> given

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
being made so essentially I've given

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.620 
being made so essentially I've given
these<00:02:40.070> worms<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.459> tumor<00:02:40.850> which<00:02:41.150> isn't<00:02:41.450> very

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
these worms a tumor which isn't very

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.470 
these worms a tumor which isn't very
nice<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.400> why<00:02:43.400> these<00:02:43.459> two<00:02:43.940> different<00:02:44.300> types

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
nice and why these two different types

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.330 
nice and why these two different types
of<00:02:44.630> mutants<00:02:45.050> are<00:02:45.200> interesting<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.890> us<00:02:46.070> is

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
of mutants are interesting to us is

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.220 
of mutants are interesting to us is
because<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.090> shows<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.330> runt<00:02:47.780> 1<00:02:47.959> and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
because it shows that runt 1 and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.260 
because it shows that runt 1 and
therefore<00:02:48.500> trunks<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.250> very<00:02:49.520> important<00:02:50.090> in

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
therefore trunks is very important in

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.000 
therefore trunks is very important in
the<00:02:50.510> decision<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.200> proliferate<00:02:51.739> or

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
the decision to proliferate or

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.250 
the decision to proliferate or
differentiate<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.150> become<00:02:53.390> specialized

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.660 

so<00:02:58.260> what<00:02:58.440> we<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.739> here<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> simple

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
so what we have here is a simple

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.520 
so what we have here is a simple
biological<00:03:00.030> system<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:00.959> which<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.290> study

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
biological system in which to study

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.559 
biological system in which to study
ranks<00:03:01.890> genes<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:03.090> hope<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
ranks genes and it's hope that the

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.690 
ranks genes and it's hope that the
insights<00:03:03.989> gained<00:03:04.290> from<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.769> tiny<00:03:05.129> but

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
insights gained from this tiny but

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.089 
insights gained from this tiny but
really<00:03:06.239> significant<00:03:06.840> worm<00:03:07.050> will<00:03:07.530> help<00:03:07.769> us<00:03:07.950> in

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
really significant worm will help us in

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.030 
really significant worm will help us in
the<00:03:08.220> fight<00:03:08.430> against<00:03:08.879> cancer
