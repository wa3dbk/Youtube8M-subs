00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.879
 hello everyone talks to the champion 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.669
 world of martial arts mister 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.230
 satan on this occasion we will continue with 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.170
 the second part of the finals 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.360
 original dragon ball with respect to 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.910
 the saga of the androids despite what 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.270
 difficult it may seem number 17 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.190
 number 18 number 16 and felix were not 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.170
 originally planned by akira 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.869
 toriyama for the saga after the one of 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.699
 freezer in a talk between akira 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.800
 Toriyama and his three editors 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.230
 kazuhiko tories and ma giocondo and fututo 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.749
 takeda in the section in long times 2 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.640
 toriyama mentions that originally 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.710
 I was happy with the villains 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.409
 main saga out of a number 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.359
 19 and number 20 but because of the criticism 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.190
 that they received from tories and more 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.409
 referring to the androids as a 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.829
 old and a fat toriyama created the 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.469
 androids 17 and 18 but the criticisms do not 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.850
 they would be there since a new account 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.039
 very hard would refer to the androids 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.760
 like two brats so toriyama 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.709
 he decided to create but it happened that 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.149
 with do you mentioned that he looked ugly 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:06.640
 so he suggested that he 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.350
 transform 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.750
 in this way toriyama created the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.210
 second form of the android when without 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.979
 embargo would attack again mentioning 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.750
 that now the android he seemed a 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.890
 imbecile so he created his way 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.960
 perfect 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.960
 finally the perfect way to have it 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.180
 It seemed ideal to when every occasion in 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 that a saga was coming to an end many 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.320
 fans back then naturally 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.240
 they thought that maybe that would be the end of 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.979
 dragon ball and the cell saga was not the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.930
 exception so many rumors 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.050
 about the true end of dragon ball 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.729
 they started to spread out despite this 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.800
 it was far from true since 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.780
 toriyama never mentioned in any 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.700
 interview my official source that had 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.640
 plans to finish dragon ball in said 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.890
 period with respect to the saga of ma jin 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.050
 wook we know that dragon ball z finished 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.300
 in said saga but it is interesting to note 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.190
 some of the words of Akira himself 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.530
 toriyama in the much cited say his 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.149
 number 2 when asked about the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.880
 idea of ​​placing agoyán as the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.250
 protagonist of the saga wanted to put 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.190
 agoyan in the main role but not 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.680
 it would work I felt that compared to goku 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.860
 in the end goya was not suitable 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.470
 for that role 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.660
 with these words we can see that 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.580
 akira toriyama changed her mind despite 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.710
 that in fact if he was given something of 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.200
 prominence to goian becoming 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.990
 the character without merging more powerful 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.090
 of dragon ball z until then but 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.670
 because goya was not suitable for the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.620
 role of the protagonist there are several 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.510
 factors that could have affected the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.600
 popularity of the sayayin hybrid in the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.610
 ninetys in fact surveys conducted 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.709
 at that time they claimed that during the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.690
 saga of cell goian became the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.570
 most popular character of dragon ball z 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.490
 even surpassing the same goku but the 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.560
 possible cause of its descent could 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.660
 have due to several factors like that 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.489
 during the seven years after the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.440
 death of the perfect android 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.540
 goián stopped training by turning 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.640
 too weak compared to its 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.770
 younger counterpart as well as others 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.720
 events like the fight against the hard the 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.870
 defeat against ma jin wook fat between 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.580
 other elements that did not favor it 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.620
 rumors on the internet started to be made 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.600
 path claiming that originally 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.640
 piccolo was going to be here in madrid and that 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.410
 he hurt himself instead of vegueta but nothing 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.670
 of this is supported by sources 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.380
 officers though 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.959
 a curious fact is that in the game 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.819
 supersonic goodbye 2 for nintendo ds 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.000
 vadhir and possesses gold pic so 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.950
 maybe this rumor is based on this a 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.810
 latest rumor about the saga of ma jin bu 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.790
 it said that thor called had not planned 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.739
 that Benito separated but that his 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.930
 editor or the fans forced toriyama to 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.060
 undo the merger this supposed 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.310
 evidence is due to the somewhat 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.319
 forced and even contradictory 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.510
 lose the merger if we take into account 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.660
 that the supreme kai osama mentions that the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.459
 fusion would last forever however 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.170
 remember that toriyama is not 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.540
 exactly the person who had 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.430
 planned the series from head to toe and that 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.200
 various inconsistencies or changes 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.500
 sudden they occurred throughout the 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.630
 series and the manga finally let's analyze 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.880
 the end as such in which toriyama 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.819
 send a comment to all fans of 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.670
 dragon ball z I really appreciate 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.290
 read dragon ball for such a long time 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.200
 I am very grateful for all your support 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.239
 until the last moment the truth is that 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.460
 I decided this a long time ago but many 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.220
 things happened so I apologize 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.280
 for announcing it so suddenly 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.200
 I apologize with all the fans also to 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.510
 from now on I think I'll take a 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.490
 small rest and I'll draw more things 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.960
 brief 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.090
 They will definitely see me again I think 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.150
 that will be interesting so I hope it 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.990
 really good until that day this is a 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.850
 goodbye we will see you on another occasion these 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.980
 words can be an indication that 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.720
 maybe toriyama was being pressured 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.550
 by its editor to continue with the 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.740
 series beyond the saga of ma jin wook 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.960
 but as toriyama thought about concluding 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.600
 dragon ball years ago he thought it was 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.150
 just give it an at least temporary end to 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.700
 dragon ball do you think it would have been 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.380
 interesting that the androids 19 and 20 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.840
 would have been the protagonists of the 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.030
 saga and you think that goian deserved to be the 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.490
 that will end with ma jin wook 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.010
