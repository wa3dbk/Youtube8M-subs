00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
now so that's pretty cool um let's test

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.049 
now so that's pretty cool um let's test
out<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> cows<00:00:34.160> you're<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.250> following<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
out the cows you're all following so you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.090 
out the cows you're all following so you
got<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:42.559> let's<00:00:43.559> take<00:00:43.770> our

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
got that one and that one let's take our

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.729 
got that one and that one let's take our
awesome<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> sheep<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> can't<00:00:48.300> see

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
awesome in the sheep so if you can't see

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.639 
awesome in the sheep so if you can't see
home<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.950> hard<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.309> keep<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:52.110> right<00:00:52.320> spot

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
home it's hard to keep it the right spot

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.310 
home it's hard to keep it the right spot
bit<00:00:53.149> test<00:00:54.149> other<00:00:54.329> keep<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.079> pigs<00:00:56.270> carrots

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.470 

maybe<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.379> should<00:01:01.410> throw<00:01:01.829> some<00:01:02.100> beads<00:01:02.480> because

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
maybe we should throw some beads because

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.700 
maybe we should throw some beads because
they<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:07.549> they<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.610> our<00:01:09.060> use<00:01:09.780> beats<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.560> um

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
they do on they do our use beats for um

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.149 
they do on they do our use beats for um
they<00:01:13.710> use<00:01:13.890> beads<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.460> breathe<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.560> I'm<00:01:16.560> going

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
they use beads to breathe so I'm going

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.200 
they use beads to breathe so I'm going
to<00:01:17.220> grab<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.430> whole<00:01:18.229> bucket<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.409> water<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.210> sonali

and it can take up to three times
sometimes<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.659> too<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:56.100> loss<00:01:56.280> um

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
sometimes it's too like that one loss um

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.800 
sometimes it's too like that one loss um

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
she can't actually get beats in arm in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.550 
she can't actually get beats in arm in
creative<00:02:14.450> mode<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.930> be<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.110> survival

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
creative mode you have to be in survival

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.400 
creative mode you have to be in survival
mode<00:02:15.790> um<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.240> yeah<00:02:17.480> oh<00:02:17.720> that's<00:02:18.200> another

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
mode um but yeah oh that's another

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.760 
mode um but yeah oh that's another
glitch<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.340> say<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.790> um<00:02:20.530> everything<00:02:21.530> went

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
glitch and say that um everything went

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.490 
glitch and say that um everything went
black<00:02:22.130> when<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.400> hit<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.790> pig<00:02:23.120> sir<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.630> one<00:02:24.470> of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
black when I hit the pig sir as one of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.330 
black when I hit the pig sir as one of
the<00:02:24.680> glitches<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.730> 0.8<00:02:26.420> when<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:26.660> bug<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.340> yeah

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the glitches in 0.8 when I bug on yeah

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.040 
the glitches in 0.8 when I bug on yeah
that<00:02:28.520> was<00:02:28.610> pretty<00:02:28.760> much<00:02:28.910> breathing<00:02:29.300> tests<00:02:29.690> on

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
that was pretty much breathing tests on

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.180 
that was pretty much breathing tests on
let<00:02:30.350> me<00:02:30.410> just<00:02:30.470> takes<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.340> out<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.850> go<00:02:32.120> back<00:02:32.300> in

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
let me just takes it out and go back in

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.970 
let me just takes it out and go back in
it<00:02:34.190> usually<00:02:34.400> fixes<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.940> witch<00:02:35.150> there<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.480> go

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
it usually fixes a witch there you go

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.310 
it usually fixes a witch there you go
but<00:02:36.980> yeah<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.280> breeding<00:02:37.610> works<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.030> cows<00:02:38.390> did

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
but yeah the breeding works the cows did

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.320 
but yeah the breeding works the cows did
I<00:02:39.770> mean<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.070> pigs<00:02:40.370> they<00:02:40.850> didn't<00:02:41.090> actually

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
I mean the pigs they didn't actually

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.620 
I mean the pigs they didn't actually
work<00:02:41.750> with<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.320> case<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.450> that's<00:02:44.450> probably

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
work with the case so that's probably

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.330 
work with the case so that's probably
going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.960> be<00:02:45.050> fixed<00:02:45.590> I'm<00:02:45.710> not<00:02:45.860> sure<00:02:46.040> what's

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
going to be fixed I'm not sure what's

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.870 
going to be fixed I'm not sure what's
going<00:02:46.550> on<00:02:46.670> there<00:02:46.730> um<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:49.310> yeah<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:49.670> said<00:02:49.850> that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
going on there um but yeah it said that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.740 
going on there um but yeah it said that
the<00:02:50.120> pigs<00:02:50.630> should<00:02:51.110> eat<00:02:52.070> carrots<00:02:52.760> beets<00:02:53.480> but

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
the pigs should eat carrots beets but
