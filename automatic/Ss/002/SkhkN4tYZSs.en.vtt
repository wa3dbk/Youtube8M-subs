is<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> myth<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:15.750> don't<00:00:16.049> know<00:00:16.440> sea<00:00:16.740> level<00:00:17.390> the

is a myth we don't know sea level the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.870 
is a myth we don't know sea level the
reason<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:18.930> sea<00:00:19.859> level<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.279> constantly

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
