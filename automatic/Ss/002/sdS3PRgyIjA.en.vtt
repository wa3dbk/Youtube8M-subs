 despite existing only g 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.929
 who loved 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.919
 who felt father 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.579
 of all the beings and all the creatures that would come from 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.670
 Listening strength was latent in his spirit 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.400
 in that spirit were all the sciences all the elements all the 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.300
 natures 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.120
 all the principles 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.910

 in which were the past the present and the future even before arising to the 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.810
 life the worlds and beings 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.860
 that divine inspiration came true under the infinite strength of 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.090
 divine love there began life 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.690
 the bosom of God was filled with beings and in all manifested love power and 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.780
 the wisdom of the father 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.539
 creation has life and manifests the power and strength of your lord 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.870
 god is not complicated mysterious confused me in his creation because what 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.000
 perfect is simple 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.730
 in my creation everything lives 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.590
 grows and perfects 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.870
 you are the spirits that from the beginning of creation harris 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.500
 received a mission 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.900
 you have spark of my spirit and you have been endowed with a reason of will and 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.140
 intelligence 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.010
 jose formed in my image and likeness and therefore you are prepared to 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.460
 think feel and love 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.610
 lucid creation is nurtured by me and all spirits live like 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.690
 branches of a tree taking life from him and feeding on his wise 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.440
 How can you think that I am distant or indifferent to 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.570
 your sufferings if I am your teacher 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.090
 your doctor and your father 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.010
 your spirit was created with appropriate attributes to follow through the 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.220
 scale of perfection and reach the goal determined in the high designs of the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.090
 Sir 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.530
 was created for the fight for the lift was not created for inertia 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.339
 for immobility 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.769
 hence because some spirits have become great inspired by the 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.769
 Divine love and in the beauties created by God 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.020
 within those spirits there were those who 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.320
 being great in themselves but small before the infinite of God they wanted 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.430
 virtue to his free will defying the father's designs extending for his 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.490
 own will to dwellings and paths created by them which the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.720
 they separated from the path of perfection and from the father's house 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.400
 that act was his first fall his first disobedience 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.049
 your first mistake 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.829
 just one imperfection is enough to disharmonize in the concert of love 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.809
 divine and its results can only be avoided by returning to the path of 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.229
 final repentance and obedience 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.039
 since the first disobedient got up in front of miley how much 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.189
 misery and how much darkness left in its wake 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.290
 since then evil exists as an invisible force 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.069
 I allow that force to exist only to test them and for 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.989
 yourselves I want is to end badly 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.209
 many spirits returned repentant and surrendered full of pain but also 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.519
 of hope 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.560
 to ask the father to politicize them of those faults 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.719
 some had descended moved by ambition others by curiosity 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.249
 the curious is an intruder in the alien domain 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:36.159
 just as the disobedient is the most terrible enemy of himself 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.199
 more those who soon returned to the father in search of forgiveness were 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.369
 received by perfect love 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:47.249
 their garments were dismantled their erased bitterness and their light returned 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:47.599
 to shine
