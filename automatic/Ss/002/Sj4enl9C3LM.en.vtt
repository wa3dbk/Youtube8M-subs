guys a little bit about ultramarathons

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.299 
guys a little bit about ultramarathons
the<00:00:09.630> definition<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.320> an<00:00:10.440> ultramarathon<00:00:10.860> is

the definition of an ultramarathon is

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.970 
the definition of an ultramarathon is
anything<00:00:12.049> higher<00:00:13.049> than<00:00:13.969> 26.2<00:00:14.969> miles<00:00:15.980> common

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
anything higher than 26.2 miles common

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.570 
anything higher than 26.2 miles common
distances<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:18.330> ultramarathons<00:00:19.140> are<00:00:19.380> 50<00:00:20.340> K

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
distances for ultramarathons are 50 K

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.290 
distances for ultramarathons are 50 K
which<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.720> 31<00:00:22.109> miles<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.750> 50-mile<00:00:24.750> race<00:00:26.000> 100<00:00:27.000> K

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
which is 31 miles a 50-mile race 100 K

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.209 
which is 31 miles a 50-mile race 100 K
which<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.380> 62<00:00:29.750> miles<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> hundred

which is 62 miles and then a hundred

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.260 
which is 62 miles and then a hundred
mile<00:00:32.579> distances<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.690> even<00:00:34.140> beyond<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> those

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
mile distances and even beyond so those

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.020 
mile distances and even beyond so those
are<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> typical<00:00:36.840> ultramarathon<00:00:38.030> distances

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
are the typical ultramarathon distances

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.569 
are the typical ultramarathon distances
and<00:00:41.360> I've<00:00:42.360> done<00:00:42.750> anywhere<00:00:43.410> from<00:00:43.890> my<00:00:44.309> first

and I've done anywhere from my first
ultra<00:00:44.910> marathon<00:00:45.270> was<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> 50k<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.340> also

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
ultra marathon was a 50k and then I also

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
ultra marathon was a 50k and then I also
attempted<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.510> hundred<00:00:48.840> mile<00:00:48.989> race<00:00:49.260> where<00:00:49.620> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
attempted a hundred mile race where I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.000 
attempted a hundred mile race where I
only<00:00:50.129> made<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.430> 66<00:00:51.180> miles<00:00:51.530> which<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
only made it 66 miles which was the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.900 
only made it 66 miles which was the
drop-down<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.149> 100<00:00:54.539> K<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.050> race<00:00:55.610> but<00:00:56.610> as

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
drop-down was 100 K for that race but as

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.810 
drop-down was 100 K for that race but as
far<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.270> training<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.199> an<00:00:58.800> ultra<00:00:59.100> marathon<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
far as training for an ultra marathon I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.260 
far as training for an ultra marathon I
think<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:01.020> need<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.850> get<00:01:02.850> out<00:01:03.030> there

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
think you really need to get out there

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.960 
think you really need to get out there
start<00:01:03.750> running<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:07.280> whether<00:01:08.280> you're<00:01:08.490> doing<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
start running and whether you're doing a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.020 
start running and whether you're doing a
50k<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:11.720> 100k<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:13.049> even<00:01:13.320> 100<00:01:13.740> miles<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.820> need

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
50k or 100k or even 100 miles you need

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
50k or 100k or even 100 miles you need
to<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.600> some<00:01:15.869> good<00:01:16.619> mileage<00:01:17.150> training

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to put in some good mileage training

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
to put in some good mileage training
runs<00:01:18.590> things<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.979> consider<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:23.040> race

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
runs things to consider is for your race

is how are you going to refuel during
the<00:01:26.700> race<00:01:26.880> part<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.960> ultra<00:01:28.200> marathons<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the race part of ultra marathons is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
the race part of ultra marathons is
being<00:01:30.060> able<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.479> eat<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:32.250> good<00:01:32.790> amount<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.270> food

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
being able to eat a good amount of food

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.990 
being able to eat a good amount of food
and<00:01:35.119> recharge<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.549> bonk<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> hit

and recharge so you don't bonk and hit
tons<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> walls<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.150> use

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
tons of walls so one thing I do is I use

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.490 
tons of walls so one thing I do is I use
goo<00:01:44.149> energy<00:01:45.149> gels<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.280> also<00:01:47.280> Clif<00:01:48.240> bars<00:01:48.509> those

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
goo energy gels and also Clif bars those

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.810 
goo energy gels and also Clif bars those
are<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.799> main<00:01:50.070> two<00:01:50.490> sources<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:52.399> caffeine<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
are my main two sources of caffeine and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.370 
are my main two sources of caffeine and
calories<00:01:55.040> during<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.130> race<00:01:56.509> when<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> train<00:01:58.049> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
calories during a race when I train I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.060 
calories during a race when I train I
usually<00:01:58.939> every<00:01:59.939> hour<00:02:00.210> or<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.380> try<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
usually every hour or so I try and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.990 
usually every hour or so I try and
replace<00:02:02.430> at<00:02:02.700> least<00:02:03.180> 100<00:02:04.079> calories<00:02:05.000> depending

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
replace at least 100 calories depending

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.169 
replace at least 100 calories depending
on<00:02:06.090> how<00:02:06.180> hot<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.719> how<00:02:07.079> hard<00:02:07.380> on

later<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.859> when<00:02:49.159> I'm<00:02:49.280> kind<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.579> feeling<00:02:50.030> a

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
later on when I'm kind of feeling a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.879 
later on when I'm kind of feeling a
little<00:02:50.239> out<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.810> giving<00:02:51.590> me<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.680> little

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
little out of it giving me a little

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.399 
little out of it giving me a little
