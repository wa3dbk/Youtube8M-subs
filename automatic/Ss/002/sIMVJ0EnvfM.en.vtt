00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.910
 in this place of ours is wonderful from leading 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.639
 then in the future there will be a left pond and 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.570
 starts from start to markup then 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.580
 two pits select 5 soils for later 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 these buttons could be stones 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.279
 put lined film and then already 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.240
 it is filled with water we decorate correctly that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 main excavation work all finished 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.340
 coincided 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.500
 fly and you get small pebbles 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.239
 to keep the surface smooth 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.730
 and proceed to the formation 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 directly bowl using film 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 strong stones and other decorative 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.030
 of the material - in general, then decorate 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.829
 general concept hole 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.829
 landscape design its already sold 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.880
 at 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.049
 first preliminary 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.869
 markup stones and book version so 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.469
 called and now goes will not put on 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:25.189
 laying surface to 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:27.890
 start the film button finally 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.950
 decorating first I stack 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.520
 dense material so that it prevents 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.560
 damage and then my film will be 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.380
 sweet 2 so nail file and sin will be 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.430
 go chicago film 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.060
 that's how all the traffic goes and two 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.610
 layer 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.530
 now two layers have already been laid 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.870
 get down okay let's go put soft 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.670
 party 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.120
 the main film that will hold 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.800
 water it comes on top is another protective 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.020
 by 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.110
 Today's protective film is more durable 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.869
 which will prevent damage 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.500
 The main film you attach beautiful 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.140
 their blue is not our little lake this 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.530
 very creative process which is not 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.190
 implies some strict rules and 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:29.820
 anxiety is just my task to create 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:35.380
 beautiful forms natural look beautiful 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:38.830
 design what I'm working on now man 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.000
 you need to lay the coastline to create 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.060
 callah effect right here and go then 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.050
 from there to the alpine slide which 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.420
 smoothly go into flat design 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.860
 it will frame 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.860
 this run in which will 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:04.400
 Kuchik crave and rest 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:07.790
 It can be a gazebo but it's all in the hope 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.709
 near future but for now his hands or 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.819
 of this thread it is accurate namely 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.730
 to recreate 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.319
 beautiful trial pansha 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:23.319
 quality of material used logs 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.319
 the stones 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:32.620
 gravel all right tags 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:37.300
 well here's the composition creation outlines 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.160
 external forms completed world by you quite 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.560
 some ground facts 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.380
 add a little gravel of small pebbles 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:49.710
 and plant the plants and the composition will be 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.850
 singing hung out 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:58.690
 here 100 channels will look 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:02.430
 a little bit fussy so far i think when 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.210
 it's all for laziness it will give 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.650
 finished look 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.810
 attention of many labors and concerns 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:17.240
 start the flood of the pool look 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.780
 there and here it is the long-awaited stream of fresh 

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.570

 op op op op op 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.990
 I 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.159
 it is held wonderful head 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.940
 pond or less lake which we 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:38.789
 we will recreate then a little punishing 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.789
 morning is his pulpit 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.990
 the pool is finally filled with water right 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.490
 and the debate on the pond or mini-game 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:54.669
 We have prepared articles no flowers 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.219
 preliminary robes led today 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.189
 will be the most pleasant occupation guidance 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.870
 beauty 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:06.189
 will need to be surrounded by pebbles 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.470
 those who are prepared to be like 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:12.650
 plants 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:16.640
 and our labor will gain 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.640
 during how beautiful the sky reflects 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.640
 around 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.599

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.870
 the outlines of the game are like three points 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.610
 the pebbles are left completely 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.940
 a little bit here to arrange this caretaker 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:03.840
 wait until the aviation little flowers
