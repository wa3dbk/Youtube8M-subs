00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.379
 The first thing we're going to see is our 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.379
 configuration 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.490
 from this configuration we must 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 change it in windows 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.660
 already having this we are going to locate our 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.690
 windows that we have here the first the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.240
 second the third and fourth until 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.070
 down here the fifth one that is my line of 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.730
 time and the sixth that I'm not going to 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.540
 to import 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.100
 now the process to make a dvd is the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.790
 next I'm going to have this side of me 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 menu and my track on the menu I'm going to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.430
 load from this side as vistes templetes 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.430
 I'm going to generate starting we're going to take s 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 interpret 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 I already charge it now on the track I'm going 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.010
 to upload my videos and content 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.070
 here 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.070
 I have 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.370
 now the next step is to import 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.120
 our files on the left side 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.120
 I do not search 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.450
 I have these two I already of the compressor already 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 I made my two files that are audio and 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.860
 video in this case is a m2 v 3 ago 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.500
 these two files he reflected and the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.010
 amounts regardless of the least appear 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.010
 from this side 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.620
 the following work to me I'm going to 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.920
 start working part of my menu 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.200
 and design it, here you can modify 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.860
 maybe it's content 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.840
 heads 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.530
 everything I want to modify the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.320
 cellular to modify 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.580
 and in this area it's called drop show and I 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.040
 I will be able to add part of my video 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.650
 perhaps it is this 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.730
 just dragged are open is 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.890
 playing that video when they're 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.619
 this part below are my buttons every 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.220
 button that they have is a track that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.120
 it will generate 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.120
 in this case 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.370
 we have a loaded tractor 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.780
 It will help me to make my linke or 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.540
 and now to make the link I'm going to 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.099
 give 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:41.209
 to the button with the right to appear to be here 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.920
 back to tracks that is the track this 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.280
 I have here I can change the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.280
 first name 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.530
 let me 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.590
 change one 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.510
 he came back 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.959
 I appear to live one that is the same as 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.959
 I have here 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.319
 now I'm going here to try the tractor video 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.140
 now this line has been generated 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.410
 this line means that you already cleaned me 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.600
 when I click here on my 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.720
 controller 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.790
 all send to this clip 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.920
 The next thing we're going to do is load 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.200
 on the track our video that we have 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.480
 this side has important we give 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.080
 double click to activate it 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.640
 we select the two and we take it 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.350
 dragging it and we put it on the line 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.390
 of time of 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.790
 we must take into account in what 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.830
 We are here site will not charge me going 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.510
 to hit the track 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.840
 if I charge it here if I value it in its 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.840
 suit 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.519
 the next thing we see is of 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.950
 this side we have to transform 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.950
 our video if it does not come in 16 9 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.549
 in this part he will tell you if he comes to 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.939
 the 16 claver this yes but let's less 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:01.709
 again be fine in 43 here we have it 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.709
 what to modify will not be less 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.320
 display down 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.830
 from 43 to 16 of the country they realize they 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.530
 modified the appearance of the obvious 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.010
 now having this is already loaded 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.990
 practically 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.020
 but I want when I finish my 

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.970
 video from here the menu is returned 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.190
 then let's give it from Lyon in the 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.050
 right part of the clip also reactivated 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.389
 click on the menu 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.009
 and my arrows and it's already turned 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.860
 double already I have internal life of 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.840
 I return to the menu and let's see the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.870
 simulation on the top in 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.729
 half we have the one that says if it does not beat 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.129
 this one here is going to show me the 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.150
 simulation of how it would look to see the 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.409
 16 9 we are going to give you here display mode 16 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.330
 9 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.630
 he's going to show me full as I 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.060
 and you modify here before me 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.610
 It makes me normal 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.150
 now I 'm going to explain here a demand 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.350
 of guarantees 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.350
 how many times click 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:54.840
 and this is the process of generating a dvd 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.790
 to burn it 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.790
 in general
