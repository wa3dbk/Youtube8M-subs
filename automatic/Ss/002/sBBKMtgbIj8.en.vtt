00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.340
 for one that was good 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.670
 give me to study philosophy and imagine 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.020
 who studies 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.380
 try to find the answer 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.440
 to situations that have to do with 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:28.130
 questions and so many new mouths 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.110
 good field of study Philosophy 3 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.990
 there are some themes that are classics that 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.540
 they are really exciting like 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.620
 metaphysics that's a field of study for 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.750
 the philosophy that has as we say as 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.760
 object let's say it let's say very 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.670
 briefly aims at the study 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.500
 of god of the soul of the entities that are 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.780
 beyond the physical 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.690
 the idea is to make a rational study of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.330
 that but that's a class theme but there's 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.070
 many other topics that we say that 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.830
 they have a great interest and that they are perhaps 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.780
 more contemporary in particular there is one 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.610
 which is the philosophy of the mind and that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 I find it extremely interesting and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.950
 well it's very topical but good 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.590
 there are many areas and there are many fields 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.619
 that are classic and there are others that are more 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.540
 this newest I started working with 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.020
 a scholarship that is given the university of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.570
 advanced student with that scholarship prepare what 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.520
 that was the thesis that I did on the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.380
 work and the temporal aspects of 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.090
 I work different types of notions of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.520
 work 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.429
 good after that investigation 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.469
 initial that was for the thesis pass to 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.969
 be a bit more exhaustive work 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.579
 which is what I would be starting to do 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.219
 now that good already requires many more 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.250
 critical readings and much much more 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.939
 specific study of the subject a lot 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.350
 reading first after good saying 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.109
 differentiating in the case of how I work 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.479
 I the different types of aspects 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.950
 that has the notion I've spent 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.289
 how many years he said he was going to 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.989
 study political science and a friend 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.149
 the last year of the race gave me the 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.910
 Bachelor's degree curriculum 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.009
 philosophy and I was a few months 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.390
 doubting because there were subject names 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.280
 very strange that sounded to me very 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.950
 interesting but I did not know if he encouraged me 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.840
 to study it and in the end I decided to try a 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.670
 year here in Bahia to see what happened with 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.519
 this race and in the end I finished 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.280
 there are two great possibilities 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.900
 one is teaching I would be interested 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.019
 a lot of teaching in the field 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.849
 university and I would also like to see 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.519
 if it would encourage me at some point to give 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.350
 classes in the secondary and if not the other 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.600
 great side that I think was why 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.820
 has the degree is to do 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.180
 research is divided into practically 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.780
 in 22 lines I think the research in 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.060
 philosophy one that is to work an author 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.770
 specifically and dedicate themselves to the work of 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.500
 that author and another that is to dedicate a 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.020
 topic and in the within that topic see 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.150
 choose which authors are the 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.830
 what else are they used to say this or that 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.780
 thing 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.330
 or see which are the ones that help the most 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.760
 the vision of reality that you have in 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.950
 this moment in my case I chose a theme 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.560
 I chose the topic of work and good and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.780
 then the subject of time let 's say is 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.970
 something very everyday and that we all 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.040
 touch and there I think there is also the other 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.680
 theme the fact that philosophy is not 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.030
 something that is abstracted or removed or in 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.280
 an ideal or idyllic past but it is 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.550
 something that touches us every day 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.550
 weather
