why no one quite knows the reason it
could<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:22.020> his<00:00:22.199> head<00:00:22.410> wasn't<00:00:22.650> screwed<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:23.189> just

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
could be his head wasn't screwed on just

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.060 
could be his head wasn't screwed on just
right<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:24.269> could<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.840> perhaps<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.890> his<00:00:26.010> shoes

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
right it could be perhaps that his shoes

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.460

were<00:00:26.550> too<00:00:26.580> tight<00:00:26.779> but<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> most

were too tight but I think the most

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.919

likely<00:00:28.949> reason<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:29.640> may<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.510> been<00:00:30.750> that

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
likely reason of all may have been that

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.620 
likely reason of all may have been that
his<00:00:30.990> heart<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:32.040> sizes<00:00:32.369> too<00:00:32.820> small
