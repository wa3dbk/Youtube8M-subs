00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.380
 meteor shower of the comet and sun 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.290
 presented by science 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.880
 nasa anticipation is to study as the 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.140
 comet and song is submerged inside 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 of the solar system for a meeting 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.410
 close with the sun in November 2013 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.689
 devastated point-blank by radiation 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.579
 solar the blood yzr probably 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.360
 will become one of the best comets 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.340
 in many years 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.710
 when the nasa swift spacecraft 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.750
 observed the comet in January 2013 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.450
 it was still close to the orbit of 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.820
 jupiter but I was already very active more than 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.530
 112 thousand dust books were expelled 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.530
 of the nucleus of the comet per minute 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.880
 it turns out that a little bit of this dust could 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 end of a land 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.140
 the veteran meteor researcher 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.790
 Paul Baker of the University of Western 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.860
 Ontario has made use of a computer 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.020
 to model the path of dust 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.700
 expelled by comet Jason and his 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.590
 findings suggest that it could provoke 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.080
 an unusual meteor shower 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 for several days around the 12th 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.250
 January 2014 the earth will go through 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.860
 of a small waste stream 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.510
 diameter of the comet and they are says baker the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.400
 resulting rain could have some 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.080
 interesting properties on the one hand 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.060
 could cover the surface of dust 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.250
 the earth 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.320
 according to baker's computer models 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 in the tail of the comet is composed of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.180
 small dust grains no more than a few 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.009
 few microns wide these will hit the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.259
 atmosphere at a speed of about 56 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.820
 kilometers per second because the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.530
 particles are so small they 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.670
 will slow down quickly in the part 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.380
 superior of the atmosphere of the earth 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.420
 instead of burning emitting a 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.030
 flash of light will drift falling 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.500
 gently towards the earth he says he does not know 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.090
 will notice nothing however the rain 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.320
 invisible dust of the comet if it 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.320
 produce will be very slow 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.920
 and it can take months or even years that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.440
 the fine dust is deposited from the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.940
 atmosphere another unusual manifestation of 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.130
 the rain could be the clouds do not 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.259
 innocent 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.119
 the clouds are nonetheless clouds of color 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.100
 electric blue that float above 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.050
 the poles of the earth the latest data 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.660
 spacecraft NASA 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.970
 they suggest that they are produced by dust 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.349
 space the tiny meteoroids 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.180
 act as points where the 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.590
 water molecules gather the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.390
 resulting ice crystals will 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.400
 assemble to form clouds on the edge 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.590
 space itself 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.269
 this is still speculation but the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.129
 come tyson could provide the 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.959
 seeds for a cloud show no 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.700
 use test waves blue 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.650
 electric power over the polar regions of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.540
 the earth may be the only sign 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.079
 visible that a rain of dust is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.079
 taking place 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.610
 Baker points out another curiosity the rain 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.590
 will reach our planet from two 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.360
 directions at a time when the earth 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.560
 pass through the waste stream 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.170
 we will meet with two groups 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.000
 other than comet dust a cloud 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.129
 of dust that follows the comet and are up 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.230
 the sun and another cloud will be moving in 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.990
 the opposite direction away from the sun by 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.150
 the pressure of solar radiation 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.400
 the currents will fall on the sides 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.160
 opposites of the earth simultaneously in 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.830
 my experience says this kind of 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.330
 double hit is unprecedented 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.100
 cooke bill from the middle office 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.170
 environment over meteoroids of the nasa 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.270
 says that little danger to the ships 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.010
 spacecraft in Earth orbit these 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.480
 particles are too small as 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.190
 to penetrate the walls of our 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.200
 satellites and they do not have any 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.070
 possibility against the heavy shielding of 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.020
 the ss however adds the operators 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.490
 of mission should certainly be alert 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.980
 throughout the 12th of January for the 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.510
 possible anomalies the observers of the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.790
 sky probably should be 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.380
 also alerts the chances of seeing 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.780
 some are low but the comet Jason 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.280
 it could be a surprise box for 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.110
 get more information about 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.110
 comet Jason and his visibility from the 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.110
 land stay tuned to science nasa
