00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.910
 good as this all here is not retina 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.250
 with a new video and this is a video 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 about a product from a microphone that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:27.330
 call brown video mike version 2 and this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.980
 microphone is from diesel slr camera ar 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.570
 at this moment I am using a channel 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.030
 of 5 there is and well this microphone I just 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.940
 to buy today approximately the price 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 It's like 170 American dollars in one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 It is a simple video where it shows the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.350
 microphone quality at this time 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.270
 I'm about one meter 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.430
 Distance from the microphone camera 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.220
 and well here I am going to show you the box 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.450
 of the product here is the camera that is 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.210
 similar to mine and here is the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.970
 microphone above the microphone comes with 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.670
 an adapter and you connect the camera and 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.900
 there it is and I do not know if you can notice here 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.050
 something red I'm going to show you a 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.570
 photography in more detail is like the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.100
 shock mail is something that holds the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.200
 microphone but like this also 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.610
 product is not this hard plastic is 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.290
 Something like 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.970
 the elastic is like support and in fact 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.980
 is to protect the microphone against 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.260
 knock sound what it does is help 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.820
 reduce the sounds of blows the 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.170
 step sounds that kind of sounds and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.360
 good the microphone connects 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.760
 directly to the camera with a cable 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.370
 that comes in there this only works 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.170
 with cameras that have this entry 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.580
 microphone 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.979
 the input is this jack 3.5 to ramirez 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.759
 this microphone comes with this two 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.009
 functions that is the direct function and 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.460
 then comes a function that is also 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.790
 as direct but with a filter that 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.800
 reduces the signal to low frequencies 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.259
 this is used to reduce noise from 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.520
 environment maybe or low noises in 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.150
 Shock frequencies can reduce reduce 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.900
 in frequencies 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.810
 and environmental and good the microphone uses 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.299
 batteries uses a 9-volt battery and 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.879
 in fact the battery lasts a lot 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.459
 supposedly here in the product says 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.159
 that a battery can last you up to 100 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.700
 hours of use the product comes with 10 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.700
 years warranty 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.319
 it also comes with a pair one pair reduces 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.269
 and the amount in which the microphone 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.760
 record the volume then if they are 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.700
 let's say at a concert or they're 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.749
 recording a place where there is much this 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.879
 high sound I can show that pair for 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:00.879
 say reduce that sound and to record 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.709
 with better quality and good this is all 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.819
 for now if you have more questions you should 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.340
 leave the details here in the 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.069
 description of the video and more information 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.280

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.269
