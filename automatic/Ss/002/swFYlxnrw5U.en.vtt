one of the only people i mean there's

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.719 
one of the only people i mean there's
probably<00:02:08.590> other<00:02:08.739> people<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.069> imported<00:02:09.580> them

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
probably other people that imported them

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.440 
probably other people that imported them
but<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.539> going<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> be<00:02:10.840> one<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:12.360> very<00:02:13.360> few

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
but it's going to be one of very few

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.759 
but it's going to be one of very few
people<00:02:13.989> in<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.140> united<00:02:14.410> states<00:02:14.470> that

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.350 
they've actually been officially
released<00:02:18.610> over<00:02:19.120> there<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:20.760> was<00:02:21.760> trying<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.150> find

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
released over there I was trying to find

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.119

a<00:02:22.510> store<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.810> stopped<00:02:23.260> all<00:02:23.470> three<00:02:23.830> colors

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
a store that stopped all three colors

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.890 
a store that stopped all three colors
but<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.610> seemed<00:02:24.819> more<00:02:25.030> difficult<00:02:25.540> than<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.780> had

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
but it seemed more difficult than I had

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.800 
but it seemed more difficult than I had
anticipated

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.559
