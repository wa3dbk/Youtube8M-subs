interesting<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.149> don't<00:00:36.300> stop<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:37.050> too

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
interesting we don't stop and think too

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
interesting we don't stop and think too
often<00:00:37.410> about<00:00:37.800> how<00:00:37.950> far<00:00:38.309> websites<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.910> come

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
often about how far websites have come

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.250 
often about how far websites have come
just<00:00:39.120> over<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> last<00:00:39.600> few<00:00:39.809> years<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.140> when

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
just over the last few years but when

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.959 
just over the last few years but when
you<00:00:40.320> really<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.739> stop<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.309> about<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.700> if

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you really do stop and think about it if

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.040 
you really do stop and think about it if
you<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> websites<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.960> were

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
you think about the websites that were

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
you think about the websites that were
popular<00:00:43.230> three<00:00:43.680> four<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.070> five<00:00:44.280> years<00:00:44.550> ago

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
popular three four or five years ago

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
popular three four or five years ago
they<00:00:45.120> are<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.570> fundamentally<00:00:46.230> different<00:00:46.530> from

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
they are so fundamentally different from

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.110 
they are so fundamentally different from
the<00:00:46.739> websites<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:47.280> different<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.789> are

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the websites that are different that are

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.510 
the websites that are different that are
popular<00:00:48.510> today<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
popular today and I think that in a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.650 
popular today and I think that in a
larger<00:00:50.789> sense<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> real<00:00:51.270> estate<00:00:51.420> industry

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
larger sense the real estate industry

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.420 
larger sense the real estate industry
hasn't<00:00:52.050> quite<00:00:52.379> caught<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.129> shift

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
hasn't quite caught up with this shift

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.260 
hasn't quite caught up with this shift
so<00:00:53.550> we're<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> talk<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.180> today

so we're going to talk to you today

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
so we're going to talk to you today
about<00:00:54.420> how<00:00:55.140> websites<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.920> change<00:00:56.160> how<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
about how websites really change how the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.889 
about how websites really change how the
new<00:00:56.579> model<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.059> website<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.480> emerged<00:00:57.719> and

new model the website is emerged and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.540 
new model the website is emerged and
what<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.890> effectively<00:00:59.010> market

from websites a few years ago is that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.399 
from websites a few years ago is that

now<00:02:20.190> one<00:02:20.370> way<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.549> do<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:20.730> that's<00:02:21.030> very<00:02:21.239> easy

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
now one way to do this that's very easy

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.089 
now one way to do this that's very easy
would<00:02:21.690> be<00:02:21.810> through<00:02:22.110> mortgage<00:02:22.560> calculators

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
would be through mortgage calculators

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.740 
would be through mortgage calculators
another<00:02:23.819> way<00:02:23.940> would<00:02:24.060> be<00:02:24.120> linking<00:02:24.599> to

another way would be linking to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.119 
another way would be linking to
something<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.140> Google<00:02:25.319> map<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.799> people

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
something like Google map so that people

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.520 
something like Google map so that people
can<00:02:26.250> view<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.269> surrounding<00:02:27.810> area<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
can view the the surrounding area the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.809 
can view the the surrounding area the
bottom<00:02:28.799> line<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:28.920> buying<00:02:29.250> tools<00:02:29.489> out<00:02:29.790> there

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
bottom line is buying tools out there

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.460 
bottom line is buying tools out there
that<00:02:30.000> either<00:02:30.360> are<00:02:30.450> your<00:02:30.690> own<00:02:30.840> or<00:02:31.079> things<00:02:31.409> that
