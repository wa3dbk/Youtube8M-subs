reasons that I selected this boot over
some<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> other<00:00:36.270> 80<00:00:36.719> boots<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.380> are<00:00:37.530> out

some of the other 80 boots that are out
there

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
there

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
there
first<00:00:39.270> off<00:00:39.480> let's<00:00:39.719> look<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.020> sole<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
first off let's look the sole it's a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220 
first off let's look the sole it's a
Vibram<00:00:41.340> came<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.969> soul<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.989> non

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
Vibram came in soul it's a non

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
Vibram came in soul it's a non
interchangeable<00:00:44.160> non-replaceable<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.570> on

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
interchangeable non-replaceable so on

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.790 
interchangeable non-replaceable so on
sole<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.289> that's<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
sole on this and I think that's going to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.450 
sole on this and I think that's going to
be<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> trend<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:51.660> you'll<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:52.050> more<00:00:52.770> boots

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
be a trend that you'll see more boots

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.549 
be a trend that you'll see more boots
coming<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.360> non<00:00:54.690> interchangeable

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
coming out with non interchangeable

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.709 
coming out with non interchangeable
soles<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> save<00:00:57.090> weight<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
soles I think just to save weight and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
soles I think just to save weight and
reduce<00:00:57.899> cost<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.890> they're<00:00:59.370> finding<00:00:59.579> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
reduce cost and they're finding that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420 
reduce cost and they're finding that
it's<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.329> necessary<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.920> two

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it's just not that necessary to have two

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.380 
it's just not that necessary to have two
different<00:01:02.699> souls<00:01:04.820> one<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.000> unique<00:01:06.360> things

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
different souls one of the unique things

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.270 
different souls one of the unique things
about<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.259> boot<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:07.710> gonna<00:01:07.860> point<00:01:08.130> out

right away and I'm gonna approach this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.750 
right away and I'm gonna approach this

up<00:01:33.479> getting<00:01:33.689> rid<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> them<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.619> they

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
up getting rid of them just because they

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.550 
up getting rid of them just because they
were<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.790> stiff<00:01:36.299> enough<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.840> give<00:01:36.990> me<00:01:37.200> the

were not stiff enough to give me the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
were not stiff enough to give me the
downhill<00:01:38.159> performance<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> wanted

downhill performance that I wanted

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.109

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
they went uphill great I just felt they

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.600 
they went uphill great I just felt they
weren't<00:01:42.329> stiff<00:01:42.630> enough<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.490> make<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
weren't stiff enough to make it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.850 
weren't stiff enough to make it
enjoyable<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.299> me<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.810> ski<00:01:46.079> downhill<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
enjoyable for me to ski downhill and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.649 
enjoyable for me to ski downhill and
that's<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> position<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:48.030> unique<00:01:48.450> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that's not a position that's unique to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.260 
that's not a position that's unique to
me<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.380> speaking<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.920> numerous<00:01:50.549> alpine

skiers that have looked at the 80 boots

skiers that have looked at the 80 boots
they<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.899> felt<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.619> were<00:01:55.680> sacrificing

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
they all felt that they were sacrificing

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.060 
they all felt that they were sacrificing
too<00:01:56.820> much<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.240> downhill<00:01:57.479> performance<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.890> get

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
too much in downhill performance to get

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.009 
stiffer I believe their flex is right
around<00:02:22.709> 130<00:02:23.879> they<00:02:24.879> still<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.269> about<00:02:25.359> a<00:02:25.510> 40

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
a very aggressive forward stance I

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.309 
a very aggressive forward stance I
haven't<00:03:12.639> seen<00:03:12.909> anyone<00:03:13.450> mention<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.049> in

haven't seen anyone mention that in

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.869 
haven't seen anyone mention that in
their<00:03:14.500> reviews<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.250> these<00:03:15.400> scar<00:03:15.730> from

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
their reviews of these scar from

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.149 
their reviews of these scar from
Australia<00:03:16.389> boots<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.319> think<00:03:17.590> that's<00:03:17.859> a

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
Australia boots and I think that's a

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.670 
Australia boots and I think that's a
really<00:03:18.699> key<00:03:19.060> feature<00:03:19.389> to<00:03:19.540> talk<00:03:19.840> about<00:03:19.989> in

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
really key feature to talk about in

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.379 
really key feature to talk about in
visiting<00:03:21.220> with<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.459> guy<00:03:21.729> just<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.180> last

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.210 
weekend who had tried some of the 80
bibs<00:03:24.370> his<00:03:24.729> complaint<00:03:25.269> was<00:03:25.540> they<00:03:26.290> left<00:03:26.680> him<00:03:26.979> in

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.689 
bibs his complaint was they left him in
two<00:03:27.489> upright<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.900> position<00:03:29.340> he<00:03:30.340> comes<00:03:30.549> from

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
two upright of a position he comes from

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.719 
two upright of a position he comes from
a<00:03:30.819> racing<00:03:31.239> background<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.870> he<00:03:32.019> likes<00:03:32.290> that

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
a racing background and he likes that

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.819 
a racing background and he likes that
more<00:03:33.729> aggressive<00:03:33.819> forward<00:03:34.659> lean<00:03:35.019> as<00:03:35.260> boot<00:03:35.530> and

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
more aggressive forward lean as boot and

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.670 
more aggressive forward lean as boot and
I<00:03:36.549> honestly<00:03:37.299> was<00:03:37.540> not<00:03:37.780> aware<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.409> boot

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
I honestly was not aware that this boot

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.430 
I honestly was not aware that this boot
had<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.459> second<00:03:40.030> hole<00:03:40.209> for<00:03:40.989> more<00:03:41.290> aggressive

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
had that second hole for more aggressive

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.009 
had that second hole for more aggressive
forward<00:03:41.979> lean<00:03:42.220> until<00:03:42.819> I<00:03:42.849> removed<00:03:43.359> that<00:03:43.720> walk

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
forward lean until I removed that walk

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.520 
forward lean until I removed that walk
ski<00:03:44.650> mechanism<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.489> saw<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.449> that<00:03:46.629> second

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
ski mechanism and saw that that second

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.439 
ski mechanism and saw that that second
hole<00:03:47.709> was<00:03:47.919> chilled<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.280> there<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.609> removed<00:03:49.359> it

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
hole was chilled in there I removed it

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:50.939 
hole was chilled in there I removed it
because<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.720> was<00:03:49.870> gonna<00:03:49.989> drill<00:03:50.319> a<00:03:50.349> second<00:03:50.799> hole

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
because I was gonna drill a second hole

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.460 
because I was gonna drill a second hole
in<00:03:51.159> and<00:03:51.819> Scarpa<00:03:52.419> had<00:03:52.599> already<00:03:52.840> done<00:03:53.079> it<00:03:53.169> for<00:03:53.199> me

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
in and Scarpa had already done it for me

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.949 
in and Scarpa had already done it for me
so<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.620> think<00:03:53.739> that's<00:03:53.979> a<00:03:54.129> very<00:03:54.549> very<00:03:55.000> nice

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
so I think that's a very very nice

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.800 
so I think that's a very very nice
feature<00:03:56.409> that<00:03:57.040> may<00:03:57.639> be<00:03:57.699> somewhat<00:03:58.419> unique<00:03:58.750> to

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
feature that may be somewhat unique to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.839 
feature that may be somewhat unique to
this<00:03:59.019> boot<00:03:59.229> it<00:03:59.500> may<00:03:59.650> be<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.829> standard<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.549> don't

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
this boot it may be a standard I don't

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
it is a little bit fiddly I guess but I

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.250 
it is a little bit fiddly I guess but I
really<00:04:26.919> like<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.600> they<00:04:28.600> release<00:04:28.930> the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
really like that they release the

really like that they release the
booster<00:04:29.889> structure<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.790> really<00:04:31.630> like<00:04:32.520> that

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
booster structure I really like that

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.730 
booster structure I really like that
when<00:04:33.639> you<00:04:33.790> open<00:04:34.450> this<00:04:34.810> boot<00:04:35.050> up<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.440> makes<00:04:35.620> it

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
when you open this boot up it makes it

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.879 
when you open this boot up it makes it
very<00:04:36.040> easy<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.940> get<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.389> and<00:04:37.480> out<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.680> the

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
very easy to get in and out of and the

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.540 
very easy to get in and out of and the
reason<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.030> easy<00:04:40.389> to<00:04:40.510> get<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.810> out<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.550> is

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
reason it is so easy to get it out of is

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.220 
reason it is so easy to get it out of is
that<00:04:42.850> this<00:04:43.090> time<00:04:45.330> flips<00:04:46.330> completely<00:04:47.050> out<00:04:47.200> of

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
that this time flips completely out of

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.129 
that this time flips completely out of
the<00:04:47.440> way<00:04:47.620> giving<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.580> really<00:04:49.330> wide<00:04:49.750> open

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
the way giving you really wide open

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.230 
the way giving you really wide open
access<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.860> get<00:04:51.010> your<00:04:51.190> foot<00:04:51.490> in<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.910> out<00:04:52.030> of

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
when you put it in walk mode tours so

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.800 
when you put it in walk mode tours so
well<00:05:20.110> or<00:05:20.320> gives<00:05:21.070> me<00:05:21.160> some<00:05:21.340> emotion<00:05:21.850> I<00:05:22.000> don't
