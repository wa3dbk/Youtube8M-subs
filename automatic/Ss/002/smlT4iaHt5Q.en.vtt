 [Desteni] Inter-dimensional space interface interview - Jack - Human History (64) Actual assistance indigo 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.270
 Hey, this is Jack. 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:30.150
 I want to give some practical support for children of Indigo and Crystal; actually support or assist indigo and crystal children. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.570
 What we do in the dimensional space is: we... 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.720
 Sound-bombed the crystal real body within those children 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:50.410
 Second, we are busy examining - how can we... 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.680
 Because it happens within the minds of those children - is as follows: 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.510
 Children have defined (defined) themselves 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.520
 According to that - within their mental consciousness system - the exemplified emotional center 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.900
 So, some children have problems - they have defined who they are based on that (the emotional center) 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.450
 Why do I say that it is a problem, it is a problem - from this point of view: 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.410
 They are so indoctrinated and defined - the equivalent of ... being instantiated within their minds - the emotional center 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.290
 We can't remove it - because if we remove it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.410
 That humans will die because they are so - become part of the entire mental consciousness system 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.570
 That (* emotional center) is being poured into the human body. 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.580
 What you have to remember is as follows: 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.930
 These mentally conscious systems - are trans-dimensionally spatial 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.330
 And their trans-dimensional spatial "realization" is within the human body. 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.540
 And if this person begins to define himself as this system of mind (infused into the human body) - too serious 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.940
 You suddenly removed the system 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 This flesh will die - because 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.180
 The system of the "push" of the human being: is in - and is equivalent to - human body (within and as the human physical body) 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.490
 So, in other words 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.600
 If the system is not there, the human body will not work. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.130
 So - for indigo and crystal children - what is the actual support? 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.390
 At this moment... I will say: 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.380
 We are in the dimension space - working on methods 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.300
 We can "scatter" these centers of mental consciousness - 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.650
 These mentally conscious emotional centers - within the human body of the child, elapsed time 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.100
 Means - we are slow but sure... what we do is as follows: 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.630
 We are based in children, equal to children, and equal to children who are really 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.350
 What we are doing is: 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.230
 We "lifted up" they are the ones - within them 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.570
 Then we allowed them - stand up in their own body - slow but sure - 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.790
 And stand up in Nagan - in - equal to life - they are the performance of the person - 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.900
 These mentally conscious system centers within them - began to move away 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.660
 Slow - very slow 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.490
 We do this - not too fast 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.270
 We do this - at the right pace 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.840
 So...the child's - the real performance of life - begins to appear 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.370
 Now - depending on how much (system) is flooding - 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.630
 We can help by means of measures 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.100
 The other measure is - self forgiveness 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.240
 Good - implementation of self-forgiveness... 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:30.500
 Now, present self-forgiveness to your child... If the child has not been able to... 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.130
 Cooperation / cooperation - from that point of view 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.680
 What you should do is: You are doing self-forgiveness - the equivalent of your child. 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.890
 It’s like putting your child into you, almost like picking up your child - put it in your heart 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.560
 Then you are equal to them - do self forgiveness - for them 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:55.470
 Or, you can write a self-forgive application on paper and read it to your child. 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.650
 Self-forgive applications, such as: 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.180
 I forgive myself - accept and allow myself - define myself based on those emotional reactions 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.630
 I forgive myself - accept and allow myself - often in fear 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.000
 I forgive myself - accept and allow myself - feel frustrated from time to time 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.510
 I forgive myself - accept and allow myself - often lose my temper 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.850
 I forgive myself - accept and allow myself - because of my situation - feel guilty about my parents. 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.520
 Children really feel guilty 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.910
 Parents - most children are quite aware of what happened to themselves. 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.170
 And that's what makes it even more difficult, 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.140
 Because they are quite aware of what is going on with them, but they can’t stop themselves - 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.620
 And this is "not cool" 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.640
 I mean, in the dimension space, I talked to children who have had this experience. 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.840
 And they told me that it was like they were trapped in this body, and 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.630
 They can't escape, and no one can hear them, because it's like the system inside them - all the things are doing 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.760
 - And they just want to come out and say: I am still here! This (system) is not me! 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.060
 They said it was like being trapped in...something doing everything... inside 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.060
 And no one can hear you 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.840
 I don't know if you have the same experience... such as a comatose human (* vegetative) 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.310
 Almost like - feels trapped in the flesh, and no one can hear them 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.930
 The same situation - in terms of the human physical experience, it is completely reversed 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.590
 That is, a big temper... hardship...can't cooperate - like 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.340
 Parents - that's not your child, it's not your child, and you know it. 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.310
 That is the mental consciousness...the emotional center system - in response 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.220
 I explained it in an interview with the previous indigo and crystal children. 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.460
 Your child is here. 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.170
 And we are busy with assistance. We are bringing out the performance of your child (equivalent to life), slow but true 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.820
 Take it easy 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.850
 My advice is: as your child - apply self forgiveness - everything that appears 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.160
 Even your reaction to your child, forgive that; 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.020
 Cleaning up your relationship with your child means - 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.350
 Make sure you don't react to your child's performance, 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.810
 Because that reaction - will also support your child's (emotional) performance to continue 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.310
 Stand up - say: no, stop here! This is not what you are! 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.310
 Speak to your child - equal to equality (mutually equivalent) 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320
 Although their reactions and everything does not seem to be equal (mutually equivalent) to your child's speech - equal to equality (mutually equivalent) 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.120
 Although their reaction and everything does not seem to be equal (equivalent) 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.070
 Your child is "here" - behind these system reactions 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.900
 Just listening to you 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.820
 To inspire your child - the real one is. Your child is not that temper, reaction, unable to cooperate - 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.740
 That is the reaction of the mental consciousness system 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.050
 Start applying equality and integration to your child 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.850
 Say to your child: Stop! This is not what you are. 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.090
 Apply forgiveness.. Equivalent to your child. Apply forgiveness to yourself. Keep an eye out - don't react to your child 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:07:00.180
 Because you are reacting to a system. Your child is really a person...behind the system 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.560
 Ok, thank you. 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:11.380
 If you need any more support, I need more details, you can go to this site: Desteni Universe 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.120
 And I will give you some more specific examples, thank you.
