00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
cool suggestions unstable often nerd

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.450 
cool suggestions unstable often nerd
when<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> had<00:00:19.500> said<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.830> he<00:00:19.949> wanted<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.250> see

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
when I had said that he wanted to see

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.730 
when I had said that he wanted to see
Seth<00:00:20.730> Rollins<00:00:20.970> Phoenix<00:00:21.869> flash<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.470> game

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
Seth Rollins Phoenix flash in the game

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.170 
Seth Rollins Phoenix flash in the game
and<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> can't<00:00:23.250> believe<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.609> didn't<00:00:23.850> even<00:00:23.939> think

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and I can't believe I didn't even think

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.590 
and I can't believe I didn't even think
of<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
of that

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
of that
when<00:00:25.230> making<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.650> video<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> seems<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.279> such

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
when making the video it seems like such

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.220 
when making the video it seems like such
an<00:00:26.640> obvious<00:00:26.730> move<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.300> they<00:00:27.420> need<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.779> have

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
an obvious move that they need to have

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
an obvious move that they need to have
so<00:00:28.619> hopefully<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.130> Phoenix<00:00:29.429> flash<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:30.000> in

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
so hopefully the Phoenix flash is in

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.440 
so hopefully the Phoenix flash is in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
so first up on the list is Randy Orton's
double<00:00:45.239> DDT<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.140> he<00:00:46.230> takes<00:00:46.260> two

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
double DDT this is where he takes two

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.170 
double DDT this is where he takes two
superstars<00:00:46.950> hanging<00:00:47.520> off<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> middle<00:00:47.940> rope

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
superstars hanging off the middle rope

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.360 
superstars hanging off the middle rope
and<00:00:48.390> hit<00:00:48.510> some<00:00:48.690> winded<00:00:48.960> DDT<00:00:49.350> we've<00:00:50.010> seen<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and hit some winded DDT we've seen this

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.369 
and hit some winded DDT we've seen this
countless<00:00:50.610> times<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.690> no<00:00:51.840> reason<00:00:52.199> why

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
countless times so there's no reason why

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.080 
countless times so there's no reason why
it<00:00:52.440> shouldn't<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.309> 16<00:00:53.730> after<00:00:53.969> all

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
it shouldn't be to get 16 after all

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
it shouldn't be to get 16 after all
we've<00:00:54.210> seen<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.960> than<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> double

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
we've seen this more than the double

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.319 
we've seen this more than the double
attitude<00:00:56.250> adjustment<00:00:56.730> that's<00:00:56.940> currently<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
attitude adjustment that's currently the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.240 
attitude adjustment that's currently the
game<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.010> comes<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
game but that's not all when it comes to
