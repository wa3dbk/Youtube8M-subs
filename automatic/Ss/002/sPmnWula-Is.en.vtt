he<00:01:43.630> sent<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.020> back<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.230> us<00:01:44.790> after<00:01:45.870> not<00:01:46.870> using<00:01:47.230> it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
he sent it back to us after not using it

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.900 
he sent it back to us after not using it
for<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.590> few<00:01:47.620> years<00:01:47.980> because<00:01:48.190> he<00:01:48.550> was<00:01:48.580> in<00:01:48.790> this

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
for a few years because he was in this

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.850 
for a few years because he was in this
massive<00:01:49.420> rig<00:01:49.660> that<00:01:49.870> he<00:01:49.960> just<00:01:50.380> doesn't<00:01:50.560> use

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
massive rig that he just doesn't use

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.500 
massive rig that he just doesn't use
anymore<00:01:51.160> and<00:01:51.340> he<00:01:51.880> thought<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.120> we<00:01:52.480> should

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
anymore and he thought that we should

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.800 
anymore and he thought that we should
have<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:53.050> back<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.460> we<00:01:54.580> opened<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.450> up<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.750> of

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
have it back so we opened it up and of

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.540 
have it back so we opened it up and of
course<00:01:55.900> we<00:01:56.080> had<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.320> listen<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.340> were

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
course we had to listen to it and were

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.570 
course we had to listen to it and were
amazed<00:01:57.940> how<00:01:58.360> wonderful<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:58.990> sounded<00:01:59.490> at<00:02:00.490> the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
amazed how wonderful is sounded at the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.850 
amazed how wonderful is sounded at the
same<00:02:00.760> time<00:02:00.970> we<00:02:01.150> have<00:02:01.270> found<00:02:01.510> 150<00:02:02.410> of<00:02:02.740> our

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
same time we have found 150 of our

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.460 
same time we have found 150 of our
original<00:02:03.040> boards<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:04.120> was<00:02:04.300> in<00:02:04.450> his<00:02:04.630> basic

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
original boards that was in his basic

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.400 
original boards that was in his basic
preamp<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.790> we<00:02:06.910> decided<00:02:07.210> we<00:02:07.480> would<00:02:07.660> take<00:02:08.200> the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
preamp so we decided we would take the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.710 
preamp so we decided we would take the
basic<00:02:08.740> design<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.429> go<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.119> little<00:02:10.240> less

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
basic design and go a little less

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.990 
basic design and go a little less
high-tech<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.380> we<00:02:11.500> became<00:02:11.830> later<00:02:12.100> on<00:02:12.340> we

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
high-tech that we became later on we

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.960 
high-tech that we became later on we
started<00:02:13.360> making<00:02:13.450> our<00:02:14.490> preamp<00:02:15.490> right<00:02:15.730> here

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
started making our preamp right here

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.820 
started making our preamp right here
this<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> same<00:02:16.930> as<00:02:17.110> Lee's<00:02:17.320> but<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.680> went<00:02:17.770> to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
this is the same as Lee's but it went to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.970 
this is the same as Lee's but it went to
a<00:02:17.920> single<00:02:18.250> rack<00:02:18.400> space<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.300> we<00:02:19.420> started<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.050> do

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
a single rack space and we started to do

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.070 
a single rack space and we started to do
full<00:02:21.250> regulation<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> high<00:02:22.240> end<00:02:22.270> on<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
full regulation on the high end on the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.820 
full regulation on the high end on the
power<00:02:23.500> supply<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.220> full<00:02:24.700> regulation<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
power supply and full regulation on the

on the the heater supply which makes the
preamp<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.830> lot<00:02:29.980> quicker<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:30.970> process

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
preamp a lot quicker but in the process

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.810 
preamp a lot quicker but in the process
you<00:02:31.570> kind<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.900> do<00:02:32.080> lose<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.740> little<00:02:33.310> bit<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.580> that

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
you kind of do lose a little bit of that

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.820 
you kind of do lose a little bit of that
that<00:02:34.390> tube<00:02:34.690> warmth<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.459> model<00:02:36.760> we

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
that tube warmth so in this model we

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.340 
that tube warmth so in this model we
kept<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.980> exactly<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.850> way<00:02:39.900> leaves<00:02:40.900> was<00:02:41.140> done

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
kept it exactly the way leaves was done

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.150 
kept it exactly the way leaves was done
and<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.260> such<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.740> way<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.600> drives

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and have it in such a way that it drives

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.100 
and have it in such a way that it drives
another<00:02:48.160> tube<00:02:48.430> now<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.300> tube<00:02:49.540> drives<00:02:49.930> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
another tube now this tube drives the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.259 
another tube now this tube drives the
Jensen<00:02:50.560> transformer<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.880> Jensen

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
Jensen transformer the Jensen

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.080 
Jensen transformer the Jensen
transformer<00:02:53.160> drives<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.580> Class<00:02:54.820> C<00:02:54.850> power

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
transformer drives the Class C power

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.690 
transformer drives the Class C power
amplifier<00:02:55.420> with<00:02:56.110> 800<00:02:56.500> watts<00:02:56.680> now<00:02:57.340> because

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
amplifier with 800 watts now because

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.290 
amplifier with 800 watts now because
it's<00:02:58.000> tube<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.540> transformer<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.550> plasti

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
it's tube in transformer and the plasti

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's tube in transformer and the plasti
power<00:03:01.510> amp<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:01.959> very<00:03:02.170> high<00:03:02.410> Phi<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:03.310> also<00:03:03.489> very

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
power amp is very high Phi but also very

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.120 
power amp is very high Phi but also very
neutral<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.780> just<00:03:05.080> passes<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.620> tube<00:03:05.800> sine

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
neutral it just passes the tube sine

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.100 
neutral it just passes the tube sine
sound<00:03:06.790> right<00:03:07.090> out<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.510> other<00:03:07.690> end

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
sound right out the other end

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.500 
sound right out the other end
so<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:09.010> essentially<00:03:09.640> sounds<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.209> like<00:03:10.360> an

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
so it's essentially sounds just like an

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.350 
so it's essentially sounds just like an
800<00:03:10.900> watt<00:03:11.019> tube<00:03:11.260> amplifier<00:03:11.850> not<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.030> anyone

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
800 watt tube amplifier not that anyone

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.750 
800 watt tube amplifier not that anyone
could<00:03:13.570> make<00:03:13.720> one<00:03:13.959> like<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.620> stopped<00:03:15.610> at

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
could make one like that I stopped at

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.110 
could make one like that I stopped at
350<00:03:16.540> myself<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.739> was<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.430> was<00:03:18.549> like<00:03:18.730> 60

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
350 myself and that was that was like 60

350 myself and that was that was like 60
pounds<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.720> was<00:03:19.900> enough<00:03:20.880> anyway<00:03:21.880> this

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
pounds and that was enough anyway this

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.030 
pounds and that was enough anyway this
is<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:26.350> proven<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.769> be<00:03:26.830> very

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040
