00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
ok today I'll be showing you the power

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.599 
ok today I'll be showing you the power
the<00:00:21.810> devastating<00:00:22.470> color<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> trainers

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609

the devastating color of the trainers
version<00:00:24.180> ok<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.800> basically<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.490> see<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
version ok so basically you can see the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.500 
version ok so basically you can see the
you<00:00:27.570> can<00:00:27.599> flex<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.470> ok<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.130> flexible<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.300> not

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
you can flex it ok it's flexible but not

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.900 
you can flex it ok it's flexible but not
super<00:00:31.050> flexible<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.830> go<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
super flexible you can go like that and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
super flexible you can go like that and
it'll<00:00:33.300> bounce<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> ground<00:00:33.870> ok<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.800> can

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
it'll bounce on the ground ok so you can

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.940 
it'll bounce on the ground ok so you can
basically<00:00:35.390> stab<00:00:36.390> things<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.870> bit<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.860> will

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
basically stab things a bit and it will

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.560 
basically stab things a bit and it will
not<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.390> still<00:00:39.660> stab<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.820> ok<00:00:41.820> so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
not see it you can still stab it ok so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.869 
not see it you can still stab it ok so
right<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.680> some<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.460> break<00:00:44.850> up

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
right now here I have some we break up

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.770 
right now here I have some we break up
Oh<00:00:45.120> tiles<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:47.520> blue<00:00:47.730> ones<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
Oh tiles and the blue ones are the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
Oh tiles and the blue ones are the
richer<00:00:49.230> ones<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.710> red<00:00:49.890> ones<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
richer ones the red ones are the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.299 
richer ones the red ones are the
stronger<00:00:50.910> ones<00:00:51.090> these<00:00:51.629> require<00:00:52.230> 25<00:00:52.829> pounds

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
stronger ones these require 25 pounds

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.139 
stronger ones these require 25 pounds
these<00:00:53.789> requires<00:00:54.420> 30<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.980> 35<00:00:56.489> pounds<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.910> force

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
these requires 30 to 35 pounds of force

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.130 
these requires 30 to 35 pounds of force
to<00:00:57.210> brick<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.780> test<00:00:58.320> enough<00:00:58.620> test<00:00:59.579> amount<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.719 

dumbbell<00:01:04.170> ok<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.739> put<00:01:05.070> weight<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
dumbbell ok so I put weight on it and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.210 
dumbbell ok so I put weight on it and
see<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> can't<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.260> let's<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.770> take<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
see what I can't do so let's just take a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.560 
see what I can't do so let's just take a
weak<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:09.110> put<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:11.090> maybe<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.360> two

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
weak one put it here maybe put two

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
weak one put it here maybe put two
bricks<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:14.220> support<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
bricks just to support it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
bricks just to support it
there<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.689> ok<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.710> we're<00:01:17.250> gonna<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there we go ok so we're gonna use the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.050 
there we go ok so we're gonna use the
edge<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.570> smash<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:20.490> ok

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
edge to smash it like that ok

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.219 
edge to smash it like that ok
so<00:01:21.509> let's<00:01:21.689> give<00:01:21.990> some<00:01:22.020> force<00:01:22.500> ready<00:01:24.229> now<00:01:27.229> there

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
so let's give some force ready now there

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.760 
so let's give some force ready now there
we<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.500> ok<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:30.090> did<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:31.350> hard<00:01:31.619> because

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
we go ok so we did it it's hard because

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.520 
we go ok so we did it it's hard because
yet<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.280> chopped<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.850> spot<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.990> let's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
yet we chopped the right spot so let's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.350 
yet we chopped the right spot so let's
try<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:35.060> red<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.710> if<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:39.210> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
try a red one if this is the this is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.760 
try a red one if this is the this is
supposed<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> harder<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:42.500> there<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.590> go

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
supposed to be a harder one there we go

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.020 
supposed to be a harder one there we go
ok<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.149> basically<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:48.479> takes<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> lot<00:01:49.079> of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
ok so basically it takes up a lot of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.060 
ok so basically it takes up a lot of
accuracy<00:01:51.030> testing<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.930> smash<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:52.770> on

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
accuracy testing to smash it right on

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130 
accuracy testing to smash it right on
but<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.060> actually<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
but if you actually get it right on a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.310 
but if you actually get it right on a
spot<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.310> does<00:01:56.549> chop<00:01:57.030> open<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.960> thing<00:01:58.140> is

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
spot it it does chop open the thing is

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.920 
spot it it does chop open the thing is
this<00:01:58.560> thing<00:01:58.799> hits<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> ground<00:02:00.000> first<00:02:00.180> before

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
this thing hits the ground first before

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.510 
this thing hits the ground first before
I<00:02:01.170> can't<00:02:01.409> break<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.799> blade<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.369> actually

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I can't break the blade so it actually

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.730 
I can't break the blade so it actually
hurt<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:02.880> hand<00:02:03.270> doing<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.689> anyway<00:02:04.350> let<00:02:04.649> me

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
hurt my hand doing that anyway let me

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.250 
hurt my hand doing that anyway let me
try<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> stuff<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.659> higher

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.640 

there<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.349> go<00:02:13.269> snap<00:02:14.269> it<00:02:14.450> okay<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.440> was

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
there we go snap it okay so that was

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.670 
there we go snap it okay so that was
pretty<00:02:15.920> fun<00:02:16.629> so<00:02:17.629> no<00:02:17.900> let's<00:02:18.140> do<00:02:18.290> something<00:02:18.530> less

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
pretty fun so no let's do something less

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.860 
pretty fun so no let's do something less
challenging<00:02:18.980> okay<00:02:19.549> so<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.909> Chapra

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
challenging okay so you can Chapra

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.300 
challenging okay so you can Chapra

here let's try again no forget it okay
anyway<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:08.480> by<00:04:09.409> testing<00:04:09.830> this<00:04:09.950> out<00:04:10.129> okay<00:04:10.670> we

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
anyway so by testing this out okay we

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.990 
anyway so by testing this out okay we
actually<00:04:11.720> tested<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.349> durability<00:04:13.099> of<00:04:13.310> the

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
actually tested the durability of the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.410 
actually tested the durability of the
plate

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
plate

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.270 
plate
I'm<00:04:14.840> not<00:04:15.019> testing<00:04:15.349> myself<00:04:15.500> okay<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.010> can

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
I'm not testing myself okay I can

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.650 
I'm not testing myself okay I can
actually<00:04:16.430> break<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:16.910> thing<00:04:16.970> but<00:04:17.239> who<00:04:17.419> cares

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
actually break this thing but who cares

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.409 
actually break this thing but who cares
um<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:18.440> thing<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:19.040> want<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.310> break<00:04:19.549> things

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
um the thing is you want to break things

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.990 
um the thing is you want to break things
to<00:04:20.660> test<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.590> durability<00:04:21.949> of<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.550> edge<00:04:22.699> and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
to test the durability of the edge and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.279 
to test the durability of the edge and
you<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.240> see<00:04:23.419> hitting<00:04:23.720> all<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.960> hard<00:04:24.229> stuff

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
you can see hitting all the hard stuff

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.620 
you can see hitting all the hard stuff
it's<00:04:25.070> not<00:04:25.310> going<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.699> do<00:04:25.789> any<00:04:25.940> damage<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.419> it

it's not going to do any damage to it
even<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.440> tip<00:04:27.680> right<00:04:27.889> here<00:04:27.919> still<00:04:28.699> very

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
even the tip right here still very

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.560 
even the tip right here still very
strong<00:04:29.180> after<00:04:29.600> hitting<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.990> lot<00:04:30.139> of<00:04:30.289> stuff<00:04:30.560> and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570
