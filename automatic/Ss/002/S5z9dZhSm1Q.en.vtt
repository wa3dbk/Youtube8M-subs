00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
talking about the the proper odd

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.650 
talking about the the proper odd
technique<00:00:15.889> as<00:00:16.070> far<00:00:16.100> as<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.550> dental<00:00:17.060> caning

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
technique as far as the dental caning

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.140 
technique as far as the dental caning
well<00:00:18.380> we<00:00:18.949> did<00:00:19.130> we<00:00:19.250> did<00:00:19.369> a<00:00:19.400> little<00:00:19.820> bit<00:00:19.910> of<00:00:20.000> talk

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
well we did we did a little bit of talk

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.670 
well we did we did a little bit of talk
about<00:00:20.390> some<00:00:20.539> additional<00:00:20.750> techniques<00:00:21.350> that<00:00:21.590> we

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
about some additional techniques that we

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.740 
about some additional techniques that we
could<00:00:21.830> use<00:00:22.070> when<00:00:22.820> you<00:00:22.939> really<00:00:23.210> can't<00:00:23.449> slide

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
could use when you really can't slide

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.810 
could use when you really can't slide
you<00:00:23.960> have<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.470> headliner<00:00:24.859> over<00:00:25.279> far<00:00:25.519> enough

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
you have the headliner over far enough

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.710 
you have the headliner over far enough
and<00:00:26.119> in<00:00:26.750> fact<00:00:27.609> we<00:00:28.609> started<00:00:28.789> this<00:00:29.090> -<00:00:29.269> I<00:00:29.420> started

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
and in fact we started this - I started

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.330 
and in fact we started this - I started
for<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.140> first<00:00:30.170> time<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:30.560> did<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:30.920> technique

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
for the first time I did this technique

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.140 
for the first time I did this technique
this<00:00:31.490> morning<00:00:31.849> and<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:33.710> works<00:00:34.430> great<00:00:34.580> so<00:00:35.000> I'm

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
this morning and it works great so I'm

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.610 
this morning and it works great so I'm
going<00:00:35.270> to<00:00:35.300> show<00:00:35.450> you<00:00:35.480> what<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.810> is<00:00:35.840> it<00:00:36.230> involves

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
going to show you what it is it involves

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.440 
going to show you what it is it involves
the<00:00:36.740> mini<00:00:36.920> lifter<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:37.370> I<00:00:37.700> think<00:00:37.970> Joel<00:00:38.240> from

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
the mini lifter and I think Joel from

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.290 
the mini lifter and I think Joel from
Canada<00:00:38.870> actually<00:00:39.700> suggested<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.790> idea<00:00:40.940> to

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
Canada actually suggested the idea to

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.440 
Canada actually suggested the idea to
begin<00:00:41.600> with<00:00:41.830> but<00:00:42.830> we<00:00:43.520> had<00:00:43.670> some<00:00:43.820> dents<00:00:44.030> in<00:00:44.210> here

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
begin with but we had some dents in here

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.210 
begin with but we had some dents in here
on<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:44.750> roof<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.110> were<00:00:45.200> much<00:00:45.530> larger<00:00:45.800> than

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
on this roof that were much larger than

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.550 
on this roof that were much larger than
this<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:47.480> specifically<00:00:47.990> I'm<00:00:48.170> talking<00:00:48.230> about

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
this and specifically I'm talking about

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.150 
this and specifically I'm talking about
this<00:00:48.800> one<00:00:48.980> right<00:00:49.010> here<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:50.980> this<00:00:51.980> is

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
this one right here so this is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.800 
this one right here so this is
definitely<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:52.910> has<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.300> potential<00:00:53.630> to

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
definitely and it has the potential to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.060 
definitely and it has the potential to
oil<00:00:54.080> can<00:00:54.260> but<00:00:54.410> it's<00:00:54.530> going<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.680> I'm<00:00:54.920> going<00:00:54.950> to

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
oil can but it's going to I'm going to

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.980 
oil can but it's going to I'm going to
be<00:00:55.130> able<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.340> show<00:00:55.490> you<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.760> principle<00:00:56.300> of<00:00:56.450> how

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
be able to show you the principle of how

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.810 
be able to show you the principle of how
this<00:00:57.260> works<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:57.800> actually<00:00:58.280> works<00:00:58.490> a<00:00:58.640> lot

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
this works this actually works a lot

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
like the you know a lot like the prop

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.280 
like the you know a lot like the prop

rod and stuff it's you know I'm going to
put<00:01:03.470> some<00:01:03.590> tension<00:01:03.770> on<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.100> outside<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.760> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
put some tension on the outside of the

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
is I kept the feet at the very edge of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.570 
is I kept the feet at the very edge of
the<00:01:23.660> dent<00:01:23.870> ok<00:01:24.800> went<00:01:24.950> ahead<00:01:25.010> and<00:01:25.220> put<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.340> nickel

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
the dent ok went ahead and put a nickel

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.750 
the dent ok went ahead and put a nickel
sized<00:01:25.940> tab<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.720> here<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:27.920> tighten<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.640> up

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
sized tab in here and just tighten it up

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.300 
sized tab in here and just tighten it up
just<00:01:28.820> enough<00:01:29.330> where<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.930> were<00:01:30.080> left<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:31.220> know

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
just enough where it were left you know

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.649 
just enough where it were left you know
some<00:01:31.520> good<00:01:31.640> pressure<00:01:31.970> right<00:01:32.300> here<00:01:32.450> at<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
some good pressure right here at the

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.390 
some good pressure right here at the
bottom<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.110> dent<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.980> so<00:01:34.100> now<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.310> can

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
bottom of the dent and so now I can

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.540 
bottom of the dent and so now I can
actually<00:01:34.700> go<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.210> here<00:01:35.240> with<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:37.100> sharp<00:01:37.370> tip

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
actually go in here with the sharp tip

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.149 
actually go in here with the sharp tip
tool

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.639

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
and make my pushes and it is just much

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.330 
and make my pushes and it is just much
stiffer

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
stiffer

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:55.660 
stiffer

the<00:02:11.600> dent<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:11.930> level<00:02:13.330> right<00:02:17.200> maybe<00:02:18.200> five

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
the dent to this level right maybe five

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.770 
the dent to this level right maybe five
or<00:02:18.470> ten<00:02:18.650> minutes<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.070> guys<00:02:19.190> think<00:02:19.490> all<00:02:20.390> right

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
five minutes but anyhow we got a little

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.309 
five minutes but anyhow we got a little
bit<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.030> where<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.209> had<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.780> kind<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.140> tighten

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319

bit of where I had to kind of tighten
that<00:02:27.500> thing<00:02:27.560> up<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:29.060> thing<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.480> going<00:02:29.570> to

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that thing up so this thing is going to

be you know I'm going to do a little bit
of<00:02:31.730> some<00:02:31.970> 2000<00:02:32.600> on<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.500> finish<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.220> out<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
of some 2000 on it to finish it out and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.979 
of some 2000 on it to finish it out and
we'll<00:02:34.670> go<00:02:34.790> ahead<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.090> get<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.300> shot<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.690> as

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
we'll go ahead and get a shot of that as

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.590 
we'll go ahead and get a shot of that as
well<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:37.310> literally<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:38.000> mean<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.330> mini

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
well but literally I mean this mini

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.800 
well but literally I mean this mini
lifter<00:02:39.050> stabilized<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.280> thing<00:02:40.750> not<00:02:41.750> only

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
lifter stabilized that thing not only

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.509 
lifter stabilized that thing not only
for<00:02:42.230> pushing<00:02:43.160> but<00:02:43.580> for<00:02:43.910> tapping<00:02:44.209> down<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:46.100> you

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
for pushing but for tapping down so you

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.759 
for pushing but for tapping down so you
know<00:02:46.550> like<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.030> said<00:02:47.150> we<00:02:47.300> always<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.870> think<00:02:48.410> when

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
know like I said we always I think when

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.229 
know like I said we always I think when
you<00:02:48.860> got<00:02:48.950> stretch<00:02:49.250> metal<00:02:49.670> like<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.060> one

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
you got stretch metal like that one

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.900 
you got stretch metal like that one
right<00:02:50.480> there<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:50.959> was<00:02:51.260> had<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.800> really<00:02:52.190> Rock

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
right there that was had a really Rock

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.229 
right there that was had a really Rock
Sodom<00:02:53.360> solid<00:02:53.900> bottom<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:56.030> know<00:02:56.120> you're

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
Sodom solid bottom on it you know you're

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.610 
Sodom solid bottom on it you know you're
going<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.390> have<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.600> little<00:02:56.900> bit<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> few<00:02:57.260> push

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
going to have a little bit a few push

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.199 
going to have a little bit a few push
marks<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.160> bottom<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.790> then<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.090> my

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
marks in the bottom of it then in my

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.150 
marks in the bottom of it then in my
opinion<00:02:59.540> if<00:02:59.660> you're<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.110> know<00:03:00.230> you're<00:03:01.040> going

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
opinion if you're you know you're going

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.199 
opinion if you're you know you're going
to<00:03:01.190> worry<00:03:01.370> about<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.640> texture<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
to worry about the texture of the

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.060 
to worry about the texture of the
vehicle<00:03:02.600> on<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.750> retail<00:03:03.079> hail<00:03:03.350> damage<00:03:03.680> car<00:03:03.890> like

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
vehicle on a retail hail damage car like

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.160 
vehicle on a retail hail damage car like
this<00:03:04.329> I'm<00:03:05.329> going<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.540> go<00:03:05.630> in<00:03:05.750> there<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.049> I'm

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
this I'm going to go in there and I'm

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.330 
this I'm going to go in there and I'm
going<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.350> wet<00:03:06.470> sand<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.829> out<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.310> little

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
going to wet sand that out just a little

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.449 
going to wet sand that out just a little
bit<00:03:08.110> bring<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> texture<00:03:09.680> down<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.160> level

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
bit bring the texture down to the level

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.420 
bit bring the texture down to the level
to<00:03:10.489> where<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:11.570> know<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.019> disappeared<00:03:12.950> so

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
to where you know it's a disappeared so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.000 
to where you know it's a disappeared so
we<00:03:14.239> did<00:03:14.390> use<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.570> sharp<00:03:14.900> tip<00:03:15.079> on<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.620> you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
we did use a sharp tip on it and you

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.370 
we did use a sharp tip on it and you
know<00:03:16.130> shrinking<00:03:16.700> in<00:03:16.790> my<00:03:16.910> opinion<00:03:17.239> is<00:03:17.390> you<00:03:18.290> know

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
know shrinking in my opinion is you know

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.910 
know shrinking in my opinion is you know
very<00:03:18.620> important<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:19.190> dent<00:03:19.459> like<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.850> so

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
very important on a dent like this so

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.650 
very important on a dent like this so
just<00:03:21.920> stay<00:03:22.100> tuned<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.610> we'll<00:03:22.730> get<00:03:22.880> our<00:03:23.150> final

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
just stay tuned and we'll get our final

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.060 
just stay tuned and we'll get our final
shots<00:03:24.880> guys<00:03:25.880> here<00:03:26.299> we<00:03:26.420> are<00:03:26.450> with<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.500> finished

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
shots guys here we are with the finished

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.060 
shots guys here we are with the finished
product<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:29.320> mean<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.470> came<00:03:30.620> out<00:03:30.829> absolutely

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
product I mean it came out absolutely

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.819 
product I mean it came out absolutely
great<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.209> only<00:03:32.450> reason<00:03:33.170> we<00:03:33.290> did<00:03:33.470> any<00:03:33.620> wet

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
great the only reason we did any wet

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.479 
great the only reason we did any wet
sanding<00:03:34.220> at<00:03:34.310> all<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.420> damaged<00:03:35.750> area<00:03:36.110> is

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
sanding at all in the damaged area is

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.949 
sanding at all in the damaged area is
just<00:03:37.489> because<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.910> did<00:03:38.299> some<00:03:38.420> shrinking<00:03:38.810> with<00:03:38.930> a

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
just because I did some shrinking with a

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.720 
just because I did some shrinking with a
sharp<00:03:39.260> tip<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.799> had<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.100> was<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.400> little<00:03:40.430> bit

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
sharp tip and it had it was a little bit

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.030 
sharp tip and it had it was a little bit
textured<00:03:41.180> at<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:41.450> point<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.989> know<00:03:42.140> just

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
textured at that point you know just

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.670 
textured at that point you know just
slightly<00:03:43.400> not<00:03:43.760> enough<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:45.320> know<00:03:45.350> be

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
slightly not enough to you know be

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.860 
slightly not enough to you know be
permanent<00:03:46.220> in<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.370> paint<00:03:46.640> but<00:03:47.329> enough<00:03:47.600> where

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
permanent in the paint but enough where

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
my opinion when we were talking about

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.650 
my opinion when we were talking about
the<00:04:50.600> prop<00:04:50.870> rod<00:04:51.139> video<00:04:51.729> he<00:04:52.729> suggested<00:04:53.539> this

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
the prop rod video he suggested this

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.200 
the prop rod video he suggested this
technique<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:55.520> date<00:04:55.699> I<00:04:55.729> guess<00:04:55.910> I'm<00:04:56.180> the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
technique and to date I guess I'm the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.460 
technique and to date I guess I'm the
first<00:04:56.510> one<00:04:56.690> who<00:04:56.900> put<00:04:57.139> it<00:04:57.229> on<00:04:57.350> video<00:04:59.350> one<00:05:00.350> of<00:05:00.410> the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
first one who put it on video one of the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.750 
first one who put it on video one of the
first<00:05:00.620> opportunities<00:05:00.889> I<00:05:01.310> actually<00:05:01.460> thought

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
first opportunities I actually thought

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.990 
first opportunities I actually thought
about<00:05:01.820> trying<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:02.840> in<00:05:03.199> my<00:05:03.320> opinion<00:05:04.000> guys

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
about trying it and in my opinion guys

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.920 
about trying it and in my opinion guys
this<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.300> going<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.479> save<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.720> lot<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:06.229> panels<00:05:06.669> so

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
this is going to save a lot of panels so

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.400 
this is going to save a lot of panels so
there<00:05:08.930> you<00:05:09.050> have<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:10.930> stay<00:05:11.930> tuned<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.289> see

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
there you have it stay tuned and see

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:23.870 
there you have it stay tuned and see
what<00:05:12.500> we<00:05:12.560> come<00:05:12.680> up<00:05:12.740> with<00:05:12.860> next<00:05:13.099> time
