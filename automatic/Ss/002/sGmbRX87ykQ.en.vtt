bit of an open-ended question so here's

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.450 
bit of an open-ended question so here's
the<00:00:39.030> way<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.420> typically<00:00:39.989> answer<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.620> first<00:00:41.309> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the way I typically answer it first I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580 
the way I typically answer it first I
ask<00:00:41.670> them<00:00:41.910> how<00:00:42.540> much<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.410> make

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
get there if you go through the ideal

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
history show that a person of average

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.080 
history show that a person of average
work<00:00:54.180> ethic<00:00:54.600> will<00:00:54.870> make<00:00:55.610> $50,000<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.820> first

year<00:00:57.390> how<00:00:58.230> did<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.590> come<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> number

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
year how did we come up with that number

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.990 
year how did we come up with that number
because<00:01:00.480> our<00:01:00.750> model<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.410> based<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.010> making<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
because our model is based on making a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
because our model is based on making a
minimum<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:04.049> hundred<00:01:04.199> dollars<00:01:04.710> per<00:01:04.949> load

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
minimum of one hundred dollars per load

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.630 
minimum of one hundred dollars per load
and<00:01:05.510> moving<00:01:06.510> two<00:01:06.900> loads<00:01:07.229> per<00:01:07.560> day<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and moving two loads per day that's it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.390 
and moving two loads per day that's it
just<00:01:09.060> two<00:01:09.330> loads<00:01:09.630> per<00:01:10.020> day<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.220> course

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
just two loads per day now of course

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370 
just two loads per day now of course
people<00:01:11.700> make<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> lot<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.360> than<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:12.900> one

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
people make a lot more than just one

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.499 
people make a lot more than just one
hundred<00:01:13.740> dollars<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.430> times<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.360> they

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
hundred dollars at times and they

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
hundred dollars at times and they
certainly<00:01:15.750> move<00:01:16.110> more<00:01:16.409> than<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.950> loads<00:01:17.250> at

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
certainly move more than two loads at

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.719 
certainly move more than two loads at
times<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.869> an<00:01:19.049> average<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> minimum

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
times but on an average and at a minimum

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.179
