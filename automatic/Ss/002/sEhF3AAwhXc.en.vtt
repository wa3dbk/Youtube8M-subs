00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.959
 some today I'm here again from a flight 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 save to teach the other three this 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:20.420
 it's catering from the previous expansion 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.390
 but good they teach it and just 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.610
 here on the dark coast of indoor kaun 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:32.169
 at coordinates 52 32 not the most you see 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.780
 that there is a whirlpool here 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.720
 all the seagulls dancing 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.970
 flying so unique and pretty 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.310
 I bring a huge waterfall with its 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.860
 swirl to the bottom such 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.860
 over there hurricane that by the way there is a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.320
 Cow circling 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.030
 good and what I wanted to show you to see 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.030
 if I did not kill myself it was this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 fly 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.489
 goodbye the fighter 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.159
 now it is delivered to me where people go to 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.130
 leave 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.640
 so let's see if the rounds end and I 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.640
 they leave some 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:22.190
 The specific side is here 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.390
 that here inside there is a lady who gives you 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.950
 the option to get out of here 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.950
 a nice place 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 and here we look for them 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.810
 it's cracked will be sucker 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.920
 and here inside is the man who 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.290
 for the alliance is a cost and for the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.570
 true is a bug that is there 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.300
 Look, it 's very nice 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.270
 and I make mine 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.250
 or not 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.250
 He has spent me 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 let's make a tremendous 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.200
 and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.200
 and while it is done to me 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:25.320
 I come Thursday where for the three that 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.320
 send to take by sack 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.260
 jesse running 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.980
 Well, here is this man, then 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.140
 to leave leaving a footprint more 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.770
 fantastic 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.770
 taking 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.770
 it can always come out like this 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:57.420
 let a cave full of mushrooms 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.420
 that expel something hallucinogenic 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:06.260
 and it comes out just 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.470
 in front of the whirlpool of the swirl in 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.470
 finish 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.110
 Well, nothing is a curiosity if 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.000
 you have led an alliance 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.090
 you know better but few people see you in 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.550
 this side and if you have remained fat what 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.020
 more sure is that you do not know to come to 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.360
 do the chorra and what does the 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.720
 swirl and if I teach someone you that 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.280
 the crazy leaves it because I hope you like it 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.520
 and thank you very much for having seen the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.520
 video
