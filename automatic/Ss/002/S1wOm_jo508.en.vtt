but<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.420> interesting<00:01:36.690> point<00:01:37.080> about<00:01:37.229> it

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
but the the interesting point about it

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.100 
but the the interesting point about it
is<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.860> looks<00:01:38.190> like<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.610> has<00:01:38.880> Arsenal<00:01:39.720> quality

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
is it looks like it has Arsenal quality

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.779 
is it looks like it has Arsenal quality
David<00:01:40.619> tells<00:01:40.800> me<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.069> does<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.399> Arsenal

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
David tells me it does have Arsenal

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.699 
David tells me it does have Arsenal
quality<00:01:42.149> and<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.690> significantly<00:01:43.470> cheaper

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
quality and it's significantly cheaper

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.680 
quality and it's significantly cheaper
than<00:01:43.950> Arsenal<00:01:44.700> rifles<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.209> I'm<00:01:45.300> not<00:01:45.450> bashing

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
than Arsenal rifles and I'm not bashing

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.749 
than Arsenal rifles and I'm not bashing
optional<00:01:46.140> rifles<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.560> all<00:01:46.679> I<00:01:46.709> think<00:01:47.310> they're<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
optional rifles at all I think they're a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.300 
optional rifles at all I think they're a
great<00:01:48.090> rockets<00:01:48.539> but<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.289> this<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.800> is<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
great rockets but I think this is a is a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
great rockets but I think this is a is a
good<00:01:50.489> bargain<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.330> somebody<00:01:51.599> want<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> get

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
good bargain for somebody want to get

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.510 
good bargain for somebody want to get
into<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> make<00:01:52.319> a<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.069> is<00:01:53.220> probably

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
into a make a I think this is probably

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.520 
into a make a I think this is probably
the<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.390> he's<00:01:54.599> got<00:01:54.780> him<00:01:54.899> priced<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.709> cheapest

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the way he's got him priced the cheapest

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:24.400 
the way he's got him priced the cheapest
