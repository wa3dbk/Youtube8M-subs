00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 now we are all going for depression 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.139
 the pump is here the pump is all the 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.920
 room 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.020
 not only extractor there is no corner 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.300
 but disable here so the more 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.000
 large spacious where to place the voice 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.110
 this map is special because 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.690
 those pumps are one if they are different to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.660
 rest and good let's start with the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.290
 ninja sites but let's start again 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 with this site that would be like that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.910
 I'm going to change because now I like more 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.910
 it's better and just beige if they come in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.840
 perfectly and tell you that it has come out 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 an optics 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.590
 and I want to have as an example now 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.590
 second place a great 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.710
 and here below you can hear the bomb you see 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.560
 they want through who goes out and we go 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.189
 I just went out 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.189
 and what is 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.790
 through the window the crystals so that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.790
 as well 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:36.430
 the organisms would be like him and then we 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.600
 you can put up there it 's fine 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.600
 we have a friend of this one 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.410
 All this 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.510
 but good the case would be that also 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.510
 he is 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:13.040
 lay down the development before they left me 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:18.800
 it's almost impossible and then we'll have 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:23.260
 further from jumping but these would be 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.260
 the main tips with an example 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.350
 the pump is placed 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.920
 make it activated 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.420
 we talk ahead excellent 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.420
 prepare for the next round 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.200
 a break 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.670
 and here we continue with the pump must and 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.860
 you have also seen it, we are running 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.050
 very fast backwards because the team 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.850
 enemy reappears 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.380
 at the same distance as bears like that 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.760
 that if they go to sarkozy buildings get to 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.590
 do any if we start with this that 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.680
 is the nearest 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.420
 in this also that is testing us 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.799
 it covers very well this you have to control 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.209
 the camouflage I also recommend you that 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.299
 offers the sniper so he 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.920
 blocks very very advanced towards where 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.989
 many come down with the sniper himself 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.880
 but without a doubt it is the most recommended by 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.560
 my part 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.989
 what 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:45.780
 and we start already with for example this here 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:48.770
 I 've got myself this 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.770
 to the selection 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.800
 and then enter you will discover the 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.400
 hallways girls so what better to do 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.870
 I 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.560
 that will be the pump and trunks to see 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.410
 from behind for care 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.360
 it came to us all because to be seen 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.040
 from here we think with the good but 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.790
 well this does not try very much is very 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.790
 close many times 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.830
 and finally so I forgot that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.830
 I have put 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.240
 above 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 that 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.939
 aleph ibros perfect 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.030
 Well, I 'm going to leave with my example 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.310
 online this 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.790
 less level to bring it there are a 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.930
 little more in reacting 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.729
 since in one hour 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.419
 even a little 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.470
 and let's say the bomb again strange here 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.360
 inside 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.620
 when you see simply always 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.150
 deactivate all 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.740
 I hope you liked it and I 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.070
 I just leave you with the example 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.610
 on-line 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.610
 and good bye
