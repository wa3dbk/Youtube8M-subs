00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:09.330
 as you will see I had a problem with the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.030
 code 43 some you already have had 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.400
 found the correct solution is 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.519
 looking in pages that told you that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.730
 you have to remove the battery suck it and 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.720
 that would be restored to nothing that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.880
 nothing do not fight that looked in pages 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.259
 I have searched in the microsoft some 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 bad information microsoft here and the 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.210
 another day between a page and they told me 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.160
 they explained to me what it would be like 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.770
 do ok then we get into panel 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.480
 of control 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 systems and security 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.070
 the security system puts the center 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.020
 of activities put review the state 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.340
 of the team solving problems change 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.739
 combination control of accounts 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.680
 User solved usual rules 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.879
 of the team is worth it and let's see what 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.879
 what was it that had to be given here 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:09.500
 and having the device that narrates the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.580
 code 43 in the plugged in is valid for 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.190
 that the program 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.930
 look for the driver or the device 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.240
 that is wrong to return it to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.630
 update voucher and we would give it as a 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.630
 moment 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.070
 this would be the white code x 43 the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
 hardware and sound 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.660
 and this would find you the the problem now 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.620
 because I have not plugged in because I already 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.240
 repair that code okay we go there and you 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.210
 we give here again hardware and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.900
 dispositives 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.940
 and here in the program itself I would look for 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.450
 that is the failure that and I would return it to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.380
 restore 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.259
 you would return to that code 43 but that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.950
 next would detect the problem that 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.740
 is 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.390
 and it would help you to repair the system and 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.119
 or had even thought to take it to a 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.810
 computer that I said I'll look for it 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.610
 before taking it to see that that 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.410
 problem that and loneliness got me and 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.849
 solve the problem right now I'm going 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.660
 to say that it is possible that they have 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.069
 local detected 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.920
 the hardware changes is because I do not have 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.210
 a plugged in truth is true and I hope 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.920
 that has helped you in something 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.230
 subscribe if you like my channel give

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.720
