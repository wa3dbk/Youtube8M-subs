00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.606
plants make their own food like this

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.280
Carbon dioxide, chlorophyll

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:19.602
Water, sunshine, fill the bill

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.460
Photosynthesis

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.740
plants make their own food like this, you see

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.320
Carbohydrates made from the sun
 those plants make food for everyone

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.400
Plants possess chloroplasts

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.660
what are those things, you might ask

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.580
they capture sunlight's energy

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.680
to help make food for plant and trees

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.550

sunlight, water, CO-2

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.693
plants don't take much for all they do

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.520
give us carbs and oxygen

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.520
we need green plants if we're to win

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.640
they give us food

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.640
those plants and trees

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.500
they help us breathe

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.680
some make us sneeze!

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.480
wheat and corn, just what we need

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.760
lima beans, sunflower seeds

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.600
peppers, pumpkins, pears, and peas,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.440
those things come from plants and trees

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.560
rice, and barley, your oatmeal

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.720
we eat plants at most meals

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.800
apes, and mice, and humans can't

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.490
neither can a bee nor ant

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.570
but ferns, and firs, and maples can

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.560
don't need to use no frying pan

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.680
Make their own food

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.820
don't need to eat

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.640
photosynthesis?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.760
really sweet!

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.680
photosynthesis,
plants make their own food like this

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.540
carbon dioxide, chlorophyll

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.538

PHOTOSYNTHESIS

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.260
plants make their own food like this you see

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.460
So here's the photosynthesis equation

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:59.206
A plant uses carbon dioxide from the air

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:00.824
along with water and light energy

00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:03.045
that's the energy absorbed by chloroplasts

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.167
and through the process of photosynthesis

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:07.271
converts those to carbohydrates

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:08.998
oxygen and water

00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:11.751
not only do the plants use the carbohydrates to live

00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:15.358
almost all living things rely on the foods
 plants make to survive

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.500
and when we're hungry it's understood

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.720
the foods plants make taste really good

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:23.585
apples, limes, red tomatoes

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.540
sugar, syrup, sweet potato

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.755
carrots, chocolate, coffee, tea,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.580
cherries, chilies, celery...

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.370
