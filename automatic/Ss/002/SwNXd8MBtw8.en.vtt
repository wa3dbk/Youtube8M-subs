00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.890
 actually here is the site in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.710
 campus where every evening in Tomsk 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.630
 lovers of riding sides are going to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.150
 that is literally a hundred meters away 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.639
 Residential houses and facilities are located 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.449
 who experience constant discomfort 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.189
 from the sound of loud silencers to residents 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.810
 this area of ​​the city accounts for 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.740
 several times contact the duty officer 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.600
 part of the traffic police 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 complaints of violation of peace and quiet 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.130
 evening time in turn employees 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.500
 traffic police in the amount of several 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.719
 and god 'go to the place and disperse 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.219
 lovers of extreme driving along the way 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.110
 fines and drivers for excessive 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.739
 tinted and loud right accurate 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.230
 silencers 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.870
 Well, as for trips to such 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.170
 traffic police activities but before 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.440
 just goes on calls coming in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.660
 the on duty part is locks coming in and from 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.210
 city ​​residents and from other participants 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.489
 road traffic basically comes in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.350
 information of such a plan is collected 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.439
 motorists mean at the sites then 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.119
 there are about and definitely places they have 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.479
 walk and in the same places they 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.150
 going but it shows some but 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.470
 extreme driving elements 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.790
 breaks the rules of the road 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 but also create some inconvenience for 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.640
 residents of the city of Tomsk by and large 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.220
 all correct drivers break and traffic 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.990
 punishes however among that majority 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.409
 motorists who are speaking simple 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.780
 by language 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.520
 twist pyataks their pleasure there and 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.189
 those for which it is not just entertainment 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.509
 these are regular automotive participants 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.079
 competition discipline 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.880
 elevator in the winter just workout is obtained 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.009
 most effective because during 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.850
 first you can afford more and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.710
 no more wasted 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.119
 rubber is less than one oil in the second 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.880
 in winter, the skoy section is slightly smaller, that is 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.640
 you can drive closer you have more 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 time to allow your action 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.720
 calculate of course I would like my 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.430
 a separate site could come 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.950
 no one bothers could not engage 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.670
 this but unfortunately it does not have it yet 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.540
 desire to study is very big 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.880
 separate specialized area 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.920
 or track is the real solution path 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.330
 The current problem on such tracks is not 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.640
 only athletes could conduct 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.319
 their training but also ordinary drivers 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.120
 would have the opportunity to practice 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.709
 extreme driving elements 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.870
 which would be an excellent preparation 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.230
 which is in our Siberian road 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.530
 conditions just need to be necessary 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.769
 give them the opportunity to do something like that 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.319
 they could come to some place 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:44.709
 could hang out there could mean there 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.860
 spin your little trick 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.810
 lead the soul and already in the city you are 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.610
 believe me they will be much 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.829
 less desire to do this because 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.810
 we are now in the street area 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.790
 Ivanovsky here behind my back yet 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.070
 a half two years ago functioned 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.680
 sports trails school dynamo boost 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.579
 as you see here is a wasteland where 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.200
 most likely there will be new residential buildings 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.980
 it was the last official 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.209
 car sports track in Tomsk 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.920
 still rely on the selection 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.799
 some kind of budget to create 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.650
 such a track is not worth but hope 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.109
 on the allocation of land for him all the same 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.880
 maybe that's why we'll continue this topic 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.880
 our next releases
