bottom and a tube of paint down here I

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.189 
bottom and a tube of paint down here I
like<00:00:39.760> it<00:00:39.879> gets<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:40.090> little<00:00:40.239> more<00:00:40.449> abstract<00:00:40.930> and

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
like it gets a little more abstract and

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.110 
like it gets a little more abstract and
what<00:00:41.860> we're<00:00:42.010> going<00:00:42.160> to<00:00:42.340> do<00:00:42.460> is<00:00:42.640> we're<00:00:42.820> going<00:00:42.969> to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.479 
what we're going to do is we're going to
use<00:00:43.449> this<00:00:43.600> as<00:00:43.780> set<00:00:43.930> up<00:00:44.020> as<00:00:44.140> an<00:00:44.260> overlay<00:00:44.489> whereas

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
use this as set up as an overlay whereas

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.660 
use this as set up as an overlay whereas
it<00:00:45.609> as<00:00:45.760> an<00:00:46.359> overlay<00:00:46.510> for<00:00:46.780> background<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:48.070> then

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
it as an overlay for background and then

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.939 
it as an overlay for background and then
we're<00:00:49.239> going<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.840> combine<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.469> with<00:00:50.500> an<00:00:50.769> edge

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
we're going to combine it with an edge

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.279 
we're going to combine it with an edge
from<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.430> previous<00:00:51.879> set<00:00:52.149> so<00:00:52.780> what<00:00:53.019> we're<00:00:53.140> going

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
from a previous set so what we're going

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.009 
from a previous set so what we're going
to<00:00:53.440> do<00:00:53.559> first<00:00:53.590> is<00:00:54.160> we<00:00:54.550> are<00:00:54.670> going<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.210> open<00:00:55.390> up<00:00:55.690> a

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
to do first is we are going to open up a

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.049 
to do first is we are going to open up a
blank<00:00:56.739> 16<00:00:57.489> x<00:00:57.940> 24<00:00:58.480> file<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.730> we're<00:01:00.879> going<00:01:01.000> to

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
blank 16 x 24 file and we're going to

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.669 
blank 16 x 24 file and we're going to
open<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.329> up<00:01:01.390> at<00:01:01.539> 240<00:01:02.079> just<00:01:02.260> because<00:01:02.530> that's

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
open it up at 240 just because that's

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:13.110 
open it up at 240 just because that's
what<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:02.920> work<00:01:03.160> with<00:01:03.339> out<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.760> Lightroom<00:01:12.120> so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
what I work with out of Lightroom so

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.320 
what I work with out of Lightroom so
here<00:01:13.300> we<00:01:13.420> are<00:01:13.510> with<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:14.130> no<00:01:15.130> this<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:16.120> size

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
here we are with that no this is size

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.070 
here we are with that no this is size
that<00:01:16.780> 16<00:01:17.560> by<00:01:17.740> 20<00:01:17.800> I<00:01:18.370> don't<00:01:18.940> really<00:01:19.330> care<00:01:19.780> that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
that 16 by 20 I don't really care that

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.750 
that 16 by 20 I don't really care that
it's<00:01:20.410> a<00:01:20.500> different<00:01:20.800> proportion<00:01:21.280> because<00:01:21.460> i

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
it's a different proportion because i

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.400 
it's a different proportion because i
don't<00:01:21.940> care<00:01:22.330> if<00:01:22.360> it<00:01:22.840> warps<00:01:23.230> or<00:01:23.410> if<00:01:23.590> it's<00:01:25.410> you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
don't care if it warps or if it's you

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.590 
don't care if it warps or if it's you
know<00:01:26.530> distorted<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:27.250> some<00:01:27.520> some<00:01:28.240> sort<00:01:28.510> of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
know distorted in some some sort of

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.330 
know distorted in some some sort of
fashion<00:01:28.990> because<00:01:29.170> it's<00:01:29.680> just<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:30.040> bunch<00:01:30.220> of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
fashion because it's just a bunch of

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.980 
fashion because it's just a bunch of
paints<00:01:30.640> mirrors<00:01:30.940> so<00:01:31.450> we're<00:01:31.600> going<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.840> drag

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
paints mirrors so we're going to drag

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.860 
paints mirrors so we're going to drag
and<00:01:32.170> drop<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.350> over<00:01:32.920> here<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:34.330> whole<00:01:34.510> shift

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
and drop it over here the whole shift

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.900 
and drop it over here the whole shift
when<00:01:35.080> I<00:01:35.110> do<00:01:35.230> it<00:01:35.530> it's<00:01:35.710> going<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.430> drop<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.790> right

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
when I do it it's going to drop it right

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.210 
when I do it it's going to drop it right
in<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.120> middle<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.630> file<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:41.620> I<00:01:41.860> honestly

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
in the middle of the file and I honestly

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.910 
in the middle of the file and I honestly
I<00:01:42.490> like<00:01:42.670> kind<00:01:43.180> of<00:01:43.240> how<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.570> right<00:01:43.750> there<00:01:43.920> but

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
I like kind of how it is right there but

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.380 
I like kind of how it is right there but
let's<00:01:45.130> go<00:01:45.310> ahead<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.550> shrink<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:45.940> down<00:01:46.000> just

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
let's go ahead and shrink this down just

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.040 
let's go ahead and shrink this down just
a<00:01:46.480> smidge<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:50.400> that<00:01:51.400> works<00:01:51.610> with<00:01:51.760> me<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.780> from

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
a smidge and that works with me so from

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.850 
a smidge and that works with me so from
here<00:01:53.200> we're<00:01:53.380> going<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:53.560> do<00:01:53.620> a<00:01:53.680> couple

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
here we're going to do a couple

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.310 
here we're going to do a couple
different<00:01:54.070> things<00:01:55.020> we've<00:01:56.020> got<00:01:56.050> our

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320

different things we've got our
background<00:01:56.860> basically<00:01:57.040> made<00:01:57.580> for<00:01:58.000> our<00:01:58.450> photo

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
background basically made for our photo

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.720 
background basically made for our photo
but<00:01:59.320> now<00:01:59.470> we<00:01:59.530> have<00:01:59.800> to<00:01:59.950> come<00:02:00.100> through<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.640> we

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
but now we have to come through and we

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.150 
but now we have to come through and we
have<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.000> tweak<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.690> make<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.900> custom<00:02:02.410> to

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
have to tweak it and make a custom to

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.430 
have to tweak it and make a custom to
what<00:02:03.430> we're<00:02:03.610> working<00:02:03.790> on<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:05.080> what<00:02:05.290> we're

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
what we're working on so what we're

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.170 
what we're working on so what we're
going<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.740> do<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.070> we're<00:02:06.280> going<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.580> drop<00:02:06.820> this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
going to do is we're going to drop this

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.139 
going to do is we're going to drop this
edge<00:02:07.540> on<00:02:08.170> top<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:08.979> background<00:02:09.580> now<00:02:09.970> that

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
edge on top of this background now that

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.750 
edge on top of this background now that
we're<00:02:10.270> making<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.810> saw<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.650> one<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:11.920> our<00:02:12.489> set

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
we're making I saw this one in our set

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.030 
we're making I saw this one in our set
from<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.810> edge<00:02:13.959> grunge<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.799> I<00:02:14.890> thought

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
from the the edge grunge and I thought

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.510 
from the the edge grunge and I thought
kind<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.459> pany<00:02:15.730> looking<00:02:16.420> splattered<00:02:16.900> wood

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
kind of pany looking splattered wood

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.000 
kind of pany looking splattered wood
good<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.210> pany<00:02:18.480> looking<00:02:18.990> background<00:02:19.530> so

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
good on this pany looking background so

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.720 
good on this pany looking background so
what<00:02:20.160> we're<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.460> do<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.610> we're<00:02:20.700> just

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
what we're going to do is we're just

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.370 
what we're going to do is we're just
going<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.000> drag<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.360> drop<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.510> over<00:02:21.780> here<00:02:23.210> and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
going to drag and drop it over here and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.990 
going to drag and drop it over here and
I'm<00:02:25.380> just<00:02:25.410> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.680> ctrl<00:02:26.010> T<00:02:26.220> free<00:02:26.550> transform

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
I'm just going to ctrl T free transform

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.900 
I'm just going to ctrl T free transform
and<00:02:27.410> if<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.530> hold<00:02:28.770> shift<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.400> pull<00:02:29.610> from<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
and if I hold shift and pull from the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.660 
and if I hold shift and pull from the
corners<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.770> rotate<00:02:31.770> around<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.280> will<00:02:32.460> keep

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
corners and rotate around it will keep

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.510 
corners and rotate around it will keep
it<00:02:32.850> locked<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.300> at<00:02:33.690> your<00:02:34.560> main<00:02:35.160> different

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
it locked in at your main different

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.570 
it locked in at your main different
angles<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> 90<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.870> 180<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> 45

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
angles so like a 90 and 180 and the 45

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.880 
angles so like a 90 and 180 and the 45
is<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.850> between<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.990> hold<00:02:40.140> shift<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
is in between and if I hold shift and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.740 
is in between and if I hold shift and
alt<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.580> pull<00:02:41.790> from<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> corner<00:02:42.270> just<00:02:42.540> going

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
alt and pull from the corner just going

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.390 
alt and pull from the corner just going
to<00:02:42.810> make<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.170> bigger<00:02:43.440> sort<00:02:43.860> filling<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
to make that bigger sort filling in the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.240 
to make that bigger sort filling in the
box<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.500> right<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:46.710> starting<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.130> look<00:02:47.190> really

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
box so right now starting to look really

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.970 
box so right now starting to look really
busy<00:02:47.820> but<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.390> see<00:02:48.570> how<00:02:48.810> we've<00:02:49.530> got<00:02:49.740> just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
busy but you can see how we've got just

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.210 
busy but you can see how we've got just
these<00:02:50.130> three<00:02:50.190> layers<00:02:50.580> going<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.090> here<00:02:52.100> we<00:02:53.100> go

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
these three layers going on here we go

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.700 
these three layers going on here we go
ahead<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.490> close<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.410> now<00:02:55.410> we're<00:02:55.560> going

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
ahead and close this and now we're going

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.000 
ahead and close this and now we're going
to<00:02:55.800> drop<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.340> image<00:02:56.760> onto<00:02:57.650> this<00:02:58.650> clipping

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
to drop this image onto this clipping

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.520 
to drop this image onto this clipping
mask<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.970> again<00:03:00.690> if<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.050> drag<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.350> drop

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
mask so again if I just drag and drop

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.590 
mask so again if I just drag and drop
him<00:03:01.800> over<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.550> hold<00:03:02.760> shift<00:03:03.060> while<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.270> do<00:03:03.480> it

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
him over and a hold shift while I do it

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.700 
him over and a hold shift while I do it
it'll<00:03:03.810> drop<00:03:03.960> it<00:03:04.110> right<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> middle<00:03:06.710> close

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
it'll drop it right in the middle close

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.010 
it'll drop it right in the middle close
that<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.390> we're<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.570> make<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.930> a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
that and we're going to make it just a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.420 
that and we're going to make it just a
little<00:03:10.050> bit<00:03:10.320> bigger<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.680> we're<00:03:11.010> sure<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.340> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
little bit bigger so we're sure that it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520 
little bit bigger so we're sure that it
covers<00:03:11.580> up<00:03:11.850> my<00:03:12.000> clipping<00:03:12.360> mask<00:03:12.540> area<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.140> ctrl

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
covers up my clipping mask area so ctrl

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.340 
covers up my clipping mask area so ctrl
t<00:03:13.770> hold<00:03:14.310> alt<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.760> shift<00:03:15.060> make<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.290> a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
t hold alt and shift make it just a

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.700 
t hold alt and shift make it just a
little<00:03:16.380> bit<00:03:16.620> bigger<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:19.290> if<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.470> come<00:03:19.680> over

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
little bit bigger and if I come over

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.860 
little bit bigger and if I come over
here<00:03:20.070> where<00:03:20.370> my<00:03:20.400> layers<00:03:20.760> are<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.720> hold

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
here where my layers are and if I hold

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.740 
here where my layers are and if I hold
alt<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.560> click<00:03:22.650> between<00:03:23.520> these<00:03:23.910> guys<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.510> will

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
alt and click between these guys it will

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.180 
alt and click between these guys it will
create<00:03:25.080> with<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.320> clipping<00:03:25.620> mask<00:03:25.830> for<00:03:26.010> me

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
create with the clipping mask for me

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.840 
create with the clipping mask for me
which<00:03:26.850> drops<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.390> into<00:03:27.570> this<00:03:28.170> edge<00:03:28.820> so<00:03:29.820> a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
which drops it into this edge so a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.100 
which drops it into this edge so a
couple<00:03:30.030> things<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.420> noticed<00:03:30.690> right<00:03:30.840> off<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
couple things I noticed right off the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.230 
couple things I noticed right off the
bat<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.650> don't<00:03:31.709> want<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.250> being<00:03:32.790> right<00:03:33.060> by

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
bat is I don't want this being right by

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.600 
bat is I don't want this being right by
his<00:03:33.510> face<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.680> easiest<00:03:34.830> way<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.220> get<00:03:35.430> rid

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
his face so the easiest way to get rid

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.640 
his face so the easiest way to get rid
of<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.120> click<00:03:36.540> on<00:03:36.750> my<00:03:36.990> clipping<00:03:37.410> layer

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
of that is to click on my clipping layer

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.360 
of that is to click on my clipping layer
and<00:03:37.920> paint<00:03:38.880> black<00:03:39.330> onto<00:03:39.990> it<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.830> using<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.190> big

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and paint black onto it just using a big

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.100 
and paint black onto it just using a big
soft<00:03:41.670> brush<00:03:43.790> compared<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.940> top<00:03:45.120> here<00:03:45.420> and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
soft brush compared to the top here and

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.500 
soft brush compared to the top here and
if<00:03:46.740> we're<00:03:46.890> just<00:03:47.040> paint<00:03:47.220> black<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.270> it's

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
if we're just paint black on to it it's

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.860 
if we're just paint black on to it it's

situate<00:04:20.850> them<00:04:22.760> something

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
situate them something

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.970 
situate them something
on<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:25.550> darker<00:04:25.880> side<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:29.230> this<00:04:30.230> close<00:04:30.650> move

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
on the darker side of it this close move

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.420 
on the darker side of it this close move
it<00:04:31.070> down<00:04:32.800> something<00:04:33.800> there<00:04:33.920> is<00:04:34.010> pretty<00:04:34.190> close

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
it down something there is pretty close

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.630 
it down something there is pretty close
so<00:04:35.210> we're<00:04:35.420> getting<00:04:35.570> better<00:04:36.340> we're<00:04:37.340> going<00:04:37.520> to

so we're getting better we're going to

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.730 
so we're getting better we're going to
come<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.390> layer<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:42.110> my<00:04:42.200> paintbrush

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
come to this layer to my paintbrush

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.170 
come to this layer to my paintbrush
layer<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.250> we're<00:04:43.400> going<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.730> play<00:04:43.940> with<00:04:44.090> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
layer and we're going to play with the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.850 
layer and we're going to play with the
blending<00:04:44.570> modes<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.200> little<00:04:45.440> bit<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.710> give

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
blending modes just a little bit to give

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.910 
blending modes just a little bit to give
it<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:46.040> more<00:04:46.070> finish<00:04:46.880> refined<00:04:47.390> look<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.740> if<00:04:48.830> I

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920

it a more finish refined look so if I
click<00:04:48.980> on<00:04:49.310> this<00:04:49.490> layer<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:50.060> come<00:04:50.480> to<00:04:50.570> my

I like that one normally I don't have
something<00:05:04.880> in<00:05:05.180> mind<00:05:05.420> as<00:05:05.720> I'm<00:05:05.900> going<00:05:06.080> through

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
something in mind as I'm going through

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.900 
something in mind as I'm going through
these<00:05:06.620> I'm<00:05:06.860> just<00:05:07.160> scrolling<00:05:07.430> through<00:05:07.760> them

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
these I'm just scrolling through them

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.120 
these I'm just scrolling through them
and<00:05:08.060> whatever<00:05:08.270> one<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.690> like<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.140> best<00:05:09.380> is<00:05:09.860> the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
one that we end up using there are rhyme

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.040 
one that we end up using there are rhyme
and<00:05:13.610> reasons<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.120> how<00:05:14.300> these<00:05:14.510> are<00:05:14.630> grouped<00:05:14.930> the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
and reasons to how these are grouped the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.930 
and reasons to how these are grouped the
way<00:05:15.170> they're<00:05:15.350> grouped<00:05:15.650> such<00:05:16.340> as<00:05:16.490> making<00:05:16.670> them

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
way they're grouped such as making them

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.210 
way they're grouped such as making them
lighter<00:05:17.210> making<00:05:17.690> them<00:05:17.780> darker<00:05:18.230> taking<00:05:19.100> out

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
lighter making them darker taking out

the greys taking out the lights into
blocks<00:05:22.780> I'm<00:05:23.780> thinking<00:05:23.990> I<00:05:24.380> like<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:26.620> and

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
blocks I'm thinking I like that and

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.740 
blocks I'm thinking I like that and
let's<00:05:28.850> do<00:05:29.000> one<00:05:29.150> more<00:05:29.180> thing<00:05:29.330> let's<00:05:29.600> put<00:05:29.720> a
