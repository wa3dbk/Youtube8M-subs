from 2500 to 7,000 K and depending on
how<00:03:10.280> they<00:03:10.520> light<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:12.170> different<00:03:12.740> moods

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
how they light is the different moods

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.220 
how they light is the different moods
and<00:03:13.550> modes<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.330> you'll<00:03:14.600> get<00:03:14.780> with<00:03:14.840> this

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
and modes that you'll get with this

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.870 
and modes that you'll get with this
lighting<00:03:16.300> very<00:03:17.300> clever<00:03:17.690> idea

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880
