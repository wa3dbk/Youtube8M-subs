the<00:00:25.920> actual<00:00:26.099> back<00:00:26.580> plate<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:28.109> actually

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the actual back plate is it's actually

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.160 
the actual back plate is it's actually
it<00:00:28.800> will<00:00:28.890> act<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.550> riser<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.720> backrest

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
it will act as a riser of the backrest

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.250 
it will act as a riser of the backrest
so<00:00:32.420> it<00:00:33.420> actually<00:00:34.579> what<00:00:35.579> he<00:00:35.700> will<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:39.260> to

10 10 millimeters I think it's a
deranged<00:00:57.680> 4<00:00:58.680> millimeters<00:00:59.449> in<00:01:00.449> our<00:01:00.629> interest

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
deranged 4 millimeters in our interest

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
deranged 4 millimeters in our interest
on<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:04.010> push<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
you'll have to remove these four screws

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.710 
you'll have to remove these four screws
here<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.700> back<00:01:20.850> play<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> stop

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
here in the in the back play in the stop

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:39.219 
here in the in the back play in the stop
using<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.619> ratchet

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.260 

the<00:01:40.229> construction<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.189> deep<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the construction of the deep the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.569 
the construction of the deep the
backplate<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.869> very<00:01:43.409> solid<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> storing<00:01:44.429> it

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
backplate is very solid and storing it

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.289 
backplate is very solid and storing it
actually<00:01:44.969> weights<00:01:45.979> it's<00:01:46.979> quite<00:01:47.310> quite<00:01:48.000> heavy

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
actually weights it's quite quite heavy

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.709 
actually weights it's quite quite heavy
outside<00:01:49.280> it's<00:01:50.280> around<00:01:50.610> three<00:01:51.479> pounds

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
outside it's around three pounds

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
outside it's around three pounds
probably<00:01:53.270> probably<00:01:54.270> more<00:01:54.990> or<00:01:55.170> less<00:01:55.319> this<00:01:58.969> so

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
probably probably more or less this so

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.830 
probably probably more or less this so
the<00:02:00.600> actual<00:02:00.959> weight<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.709> flat<00:02:01.979> plate

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
the actual weight of this flat plate

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.710 
the actual weight of this flat plate
will<00:02:03.840> impact<00:02:04.289> in<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.739> way<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.459> are

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
will impact in the way when you are

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.949 
will impact in the way when you are
rising<00:02:06.720> or<00:02:07.649> lowering<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.429> deceit<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.239> remove

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
rising or lowering the deceit you remove

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.170 
rising or lowering the deceit you remove
that<00:02:09.989> after<00:02:10.560> removing<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> four<00:02:11.280> screws<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
that after removing the four screws you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.870 
that after removing the four screws you
will<00:02:12.329> end<00:02:12.510> up<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.250> then<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:16.880> put

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
will end up with that and then you put

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:27.949 
will end up with that and then you put
it<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.329> that<00:02:18.480> position

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:49.170 

then<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.140> have<00:02:29.410> to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.720 

so<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.420> order<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.690> tighten<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.430> screws<00:02:52.430> on<00:02:52.610> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
so in order to tighten the screws on the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.330 
so in order to tighten the screws on the
bond<00:02:53.030> with<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.840> nuts<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:54.380> will<00:02:54.500> need<00:02:54.680> for

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
bond with the nuts you will need for

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.630 
bond with the nuts you will need for
this<00:02:55.430> stage<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.090> right<00:02:56.300> ship<00:02:56.830> with<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.040> 10

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
this stage the right ship with the 10

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.920 
this stage the right ship with the 10
millimeters<00:02:59.180> socket<00:03:00.100> as<00:03:01.100> well<00:03:01.400> as<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.930> Adhan

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
millimeters socket as well as the Adhan

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:54.360 
millimeters socket as well as the Adhan
reg<00:03:03.170> island<00:03:04.010> range<00:03:04.220> formula<00:03:05.150> models

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.760 

so<00:03:55.370> we<00:03:55.610> are<00:03:55.820> half<00:03:56.320> halfway<00:03:57.320> through<00:03:57.620> the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
so we are half halfway through the

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.050 
so we are half halfway through the
process<00:03:58.220> we<00:03:58.880> have<00:03:59.060> install<00:03:59.450> via<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.760> de<00:04:01.760> stock

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
process we have install via the de stock

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.260 
process we have install via the de stock
the<00:04:02.420> stock<00:04:02.500> support<00:04:03.500> from<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.830> original<00:04:04.670> seed

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
the stock support from the original seed

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.010 
the stock support from the original seed
then<00:04:06.110> you'll<00:04:06.350> have<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.770> push<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.910> push<00:04:08.840> it

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
then you'll have to push it push it

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:19.590 
then you'll have to push it push it
through<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.920> seed<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:15.680> those<00:04:16.370> two<00:04:16.640> pieces

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.180 

this<00:04:20.600> is<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.870> way<00:04:21.020> you<00:04:21.080> mount<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.709> you

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
this is the way you mount it and you

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.590 
this is the way you mount it and you
will<00:04:22.430> hold<00:04:22.730> it<00:04:22.940> using<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.940> four<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:29.300> four

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
will hold it using the four the four

backrest inclination a little bit

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:00.100 
backrest inclination a little bit
further<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:58.190> that's<00:04:58.400> that's<00:04:59.330> pretty<00:04:59.540> much<00:04:59.780> it

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
further and that's that's pretty much it

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.520 
further and that's that's pretty much it
and<00:05:00.610> once<00:05:01.610> you<00:05:01.790> have<00:05:01.970> tightened<00:05:02.960> all<00:05:03.230> these
