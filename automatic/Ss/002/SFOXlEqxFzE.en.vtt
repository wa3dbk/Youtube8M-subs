00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.800
 and already 64 insured are warm 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.750
 Welcome to the press conference after the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.619
 fourth semi final game ev landshut went 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.779
 against the bidigheim steelers of in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.039
 stood 36 in today's game and in the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.020
 series 0 to 4 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.580
 with me the two trainer are the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.470
 crews kevin gaudet of the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.570
 bidding home steelers and toni krinner from 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 ev landshut 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.650
 First of all , how do you get started? 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.660
 our guests coach kevin cordial 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.950
 Congratulations on the victory today and the speed 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.750
 short statement from your side please 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.820
 give 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.480
 you see what happens when you shoot 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.289
 not the first gate the truth finally 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.190
 the first goal was scored and it was one 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.550
 play to the end with the note 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 they would have some very good protections 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.129
 chances and the disc actually would have 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.689
 only sometimes you need disc luck 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.200
 last title is just not there because 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.130
 Of course they had the four 4 is made 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.020
 as always his game but I think that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.820
 series I was decided today that was 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.759
 of course the last two games where we are 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.369
 really have the ladies taken 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.080
 this 2030 and hard 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.720
 swing us in the moment we are real 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.729
 I already said last game 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.770
 really no other level i 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.170
 have not seen whole season 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.450
 we play the best season best 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.610
 Hockey after months is not easy 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.119
 in the moment to beat us when we are 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.220
 beautiful 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.770
 you need a bit of luck and me 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.579
 think plant has not had much to 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.920
 whole series 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.420
 but of course we are happy 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:02.229
 go to the final and yes 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:06.619
 that was it thank you very much thank you kevin 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:09.560
 kuranyi that's 0 to four short 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.280
 statement to your view of the game me 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.069
 believe what with distance of the scarcest and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.420
 fearful player from my 60 thinks that 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.280
 you will also see it like this or mine too 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.510
 a nice dig congratulation 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.350
 kevin and and the bidigheim steelers 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.959
 who deservedly made it to the final 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.260
 kevin said it is incredibly difficult 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.690
 At the moment it looks like it's turning in 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 the last two years with security 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.330
 the best ice hockey in the league where you 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.549
 see where is played and they have 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.290
 just the right one in every moment 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.470
 answer given 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.230
 the team is so smart so smart 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.920
 Divorate with confidence 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.930
 that actually for the other semi-final 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.859
 Pairing the best advice will stop you 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.630
 they would tolerate 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.769
 the first two blocks foyer the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.209
 team collection then you have 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.269
 maybe a chance against bidigheim 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.510
 I think we have mostly seen here 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.840
 future and it is very very difficult 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.730
 have been against you to have a recipe 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.130
 we tried everything in each one 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.859
 tried everything and therefore 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:27.160
 the greatest respect and is due 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.160
 congratulations to bidigheim 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.709
 Of course it is not easy for us 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.480
 been after the 3 0 residue against 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.079
 team that was so dominant with 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.190
 fullest motivation with the fullest 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.940
 passion to come out again 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.100
 But good for the team like them 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.380
 this game has tackled like her 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.340
 our great spectator again 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.799
 could inspire 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.319
 he thinks the spark is from ice to 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.579
 audience jumped over and thereby was 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.319
 the great support over the whole 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.760
 playing time we have a lot 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.900
 made today and did not want anyone 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.670
 disappoint and I think that's us 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.090
 successful 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.590
 throughout the last three months 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.629
 Mostly the disappointment should be 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.710
 of course big but the last three 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.870
 months should be over 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.660
 against what's in the whole season for 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.460
 difficulties the boys had 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.990
 we all know but they have 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.840
 they have stabilized that 

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.690
 nobody has more cent in the sixth 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.430
 given place and they did it 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.170
 we have a great quarter-final series 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.120
 seen and it is no shame against 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.680
 to excrete bidigheim 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.560
 You have to be a fair sportsman 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.320
 see and and take away that is 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.380
 Just want to thank me for that 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.700
 the great support for our fans 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.850
 from the office around from the way 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.920
 started the move us steadily 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.900
 keep that free we absolutely 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.310
 can work professionally and still 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.470
 more big thank you to the team 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.470
 Thank you so much 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:12.040
 thanks toni there are questions from the side of 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:15.620
 press put and greatest respect applies 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.010
 form kevin that is a process that 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.270
 is not just for tomorrow on tomorrow 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.780
 but there is a lot of work over there 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.720
 years in there and you have to do it 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.930
 very high 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.790
 they have homework on the whole league 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.530
 Give over the summer and you have to 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.530
 do well the water can reach 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.420
 there are more questions 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.490
 ask me at night first game 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.800
 We have experienced in clay this year 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.070
 my two weeks free the first one 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.600
 playoff-round all profit spheres it 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:18.020
 another two weeks three it difficult question 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:27.470
 I was surprised with our game 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:30.210
 Whether these ten days are not at the moment 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.910
 that's six or seven who play 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.740
 knows if it's better that's halfway 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:40.620
 question to ask at the moment we will 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:42.180
 see there are more questions that it 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.730
 not the case, then we'll come soon 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.070
 to the mentioned part frankfurter 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.590
 lions against the fischtown pinguins gate 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.900
 here came 4 to 6 for the tribe 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.990
 greens with 2 2 in the series 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.220
 it's definitely about six games 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.680
 and we also look who in the 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.720
 The final stage will be in the play downs 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.370
 it goes into the extension between the 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.620
 Esv Kaufbeuren and Heilbronn 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.110
 hawks in the score of 4 24 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.030
 of course we still thank my 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.250
 Names of the evl quite cordially for her 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.170
 loyalty and support throughout 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.270
 season away we have a very very 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.530
 good and very high audience response 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.530
 I can list this year 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:22.140
 believe the team has now with synonymous 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.120
 the semi-final collection much repaid 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.950
 Unfortunately, it was relatively clear now 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.890
 but the bidigheim steelers were 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.060
 just better now we thank you 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.740
 of course, very warmly at all 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.710
 sponsor and hope for each other 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.440
 support in the new season 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:40.260
 of course not least with the three 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.610
 1971 are watching this evening for 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.280
 We are now in the first time 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.260
 summer break and yes I wish the way 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.070
 a lot of fun and the tony at the 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.750
 preparation for the new team 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.920
 We'll see you make good service 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.920
 We'll see you soon
