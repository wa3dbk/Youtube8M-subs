00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.820 
to get the microgreens we've got to grow
them<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.900> grow<00:02:01.080> them<00:02:01.260> in<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.530> shallow

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
them and you can grow them in a shallow

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.740 
them and you can grow them in a shallow
container<00:02:02.190> that's<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.970> key<00:02:03.150> you<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:03.600> need

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.979 
cabbage so we're gonna do one container
of<00:03:31.530> red<00:03:31.739> cabbage<00:03:31.980> mix<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.970> may<00:03:33.120> ask<00:03:33.299> can<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.630> mix

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
of red cabbage mix you may ask can I mix

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.560 
of red cabbage mix you may ask can I mix
all<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.709> these<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.190> container<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.910> don't

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
all of these in one container I don't

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.910 
all of these in one container I don't
advise<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.170> because<00:03:37.380> they'll<00:03:37.590> grow<00:03:37.769> at

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
advise it because they'll grow at

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.190 
advise it because they'll grow at
slightly<00:03:38.220> different<00:03:38.700> rates<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.120> if<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.930> want

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
slightly different rates so if you want

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.199 
slightly different rates so if you want
it<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.410> grow<00:03:40.769> all<00:03:41.010> four<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.370> these<00:03:41.549> have<00:03:41.940> four

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
it to grow all four of these have four

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.420 
it to grow all four of these have four
different<00:03:42.420> containers<00:03:43.140> or<00:03:43.290> divide<00:03:44.190> your

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
different containers or divide your

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.580 
different containers or divide your
container<00:03:44.820> into<00:03:45.150> little<00:03:45.420> sections<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:46.410> don't

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
container into little sections but don't

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.620 
container into little sections but don't
mix<00:03:46.769> them<00:03:46.980> up<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.970> next<00:03:48.209> thing<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.450> want

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
mix them up so the next thing you want

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.539 
mix them up so the next thing you want
to<00:03:48.690> do<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.380> want<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.620> put<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.890> seed<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.340> and

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
to do is you want to put the seed in and

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.759 
to do is you want to put the seed in and
you<00:03:50.700> want<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.970> put<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.209> fairly<00:03:51.690> heavy<00:03:52.110> about<00:03:52.530> a

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
you want to put it fairly heavy about a

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.400 
you want to put it fairly heavy about a
quarter<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.430> an<00:03:53.549> inch<00:03:53.730> or<00:03:54.030> less<00:03:54.390> between<00:03:54.750> seeds

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
quarter of an inch or less between seeds

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.110 
quarter of an inch or less between seeds
so<00:03:55.980> we'll<00:03:56.100> just<00:03:56.250> sprinkle<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.700> little<00:03:56.820> bit<00:03:56.970> of

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
so we'll just sprinkle a little bit of

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.319 
so we'll just sprinkle a little bit of
that<00:03:57.209> on<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.769> can<00:03:58.920> see<00:03:59.130> there<00:03:59.400> what<00:04:00.299> I

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
that on and you can see there what I

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.449 
that on and you can see there what I
tend<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.780> do<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.170> then<00:04:01.440> take<00:04:01.650> my<00:04:01.799> fingers<00:04:02.280> and

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
tend to do is then take my fingers and

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.430 
tend to do is then take my fingers and
if<00:04:02.850> any<00:04:03.030> seeds<00:04:03.329> have<00:04:03.510> really<00:04:03.930> gotten<00:04:04.170> stuck

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
if any seeds have really gotten stuck

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.930 
if any seeds have really gotten stuck
together<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.920> there's<00:04:05.040> no<00:04:05.099> space<00:04:05.520> this<00:04:05.760> will

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
together and there's no space this will

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.550 
together and there's no space this will
help<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.629> create<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.900> little<00:04:07.050> bit<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.349> space

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
help to create a little bit of space

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
help to create a little bit of space
between<00:04:07.800> them

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
between them

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.790 
between them
because<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.630> microgreen<00:04:10.140> seeds<00:04:10.470> are<00:04:10.650> so

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
because the microgreen seeds are so

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.370 
because the microgreen seeds are so
small<00:04:11.190> we<00:04:11.820> don't<00:04:12.030> need<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.240> lot<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.570> soil<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:13.080> top

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
small we don't need a lot of soil on top

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.290 
small we don't need a lot of soil on top
so<00:04:13.950> we'll<00:04:14.070> just<00:04:14.220> take<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> little<00:04:14.640> more<00:04:14.820> soil

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
so we'll just take a little more soil

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.009 
so we'll just take a little more soil
and<00:04:16.290> cover<00:04:16.560> those<00:04:16.890> seeds<00:04:17.190> about<00:04:17.730> 1/8<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.900> as

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
and cover those seeds about 1/8 to as

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.630 
and cover those seeds about 1/8 to as
much<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.620> quarter<00:04:19.920> of<00:04:20.010> an<00:04:20.100> inch<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.459> cover

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
much of a quarter of an inch to cover

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.910 
much of a quarter of an inch to cover
them<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.000> that's<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.360> no<00:04:21.870> deeper<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.770> there

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
them but that's it no deeper and there

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.480 
them but that's it no deeper and there
you<00:04:26.040> have<00:04:26.070> it

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
you have it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.070 
you have it
now<00:04:26.640> our<00:04:26.820> micro<00:04:27.150> green<00:04:27.390> container<00:04:27.840> is<00:04:28.050> ready

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
now our micro green container is ready

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.810 
now our micro green container is ready
to<00:04:28.410> go<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:28.590> we've<00:04:28.890> got<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.190> seeds<00:04:29.460> we've<00:04:29.670> got

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
to go so we've got the seeds we've got

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.800 
to go so we've got the seeds we've got
the<00:04:29.940> soil<00:04:30.210> we<00:04:30.630> now<00:04:30.750> have<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.110> add<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.560> water

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
the soil we now have to add the water

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.060 
the soil we now have to add the water
all<00:04:33.810> right<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.020> what<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.170> need<00:04:34.290> now<00:04:34.530> is<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.830> water

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
all right so what I need now is to water

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.890 
all right so what I need now is to water
it<00:04:35.280> now<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.460> could<00:04:35.910> use<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.180> watering

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
it now you could use a watering

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.480 
it now you could use a watering
container<00:04:37.290> but<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.530> don't<00:04:37.890> recommend<00:04:38.190> this

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
container but I don't recommend this

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.430 
container but I don't recommend this
because<00:04:38.730> even<00:04:39.690> if<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.870> have<00:04:40.020> one<00:04:40.230> of<00:04:40.320> those

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
because even if you have one of those

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.250 
because even if you have one of those
rain<00:04:40.980> even<00:04:41.880> if<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.150> have<00:04:42.330> say<00:04:42.630> an<00:04:42.750> adapter

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
rain even if you have say an adapter

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.630 
rain even if you have say an adapter
that<00:04:43.290> makes<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.770> little<00:04:43.950> more<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.400> rain

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
that makes this a little more like rain

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.370 
that makes this a little more like rain
it<00:04:44.910> could<00:04:45.060> start<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.510> push<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.020> seeds<00:04:46.230> a

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
it could start to push the seeds a

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.380 
it could start to push the seeds a
little<00:04:46.410> bit<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:46.860> fairly<00:04:47.400> fragile<00:04:47.640> so

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
little bit this is fairly fragile so

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.150 
little bit this is fairly fragile so
we're<00:04:48.600> gonna<00:04:48.720> forego<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.740> watering

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
we're gonna forego the watering

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.630 
we're gonna forego the watering
container<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.790> what<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:50.940> use<00:04:51.360> is<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:52.800> mr.<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.610> I

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
container and what I use is a mr. so I

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.970 
container and what I use is a mr. so I
basically<00:04:54.210> just<00:04:54.330> have<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.690> clean<00:04:55.140> bottle<00:04:55.500> here

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
basically just have a clean bottle here

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.610 
basically just have a clean bottle here
it<00:04:56.070> says<00:04:56.280> water<00:04:56.700> for<00:04:57.000> misting<00:04:57.390> on<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:57.870> I'll

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
it says water for misting on it and I'll

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.610 
it says water for misting on it and I'll
just<00:04:58.860> missed<00:04:59.550> the<00:05:00.000> soil<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:01.230> can<00:05:01.380> see<00:05:01.530> how

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
just missed the soil you can see how

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.250 
just missed the soil you can see how
nicely<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.160> wets<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.520> soil<00:05:02.850> now<00:05:03.480> there's<00:05:04.050> no

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
nicely this wets the soil now there's no

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.990 
nicely this wets the soil now there's no
drainage<00:05:04.800> in<00:05:04.950> this<00:05:05.100> particular<00:05:05.610> container

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
drainage in this particular container

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.760 
drainage in this particular container
and<00:05:06.330> that's<00:05:06.420> okay<00:05:07.140> because<00:05:07.440> we're<00:05:07.740> just

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
and that's okay because we're just

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.560 
and that's okay because we're just
getting<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.370> seeds<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.760> germinate<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:09.270> little

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
getting the seeds to germinate a little

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.360 
getting the seeds to germinate a little
bit<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.110> can't<00:05:10.320> have<00:05:10.440> drainage<00:05:10.680> but<00:05:11.100> it's<00:05:11.220> not

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
bit you can't have drainage but it's not

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.000 
bit you can't have drainage but it's not
critical<00:05:11.790> it<00:05:11.970> doesn't<00:05:12.350> however<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.770> don't

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
critical it doesn't however you don't

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.620 
critical it doesn't however you don't
want<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.340> get<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:14.580> too<00:05:14.820> wet<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:15.270> just<00:05:15.510> a

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
want to get this too wet so just a

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.080 
want to get this too wet so just a
little<00:05:15.990> bit<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.230> moisture<00:05:16.710> on<00:05:17.130> there<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.970> then

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
little bit of moisture on there and then

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.810 
little bit of moisture on there and then
we're<00:05:18.180> gonna<00:05:18.270> seal<00:05:18.570> this<00:05:18.750> up<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.610> this<00:05:20.610> will

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
we're gonna seal this up and this will

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.340 
we're gonna seal this up and this will
act<00:05:21.030> like<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.240> little<00:05:21.570> greenhouse<00:05:21.780> we<00:05:22.110> don't

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
act like a little greenhouse we don't

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.900 
act like a little greenhouse we don't
need<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.560> lot<00:05:22.770> of<00:05:22.950> water<00:05:23.220> in<00:05:23.460> there<00:05:23.669> because

need a lot of water in there because

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.940 
need a lot of water in there because
it's<00:05:24.030> gonna<00:05:24.150> continue<00:05:24.419> to<00:05:24.780> recirculate<00:05:25.200> you

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
it's gonna continue to recirculate you

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.070 
it's gonna continue to recirculate you
want<00:05:26.160> to<00:05:26.220> place<00:05:26.460> this<00:05:26.700> under<00:05:27.210> grow<00:05:27.450> light<00:05:27.720> or
