00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hi, I'm 397 key and today I'm going to 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.960
 talk about a movie that a lot of people 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.030
 he met and that is still spoken of her 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.049
 it is mortal kombat annihilation or 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.000
 annihilation for Latin America in 1995 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.949
 the movie of a famous game was made 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 of video called mortal kombat which 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.449
 was successful and was known as the best 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 movie based on a video game the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.099
 very good wardrobe characters 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.050
 excellent good performances very faithful 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.970
 to the game like for example johnny cage 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.489
 very similar to how we all know it 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.500
 scorpion towards his fatality the attack 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.290
 end of the incan against the sorcerer very 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.730
 well designed good special effects 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.760
 although he actually had some 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 differences but that was the least 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 Thanks to its popularity , a 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.410
 sequel that would release in 1997 the trailer 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.530
 seemed to promise a lot for a second 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.320
 movie but what happened the movie was 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.239
 a total failure very unfaithful to the game and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 several fans took it as a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.859
 insult costume similar to the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.650
 characters but very bad effects 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.920
 very bad specials the characters in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.020
 any side 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.990
 some only appeared 5 minutes as 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.330
 Sub 0 others do not see them or fight like 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.280
 rain striker and cabal are just 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.080
 mentioned ermac instead of talking 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.720
 referring to him as we 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.250
 just say something that was wrong 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.409
 done since he is several souls 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.479
 locked in a body and something that 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.310
 he got angry was to make him not use and vote 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.220
 appear as a shadow of him when in 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.200
 reality is the original sub 0 but that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.390
 appears as the father of chauca ni de reid 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.399
 in when in the game shao kahn and reid 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.740
 in they are not brothers and less children of yes 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.869
 no jake that in the game was the best 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.819
 Quitana's friend is not recognized 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.350
 no friendship in the movie and they do 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.420
 that she sent the characters 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.060
 leading to a trap when in 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.860
 actually allied itself with them are as 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.869
 at the end of the first movie I had 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.060
 put on a suit of the priests of the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.369
 shadows appeared dressed differently and 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.350
 johnny cage still kept his glasses 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.720
 which were destroyed by hat 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.909
 previously it is very that it was the best 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.619
 friend of sub zero make it look like 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.170
 his great enemy and this one did not throw 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.119
 missiles and also in the scene that we see 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.040
 a sub zero flying to freeze what 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.730
 we can clearly see the machine that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.860
 I held 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.720
 something that maybe I could give you another 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 opportunity to the directors was a 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.170
 deleted scene from the end of the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.000
 movie where he looked at any 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.650
 price 'help well not to be 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 released but it seems that they were not 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.549
 interested in doing a third 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.799
 movie what causes confusion since 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.470
 when it appears on the cover of the movie 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.090
 in the Japanese version it seems that they believed 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.010
 they wanted to do deadly kombat 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.110
 annihilation something amazing but what 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.730
 ruined they ruined a movie that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.090
 had a future and also great 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.049
 chances of having another movie more 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.239
 well that was all 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.110
 comment so I know if you liked it 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.110
 goodbye
