now are you wondering can I use a little

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.570 
now are you wondering can I use a little
less<00:02:49.240> butter<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.690> save<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.140> calories<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
less butter to save on the calories the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.310 
less butter to save on the calories the
answer<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:51.940> no<00:02:52.150> skipping<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.900> butter<00:02:53.080> guys

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
answer is no skipping on the butter guys

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.930 
answer is no skipping on the butter guys
and<00:02:53.980> you'll<00:02:54.160> understand<00:02:54.610> when<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.790> take<00:02:54.910> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
and you'll understand when you take a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.590 
and you'll understand when you take a
bite<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:56.850> we're<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.030> fold<00:02:58.300> it<00:02:58.480> over

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
bite and we're going to fold it over

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.170 
bite and we're going to fold it over
about<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.560> half<00:02:59.800> an<00:02:59.920> inch<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.760> add<00:03:00.910> about<00:03:01.120> a

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
about a half an inch and add about a

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.870 
about a half an inch and add about a
teaspoon<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.960> mixture<00:03:02.580> fold<00:03:03.580> in<00:03:03.760> the

teaspoon of the mixture fold in the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.020 
teaspoon of the mixture fold in the
sides<00:03:04.770> this<00:03:05.770> helps<00:03:06.070> keep<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.310> mixture<00:03:06.610> sealed

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
sides this helps keep the mixture sealed

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.180 
sides this helps keep the mixture sealed
in<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:07.480> then<00:03:08.140> we're<00:03:08.350> going<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.590> fold<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.160> a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
in and then we're going to fold it in a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.180 
in and then we're going to fold it in a
triangular<00:03:09.700> shape<00:03:09.880> just<00:03:10.480> like<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:11.190> this
