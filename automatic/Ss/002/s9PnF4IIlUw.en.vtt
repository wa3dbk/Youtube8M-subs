00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
to put in down there I'll make my

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.470 
to put in down there I'll make my
mushroom<00:01:37.150> forest<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:40.060> then<00:01:40.150> we'll<00:01:40.300> give<00:01:40.450> it

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
and that's about as far as I want to go

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.870 
and that's about as far as I want to go
with<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:51.840> end<00:01:54.140> right<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.670> cuz<00:01:56.670> that's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
with this end right now cuz that's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.990 
with this end right now cuz that's
holding<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:58.400> now<00:01:59.400> we'll<00:01:59.580> check<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
holding that on there now we'll check it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.530 
holding that on there now we'll check it
out<00:02:00.120> and<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.570> what<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.900> have<00:02:02.030> if<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.510> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
out and see what we have if this is a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.990 
out and see what we have if this is a
piece<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:03.930> dogwood<00:02:04.290> I'd<00:02:05.220> have<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.640> take<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
piece of dogwood I'd have to take the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.820 
piece of dogwood I'd have to take the
bark<00:02:06.240> off<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:06.900> wouldn't<00:02:07.440> keep<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.710> up

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830

bark off of it so wouldn't keep you up
at<00:02:07.979> night<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.520> debark<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.530> case

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
at night that debark it but in this case

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.430 
at night that debark it but in this case
this<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.160> honey<00:02:11.459> locust<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.320> that'll<00:02:13.320> work

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
this is honey locust and that'll work

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.820 
this is honey locust and that'll work
fine<00:02:13.770> I'll<00:02:14.040> take<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.490> now<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:16.170> make<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.380> slice

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
fine I'll take this now and make a slice

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
fine I'll take this now and make a slice
over<00:02:17.370> here

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:36.009 

make<00:02:24.850> an<00:02:25.000> undercut

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:43.309

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.539 

that's<00:02:44.040> tricky<00:02:44.400> isn't<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:46.189> not<00:02:47.189> many<00:02:47.340> people

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
that's tricky isn't it not many people

00:02:47.549 --> 00:03:00.810 
that's tricky isn't it not many people
can<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.909> that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.030

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.280 

then<00:03:44.670> when<00:03:44.819> I<00:03:44.849> get<00:03:44.970> into<00:03:45.270> that<00:03:45.510> part<00:03:45.930> there<00:03:46.260> I

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
then when I get into that part there I

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.690 
then when I get into that part there I
take<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.800> small<00:03:47.130> one

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:04.780 

and<00:03:55.700> then<00:03:56.060> we'll<00:03:56.180> make<00:03:56.360> an<00:03:56.510> undercut

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.550 

and<00:04:05.790> basically<00:04:06.060> we're<00:04:06.600> getting<00:04:07.700> most<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.940> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
and basically we're getting most of the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.670 
and basically we're getting most of the
mushroom<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:11.600> cutting<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.720> important<00:04:13.290> has<00:04:13.500> to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
mushroom and cutting is important has to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.159 
mushroom and cutting is important has to
be<00:04:13.800> smooth<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:15.330> you<00:04:15.390> don't<00:04:15.630> do<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> lot<00:04:15.900> of

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
be smooth so you don't do a lot of

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.300 
be smooth so you don't do a lot of
sanding<00:04:17.750> I'll<00:04:18.750> make<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> final<00:04:19.470> cut<00:04:21.320> very<00:04:22.320> very

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
sanding I'll make a final cut very very

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.700 
sanding I'll make a final cut very very
carefully

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.570 

oh<00:04:31.450> is<00:04:32.450> that<00:04:32.480> ever<00:04:32.720> smooth<00:04:34.840> now<00:04:36.460> we're<00:04:37.460> gonna

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
oh is that ever smooth now we're gonna

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.660 
oh is that ever smooth now we're gonna
leave<00:04:38.120> this<00:04:38.360> part<00:04:38.750> on<00:04:39.370> give<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.520> little

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670

natural<00:04:41.000> look<00:04:42.010> so<00:04:43.010> I'm<00:04:43.250> going<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.520> cut<00:04:43.790> it<00:04:43.940> on

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
natural look so I'm going to cut it on

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.520 
natural look so I'm going to cut it on
the<00:04:44.270> bottom<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:46.760> give<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.120> start<00:04:47.420> and<00:04:48.020> I

won't<00:04:48.740> waste<00:04:49.340> too<00:04:49.640> much<00:04:49.670> time<00:04:49.880> with<00:04:50.420> that

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
won't waste too much time with that

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:59.390 
won't waste too much time with that
because<00:04:50.870> I<00:04:51.110> got<00:04:51.230> to<00:04:51.380> go<00:04:51.500> over<00:04:51.770> here
