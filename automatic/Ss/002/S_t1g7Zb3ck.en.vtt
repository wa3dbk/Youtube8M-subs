00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.450
 Hi, I'm Benavidez level and this is a 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.000
 advice over practical natural cooking 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.839
 this time we are going to make a juice of 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.820
 apple carrot and celery is very simple 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.250
 and it can be an option for breakfast 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.470
 or also as something very different for 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.230
 accompany your food at the time of 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.420
 main meal we're going to need a 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.560
 little water are about two glasses 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:32.149
 of water two apples three carrots and 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.899
 two celery sticks the carrot already 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.489
 I have it here without skin what we are going to 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.649
 to do is to break into small pieces 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.760
 just like the apple the apple is not 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.920
 necessary that the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.220
 that we fight 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.730
 we are going to strain after this mixture 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.470
 after moving to the blender it is very 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.320
 important that you wash and disinfect 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.150
 fruits and vegetables we have here a 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.560
 natural disinfectant that you can 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.780
 do yourself check what in the videos 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.550
 let's make small pieces for 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.550
 facilitate the liquefied 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.710
 what the heart and the seeds do not 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.710
 we will use it 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.580
 perfect we ended up with the apple and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.580
 now we go with the carrot 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.020
 i 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.710
 celery 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.700
 on the skin was a very special flavor to 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 I love celery 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.210
 and since we have fruits the carrot 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.690
 and celery let's put the water in the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.690
 blender 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.070
 more or less two cups is half a liter d 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.280
 of water 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.940
 and we go little by little adding the fruit 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.720
 let's go to and when by parties so that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.720
 be simpler 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 This is a juice that will refresh you 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.230
 nourish I do not know if you notice you do not have 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.599
 absolutely no sugar 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.129
 what makes it massa we are not going to strain it 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.129
 it is thick 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.019
 and what we do is in a colander him 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.800
 scrape with a spoon like that is a lot 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.800
 easier 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.760
 the process 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.940
 the bagasse that you have left you can save it 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.700

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.760

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.290
