China<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.630> quality<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.289> it's<00:01:59.560> pretty

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
China and the quality on it it's pretty

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.279 
China and the quality on it it's pretty
good<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.909> far<00:02:01.179> as<00:02:01.240> flipping<00:02:01.539> it<00:02:01.750> goes<00:02:01.929> it's<00:02:02.170> a

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
good as far as flipping it goes it's a

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.830 
good as far as flipping it goes it's a
little<00:02:02.530> light<00:02:02.740> for<00:02:03.159> me<00:02:03.250> um<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.940> it's<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.600> little

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
little light for me um and it's a little

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.210 
little light for me um and it's a little
weird<00:02:05.049> because<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.500> handle<00:02:05.799> scales<00:02:05.950> are<00:02:06.130> not

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
weird because the handle scales are not

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.070 
weird because the handle scales are not
really<00:02:06.429> used<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.030> they<00:02:07.569> do<00:02:07.630> require<00:02:07.869> a

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
really used to it and they do require a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.330 
really used to it and they do require a
little<00:02:08.350> bit<00:02:08.440> break-in<00:02:08.799> time<00:02:08.979> before<00:02:09.250> they

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
little bit break-in time before they

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.100 
little bit break-in time before they
start<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.700> flip<00:02:09.880> smoothly<00:02:10.239> but<00:02:10.479> not<00:02:10.720> bad<00:02:10.929> at

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
start to flip smoothly but not bad at

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.780 
start to flip smoothly but not bad at
all<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.670> good<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:15.100> good<00:02:15.130> good

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
all and this is a good it's a good good

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.729 
all and this is a good it's a good good
balisong<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.510> go<00:02:16.690> ahead<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.989> purchase<00:02:17.170> before

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
balisong to go ahead and purchase before

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.110 
balisong to go ahead and purchase before
going<00:02:17.980> ahead<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.459> spending<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.819> money<00:02:19.030> on

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
going ahead and spending the money on

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.839 
going ahead and spending the money on
the<00:02:19.750> spider<00:02:20.380> fly<00:02:20.680> which<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.099> substantially

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
the spider fly which is substantially

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.449 
the spider fly which is substantially
more<00:02:22.060> money<00:02:22.360> than<00:02:22.599> your<00:02:22.950> 40<00:02:23.950> bucks

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
more money than your 40 bucks

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.340 
more money than your 40 bucks
excuse<00:02:25.030> me<00:02:25.150> $50<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.930> would<00:02:26.019> have<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.230> pay

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
excuse me $50 that you would have to pay

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.690 
excuse me $50 that you would have to pay
for<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.859> I<00:02:26.890> think<00:02:27.100> it's<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.280> really<00:02:27.489> good

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
for this so I think it's a really good

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.699 
for this so I think it's a really good
investment<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.390> see<00:02:28.870> if<00:02:29.019> this<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.200> your<00:02:29.470> style

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
investment to see if this is your style

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.470 
investment to see if this is your style
of<00:02:29.829> balisong<00:02:30.280> before<00:02:30.609> taking<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> plunge<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
of balisong before taking the plunge and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.680 
of balisong before taking the plunge and
spending<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.730> 150<00:02:33.730> plus<00:02:33.970> or<00:02:34.180> whatever<00:02:34.420> for

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
spending the 150 plus or whatever for

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.610 
spending the 150 plus or whatever for
the<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:36.549> Spyderco<00:02:37.269> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:38.049> get<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.320> smaller

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
the the Spyderco you can get the smaller

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.650 
the the Spyderco you can get the smaller
spider<00:02:39.040> fly<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.370> think<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.209> little

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
spider fly I think and it's a little

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.170 
spider fly I think and it's a little
less<00:02:40.780> expensive<00:02:41.019> but<00:02:41.410> still<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.769> not<00:02:42.180> this

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
less expensive but still it's not this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.270 
less expensive but still it's not this
is<00:02:43.359> still<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.600> lot<00:02:43.750> cheaper<00:02:43.959> than<00:02:44.109> even<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.739> so

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
is still a lot cheaper than even that so

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.280 
is still a lot cheaper than even that so
really<00:02:46.000> really<00:02:46.510> nice<00:02:46.780> torque<00:02:47.680> screws<00:02:48.070> there

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
really really nice torque screws there

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.630 
really really nice torque screws there
it's<00:02:50.290> got<00:02:50.440> really<00:02:50.709> good<00:02:50.980> as<00:02:51.069> far<00:02:51.130> as<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.430> play

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
it's got really good as far as to play

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.039 
it's got really good as far as to play
let's<00:02:51.880> let's<00:02:52.150> check<00:02:52.299> out<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.510> play<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.870> this

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
let's let's check out the play on this

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.180 
let's let's check out the play on this
real<00:02:53.319> quick<00:02:54.030> very<00:02:55.030> minimal<00:02:55.569> very<00:02:56.190> acceptable

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
real quick very minimal very acceptable

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.729 
real quick very minimal very acceptable
for<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> balisong<00:02:57.940> there<00:02:58.840> like<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.319> said<00:02:59.590> the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
for a balisong there like I said the

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.000 
for a balisong there like I said the
action<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.810> was<00:03:02.049> almost<00:03:02.260> broken<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.920> it's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
action this was almost broken and it's

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.229 
action this was almost broken and it's
tough<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.280> flip<00:03:03.549> with<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.880> for<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> little<00:03:04.120> while

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
tough to flip with it for a little while

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.030 
tough to flip with it for a little while
one<00:03:04.840> thing<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.109> do<00:03:05.170> notice<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:08.650> doesn't

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
one thing I do notice is it doesn't

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.300 
one thing I do notice is it doesn't
happen<00:03:09.310> too<00:03:09.639> often<00:03:09.880> but<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.420> does<00:03:10.450> where<00:03:11.310> this

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
happen too often but it does where this

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.059 
happen too often but it does where this
latch<00:03:12.639> will<00:03:13.000> get<00:03:13.209> up<00:03:13.359> in<00:03:13.540> here<00:03:13.920> but<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.040> doesn't

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
latch will get up in here but it doesn't

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.460 
latch will get up in here but it doesn't
happen<00:03:15.430> too<00:03:16.120> often<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.720> me<00:03:16.840> it's<00:03:17.019> every<00:03:17.200> one<00:03:17.350> so

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
happen too often to me it's every one so

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.750 
happen too often to me it's every one so
if<00:03:17.560> I'm<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.739> gonna<00:03:17.920> flip<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.280> open<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.609> look

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
if I'm just gonna flip it open to look

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.890 
if I'm just gonna flip it open to look
at<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.150> try<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.299> flip<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.569> closed<00:03:19.750> that's

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
at it and try to flip it closed that's

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.390 
at it and try to flip it closed that's
what<00:03:20.049> happens<00:03:20.410> but<00:03:20.530> if<00:03:20.620> you're<00:03:20.739> doing<00:03:20.889> combo

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
what happens but if you're doing combo

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.050 
what happens but if you're doing combo
moves<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:22.389> latch<00:03:22.569> will<00:03:22.930> stay<00:03:23.260> out<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.650> way

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
moves the latch will stay out of the way

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.020 
moves the latch will stay out of the way
but<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:26.130> but<00:03:27.130> that's<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> only<00:03:27.549> thing<00:03:27.730> I

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
but so and but that's the only thing I

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.550 
but so and but that's the only thing I
really<00:03:28.299> see<00:03:28.450> as<00:03:28.510> far<00:03:28.720> as<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.870> downfall<00:03:29.319> maybe

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
really see as far as the downfall maybe

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.770 
really see as far as the downfall maybe
an<00:03:30.370> improvement<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.209> would<00:03:32.049> be<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.579> spring

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
an improvement to this would be a spring

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.000 
an improvement to this would be a spring
spring<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.019> latch<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.530> keep<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.829> in

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
spring to this latch to keep it in

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.699 
spring to this latch to keep it in
well<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.550> open<00:03:37.170> position<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.440> if<00:03:38.590> you're

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
well the open position and if you're

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.949 
well the open position and if you're
crafty<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.760> could<00:03:39.940> probably<00:03:40.180> go<00:03:40.599> ahead<00:03:40.780> and

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
crafty you could probably go ahead and

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.229 
crafty you could probably go ahead and
do<00:03:41.049> something<00:03:41.440> like<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:42.030> with<00:03:43.030> this

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
do something like that with this

some<00:05:03.880> Loctite<00:05:04.090> in<00:05:04.479> there<00:05:04.599> it's<00:05:04.720> always<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.960> good

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
some Loctite in there it's always a good

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.409 
some Loctite in there it's always a good
idea<00:05:05.200> to<00:05:05.440> do<00:05:05.710> that<00:05:05.740> like<00:05:06.729> I<00:05:06.820> said<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:07.150> only

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
idea to do that like I said the only

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.360 
idea to do that like I said the only
downfall<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:07.900> do<00:05:08.020> see<00:05:08.320> on<00:05:08.470> this<00:05:08.590> is<00:05:08.770> latch<00:05:09.039> does

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
downfall I do see on this is latch does

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.550 
downfall I do see on this is latch does
get<00:05:09.580> in<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.729> way<00:05:09.820> every<00:05:10.450> once<00:05:10.660> in<00:05:10.780> a<00:05:10.870> while<00:05:11.020> but

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
get in the way every once in a while but

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.409 
get in the way every once in a while but
you'll<00:05:11.889> find<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.430> with<00:05:12.639> a<00:05:12.669> lot<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:12.940> anything

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
you'll find that with a lot of anything

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.969 
you'll find that with a lot of anything
that<00:05:13.570> isn't<00:05:13.660> spring-loaded<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.440> latch<00:05:14.680> will

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
that isn't spring-loaded that latch will

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.680 
that isn't spring-loaded that latch will
get<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:15.400> your<00:05:15.610> way<00:05:15.639> a<00:05:15.760> little<00:05:16.120> bit<00:05:16.270> there<00:05:16.510> and
