I love your own feces going like an
infant<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.420> car<00:00:44.750> is<00:00:45.020> working<00:00:45.230> on<00:00:45.530> ways<00:00:45.770> of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.140 

let<00:00:53.770> me<00:00:53.860> give<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.130> an<00:00:54.220> example<00:00:56.580> the<00:00:57.580> electric

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
let me give you an example the electric

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.400 
let me give you an example the electric
motor<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:59.080> used<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:01.180> fill<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.720> little<00:01:02.020> gaps

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
motor is used to fill in the little gaps

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.070 
motor is used to fill in the little gaps
when<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.890> petrol<00:01:03.370> engine<00:01:03.790> isn't<00:01:04.270> working<00:01:04.900> at

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
when the petrol engine isn't working at

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.040 
when the petrol engine isn't working at
its<00:01:05.290> best<00:01:05.560> like<00:01:05.950> for<00:01:06.190> example<00:01:06.660> during<00:01:07.660> here

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
its best like for example during here

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.370 
its best like for example during here
changes<00:01:08.620> or<00:01:08.800> while<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.760> massive<00:01:10.600> turbos<00:01:11.110> are

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
changes or while the massive turbos are

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.660 
changes or while the massive turbos are
spilling<00:01:12.160> up<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:14.410> what<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.590> find<00:01:14.920> hysterical

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
spilling up and what I find hysterical

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.900 
spilling up and what I find hysterical
about<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:16.180> is<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.800> mcLaren<00:01:17.800> has<00:01:17.910> taken

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
about that is that mcLaren has taken

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.240 
about that is that mcLaren has taken
this<00:01:19.540> blueprint<00:01:20.050> technology<00:01:20.830> which<00:01:21.010> is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
this blueprint technology which is

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.060 
this blueprint technology which is
designed<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:22.060> reduce<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:23.140> impact<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.830> the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
designed to reduce the impact of the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.180 
designed to reduce the impact of the
internal<00:01:24.580> combustion<00:01:24.970> engine

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
internal combustion engine

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.530 
internal combustion engine
and<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.640> using<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.390> increase<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.560> impact

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
and is using it to increase the impact

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.830 
and is using it to increase the impact
that's<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.750> weaponizing<00:01:31.440> a<00:01:31.710> wind<00:01:31.980> farm<00:01:32.840> or

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that's like weaponizing a wind farm or

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.200 
that's like weaponizing a wind farm or
buying<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.500> Rainbow<00:01:35.190> Warrior<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.820> turning

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
buying the Rainbow Warrior and turning

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:46.430 
buying the Rainbow Warrior and turning
it<00:01:36.300> into<00:01:36.420> an<00:01:36.660> oil<00:01:36.840> tanker<00:01:44.540> for<00:01:45.540> years<00:01:45.750> cars

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
it into an oil tanker for years cars

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.530 
it into an oil tanker for years cars
have<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:46.890> been<00:01:47.130> basically<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.970> same<00:01:48.210> but

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
have all been basically the same but

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.030 
have all been basically the same but
this<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:49.470> isn't<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.000> game-changer<00:01:51.300> a

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
this really isn't it's a game-changer a

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.550 
this really isn't it's a game-changer a
genuinely<00:01:53.040> new<00:01:53.490> chapter<00:01:54.150> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.020> history<00:01:55.200> of

genuinely new chapter in the history of
