seed from a seed house they dried down
to<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.350> oh<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.610> 15%<00:00:54.120> 15%

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
to about oh I think it's about 15% 15%

to about oh I think it's about 15% 15%
moisture<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.520> kept<00:00:56.730> around<00:00:57.059> 30%

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
moisture this can be kept around 30%

moisture this can be kept around 30%
much<00:00:57.989> higher<00:00:58.170> comes<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.280> ground<00:00:59.520> faster

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
much higher comes out of ground faster

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.889 
much higher comes out of ground faster
and<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:02.010> germination<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.820> leaves<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.329> very

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and the germination on leaves is very

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.120 
and the germination on leaves is very
close<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.260> 100%<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> result<00:01:06.830> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> past

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
close to 100% as a result in the past

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
close to 100% as a result in the past
I've<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.549> mix<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> corn<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.619> year

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
I've just mix up the corn but this year

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.500 
I've just mix up the corn but this year
I've<00:01:10.890> decided<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> separate<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> Reds

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I've decided to separate out the Reds

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
I've decided to separate out the Reds
and<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.020> yellows<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.380> oranges<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> plant

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and the yellows and oranges and plant

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.940 
and the yellows and oranges and plant
them<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> field<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.960> different<00:01:16.290> places<00:01:16.560> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
them in the field in different places so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.490 
them in the field in different places so
I<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> better<00:01:17.369> understanding<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
I get a better understanding of the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.870 
I get a better understanding of the
colors<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> their<00:01:19.830> relationships<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.729> one

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
colors and their relationships to one

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.710 
colors and their relationships to one
another<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:22.759> all<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.939> these<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.299> been<00:01:24.390> hand

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
another and all of these have been hand

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.350 
another and all of these have been hand
selected<00:01:24.840> over<00:01:25.799> through<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.430> winter<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.150> for

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
selected over through the winter so for

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.060 
selected over through the winter so for
that<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:27.900> first<00:01:28.259> picked<00:01:28.530> them<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.920> go

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that when we first picked them we go

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.819 
that when we first picked them we go
through<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.520> pick<00:01:29.700> ones<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:31.560> we

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
through and pick ones we like then we

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.890 
through and pick ones we like then we
continue<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> hand<00:01:32.640> select<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.780> know

many<00:02:16.709> small<00:02:17.129> kernels<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.790> don't<00:02:17.970> want<00:02:18.150> to

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
many small kernels so we don't want to

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.720 
many small kernels so we don't want to
plant<00:02:18.599> small<00:02:18.810> kernels<00:02:19.379> around<00:02:20.099> nice<00:02:20.250> big<00:02:20.489> fat

kernels<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:22.140> also<00:02:22.290> cleans<00:02:22.709> as<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.390> seed<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.689> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
kernels it also cleans as the seed so it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.869 
kernels it also cleans as the seed so it
doesn't<00:02:25.110> follow<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.590> if<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.370> silk<00:02:26.700> and

plant<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.049> orange<00:03:04.500> first<00:03:06.650> why<00:03:07.650> because<00:03:08.430> it's

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
plant the orange first why because it's

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.890 
plant the orange first why because it's
orange<00:03:13.250> now<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> check<00:03:14.669> carefully<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.510> seed

orange now I check carefully the seed

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.869 
orange now I check carefully the seed
level<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> begin<00:03:16.769> with<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.430> can<00:03:17.669> make<00:03:17.849> sure

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
level to begin with so I can make sure

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.789

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
wrong with the cedar will and we just go
