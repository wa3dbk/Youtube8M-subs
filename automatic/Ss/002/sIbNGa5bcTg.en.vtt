expert<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.800> Chinese<00:00:53.100> antiquities<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> he

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
expert on Chinese antiquities and he

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
expert on Chinese antiquities and he
wasn't<00:00:55.110> even<00:00:55.350> interested<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.860> putting<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.489> up

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
wasn't even interested in putting it up

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
wasn't even interested in putting it up
for<00:00:57.180> auction<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.350> even<00:00:58.559> worth<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
for auction so it's not even worth a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.080 
for auction so it's not even worth a
hundred<00:00:58.859> bucks

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
hundred bucks

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.950
