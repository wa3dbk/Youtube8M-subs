before you recorded the video that

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.000 
before you recorded the video that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
normally on deck you have the back

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.939 
normally on deck you have the back
design<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.060> has<00:00:30.210> where<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> pull<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.349> let

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
design and it has where you pull and let

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
design and it has where you pull and let
me<00:00:32.040> take<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> deck<00:00:32.910> out<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.540> but

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
me take the deck out like that but

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.030 
me take the deck out like that but
they've<00:00:34.230> actually<00:00:34.380> done<00:00:34.530> it'll<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.860> different

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
they've actually done it'll be different

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520 
they've actually done it'll be different
they<00:00:35.219> printed<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.360> front<00:00:36.690> where<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
they printed in the front where this is

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.900 
they printed in the front where this is
so<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.190> they've<00:00:38.340> done<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.700> because

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
so I like that they've done that because

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
so I like that they've done that because
you<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.260> whole<00:00:40.290> back<00:00:40.739> and

when<00:01:56.260> you<00:01:56.320> do<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:56.530> flap<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.950> has<00:01:57.040> DMC<00:01:57.610> was<00:01:57.850> kind

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
when you do the flap it has DMC was kind

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.330 
when you do the flap it has DMC was kind
of<00:01:58.150> shark<00:01:58.600> like<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.230> top<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.860> sharp<00:02:00.130> and

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
have the back fin there it was likely to

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.350 
have the back fin there it was likely to
go<00:02:02.050> them<00:02:02.230> over<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.800> water<00:02:03.010> here<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.550> then<00:02:04.300> you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
go them over the water here and then you

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.640 
go them over the water here and then you
get<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:04.900> then<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.080> have<00:02:05.200> like<00:02:05.230> this<00:02:05.380> kind

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
get it and then you have like this kind

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.800 
get it and then you have like this kind
of<00:02:05.680> tuna<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.310> shark<00:02:06.730> and<00:02:06.910> they<00:02:07.120> fish<00:02:07.360> just

diamonds<00:05:05.949> and<00:05:06.310> it's<00:05:06.400> makes<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.610> bit<00:05:06.760> like<00:05:06.880> fish

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
diamonds and it's makes a bit like fish

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.640 
diamonds and it's makes a bit like fish
that's<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.479> little<00:05:07.720> bit<00:05:07.810> unique<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:08.410> I'm<00:05:08.500> not

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
that's a little bit unique and I'm not

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.409 
that's a little bit unique and I'm not
actually<00:05:08.800> seen<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.340> design<00:05:09.669> that<00:05:09.849> before<00:05:10.210> where

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
actually seen I design that before where

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.029 
actually seen I design that before where
you<00:05:10.990> wouldn't<00:05:11.169> think<00:05:11.380> it's<00:05:11.590> something<00:05:11.770> else

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
you wouldn't think it's something else

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.529 
you wouldn't think it's something else
but<00:05:12.190> when<00:05:12.280> you<00:05:12.400> look<00:05:12.520> really<00:05:12.580> closely<00:05:12.910> into<00:05:13.449> it

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
but when you look really closely into it

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.510 
but when you look really closely into it
it's<00:05:13.720> actually<00:05:13.870> diamonds<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.400> can

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
it's actually diamonds and so you can

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.800 
it's actually diamonds and so you can
actually<00:05:15.610> get<00:05:15.789> a<00:05:15.849> marked<00:05:16.150> deck<00:05:16.240> as<00:05:16.449> well<00:05:16.479> but

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
actually get a marked deck as well but

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.390 
actually get a marked deck as well but
let<00:05:17.020> me<00:05:17.050> just<00:05:17.139> put<00:05:17.380> this<00:05:17.409> back<00:05:17.740> just<00:05:18.190> there

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400

it's a really nice intricate and looking

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.430 
it's a really nice intricate and looking
back<00:05:21.729> as<00:05:21.909> well<00:05:22.120> so<00:05:22.659> you<00:05:22.750> can<00:05:22.780> put<00:05:22.990> this<00:05:23.050> deck<00:05:23.229> up
