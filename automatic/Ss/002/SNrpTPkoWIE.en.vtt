you run over here quickly enough there

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.039

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
will be a guy at the top of the ladder

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.840 
will be a guy at the top of the ladder
that<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.650> can<00:02:00.799> kill<00:02:01.010> and<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:01.580> just<00:02:01.729> makes

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
that you can kill and that just makes

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.730 
that you can kill and that just makes
the<00:02:01.970> next<00:02:02.090> section<00:02:02.540> easier<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:03.320> don't<00:02:03.530> have

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the next section easier you don't have

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
the next section easier you don't have
you<00:02:04.100> don't<00:02:04.130> have<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.640> kill<00:02:04.790> him<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:07.640> it

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
you don't have to kill him but it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.419 
you don't have to kill him but it
certainly<00:02:07.880> makes<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.209> easier<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.429> there's

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
certainly makes it easier and there's

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.729 
certainly makes it easier and there's
also<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.759> guy<00:02:10.909> right<00:02:11.120> by<00:02:11.299> the<00:02:11.360> window<00:02:14.739> have

but it's not too bad because there's

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.740 
but it's not too bad because there's
