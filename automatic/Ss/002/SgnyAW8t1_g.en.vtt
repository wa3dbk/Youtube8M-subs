00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.680 
way
like<00:01:54.230> in<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.500> movies<00:01:55.070> he's<00:01:55.370> real<00:01:55.580> slow<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.570> if

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.710 
sword or something I don't know maybe
it's<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.460> knight<00:02:01.790> young<00:02:02.000> or<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.300> billy<00:02:02.570> club

it's like a knight young or a billy club
I'd<00:02:03.410> suggest<00:02:04.010> that<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:04.310> an<00:02:04.460> ion<00:02:04.670> but<00:02:05.240> it's

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
I'd suggest that it's an ion but it's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.380 
I'd suggest that it's an ion but it's
almost<00:02:05.870> as<00:02:06.230> big<00:02:06.410> as<00:02:06.470> your<00:02:06.770> body<00:02:07.010> so<00:02:07.670> your<00:02:08.119> guess

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
almost as big as your body so your guess

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.840 
almost as big as your body so your guess
is<00:02:08.420> as<00:02:08.780> good<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:09.110> mama<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:10.250> could<00:02:10.460> be<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.580> big

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
is as good as mama it could be a big

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.550 
is as good as mama it could be a big
black<00:02:11.090> pig<00:02:11.510> for<00:02:11.690> all<00:02:11.810> I<00:02:11.840> care
