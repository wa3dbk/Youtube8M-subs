00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.970
 good afternoon dear ladies and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.520
 gentlemen tankers with you andronchik 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.570
 and we will talk about the legendary German 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.329
 tanker tiger 2 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.509
 he's royal tiger namely 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 using stock tools on it 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.880
 eighty eight millimeter cannon 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.759
 KV 43 l I decided to completely abandon 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.479
 top guns and the advantages of 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.280
 whom we have incredible damage per minute 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 which is all about buns and perks 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.800
 I was 2,550 compared to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.280
 top gun 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.729
 about 2000 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.509
 units per minute better mixing speed and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.830
 accuracy at the level of stepping on the barrel and 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.429
 I pay for it with less 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.190
 breakthrough namely 203 millimeter 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:47.789
 base projectile and 237 millimeters of armor 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.399
 under the caliber that I think should be enough 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:55.080
 for eyes you can take under for comparison 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:59.270
 8 US tanks turned the T32 from tofu 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.580
 guns just 198 millimeter probljad and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 This is not indicative fight and selected 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.959
 out simply but because in it 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.209
 full stock picking 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:13.200
 as you may have noticed that even stock 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.739
 the tower which is sometimes stitched 150 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.940
 millimeters breaking through I managed to notice 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.680
 for the first time in full stock to take the master 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.770
 this fight 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.020
 the evidence is still so good 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.890
 shows how well it shows 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.710
 yourself stock gun as you see the map 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.940
 pass I occupy a place in 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.560
 n 3 in the center, I chose an ulterior motive and 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.650
 after analyzing the enemy setup 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.000
 which is just one art and quite 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.150
 not turned out etc. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.030
 as you might have noticed the water came down 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.090
 enemy conqueror and aggressively 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.960
 trying to sew me all the enemy 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.320
 the team decided to build their attack through 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.860
 the glacier is shining 29 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.410
 I'm covering up with the conqueror below 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.930
 very very hard wants to punch me 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.900
 well its nothing you like 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.610
 can notice the enemy team 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.850
 completely failed 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.470
 first-second line which is very good for me 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.860
 on group them for my position further 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.920
 video you can notice how good it is 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.110
 my super crazy dp moms I'll 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.660
 punish the concern which in response to 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.600
 can't do anything would he 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.270
 a little smarter he would throw me in 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.520
 I want to say a few words about the tower 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.070
 royal tiger is a rare tank 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.230
 fran house so some don't know what 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.010
 He perfectly stitched blob stock 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.730
 a tower 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.560
 meanwhile enemy conquer 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.380
 grabs you girl for a bun you 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.740
 You may notice how accurate the German 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.180
 gun every shot hits finds 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:06.950
 I will sing the purpose perfectly sketched 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.959
 enemy canned roof of the hull and only 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.060
 In response, I received one projectile 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.959
 notice later from the panel that completely 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.169
 konkerora took away I look rises 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.560

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.840
 his fat pop I want to say that someone has 5 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.750
 lower armor plates in the feed are thicker than 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.580

 then wifi ears to 5 snaps off the projectile 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.389
 behind the projectile also you can notice 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.789
 how thick is the armor tegra 2 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.289

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.930
 I see what enemy square 4 wants 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.320
 pick up our t-43 and rush to her aid 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:12.110
 in the meantime I have already filled three and a half 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.990
 thousands of damage almost no gray from the spot 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.199

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.630
