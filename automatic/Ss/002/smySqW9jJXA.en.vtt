00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.169
 w hair which time 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.819
 Jewish Book Week 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.689
 this is a book fair which runs 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.859
 here every year you can buy 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.720
 huge amount of both old and new books 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.970
 on the cheap 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.840
 but I still know nothing to do 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.450
 I do not think this 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.140
 but then it will all be lower due to him 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.260
 well slide 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.020
 real bookworm 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020
 just as luck Tomsk 1 9 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.710
 but still there are a couple of books on 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.210
 Russian language 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.460
 worth checking out 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.540
 in oslo for you samson 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.380
 you know it so much 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.820
 what's the question 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.780
 for the first two stages, I came here to us 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.790
 I realized that this is a writer of the artist well 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.830
 what do you 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.740
 need to live 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.329
 because it seems to me not worth it 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.090
 change from Moscow to anything else 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.450
 contractually because if 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.760
 by Irina himself 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.630
 have santiago de compostela 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.120
 for health it is cities 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.140
 loaded 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.730
 gigantic 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.730
 history of kuwait uae and myths 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.220
 herself come with a connection 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 grain sea 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 I like the city prosecutor's office 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.870
 all possible Moscow 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.940
 connecting ramos terrible 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.700
 anatolia tower 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.110
 In this regard, svyazinvest 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.420
 produced cruise debt markets 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.030
 pogrom 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.439
 lack of starling 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.430
 managed in the eye 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.359
 caravan barn 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.710
 skirts ponds 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.040
 aside immediately called an ambulance 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.440
 as stated 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 4 pp is connected with them 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.479
 business center 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.949
 if you ask Bulgakov 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.029
 described salin so that the head 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.289
 so that it really was 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.689
 bought times like they only managed 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.389
 now we don’t know what we managed that no we 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.819
 we only know that we know nothing we don’t 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.629
 we know what we had one two thousand years 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.429
 backwards 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.309
 so the percentage of Bulgakov 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.820
 how to get a very talented writer 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.530
 today created a mermaid with this 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.130
 even modern writers 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.580
 every writer creates today in 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.750
 salt dedication that as if i 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.650
 have you been there as though butane and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.009
 the writer he is obliged to portray everything so 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.999
 this is the readers own skin 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.009
 Syria felt what is 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:56.149
 the gift of writing this value is still on 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:58.709
 palanka multiplied nothing else by 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.499
 Apparently Bulgakov his value or talent 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.219
 was so large was just 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.359
 would correspond to increase salims 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.619
 and it is him himself so he 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:09.079
 represented really nobody knows 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.079
 what was 2,000 years ago frs 1 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.529
 he 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.339
 this for tseb 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.359
 France 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.449
 unique repository of the oldest known 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.499
 bible 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.489
 here it is 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.869
 prosecution manuscripts discovered 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.419
 the caves of the judean desert 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.829
 manuscript research 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.629
 confirmed that they refer 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.349
 the epochs of that country 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.499
 imagine 2,000 years ago 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.749
 of them there is the book of the prophet isaiah 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.969
 Vasilisa Marzalyuk 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.829
 after all, his reasons also affect him 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.859
 women 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.289
 publish happily with him the funds 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.069
 crying 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.969
 just like the authorities that it 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.159
 nice to hear a voice 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.360
 and now 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.209
 in a mermaid 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.519
 we have with Kazan 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.519
 everyone who wants and Sosnogorsk from Moscow 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.949
 you know by the way can not write about 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.210
 really lives 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.450
 You see, here is the sacred essence of this summer 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.790
 cities so that each population year each 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.880
 the pregnant population lives here 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.460
 filled 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.009
 have a loan maria idleness say 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.069
 life expense man live different lives 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.160
 thereby adding hit your city 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.229
 life radiation of their lives and I realized that 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.050
 his salimov is the set 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.210
 multiplicity recorders suicide 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.460
 Dmitriy Simes gas athletes 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
 whose sociologists have assembled 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.150
 actually it 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.759
 this passion and this goal of any writer 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.960
 to collect something in general 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.180
 and it doesn't matter what the whole story is. 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.780
 teams but the whole is for the artist this 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.309
 always some quality value 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:00.909
 imperceptibly for farms, too, a consequence 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.909
 of course of course of course 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:08.740
 Mr. N 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.370
 never the life of a number of books 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.539
 November Sevastopol 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.120
 impossible to resist 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.120
 nothing can be done will have to learn Hebrew 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.259
 also
