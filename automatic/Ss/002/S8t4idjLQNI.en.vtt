amazed they're seeing things that they
thought<00:00:33.809> were<00:00:33.870> science<00:00:34.320> fiction<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.920> seeing

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
thought were science fiction and seeing

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:45.380 
thought were science fiction and seeing
it<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.489> reality<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> National<00:00:45.210> Science

Foundation<00:00:45.539> saw<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> project

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
Foundation saw this a kind of project

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.119 
Foundation saw this a kind of project
that<00:00:47.579> would<00:00:47.760> really<00:00:48.270> transform<00:00:48.930> the

that would really transform the

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
that would really transform the
experience<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.430> people<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.180> the

museum what you're actually seeing here
is<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.360> science<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.010> help<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.640> can

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
is some science with your help we can

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
is some science with your help we can
suggest<00:00:57.030> exhibits<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.840> will<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
suggest exhibits that will get you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.290 
suggest exhibits that will get you
thinking<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:59.309> answer<00:00:59.760> questions<00:00:59.789> about

things you may have seen here they can

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.539 
things you may have seen here they can
also<00:01:03.329> tell<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.500> themselves<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
also tell you a bit about themselves and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.120 
also tell you a bit about themselves and
how<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:05.970> work<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.600> same<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.650> ask<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
how they work the same way you ask a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.770 
how they work the same way you ask a
question<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.729> tell<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> story<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:09.720> friends

question or tell a story to your friends
is<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.860> same<00:01:11.130> way<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.760> speak<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> us<00:01:12.330> we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
is the same way you can speak to us we

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
is the same way you can speak to us we
use<00:01:13.290> speech<00:01:13.619> recognition<00:01:13.650> technology<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
use speech recognition technology to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.390 
use speech recognition technology to
identify<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.810> words<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.470> use<00:01:16.710> statistics

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
identify your words and use statistics

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.890 
identify your words and use statistics
to<00:01:17.460> figure<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> meaning<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> words

to figure out the meaning of the words
based<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.650> context<00:01:20.340> once<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.570> what

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
based on context once we know what

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.520 
based on context once we know what
you're<00:01:21.840> talking<00:01:22.259> about

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you're talking about

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.890 
you're talking about
will<00:01:22.950> reply<00:01:23.340> appropriately<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.689> tell

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
will reply appropriately they can tell

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
will reply appropriately they can tell
you<00:01:25.080> things<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> interest<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
you things that would be of interest to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
you things that would be of interest to
middle<00:01:26.909> schoolers<00:01:27.270> things<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> have

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
middle schoolers things like do you have

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.609 
middle schoolers things like do you have
any<00:01:28.200> boyfriends<00:01:28.890> why<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.390> another

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
any boyfriends why is there another

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.700 
any boyfriends why is there another
virtual<00:01:31.619> human<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.579> should<00:01:32.790> meet

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
virtual human you think we should meet

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.610 
virtual human you think we should meet
and<00:01:35.520> chose<00:01:35.700> women<00:01:35.970> because<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:37.230> wanted<00:01:37.470> them

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
and chose women because we wanted them

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.330 
and chose women because we wanted them
to<00:01:37.650> serve<00:01:37.980> as<00:01:38.250> role<00:01:38.640> models<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:40.710> young

to serve as role models to get young

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.820 
to serve as role models to get young
women<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:42.030> interested<00:01:42.660> in<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.380> science<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
women more interested in the science and

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.250 
women more interested in the science and

and<00:01:46.470> grace<00:01:46.920> hopper<00:01:47.780> yeah<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.170> may<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.560> old

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
and grace hopper yeah they may be old

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.740 
and grace hopper yeah they may be old
fashioned<00:01:50.190> names<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.970> both<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
fashioned names but both are from the

fashioned names but both are from the
most<00:01:51.930> modern<00:01:52.410> computing<00:01:52.890> women<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.340> their

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
most modern computing women of their

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.640 
most modern computing women of their
time<00:01:53.760> what<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.570> were<00:01:54.690> trying<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.080> do<00:01:55.290> with

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
time what we were trying to do with

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.090 
time what we were trying to do with
these<00:01:56.250> virtual<00:01:56.460> humans<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.240> create<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.100> thing

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
these virtual humans is create a thing

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
these virtual humans is create a thing
that<00:01:59.220> would<00:01:59.370> stop<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.940> kids<00:02:00.150> in<00:02:00.330> their<00:02:00.450> tracks

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that would stop the kids in their tracks

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.540 
that would stop the kids in their tracks
seems<00:02:01.230> like<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:01.650> working<00:02:01.980> I<00:02:02.280> look

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
seems like it's really working I look

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.290 
seems like it's really working I look
