vans<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.930> think<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.500> leisure<00:04:41.830> travel

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
vans and I think that leisure travel

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.749 
vans and I think that leisure travel
puts<00:04:42.940> together<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.389> best<00:04:43.750> floor<00:04:44.199> plans<00:04:44.759> and

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
puts together the best floor plans and

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.640 
puts together the best floor plans and
the<00:04:46.210> most<00:04:46.419> suitable<00:04:46.870> workable<00:04:47.470> arrangement

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
the most suitable workable arrangement

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.080 
the most suitable workable arrangement
and<00:04:48.250> I'm<00:04:48.520> still<00:04:49.000> amazed<00:04:49.410> at<00:04:50.410> how<00:04:51.009> you<00:04:51.070> put<00:04:51.970> in

and I'm still amazed at how you put in

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.360 
and I'm still amazed at how you put in
all<00:04:52.330> these<00:04:52.509> compartments<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.620> everything
