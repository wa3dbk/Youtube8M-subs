00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.150
 I have two Motorola Milestone here and would like to compare which one 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.919
 Browser because the fastest is 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.379
 to stand for the comparison 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.949
 now available here the Skyfire Browser Opera Mini 5 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.589
 the Dolphin Browser HD and the standard browser on both devices 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.589
 running Android 2 2 1 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.279
 I will call each «My block» I start 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 left with the standard browser 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 and to appeal Opera Mini 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.690
 allegedly Tuli one and some are called the NWO 11 at Unified Resource Locator 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 and here every fan 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.510
 okay and then go on at the same time 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.210
 missing 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.210
 Of course that was not quite objective now 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230
 but 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.230
 okay Opera has won 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.360
 think Prof will quickly clear the cache 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.910
 and percent on the left milestone 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.990
 define the normal browser as a standard browser 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.440
 but to do that literally I am now of Mouth's customer link 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.440
 exactly standard browser 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.660
 Kiel SZ CENX 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.370
 See fans 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.770
 Klien is TUI 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.770
 Transporter to Motzko I make myself cookies 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.270
 Start browser 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.270
 while the page does not just look there 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
 OK, one more time 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.810
 Coupés and up to research 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.239
 Here again go to Google 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.040
 Nape pain circumstances does not matter what the whole takes then 1 10 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.789
 Minutes of youtube video 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.379
 but I think so 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.379
 settings 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.749

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.439
 good try number two 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.909
 and minders 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.909
 both browsers loading 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.189
 Well, who is faster 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:08.859
 Upper wheel won 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.749
 Okay, that's for sure Opera Mini 5 is 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.789
 with my blog Dr 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.079
 relatively long road network own very many pros are loaded 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.509
 as the standard browser 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.349
 I'm done 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.679
 here 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:30.389
 Opera start 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.539
 there is yes 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.539

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:37.509

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.909
 ULZ 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.249
 I take here 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.249
 Conan Doyle Finck from 8 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.479
 Steinemann here any page 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.799
 to copy him whether the Dolphin Browser loads since the beginning or whether he again 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.439
 Here the pop can be exhibited in front of the city home which may seem to be exhibited 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.769
 function 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.239
 and G 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.239
 Drammen again do not give the block 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.069

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.069
 Come on 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.749

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.749
 Photos Bad Nenndorf in the browser is pretty soon 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.210
 and 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.610
 Opera Mini 5 won 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.610
 Consumers are still supposed to be people for a long time 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.629
 the last one is not a party 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.800
 Of course, first of all again 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.800

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.069

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.529
 Chi too 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:21.339
 and it starts again 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.349
 Agricultural joked looks good for 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.210
 insure at almost the same time watch video 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.520
 Well that was a small, of course, not really objective test 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.499
 which browser is the fastest 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.499
 and what it looks like Swatch Taro Kono AMI 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.969
 I'm not sure how the video looks like 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.359
 maybe that was the case
