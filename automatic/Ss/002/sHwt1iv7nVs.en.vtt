on its side and I can do all these nice

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.280 
on its side and I can do all these nice
little<00:01:01.800> delicate<00:01:02.520> wispy<00:01:03.329> vines<00:01:06.049> stroke<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> at

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
little delicate wispy vines stroke it at

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
little delicate wispy vines stroke it at
an<00:01:07.409> angle<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:08.159> create<00:01:08.340> all<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> these

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
an angle to create all of these

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
an angle to create all of these
different<00:01:09.180> leaves<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:12.920> then<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> can

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
different leaves and then you can

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.440

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
brush in white half the brush in yellow
and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.409> through<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.310> create<00:01:24.530> this
