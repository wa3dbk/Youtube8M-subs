00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 I know it may seem absurd ridiculous 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.240
 shameful the video that I uploaded today 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.250
 but it's an idea that I've had and I 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.889
 I wanted to share it with you and like 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.170
 my channel is mine and I can do it I do it 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.210
 the other day to leave the shower what 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.690
 typical that you see yourself in the mirror and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.730
 saw the navel and I said well the navel not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.220
 ceases to be a scar from the moment of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.949
 childbirth do not stay with these two words or 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.869
 ground and scar the navel is a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.420
 scar like the scar of a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.399
 burn of a grain from a wound of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.760
 an amputation what happens is that as 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.950
 we all have our navel is 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.200
 totally normal totally normal 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.059
 have a mini hole in the middle of the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.450
 belly and that's a moment where I 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.760
 I started thinking what would happen if only one 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.280
 two , three people per million 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.020
 people had navel then that those 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.100
 people would be seen as weirdos 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.960
 strange different people 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.589
 the navel would be seen as an anomaly 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.379
 but of course we all have a rigor is 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.630
 normal do not worry I have it what you 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.880
 you have him what he has what he has 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.159
 normal therefore comes to this 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.430
 conclusion in this society in this 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.640
 world if you follow in the footsteps of others 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.610
 from the crowd you are normal if we look 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.210
 arm in the rae puts us first 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.920
 meaning 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.440
 within a thing that is in your 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.450
 natural state second meaning 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.920
 serves as a norm or rule and if we go to the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.770
 third meaning that is the one that most 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.740
 draws attention by saying one thing 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.840
 that by its nature form or magnitude 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.060
 conforms to certain set standards of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.880
 beforehand you are not saying that to be 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.250
 normal I have to follow some rules worth 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.319
 and time in those standards I sincerely 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.509
 I think those rules are put by the 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.909
 society for the people and for the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.340
 crowd of people who do it if 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.310
 everyone does something that something is wrong if a 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 person does it is not normal but not 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.609
 we all are 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 There are also different people 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.049
 strange ways therefore if you do not 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.929
 follow the steps in the others of the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.179
 crowd you're different in is different and 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.250
 It is worth to be different it is good and it is bad 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.260
 because they can be different from the others 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.560
 for better and be different from others 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.170
 for worse if everyone drinks and smokes and you do not 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.840
 smoke is something positive not inside what 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.319
 It is very positive if everyone studies 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.849
 but you do not study is something negative 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.739
 because you have to study there we have 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.349
 an example of different positive and 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.000
 different negative but who says that 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.239
 it is negative or positive what the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.269
 society the standards established by the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.030
 society society decides everything everything 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.790
 but what another problem is that every 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.890
 which sees a society from the point of 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 sight that you want to see a person has 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.040
 your own society and the society that 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.860
 reigns over all societies 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.860
 it is the most common the most normal 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.010
 and I 've eaten a lot of my head thinking 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.540
 if it's different it's fine if it's 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.820
 different is wrong 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.640
 I have come to that conclusion it can be 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.920
 different to better and it can be different 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.440
 to worse up here the video today but 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.770
 before I'll give you my own advice that 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.230
 it is always necessary to be yourself because 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.820
 imagine the hell that must be be 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.820
 someone that you are not
