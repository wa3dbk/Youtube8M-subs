 requests how to download gta 5 on pc 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.420
 I suggest looking at a few 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.279
 opposite side legality 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.320
 try on a long beige cloak 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.660
 and put a hat on the top of your head carelessly 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.730
 in other words turn into private 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.100
 detective all this is not meaningless 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.840
 idle talk can can be pretty 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.180
 interesting product officially 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.040
 stated as a puzzle platformer but on 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.130
 really something 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.130
 much more interesting and i know that 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.390
 he came out back in june so let's me 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.219
 my slupok medal 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.350
 and we will continue in the developer graph 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.690
 listed studio writes development 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.090
 consisting of six people well and the ball in 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.039
 the project was not in the section and we play for 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.350
 a bunch of pixels on the plot are 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.420
 Private Detective Richard Canvas 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.789
 which usual evening fell with 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.070
 fourth floor and got involved in 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.319
 a creepy web of corporate plots and 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.659
 intrigue the whole gameplay is essentially built on 

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.670
 two possibilities equestrian skill namely 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.619
 jump high without dying while 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.359
 drops and redirect the wiring to 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.909
 buildings in the distance jump to a height 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:18.009
 4 floors and crawling on the walls of aki peter 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.229
 parker richard helps special 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.209
 adaptation pool froggie marriage right away but 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.799
 for the possibility of the company in the wiring without 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:25.869
 risk of getting a deadly charge 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.789
 meets the cross sling device but it 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.829
 not all you have to do in 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.599
 the game since richard is private 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.869
 detective and, accordingly, takes orders for 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:36.880
 illegal seizure of something from someone 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.429
 considerable amount of time you have to 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.259
 hide in dark corners although more often here 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.209
 have to sit on the walls or hang 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.069
 under the ceiling thinking how to build 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.409
 wiring in the building so that one 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.630
 the security guard knocked out the door 2 fucked up 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.939
 discharge from the outlet she is 3 on top 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.560
 you would collapse yourself on the basis of the task 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.419
 you are charged money 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.009
 the number of which depends on your 

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:58.719
 actions when passing for example 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.369
 how quickly did you manage how much 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.559
 how many people saw you 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.659
 stunned and how many killed want more 

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:06.639
 press act fast and do it 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.560
 so that your presence is finally known 

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:10.569
 only you and your customer to the word with 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.120
 Customers there is a separate topic because 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.159
 around the hero weaves a net 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.319
 nasty wars then mindlessly do everything 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.810
 jobs will not work because working on from 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.909
 you often risk annoy others 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.190
 sooner or later the patience of the employer 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.959
 can forehead and it will disappear from the list 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.030
 orders well yes back to money 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.980
 they are spent on improvements which 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.810
 let you jump on knock out the doors 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.940
 In general, do everything to make a decision 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.530
 puzzles remained the only thing 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.780
 worth worrying during raids 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.670
 puzzles for the word are not only interesting 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.799
 and makes you think at night constantly 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.110
 more complicated are the wiring of various 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.670
 types of timers and any such graphics 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.590
 presented pretty quality 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.450
 pixel design despite the style 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.879
 traced all at a very high level 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.010
 worth noting amenable and very 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.049
 authentic sound series do not be angry poison 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.390
 6 people on the team with sleep with are 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.730
 composers well worth summing up 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.890
 playing definitely deserves attention and 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.260
 appears not tense relaxing 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.329
 and the spasm became very stylized 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.340
 it is a pity that while it is only for what 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.530
 optimizing the developers interface for 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.120
 tablets on boring pairs or in long 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.950
 traffic jams in the game was not 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.139
 long leaves double 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.700
 impression on the one hand she is pretty 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.470
 comfortable and to no doubt 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.389
 recommend the game to a friend who does not 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.340
 likes to stay with them on the other 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.590
 after all, the complete passage goes 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.209
 too fast but you had watt advice 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.280
 need and gamma if you like the video 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.859
