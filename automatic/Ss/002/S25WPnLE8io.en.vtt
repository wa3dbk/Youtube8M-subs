00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
it's it's really pushes the envelope as

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.480 
it's it's really pushes the envelope as
far<00:04:07.190> as<00:04:07.550> harmonies<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:09.260> lot<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.040> people<00:04:10.190> thought

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
far as harmonies a lot of people thought

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.710 
far as harmonies a lot of people thought
that<00:04:10.550> it<00:04:10.790> would<00:04:10.880> be<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:11.090> little<00:04:11.390> over<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.690> edge

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
that it would be a little over the edge

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.870 
that it would be a little over the edge
but<00:04:12.170> we<00:04:12.380> have<00:04:12.500> found<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:13.280> been<00:04:13.459> really

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
but we have found that it's been really

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.210 
but we have found that it's been really
well<00:04:14.240> accepted<00:04:14.840> because<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.680> reminds<00:04:16.070> people

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220
