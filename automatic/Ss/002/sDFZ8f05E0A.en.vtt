00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
came up it was already converted was all

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.630 
came up it was already converted was all
engineered<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:27.679> done<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.039> dusted<00:00:28.220> for<00:00:28.519> less

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
engineered and done and dusted for less

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.679 
engineered and done and dusted for less
than<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.820> price<00:00:29.000> was<00:00:29.179> going<00:00:29.269> to<00:00:29.390> cost<00:00:29.509> me<00:00:29.660> to

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
than the price was going to cost me to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.450 
than the price was going to cost me to
convert<00:00:30.019> that<00:00:30.199> one<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:30.619> it<00:00:30.919> was<00:00:31.039> a<00:00:31.070> bit<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.400> a

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
convert that one so it was a bit of a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.140 
convert that one so it was a bit of a
no-brainer

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
no-brainer

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.729 
no-brainer
although<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.809> conversion<00:00:33.199> was<00:00:33.320> done<00:00:33.530> really

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
although the conversion was done really

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.259 
although the conversion was done really
well<00:00:33.949> there<00:00:34.220> were<00:00:34.280> a<00:00:34.370> few<00:00:34.610> little<00:00:34.760> things<00:00:35.059> that

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
well there were a few little things that

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.060 
well there were a few little things that
were<00:00:35.420> left<00:00:35.629> a<00:00:35.960> little<00:00:36.320> bit<00:00:36.410> unfinished<00:00:36.710> and

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
were left a little bit unfinished and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.319 
were left a little bit unfinished and
that's<00:00:37.280> basically<00:00:37.670> where<00:00:37.850> I've<00:00:37.970> been<00:00:38.089> over

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
that's basically where I've been over

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.790 
that's basically where I've been over
the<00:00:38.390> last<00:00:38.449> 12<00:00:38.809> months<00:00:38.900> is<00:00:39.230> just<00:00:39.290> finishing

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
the last 12 months is just finishing

the last 12 months is just finishing
those<00:00:39.920> things<00:00:40.160> off<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:40.519> then<00:00:40.640> I<00:00:40.670> guess

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
those things off and then I guess

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.369 
those things off and then I guess
building<00:00:41.629> it<00:00:41.720> up<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.930> them<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.230> my
