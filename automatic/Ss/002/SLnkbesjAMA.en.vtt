00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
look into the methods of how they set

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.890 
look into the methods of how they set
this<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.119> much<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.329> possible<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.840> I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
this up as much as possible but I

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.569 
this up as much as possible but I
couldn't<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.350> find<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.159> there<00:01:32.400> was

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
couldn't actually find out if there was

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
couldn't actually find out if there was
a<00:01:32.610> control<00:01:33.299> condition<00:01:33.479> was<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.470> were

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
a control condition was that you were

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
a control condition was that you were
watching<00:01:34.950> cat<00:01:35.159> videos<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.670> some<00:01:36.210> other<00:01:36.390> type

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
