00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.350
 to understand each other without words was enough 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.350
 one glance 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.289

 waiting for some miracle 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:05.199
 should have happened 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.199
 but for some reason did not happen 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.199
 there was an increase in demand 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.520
