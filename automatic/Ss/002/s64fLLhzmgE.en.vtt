00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.330
bjbjLULU JUDY WOODRUFF: Now for those stations
not taking a pledge break, we look at efforts

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.099
in Washington state to curb pollution from
stormwater runoff. This report is from Katie

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:17.320
Campbell at our PBS partner station, KCTS
9 in Seattle. KATIE CAMPBELL, KCTS 9: As much

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.930
as 40,000 metric tons of oil and grease enter
Puget Sound every year. That s as much as

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.460
a battleship weighs. You might think all that
pollution comes from the usual suspects -- cargo

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.329
ships or factories. But actually it s caused
by rain. Even a light shower can create thousands

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.859
of gallons of stormwater that washes over
Seattle s nonabsorbent streets, sidewalks

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.090
and parking lots, sweeping up an array of
pollutants and turning into a river of oil,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.409
metals, pesticides and other contaminants.
s estimated that 75 percent of the toxic chemicals

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.489
in Puget Sound are carried there by runoff.
CURTIS HINMAN, Washington State University

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.809
Extension: Many people in the Puget Sound
region think that Puget Sound s in pretty

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:07.150
good shape. We have actually some of the worst
stormwater and other pollution problems in

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.460
the United States in Puget Sound. KATIE CAMPBELL:
Residents across the Northwest are taking

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.660
on the problem by capturing the runoff while
it s still a trickle by disconnecting their

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.690
downspouts and sending the water to something
called a rain garden. STACEY GIANAS, Stewardship

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.130
Partners: A rain garden is a beautiful landscape
feature you can put in your yard at home to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.180
collect rainwater runoff from your rooftop,
your downspouts, driveway, any hard surface.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.200
And the plants and soil in the rain garden
will filter out any pollutants found in that

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.840
runoff and slow it and divert it before it
goes in the storm drains. KATIE CAMPBELL:

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.810
Rain gardens are shaped like a bowl and filled
with layers of spongy soils and plants that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.530
can withstand extreme wet and dry conditions.
These gardens are built to mimic a forest

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.230
and replicate the work of the thousands of
acres of woodlands and wetlands that have

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.540
been lost to urban development. Washington
State University, along with the non-profit

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.869
group, Stewardship Partners, are working with
communities across Puget Sound to build 12,000

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.090
rain gardens in the next five years. STACEY
GIANAS: Twelve thousand rain gardens will

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.710
absorb approximately 160 million gallons of
stormwater each year. KATIE CAMPBELL: The

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.280
campaign is identifying waterways where stormwater
pollution is at a critical level. Longfellow

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.700
Creek, which runs through the North Delridge
neighborhood of West Seattle is one such location.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.190
This stream is so polluted by runoff that
88 percent of Coho salmon that come here die

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.280
before they can spawn. DAVID HYMEL, Rain Dog
Designs: I think we re going to get started,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.050
so KATIE CAMPBELL: David Hymel taught the
residents of North Delridge how to design

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.030
and build effective rain gardens. This cluster
of gardens was funded by a National Fish and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.900
Wildlife grant with the hope that once these
10 rain gardens are built, they will inspire

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.290
other homeowners to build their own. DAVID
HYMEL: We found it very important to recruit

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.230
this homeowner advocate, or we call them the
champion, who we educate about the benefits

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.910
and the need to do rain gardens. And we ask
them to go find other neighbors. KARRIE KOHLHAAS,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.180
Seattle resident: We cut holes in the burlap.
KATIE CAMPBELL: Karrie Kohlhaas had become

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.250
the rain garden champion of North Delridge.
KARRIE KOHLHAAS: I don t think it would have

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.670
worked if someone had just, you know, shown
up and said, we re putting rain gardens in

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.070
on your block. It just -- people resist that
kind of thing. KATIE CAMPBELL: But Karrie

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.540
quickly sold everyone in her neighborhood
on the idea. Everyone, that is, except her

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.460
fianc KARRIE KOHLHAAS: And I said, you know,
this one neighbor really doesn t want a rain

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.110
garden. And, you know, he just really likes
his lawn. And Todd said, "That s how I feel."

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.630
TODD MARTIN, Seattle resident: My initial
reaction was, it meant more work for me, because

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.910
I just finished building a raised bed. So
I wasn t that excited about it. KATIE CAMPBELL:

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.390
There are many misconceptions about rain gardens.
People wonder if they ll cause flooding or

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.300
if they ll become mosquito breeding grounds,
or if they ll be fussy to maintain. But according

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.770
to the rain garden experts, these are all
myths. CURTIS HINMAN: Probably the biggest

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.989
myth is that you can t use these systems or
bioretention areas, rain gardens, on poor

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.370
soils, soils that don t drain well. And, actually,
you know, we ve applied and installed, you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.020
know, designed and installed bioretention
systems on poor soils. And they work pretty

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.330
well. Very well, actually. KATIE CAMPBELL:
Curtis Hinman is the director of Washington

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.490
State University s low impact development
research program, a one-of-a-kind in the nation

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.410
facility for testing sustainable stormwater
methods like rain gardens and porous pavement.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.440
CURTIS HINMAN: Right now we re focusing on
water quality treatment through bioretention

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.389
systems or rain gardens. KATIE CAMPBELL: Some
have questioned the effectiveness of these

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.750
methods, especially after problems arose with
some rain gardens in Ballard last year. But

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.340
Hinman says that was a combination of poor
soil, groundwater being too close to the surface

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.060
and mistakes that were made during construction.
CURTIS HINMAN: Ballard rain gardens, I think,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.370
are a very good example of how important it
is to do really careful analysis, particularly

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.490
in challenging settings. KATIE CAMPBELL: Hinman
has written the handbook on installing rain

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.490
gardens in the Northwest, and his research
is being used throughout the region as new

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.250
stormwater management rules are being drafted.
CURTIS HINMAN: In the past, we ve provided

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.270
a, you know, a drain and a way for water to
get off the property. And as long as water

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.620
went down that drain, that s probably all
people cared about. Now we re building stormwater

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.290
management facilities in their yards, in their
-- in their streets. And so there s much more

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.550
interaction with the public in managing stormwater.
KATIE CAMPBELL: Right now, the state is in

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.560
the process of adopting new rules to request
developers to use sustainable stormwater methods,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.509
also known as low impact development. CURTIS
HINMAN: This is a big transition and we re

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:01.490
one of the few regions in the United States
that are now requiring low impact development

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.250
as the first choice for stormwater management.
KATIE CAMPBELL: But for neighborhoods that

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.520
are already established, it s a matter of
choice to adopt new stormwater management

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.090
methods like rain gardens. So financial incentives
are being offered to homeowners who build

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.009
rain gardens, in the form of grants, like
the one for Karrie Kohlhaas neighborhood.

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.460
KARRIE KOHLHAAS: It s like anything that s
unfamiliar. You learn a little more about

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.740
it and you get a little more acquainted with
it, you talk to other people about it and

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.949
you -- it sort of starts to normalize as an
idea. KATIE CAMPBELL: And even her biggest

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:38.130
skeptic has come around. TODD MARTIN: I would
highly recommend to other neighborhoods. In

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:44.259
fact, I would love to see Seattle be known
throughout the country for these -- this rain

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:46.260
garden program. WOMAN: We got to all squeeze
