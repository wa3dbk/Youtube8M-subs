yeah<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.110> how<00:03:07.410> fast<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.890> processor

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
yeah but how fast is the processor

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.100 
yeah but how fast is the processor
inside<00:03:08.520> is<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> mega<00:03:09.060> hertz<00:03:09.330> or<00:03:09.570> something

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
inside is a mega hertz or something

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.210 
inside is a mega hertz or something
distributable<00:03:11.070> cash<00:03:11.900> which<00:03:12.900> sibiu

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
