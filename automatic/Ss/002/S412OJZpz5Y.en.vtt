the internet before buy any kinds of
biking<00:00:22.410> gear<00:00:22.670> I<00:00:23.670> look<00:00:24.300> at<00:00:24.480> em<00:00:25.050> TBR<00:00:25.710> reviews

biking gear I look at em TBR reviews
those<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.080> always<00:00:28.289> helpful<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.980> sometimes

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
those are always helpful but sometimes

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.609 
those are always helpful but sometimes
it's<00:00:29.730> better<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> actually<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:31.140> able<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> see

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it's better to actually be able to see

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.319 
it's better to actually be able to see
the<00:00:32.340> product<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.630> sometimes<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:35.329> images

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the product and sometimes the images

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.569 
the product and sometimes the images
that<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.660> find<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.079> websites<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:38.340> all

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that you find on the websites that's all

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.850 
that you find on the websites that's all
these<00:00:38.730> things<00:00:39.140> they<00:00:40.140> don't<00:00:40.320> really<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.680> them

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
these things they don't really do them

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.360 
these things they don't really do them
justice<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.600> took<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.370> deliberation

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
justice so it took a lot of deliberation

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
justice so it took a lot of deliberation
before<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.270> decided<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.020> actually<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:46.620> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
before I decided to actually get this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.660 
before I decided to actually get this
shoe<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.379> Zappos<00:00:49.829> made

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
shoe but you know going with Zappos made

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
shoe but you know going with Zappos made
it<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> lot<00:00:50.969> easier<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:52.160> they<00:00:53.160> have

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it a lot easier because they they have

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
it a lot easier because they they have
that<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:54.239> pay<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> shipping<00:00:54.930> both<00:00:55.379> ways

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
that they pay for the shipping both ways

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
that they pay for the shipping both ways
so<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.309> don't<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> shoe<00:00:56.850> gets<00:00:57.030> send

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
so if you don't like the shoe gets send

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.830 
so if you don't like the shoe gets send
it<00:00:57.360> back<00:00:57.980> which<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.100> incredible<00:00:59.609> but<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.510> want

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
it back which is incredible but I want

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
it back which is incredible but I want
to<00:01:00.899> show<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.320> shoe<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.219> got

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to show you this shoe I think it's got

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.469 
to show you this shoe I think it's got
great<00:01:02.640> style<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:05.100> mean<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.180> wear<00:01:06.299> this

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
great style I mean I would wear this

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.670

shoe<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> street<00:01:08.119> if<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.420> wasn't<00:01:09.680> intending

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

does<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.480> mean<00:02:15.780> well<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.410> means<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
does that mean well it means that the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.870 
does that mean well it means that the
tongue<00:02:18.080> actually<00:02:19.080> just<00:02:19.320> wraps<00:02:19.560> around<00:02:19.880> into

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
tongue actually just wraps around into

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.170 
tongue actually just wraps around into
the<00:02:21.180> inside<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.080> upper<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.880> has<00:02:24.000> got

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the inside of the upper and this has got

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.390 
the inside of the upper and this has got
a<00:02:24.210> ton<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.990> padding<00:02:25.530> right<00:02:25.560> here<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.220> that's

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
a ton of padding right here so that's

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.790 
a ton of padding right here so that's
actually<00:02:26.850> where<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:27.210> inside<00:02:27.570> ankle<00:02:28.050> goes

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
actually where your inside ankle goes

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.480 
actually where your inside ankle goes
right<00:02:29.160> there<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:30.030> protects<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.840> from

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
right there and this protects you from

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.100 
right there and this protects you from
hitting<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.060> crank<00:02:33.330> arms<00:02:33.720> which<00:02:34.080> is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
hitting the the crank arms which is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.050 
hitting the the crank arms which is
something<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.190> always<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.670> actually

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
something that I always do actually

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.650 
something that I always do actually
bought<00:02:36.360> some<00:02:37.550> some<00:02:38.550> ankle<00:02:38.850> protectors<00:02:39.420> for

I'm really happy with it so far and I

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.030 
I'm really happy with it so far and I
was<00:03:54.510> wondering<00:03:54.900> about<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.440> size<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.980> was

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
was wondering about the size that was

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.410 
was wondering about the size that was
one<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> reasons<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.760> wanted<00:03:56.940> was<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.180> pose

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
one of the reasons I wanted was a pose

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.960 
one of the reasons I wanted was a pose
because<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.019> didn't<00:03:58.290> know<00:03:58.440> if<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.550> size<00:03:59.760> was

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
because I didn't know if the size was

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.690 
because I didn't know if the size was
gonna<00:04:00.120> fit<00:04:00.450> or<00:04:00.600> not<00:04:00.680> I'm<00:04:01.680> normally<00:04:02.160> at<00:04:02.250> 11<00:04:02.610> and
