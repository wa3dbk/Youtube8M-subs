water-soluble you can only clean it up
with<00:00:40.290> mineral<00:00:40.680> spirits<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.360> kind<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
with mineral spirits so it's kind of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.180 
with mineral spirits so it's kind of
messy<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.879> smells<00:00:45.149> sort<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.860> funky<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that nice chemical I'm going to be high

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.830 
that nice chemical I'm going to be high
kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> way<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.570> critical<00:00:54.570> part

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
kind of way and then the critical part

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.450 
kind of way and then the critical part
is<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> take<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> clump<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
is that you have to take a clump of it

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
is that you have to take a clump of it
normally<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.609> kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.000> grainy<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
normally it's kind of grainy like that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.979 
normally it's kind of grainy like that
at<00:01:02.190> least<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.059> only<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.690> I've<00:01:03.840> ever

tiny<00:01:23.670> bit<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.210> mineral<00:01:24.630> spirits<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.320> bit

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
tiny bit of mineral spirits a little bit

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.249 
tiny bit of mineral spirits a little bit
if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> take<00:01:26.880> too<00:01:27.090> much<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.540> turns<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.020> into<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
if you take too much it turns it into a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.630 
if you take too much it turns it into a
machine<00:01:28.470> ass<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.740> pour<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> tiny<00:01:32.400> little

machine ass and you pour a tiny little
drop<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.090> your<00:01:33.210> hand<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.970> work<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> a

drop in your hand and you work it a
little<00:01:36.329> bit<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:37.250> until<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
little bit more until it's the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.240 
little bit more until it's the
consistency<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.540> cookie<00:01:39.930> dough<00:01:40.250> that's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
consistency of cookie dough that's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.020 
consistency of cookie dough that's
exactly<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.329> dad<00:01:42.509> said<00:01:42.750> cookie<00:01:43.170> dough<00:01:43.290> I

bake law so I know about cookie dough it
was<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> good<00:01:47.880> analogy<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.420> him<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.810> make<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> new

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
was a good analogy for him to make a new

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
was a good analogy for him to make a new
ID<00:01:49.380> understand<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.299> pretty

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
ID understand that so this is pretty

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
ID understand that so this is pretty
much<00:01:51.570> ready<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.170> I've<00:01:52.409> left<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.860> putty<00:01:53.070> knife

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
much ready and I've left my putty knife

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.280 
much ready and I've left my putty knife
over<00:01:53.520> by<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> camera<00:01:55.460> got<00:01:56.460> me<00:01:56.549> knife<00:01:56.750> now<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
over by the camera got me knife now and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.110 
over by the camera got me knife now and
put<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.189> area<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.960 

in<00:02:03.600> order<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.460> we<00:02:05.460> take<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.730> little

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
in order to do that we take a little

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.540 
in order to do that we take a little
chunk<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.510> your<00:02:07.410> knife<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.830> you're<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.490> to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
chunk on your knife and you're going to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.550 
chunk on your knife and you're going to
smudge<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.150> in<00:02:09.300> there

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320 

this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:13.980> kind<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.370> bad<00:02:14.550> angle<00:02:14.790> come<00:02:15.150> right

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
this is kind of a bad angle come right

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.470 
this is kind of a bad angle come right
at<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.569> edge<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:17.069> switching<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.030> don't<00:02:18.300> worry

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
at the edge so switching it don't worry

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.290 
at the edge so switching it don't worry
if<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.750> looks<00:02:18.780> good<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.670> not<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.090> final

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
if it looks good this is not the final

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.170 
if it looks good this is not the final
step<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:26.220> want<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.489> really<00:02:26.670> get<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.030> in

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
step and you want to really get it in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.080 
step and you want to really get it in
there<00:02:27.420> good<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.050> really<00:02:31.380> tricky<00:02:31.620> angle

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.070 

I'm<00:02:36.090> doing<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> bad<00:02:36.569> job<00:02:36.599> here<00:02:38.660> I'm<00:02:39.660> worried<00:02:39.989> too

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
I'm doing a bad job here I'm worried too

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.040 
I'm doing a bad job here I'm worried too
much<00:02:40.140> about<00:02:40.230> talking<00:02:40.890> unless<00:02:41.010> about<00:02:41.370> working

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
much about talking unless about working

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.949 
much about talking unless about working
so<00:02:43.050> let<00:02:43.260> me<00:02:43.319> just<00:02:43.470> get<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.280> here<00:02:47.959> dropping

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
so let me just get this in here dropping

00:02:48.959 --> 00:03:01.960 
so let me just get this in here dropping
it<00:02:49.230> all<00:02:49.350> over<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.709> place

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.540 

alright<00:03:02.690> so

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.910 

next<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.760> most<00:03:06.970> critical<00:03:07.750> step<00:03:08.020> is<00:03:08.650> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
next and most critical step is the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.570 
next and most critical step is the
smoothing<00:03:09.400> out<00:03:10.590> for<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:11.770> you<00:03:12.340> take<00:03:12.550> your

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
smoothing out for this you take your

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.450 
smoothing out for this you take your
mineral<00:03:13.000> spirits<00:03:13.360> again<00:03:13.600> take<00:03:14.080> your<00:03:14.110> rag<00:03:14.460> get

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
mineral spirits again take your rag get

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.080 
mineral spirits again take your rag get
the<00:03:15.580> rag<00:03:15.730> wet<00:03:16.090> with<00:03:16.360> mineral<00:03:16.750> spirits<00:03:18.090> like

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
the rag wet with mineral spirits like

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.760 
the rag wet with mineral spirits like
not<00:03:19.450> like<00:03:19.570> soaking<00:03:19.870> wet<00:03:20.140> or<00:03:20.290> anything<00:03:20.620> just

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
not like soaking wet or anything just

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.710 
not like soaking wet or anything just
slightly<00:03:21.130> damp<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.850> take<00:03:22.090> your<00:03:22.270> putty<00:03:22.480> knife

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
slightly damp you take your putty knife

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.130 
slightly damp you take your putty knife
and<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:24.250> cover<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.840> mineral

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
and you cover it with the mineral

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.990 
and you cover it with the mineral
spirits<00:03:26.560> it's<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.250> key<00:03:28.410> men<00:03:29.460> with<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.580> proper

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
spirits it's the key men with the proper

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.900 
spirits it's the key men with the proper
angle<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.600> proper<00:03:32.020> force<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:33.400> start<00:03:33.730> up

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
angle and the proper force you start up

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.940 
angle and the proper force you start up
at<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.060> top<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.880> run<00:03:37.150> your<00:03:37.330> putty<00:03:37.570> knife

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
at the top and you run your putty knife

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.860 
at the top and you run your putty knife
nice<00:03:38.950> voice<00:03:39.250> they're<00:03:39.580> done<00:03:39.850> you<00:03:40.510> run<00:03:40.690> your

putty knife smooth and even all the way

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.850 
putty knife smooth and even all the way
down<00:03:48.450> that's<00:03:49.450> nice<00:03:50.850> then<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:51.970> next<00:03:52.090> step<00:03:52.450> is

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
down that's nice then the next step is

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.740 
down that's nice then the next step is
without<00:03:53.860> gouging<00:03:54.460> into<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.910> newly<00:03:55.510> laid

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750
