00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
just like a two years of getting that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.679 
just like a two years of getting that
album<00:01:30.990> ready<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:32.009> quite<00:01:32.509> surreal<00:01:33.509> when

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
album ready so it was quite surreal when

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.480 
album ready so it was quite surreal when
we<00:01:33.810> finally<00:01:34.049> actually<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.189> late<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I still seems weird that it's actually
