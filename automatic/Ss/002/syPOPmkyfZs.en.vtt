there's<00:00:23.759> a<00:00:23.820> slightly<00:00:24.119> interesting<00:00:24.630> story

here<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.339> I<00:00:26.669> know<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.359> material<00:00:28.019> Cowan

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
here in that I know what material Cowan

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.040 
here in that I know what material Cowan
is<00:00:28.949> using<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.929> s9<00:00:31.910> it<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.060> glass<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.900> more

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
is using for the s9 it is glass but more

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.830 
is using for the s9 it is glass but more
specifically<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> glass<00:00:35.340> composite<00:00:35.850> that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
specifically it's a glass composite that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
specifically it's a glass composite that
corning<00:00:37.379> calls<00:00:37.680> Gorilla<00:00:38.309> Glass<00:00:40.190> this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> used

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
corning calls Gorilla Glass this is used

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.010 
corning calls Gorilla Glass this is used
in<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.940> different<00:00:42.120> electronics<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
in a lot of different electronics and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.130 
in a lot of different electronics and
such<00:00:44.239> but<00:00:45.710> knowing<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.690> having<00:00:48.690> tested

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
such but knowing that and having tested

that<00:00:56.609> the<00:00:57.059> Zune<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> p3<00:00:58.379> also<00:00:59.309> used<00:00:59.489> some

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that the Zune and the p3 also used some

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.959 
that the Zune and the p3 also used some
sort<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.000> glass<00:01:00.239> composite<00:01:00.960> materials

sort of glass composite materials

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.060 
sort of glass composite materials
similar<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.390> Corning<00:01:04.170> Gorilla<00:01:04.379> Glass<00:01:04.620> or

similar to Corning Gorilla Glass or

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.550 
similar to Corning Gorilla Glass or
perhaps<00:01:05.940> it<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.360> even<00:01:06.630> grow<00:01:06.780> glass<00:01:07.110> they<00:01:07.320> just

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
perhaps it is even grow glass they just

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
perhaps it is even grow glass they just
have<00:01:07.800> not<00:01:07.980> announced<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
have not announced that they use that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.200 
have not announced that they use that
material<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:10.590> come<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.800> has<00:01:11.520> released<00:01:12.030> a

material but come on has released a
press<00:01:12.570> statement<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.260> do<00:01:13.320> use<00:01:13.740> our

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

corning has released that statement I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.900 
corning has released that statement I
think<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> those<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.550> with<00:01:23.550> that<00:01:23.730> I'm

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910
