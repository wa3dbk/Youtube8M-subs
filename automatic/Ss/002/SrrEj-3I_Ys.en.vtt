you<00:02:12.730> gotta<00:02:12.910> use<00:02:13.060> two<00:02:13.270> hands<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.860> got<00:02:15.040> to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
you gotta use two hands you got to

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.800 
you gotta use two hands you got to
separate<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.760> pull<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.300> out<00:02:16.390> there<00:02:16.600> used<00:02:16.750> to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
separate and pull it out there used to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.230 
separate and pull it out there used to
be<00:02:16.900> hands<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.680> I've<00:02:18.220> got<00:02:18.430> some<00:02:18.580> ideas<00:02:18.730> and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
be hands so I've got some ideas and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.540 
be hands so I've got some ideas and
probably<00:02:19.840> make<00:02:19.960> an<00:02:20.080> updated<00:02:20.350> video<00:02:20.680> when<00:02:21.490> I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
probably make an updated video when I

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.750 
probably make an updated video when I
show<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.330> other<00:02:22.540> sheath<00:02:22.990> options<00:02:23.760> you're

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
show you the other sheath options you're

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.220 
show you the other sheath options you're
kind<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.030> cool<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.390> make<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.840> knife<00:02:26.050> and

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
kind of cool to make a knife and

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.220 
kind of cool to make a knife and
multiple<00:02:26.650> sheets<00:02:27.360> provide<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.540> use<00:02:29.020> of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
multiple sheets provide the the use of

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.760 
multiple sheets provide the the use of
different<00:02:29.380> options<00:02:29.650> right<00:02:29.980> okay<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:32.560> you

without those burnt cinch marks all

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.250 
without those burnt cinch marks all
right<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.610> cool<00:04:09.760> part<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.780> how

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
right and in the cool part is the how

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.180 
right and in the cool part is the how
the<00:04:12.090> power<00:04:13.090> cord<00:04:13.360> necklace<00:04:13.510> works<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.620> this

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
the power cord necklace works and this

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.539 
the power cord necklace works and this
is<00:04:15.310> going<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.489> be<00:04:15.550> difficult<00:04:15.970> with<00:04:16.230> one<00:04:17.230> hand

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
is going to be difficult with one hand

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.699 
is going to be difficult with one hand
so

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
so

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.670

I<00:04:19.769> may<00:04:20.310> happen<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.609> this<00:04:20.789> video<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.479> two<00:04:21.630> parts

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
I may happen to this video in two parts

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.900 
I may happen to this video in two parts
okay<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.120> left<00:04:24.300> over<00:04:24.419> black<00:04:24.930> which

zoom<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.169> okay<00:04:31.169> with<00:04:31.289> leftover<00:04:31.740> black<00:04:31.979> which

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
zoom in okay with leftover black which

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.020 
zoom in okay with leftover black which
comes<00:04:32.789> up<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.620> down<00:04:34.639> see<00:04:35.639> think<00:04:35.880> there's

enough<00:04:36.240> contrast<00:04:36.750> here<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.169> show<00:04:38.780> let's<00:04:39.780> try

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
enough contrast here to show let's try

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.770 
enough contrast here to show let's try
that<00:04:40.110> again<00:04:41.330> okay<00:04:42.330> with<00:04:42.569> the<00:04:47.240> sorry<00:04:48.240> guys<00:04:48.419> how

that again okay with the sorry guys how

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.089 
that again okay with the sorry guys how
to<00:04:48.810> find<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.110> good<00:04:49.229> light<00:04:49.410> source<00:04:51.800> okay<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:52.860> with

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
to find a good light source okay so with

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.800 
to find a good light source okay so with
the<00:04:53.160> leftover<00:04:53.550> black<00:04:53.759> which<00:04:54.000> comes<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.720> the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
the leftover black which comes to the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.460 
the leftover black which comes to the
left<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.590> right<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:56.070> this<00:04:56.699> last<00:04:57.470> we've

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
left and to the right of this last we've

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.070 
left and to the right of this last we've
this<00:04:58.740> last<00:04:59.009> knot<00:04:59.340> if<00:04:59.520> you<00:04:59.669> will<00:04:59.849> it<00:05:00.630> extends

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
this last knot if you will it extends

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.200 
this last knot if you will it extends
out<00:05:01.349> another<00:05:01.710> six<00:05:02.039> feet<00:05:02.370> another<00:05:02.699> three<00:05:03.000> feet

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
out another six feet another three feet

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.200 
out another six feet another three feet
or<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:03.449> so<00:05:04.229> what<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.410> did<00:05:04.530> was<00:05:04.919> I<00:05:05.250> wove<00:05:05.729> it<00:05:05.940> back

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
or so so what I did was I wove it back

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.719 
or so so what I did was I wove it back
through<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:07.560> opening<00:05:07.770> see<00:05:08.220> there's<00:05:08.400> opening

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
through the opening see there's opening

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.189 
through the opening see there's opening
there<00:05:08.880> there's<00:05:09.090> an<00:05:09.180> opening<00:05:09.449> there<00:05:09.479> well

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
there there's an opening there well

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.689 
there there's an opening there well
there's<00:05:10.410> an<00:05:10.530> opening<00:05:10.860> over<00:05:10.919> here<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.490> weave

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
there's an opening over here so I weave

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.219 
there's an opening over here so I weave
it<00:05:11.880> through<00:05:11.909> there<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.860> all<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:14.789> do<00:05:15.000> is<00:05:15.509> melt

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
it through there and all I do is melt

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.159 
it through there and all I do is melt
the<00:05:16.560> ends<00:05:17.099> of<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.490> power<00:05:17.729> cord<00:05:17.970> until<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.020> get

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
the ends of the power cord until you get

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.570 
the ends of the power cord until you get
those<00:05:19.349> round<00:05:20.030> ball<00:05:21.620> drops<00:05:22.620> at<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.099> end<00:05:23.340> enough

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
those round ball drops at the end enough

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.749 
those round ball drops at the end enough
that's<00:05:23.820> kind<00:05:24.030> of<00:05:24.060> my<00:05:24.180> locking<00:05:24.599> mechanism<00:05:25.199> so

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
that's kind of my locking mechanism so

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.310 
that's kind of my locking mechanism so
it's<00:05:26.759> a<00:05:27.030> it's<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.419> tight<00:05:27.630> fit<00:05:27.659> here<00:05:28.139> and<00:05:28.259> you

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
it's a it's a tight fit here and you

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.010 
it's a it's a tight fit here and you
have<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.590> have<00:05:28.740> a<00:05:28.770> snug<00:05:29.130> fit<00:05:29.750> right<00:05:30.750> now<00:05:30.900> I'm

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
have to have a snug fit right now I'm

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.920 
have to have a snug fit right now I'm
pulling<00:05:31.349> on<00:05:31.409> on<00:05:31.740> those<00:05:32.270> on<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.389> ends<00:05:33.720> with<00:05:33.840> the

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
pulling on on those on the ends with the

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.770 
pulling on on those on the ends with the
black<00:05:34.139> right<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.949> can<00:05:35.070> see<00:05:35.280> if<00:05:35.780> it

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
black right and you can see if it

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.600 
black right and you can see if it
requires<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.259> little<00:05:37.500> bit<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.740> effort<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.070> slide

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
requires a little bit of effort to slide

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.490 
requires a little bit of effort to slide
it<00:05:38.849> through<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.449> that's<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:40.050> good<00:05:40.169> thing<00:05:40.349> so<00:05:40.440> it

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
it through and that's a good thing so it

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.230 
it through and that's a good thing so it
doesn't<00:05:40.740> come<00:05:40.830> off<00:05:40.860> so<00:05:41.610> this<00:05:41.789> can<00:05:41.969> actually<00:05:42.090> be

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
doesn't come off so this can actually be

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.050 
doesn't come off so this can actually be
cinched<00:05:42.659> around<00:05:42.780> your<00:05:43.080> neck<00:05:43.789> this<00:05:44.789> could<00:05:44.969> be

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
cinched around your neck this could be

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.959 
cinched around your neck this could be
centered<00:05:45.360> around<00:05:45.419> your<00:05:45.719> neck<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.979> fit<00:05:47.250> you

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
centered around your neck to fit you

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.370 
centered around your neck to fit you
know<00:05:48.060> over<00:05:48.419> your<00:05:48.539> head<00:05:48.690> and<00:05:48.900> tighten<00:05:49.229> it<00:05:49.259> off

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
know over your head and tighten it off

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.219 
know over your head and tighten it off
almost<00:05:49.620> like<00:05:49.770> a<00:05:49.860> necktie<00:05:50.690> yet<00:05:51.690> if<00:05:51.930> it<00:05:52.080> gets

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
almost like a necktie yet if it gets

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.350 
almost like a necktie yet if it gets
caught<00:05:52.469> anywhere<00:05:52.860> this<00:05:53.669> will<00:05:53.969> slide<00:05:54.330> through

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
caught anywhere this will slide through

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.510 
caught anywhere this will slide through
these<00:05:55.110> ends<00:05:55.349> will<00:05:55.440> slide<00:05:55.889> through<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.310> power

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
these ends will slide through the power

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.110 
these ends will slide through the power
cord<00:06:00.949> these<00:06:01.949> ends<00:06:02.280> will<00:06:02.340> slide<00:06:02.759> through<00:06:02.789> the

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
cord these ends will slide through the

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.580 
cord these ends will slide through the
power<00:06:03.270> cord<00:06:03.630> so<00:06:03.930> you're<00:06:04.199> not<00:06:04.320> going<00:06:04.530> to

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
power cord so you're not going to

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.909 
power cord so you're not going to
strangle<00:06:05.219> yourself<00:06:05.460> on<00:06:05.849> on<00:06:06.090> this<00:06:07.020> necklace<00:06:07.469> so

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
strangle yourself on on this necklace so

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.510 
strangle yourself on on this necklace so
this<00:06:08.759> whole<00:06:08.940> thing<00:06:09.120> quickly<00:06:09.330> deploys<00:06:10.520> undoes

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
this whole thing quickly deploys undoes

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.629 
this whole thing quickly deploys undoes
itself<00:06:11.729> whatever<00:06:12.229> through<00:06:13.229> the<00:06:13.520> hole<00:06:14.520> in

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
itself whatever through the hole in

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.820 
itself whatever through the hole in
there<00:06:14.849> so<00:06:15.630> nothing<00:06:15.900> is<00:06:16.020> fixed<00:06:16.349> nothing<00:06:16.710> is

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
there so nothing is fixed nothing is

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.700 
there so nothing is fixed nothing is
locked<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.340> nothing<00:06:17.639> is<00:06:17.699> knotted<00:06:18.440> and<00:06:19.440> it's

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
locked and nothing is knotted and it's

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.589 
locked and nothing is knotted and it's
snug<00:06:20.400> enough<00:06:20.520> so<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:20.880> can<00:06:21.060> cinch<00:06:21.300> it<00:06:21.449> and

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
snug enough so you can cinch it and

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.260 
snug enough so you can cinch it and
carry<00:06:21.810> it<00:06:21.990> if<00:06:22.830> it's<00:06:23.130> not<00:06:23.340> snug<00:06:23.820> enough<00:06:23.940> than

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
carry it if it's not snug enough than

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.520 
carry it if it's not snug enough than
what<00:06:24.389> you<00:06:24.479> have<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:24.840> do<00:06:24.990> is<00:06:25.169> you<00:06:25.259> have<00:06:25.349> to<00:06:25.409> go

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
what you have to do is you have to go

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.950 
what you have to do is you have to go
back<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.860> this<00:06:26.009> knot<00:06:26.310> here<00:06:26.759> and<00:06:27.060> tighten<00:06:27.690> it<00:06:27.750> I

back to this knot here and tighten it I

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.629 
back to this knot here and tighten it I
can't<00:06:28.500> anymore<00:06:28.740> because<00:06:29.010> I<00:06:29.130> put<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.400> crazy

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
can't anymore because I put the crazy

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.750 
can't anymore because I put the crazy
glue<00:06:30.050> but<00:06:31.050> if<00:06:31.979> you<00:06:32.130> do<00:06:32.250> it<00:06:32.370> right<00:06:32.490> the<00:06:32.610> first

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
glue but if you do it right the first

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.240 
glue but if you do it right the first
time

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
time

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.000 
time
and<00:06:33.340> putting<00:06:34.120> weaving<00:06:34.660> these<00:06:34.900> in<00:06:35.320> feeding

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
and putting weaving these in feeding

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.490 
and putting weaving these in feeding
these<00:06:36.250> through<00:06:36.610> the<00:06:36.760> hold<00:06:37.000> is<00:06:37.290> difficult<00:06:38.290> so

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
these through the hold is difficult so

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.320 
these through the hold is difficult so
if<00:06:39.100> you<00:06:39.220> have<00:06:39.340> a<00:06:39.370> hard<00:06:39.610> time<00:06:39.820> weaving<00:06:40.240> it

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
if you have a hard time weaving it

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.950 
if you have a hard time weaving it
through<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:40.780> gaps<00:06:41.350> that<00:06:41.620> are<00:06:41.680> these<00:06:42.370> holes

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
through the gaps that are these holes

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.300 
through the gaps that are these holes
even<00:06:43.960> hard<00:06:44.110> time<00:06:44.260> doing<00:06:44.410> it<00:06:44.620> then<00:06:44.800> then<00:06:45.160> you've

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
even hard time doing it then then you've

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.890 
even hard time doing it then then you've
done<00:06:45.460> it<00:06:45.580> right<00:06:45.700> and<00:06:45.970> I<00:06:46.000> guess<00:06:46.210> if<00:06:46.390> if<00:06:46.630> for<00:06:46.690> some

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
done it right and I guess if if for some

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.650 
done it right and I guess if if for some
reason<00:06:47.380> this<00:06:48.190> very<00:06:48.580> one<00:06:48.880> if<00:06:49.300> I<00:06:49.420> cannot

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
reason this very one if I cannot

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.430 
reason this very one if I cannot
dissolve<00:06:50.470> the<00:06:50.790> the<00:06:51.790> Krazy<00:06:52.000> Glue<00:06:52.360> this<00:06:53.260> one

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
dissolve the the Krazy Glue this one

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.190 
dissolve the the Krazy Glue this one
does<00:06:53.680> get<00:06:54.000> you<00:06:55.000> know<00:06:55.090> to<00:06:55.420> lose<00:06:55.630> I<00:06:55.900> could<00:06:56.050> always

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
does get you know to lose I could always

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.590 
does get you know to lose I could always
feed<00:06:56.500> it<00:06:56.650> through<00:06:56.680> this<00:06:56.980> hole<00:06:57.220> and<00:06:57.490> then<00:06:58.180> again

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
feed it through this hole and then again

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.890 
feed it through this hole and then again
through<00:06:58.840> this<00:06:59.080> hole<00:07:00.570> again<00:07:01.570> through<00:07:01.750> this

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
through this hole again through this

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.420 
through this hole again through this
hole<00:07:02.110> and<00:07:02.290> then<00:07:02.800> it<00:07:02.890> will<00:07:02.980> definitely<00:07:03.100> be

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
hole and then it will definitely be

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.000 
hole and then it will definitely be
tight<00:07:04.180> so<00:07:04.390> this<00:07:04.510> will<00:07:04.690> go<00:07:04.810> down<00:07:04.840> through<00:07:05.830> the

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
tight so this will go down through the

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.880 
tight so this will go down through the
hole<00:07:06.190> back<00:07:06.970> down<00:07:07.270> through<00:07:07.510> the<00:07:07.570> back<00:07:07.830> okay<00:07:08.830> so

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
hole back down through the back okay so

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.800 
hole back down through the back okay so
the<00:07:09.070> next<00:07:09.160> shot<00:07:09.460> I<00:07:09.670> will<00:07:09.730> try<00:07:10.030> to<00:07:10.090> prop<00:07:10.510> up<00:07:10.690> this

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
the next shot I will try to prop up this

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.930 
the next shot I will try to prop up this
camera<00:07:11.140> and<00:07:11.590> show<00:07:12.280> you<00:07:12.310> what<00:07:12.550> it<00:07:12.670> looks<00:07:12.820> like
