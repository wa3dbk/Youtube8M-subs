00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello to all ladies ladies geeks 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.629
 mickey's whiskeys speaks to them the shrink 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.630
 millionaire with another video this will be for 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.710
 the tournament cup numbers 2013 organized 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.109
 by my partner alan 22 03 98 and my 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.160
 rival will be super that 2009 lucky to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.100
 both and greetings 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 this will be a top 6 of the best bosses 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.689
 of a great game I mean 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.640
 castlevania lords of shadow ' in this 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.560
 game there are a lot of bosses but 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.710
 ranking is just the funniest and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.710
 great let's start then with the 6th place 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.260
 here we have the ogre of the fortress level 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.270
 of the mountain itself is not very difficult 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.550
 you should only know when to dodge and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.739
 attacking will sometimes hit the floor with 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 both hands or take out a stone and you 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.180
 will try to hit with her her pattern of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.010
 attacks is varied but relatively 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.649
 easy to dodge but it's very 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 entertaining to fight against him is good 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.989
 boss but I prefer the following 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.449
 put five here we have the gentleman 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.760
 black well the first time you see 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.920
 the black knight looks very imposing and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.450
 if it can be difficult the first time 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.000
 fight against him but 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.520
 second or third it becomes simple it is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.890
 slow their attacks are easily dodged 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.100
 and it's not hard to hit him a few hits 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.439
 although you do not trust yourself in the second phase 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 He begins to stick his sword on the floor 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.970
 leaving a black oil that will start at 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.159
 chase you if it catches you you can not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.829
 move and you 're helpless against 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.039
 here it becomes faster and harder 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.020
 but not so much in the end a very good fight 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.409
 entertained with the position it deserves 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.200
 in this top in position 4 we have the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.270
 rocks the commander of the vampires to 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.490
 simple sight may seem similar to your 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 brother browner with whom we fight a lot 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.500
 before but the truth is not the rocks 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.049
 much but much more difficult is more 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.989
 fast their attacks go down quite a bit and in 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.239
 summary is much more powerful the first 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.520
 part of the battle is good you should only 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.250
 dodge their attacks very difficult thing in 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.560
 occasions when you have already downloaded him enough 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.929
 life will open some coffins in which 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.670
 licÃ¡ntropos keeps sucking corpses 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.340
 your blood and recover to an amount 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.960
 considerable health breaks the coffin and 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.330
 keep attacking repeats 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.400
 this process up to kill him a fight 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.380
 pretty good and difficult especially 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.450
 for the newbies and although I have already 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.750
 playing this game good weather still 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.570
 costing me work sometimes put 3 of 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.480
 this list in position 3 we have a 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.690
 satan the final boss of the game and the most 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.820
 difficult to my opinion as it is obvious well 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.650
 what you have to do is attack activating 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.080
 the magic opposite to the one he is using 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.630
 only in that way will you put down life 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.270
 sounds easy but believe me it is not 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.310
 his attacks go down a chingo is very 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.770
 fast and for when you least remember 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.750
 and it will be lowered enough life 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.120
 second phase of the fight consists of what 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.670
 just that he will start to take out 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.650
 luminous and dark magic seals yes 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.170
 you fall into one of them using magic 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.060
 opposite will leave you immobile and will open the way 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.980
 to satan attack but you should only 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.410
 change to the corresponding magic to 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.170
 get rid of the seal will also start at 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.720
 invoke blue and red reapers are not 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.180
 difficult but very annoying and 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.510
 same time a rain of fire lash 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.350
 to the fight zone an epic battle 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.630
 frantic 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.630
 so entertaining and a great end to 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.020
 this great game however is not my 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.630
 favorite number 2 here we have the 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.880
 evil butcher at a glance can 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.250
 seem very difficult but that's just the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.170
 first time from the second one it 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.450
 it becomes easy enough you just have to 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.670
 dodging their attacks could say that neither 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.070
 you do not even have to use magic but 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.710
 you can use it if you want even if 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.530
 easy is super entertaining I do not know if it's 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.290
 my thing or not but that's how I see it 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.600
 deserved this post let's finish the top 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.180

 they will see him wearing the medal and the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.730
 recognition of the best fight of the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.340
 game takes it 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.790
 chan chan 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.130
 ajam cornell the dark lord lycanthrope 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.139
 what do you want a boss to tell you 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.449
 awesome imposing and with a great 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.910
 music I've already talked about this boss 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.370
 first he is a bearded and muscular gentleman 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.050
 with a hammer later it becomes 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.570
 the beast that you are seeing in the video 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.699
 I had said it was very difficult but 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.560
 now that I fight against him with enough 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.710
 magic and life was much more to me 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.260
 simple I do not want to stretch this anymore just 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.960
 I will say great boss excellent fight and my 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.090
 favorite of the game here the video ends 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.090
 I hope you like it I see it later
