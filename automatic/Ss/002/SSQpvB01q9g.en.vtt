hey YouTube is monisha and today I have

a video about heroines as you can tell
from<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.700> title<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.410> purchased<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.529> few<00:00:07.680> oils

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
from the title I purchased a few oils

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.780 
from the title I purchased a few oils
because<00:00:08.550> I'm<00:00:09.179> trying<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> go<00:00:09.809> natural<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.790> guess

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
because I'm trying to go natural I guess

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.370 
because I'm trying to go natural I guess
you<00:00:12.120> could<00:00:12.269> say<00:00:12.360> I've<00:00:12.509> already<00:00:12.870> been<00:00:13.049> natural

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
you could say I've already been natural

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.259 
you could say I've already been natural
because<00:00:13.500> I've<00:00:13.769> never<00:00:14.219> really<00:00:14.549> had<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.790> relaxer

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
because I've never really had a relaxer

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.300 
because I've never really had a relaxer
except<00:00:15.570> when<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> child<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:17.100> pretty

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
except when I was a child so it's pretty

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
except when I was a child so it's pretty
much<00:00:17.609> all<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.910> my<00:00:18.270> real<00:00:18.840> hair<00:00:19.020> under<00:00:19.350> here

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
much all of my real hair under here

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.040 
much all of my real hair under here
under<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.949> weave<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.970> my<00:00:21.210> answer<00:00:21.660> burnt

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
under the weave but my answer burnt

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.929 
under the weave but my answer burnt
straight<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:22.769> they<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.130> very<00:00:23.430> damaged

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
straight because they are very damaged

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.060 
straight because they are very damaged
so<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> decided<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.080> start<00:00:25.470> taking<00:00:25.800> better<00:00:25.920> care

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
so I decided to start taking better care

because I've been researching videos on

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.460 
because I've been researching videos on
what<00:00:30.060> type<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.240> oils<00:00:30.660> will<00:00:30.840> help<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.230> hair

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
growth and moisture and I've narrowed it

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.310 
growth and moisture and I've narrowed it
down<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.800> three<00:00:35.430> oils<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:36.660> that

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

I<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.239> what

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.820 

that<00:01:02.320> means<00:01:02.560> but<00:01:02.950> yeah<00:01:03.130> this<00:01:03.400> is<00:01:03.580> this<00:01:04.830> coconut

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
that means but yeah this is this coconut

that means but yeah this is this coconut
oil<00:01:06.430> is<00:01:06.700> one<00:01:06.940> of<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.150> few<00:01:07.330> oils<00:01:07.690> that<00:01:07.930> can

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
oil is one of the few oils that can

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.720 
oil is one of the few oils that can
actually<00:01:08.500> pin<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:08.920> trait<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.280> hair<00:01:09.460> shaft

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
actually pin and trait the hair shaft

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.800 
actually pin and trait the hair shaft
because<00:01:10.150> it's<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:10.690> thin<00:01:11.560> I<00:01:11.830> guess<00:01:12.160> and<00:01:12.580> um<00:01:13.420> I

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
because it's so thin I guess and um I

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.660 
because it's so thin I guess and um I
wrote<00:01:14.200> down<00:01:14.380> what<00:01:14.680> it<00:01:14.800> does<00:01:14.979> for<00:01:15.190> your<00:01:15.280> hair<00:01:15.340> so

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
wrote down what it does for your hair so

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.150 
wrote down what it does for your hair so
if<00:01:15.790> I<00:01:15.910> look<00:01:16.090> down<00:01:16.120> that's<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.630> reason<00:01:16.990> why<00:01:17.160> it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
if I look down that's the reason why it

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.130 
if I look down that's the reason why it
can<00:01:18.640> be<00:01:18.670> used<00:01:18.940> as<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.150> deep<00:01:19.420> conditioner<00:01:19.960> you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
can be used as a deep conditioner you

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.140 
can be used as a deep conditioner you
just<00:01:20.350> apply<00:01:20.619> directly<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.340> your<00:01:21.460> scalp<00:01:21.729> in<00:01:22.000> the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
liquid or solid form it prevents

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.120 
liquid or solid form it prevents
dandruff<00:01:26.350> because<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:29.440> helps<00:01:29.800> your<00:01:29.920> hair

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
dandruff because it helps your hair

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.170 
dandruff because it helps your hair
regain<00:01:30.490> moisture<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:33.400> promotes<00:01:33.910> hair<00:01:34.149> growth

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
regain moisture it promotes hair growth

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.130 
regain moisture it promotes hair growth
defuse<00:01:34.899> it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
defuse it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.219 
defuse it
um<00:01:35.320> daily<00:01:35.979> in<00:01:36.130> your<00:01:36.160> scalp<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.930> reason

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
um daily in your scalp and the reason

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.469 
um daily in your scalp and the reason
why<00:01:38.320> promotes<00:01:38.770> hair<00:01:39.460> growth<00:01:39.490> is<00:01:39.880> because<00:01:40.270> it

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
why promotes hair growth is because it

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.690 
why promotes hair growth is because it
has<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.630> lot<00:01:40.810> of<00:01:40.840> protein<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.470> day<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.830> usually

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
has a lot of protein a day and usually

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.940 
has a lot of protein a day and usually
the<00:01:42.850> reason<00:01:43.180> why<00:01:43.270> people<00:01:43.330> here<00:01:44.229> begins<00:01:44.800> to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
the reason why people here begins to

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.529 
the reason why people here begins to
break<00:01:45.070> often<00:01:45.399> because<00:01:45.729> of<00:01:46.030> its<00:01:46.210> lack<00:01:46.360> of

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
break often because of its lack of

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.719 
break often because of its lack of
protein<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.380> if<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.560> use<00:01:47.649> coconut<00:01:47.950> oil<00:01:48.310> it

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
protein so if you use coconut oil it

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.490 
protein so if you use coconut oil it
will<00:01:48.880> pretty<00:01:49.180> much<00:01:49.270> retaining<00:01:50.050> width<00:01:50.200> which

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
will pretty much retaining width which

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.499 
will pretty much retaining width which
causes<00:01:51.039> you<00:01:51.190> know<00:01:51.340> hair<00:01:51.700> growth<00:01:51.940> in<00:01:52.149> for<00:01:52.420> you

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
causes you know hair growth in for you

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.749 
causes you know hair growth in for you
to<00:01:52.630> see<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.990> actual<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.890> texture<00:01:54.399> of<00:01:54.430> the

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
to see the actual and the texture of the

to see the actual and the texture of the
coconut<00:01:54.910> oil<00:01:55.390> looks<00:01:55.780> like<00:01:56.020> this<00:01:56.380> it's<00:01:57.220> pretty

coconut oil looks like this it's pretty

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.590 
coconut oil looks like this it's pretty
much<00:01:57.910> just<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.690> white<00:01:58.990> tea<00:01:59.590> no<00:01:59.940> solids<00:02:00.940> not<00:02:01.360> much
