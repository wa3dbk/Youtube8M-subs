00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.120 

let's<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.750> multiple<00:01:56.170> possibilities<00:01:56.350> you

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
let's see the multiple possibilities you

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.540 
let's see the multiple possibilities you
can<00:01:57.250> do<00:01:57.460> with<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.700> single<00:01:57.970> object<00:01:59.430> with<00:02:00.430> the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
can do with a single object with the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:09.620 
can do with a single object with the
bottle<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:00.970> fuel<00:02:01.300> I<00:02:01.510> can<00:02:01.870> create<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.170> trail

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.940 

then<00:02:10.630> with<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:10.959> lighter<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.920> set<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.400> fire

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.970 

I<00:02:24.269> can<00:02:25.269> also<00:02:25.450> use<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.959> same<00:02:26.200> bottle<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
I can also use the same bottle with the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.680 
I can also use the same bottle with the
guns

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.010 

I<00:02:32.750> can<00:02:33.410> aim<00:02:33.680> launch<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.910> shoot<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.720> create

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
I can aim launch and shoot it to create

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.450 
I can aim launch and shoot it to create
a<00:02:36.050> bomb<00:02:41.140> let's<00:02:42.140> now<00:02:42.380> see<00:02:42.650> how<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.070> applies<00:02:43.430> to

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
a bomb let's now see how this applies to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.510 
a bomb let's now see how this applies to
situations<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.720> basic<00:02:45.140> enemies<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.800> see<00:02:46.310> how

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
situations and basic enemies and see how

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.120 
situations and basic enemies and see how
the<00:02:46.580> AI<00:02:46.820> reacts<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.690> your<00:02:47.810> actions<00:02:50.920> since<00:02:51.920> I'm

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
the AI reacts to your actions since I'm

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.920 
the AI reacts to your actions since I'm
in<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.340> dark<00:02:52.490> corridor<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:53.270> can<00:02:53.510> use<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> light

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
in a dark corridor I can use a light

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:02.170 
in a dark corridor I can use a light
stick<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.440> light<00:02:54.620> my<00:02:54.770> way<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.790> light<00:03:01.970> has

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
stick to light my way the light has

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.360 
stick to light my way the light has
attracted<00:03:02.720> some<00:03:02.900> enemies<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.980> I'll<00:03:04.070> shoot<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
attracted some enemies so I'll shoot a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.760 
attracted some enemies so I'll shoot a
dead<00:03:04.610> body<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.180> create<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.480> pool<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.780> blood<00:03:05.960> to

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
dead body to create a pool of blood to

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.830 
dead body to create a pool of blood to
divert<00:03:07.190> their<00:03:07.400> attention<00:03:07.430> from<00:03:08.180> me<00:03:10.780> if<00:03:11.780> you

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
divert their attention from me if you

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.990 
divert their attention from me if you
need<00:03:12.140> more<00:03:12.290> light<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.950> area<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.580> can<00:03:13.790> put

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
need more light in the area you can put

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.179 
need more light in the area you can put
some<00:03:14.180> sticky<00:03:14.450> tape<00:03:14.750> on<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.990> light<00:03:15.260> stick

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:27.240 

and<00:03:22.189> then<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.579> can<00:03:22.730> aim<00:03:22.939> for<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.299> ceiling

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.380 

let's<00:03:28.250> now<00:03:28.400> play<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.670> bit<00:03:28.849> with<00:03:28.969> the<00:03:29.060> enemies

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
let's now play a bit with the enemies

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.300 
let's now play a bit with the enemies
let's<00:03:29.689> say<00:03:29.900> we<00:03:30.049> take<00:03:30.260> some<00:03:30.469> sticky<00:03:30.769> tape<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:31.099> a

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
let's say we take some sticky tape and a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:41.530 
let's say we take some sticky tape and a
flare<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:31.939> aim<00:03:32.659> at<00:03:32.840> one<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.140> creatures<00:03:40.540> it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
flare and aim at one of the creatures it

will stick on its back and the enemy

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.059 
will stick on its back and the enemy
would<00:03:43.459> become<00:03:43.849> a<00:03:44.000> mobile<00:03:44.239> light<00:03:44.920> since<00:03:45.920> the

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
would become a mobile light since the

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.039
