 will fix it there with a lens with 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.460
 remembering that lens should only be 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.430
 used after you went to the doctor 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.399

 eye in orbit the person seeks to overcome 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.780
 Latvian again normal cataract too 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.229
 the crystalline lens that we have 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.689
 here behind the gold is the cornea behind 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.299
 then this is to be crystalline with the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.979
 Time with time goes by 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.079
 losing that transparency of it 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.840

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.479
 Slowly clean that cataract. 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.619
 lens and places a new lens is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.690
 an artificial lens is myopia right person 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.849

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.319
 to the doctor and pass a laser into your cornea 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.599
 and you are 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.239
 if you had a pair of glasses inside your 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.999

 light the degree of your eye 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.530
 is a super quiet anxiety about 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.569
 quiet so if you are comparing with 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.959
 the others, but the complex and 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.370
 still with vision with super organ 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.549
 important is a superimportant sense 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.260
 our body maybe more important it 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.209
 also handles a lot with 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.200
 aesthetics also people have those 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.969

 also does not is I knew it is that I 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.870
 I am suspected of speaking that the opposition 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.139
 It took shopkeeper to find this specialty. 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.760
 fantastic in college we played 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.099
 With the hospital, it's good, we just leave. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.989
 ophthalmologic emergency red gold 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.359
 But anxiety is much more than 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.980
 This even I'll show you a 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:15.659
 The author's study book is a do 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.299
 cancer that is one of the best 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.239
 mythology that has a book that I

 I bought rafael all the continents and 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.329
 There is a book from the corner. 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.400
 absolutely not who has a cancer that 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.199
 is that he values by what easily if he 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.319
 wants to be an ornithologist right now 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.970
 already start option is a lot of people think 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.009
 wrong is in the area you have to be alone. 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.870
 general clinic after it was total 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.579
 It's kind of complicated nowadays. 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.549
 I have been specializing since now 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.139
 so I bought it so happens 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.280
 factory a lot of people will ask if the 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:52.739
 which cost 600 reais in five times there 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.209
 600 reais but not only does it 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.989
 time I do not buy a book with 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.870
 price and now otorhinolaryngology 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:05.819
 by the subject that studies the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.379
 nose up to the throat is the ear otorrino 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.650
 ears right 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.150
 the hearing is then the otorhinolaryn and takes care of 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.699
 all this is not a problem you have in 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.199
 heard in this person who has for example 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.570
 20 ti 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.310
 the person who has an infection hearing 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.479
 person who has an infection in the area and 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.639
 septum 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.210
 the person who is still very big right? 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.490
 all this from there who moves the other 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.389
 Rio is a fantastic specialty 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.280
 otolaryngology 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.590
 it's such a super ultra specialty 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.370
 mega vip is who does the river generally 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.400
 so are living like VIPs of the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.009
 two medical specialties and is 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.919
 fantastic wins superbem otorrino well 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.960
 very well, it 's official, too. 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.789
 Well, do not you? 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.970
 Incidentally, who does hospital surgery 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.160
 I won a lot of money, so it's two 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.479
 medical tops personalities with the 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.310
 otorrino hospital 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.410
 only that they are two personalities who 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.539
 Who is in love with medicine? 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.910
 example there I love to get a stethoscope 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.490
 see the patient catch trauma pick up people 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.020
 finally bruised under the 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.180
 Milton hospital linen so that such 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.030
 are quieter societies 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.070
 In that time, you always wonder if you do not 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.500
 stay inside badim people hospital 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.690
 patient is no longer quiet so these 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.479
 different diseases 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:30.860
 in my class has 100 students in two 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:32.599
 This camp was me and my colleague so 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.449
 generally few people want the 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:38.300
 tom and is one of the most difficult to pass 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.830
 my tower that are much disputed to 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.289
 Geezer studies a lot that wants to do 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.870
 because it is relatively a specialty 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:50.240
 calm and win well everyone wants 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:53.599
