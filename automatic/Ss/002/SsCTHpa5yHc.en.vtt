00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:11.879
 this project is the work as such he write in it at 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.519
 the scenario of this of what were the unusual Wednesdays 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 make a project and where he participated there 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.580
 and now that it was very emotional 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 I looked for a way to earn all that writing and that's when I gave 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.800
 realize that he is writing a play 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.700
 I think it's very good from Pablo 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.080
 everything about the last feeling 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.920
 I see it 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.950
 more than everything as 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 a tribute referred that already I 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.350
 i 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.790
 also as for 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.819
 will close the cycle of 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.819
 the comment of can not be seen even in painting 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.469
 efe that the least groups have 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.460
 in 2010 similar and and he 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.960
 the kind thing that happens many times still knows as much as connected not 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.510
 Alberto of the first one that we left on television was 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.610
 in 1985 p in Venezuelan television program called Scraps 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.460
 throat 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.830
 and they added 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 first they will 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.899
 there in that in this interview that we play songs 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.370
 Live 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.710
 in a jet prison 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.420
 ed albertucho the story of the group and that gral tale I assume as the most 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.100
 genuine that as a tenacity the band and that and that people will be able to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.470
 enjoy 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.720
 and the plan was to make a video 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.150
 edit live where those who could not come pity but at least can see it 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.050
 through the dni 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.300
 Pablo 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.910
 the labor parma to the frame 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.500
 a band that will come fifth 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 the feeling repertoire how long it took 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.409
 the room since we had to not change anything 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.309
 and it is difficult to try 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.379
 to touch with another person 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.449
 and those below respect to go 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.449
 and because that is the idea not among others to remember the coast 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.419
 i 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.590
 good for the Romans a repertoire 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.159
 we started to study 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.369
 cardenas your house 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:28.649
 then we would meet to try to put them together 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.550
 they bought clothes head the ball and went over there goes the text this one 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.739
 to polish details 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.269
 We will be able to present the work in the evening and open a cycle of concerts 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.840
 that have been in most of them of spontaneous generation not 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.159
 because for example the first cake cake that the disk that 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.639
 since he's in Esperanto stores 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.639
 the last feeling I fulfill 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.149
 that concert came out by chance 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:58.109
 to be able to bring the work of the feli terms to the idea was that 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.020
 a person is appointed a director for every thing 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.529
 tito the director of the residents the manager of the music module 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.459
 age or alfredo caldera 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.700
 can the person 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.579
 ent forgiveness for late night was david i will go 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.269
 this extreme theater 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.219
 was the person in charge of the theater module and the video module faced with 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.939
 record company segovia 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.399
 what is it that made everything 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.790
 all the old part 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.930
 prepare for us is a great opportunity to be 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.420
 all together we have many, many years 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.229
 porter the last time we played was I think that 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:36.119
 a week to see dead that beyond what we put together lives of five years and 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.479
 if before that we preferred 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.949
 much more than five years that no other human being touches 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.519
 they are not a unique opportunity for the public but for us too 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.559
 efe the last feeling as a work 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.479
 posed on it 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.259
 ends this Saturday 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:55.889
 I do not fear obviously this can be who he brings many things but no longer 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.009
 will be the last feeling and do something else we do not know what 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.959
 it creates that we are already arriving at the end of the press conference the most 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.209
 significant of all this is 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.639
 devised as a result of the departure that there has been some way we have 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.659
 matured a lot and consider many things 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.309
 otherwise life can be on the one hand 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.959
 and of the ephemeral and foolish that can be certain things 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.109
 i decided to everything from behind 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.889
 and new vilanova and look at them so that museum has always been 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.520
 how to throw him pigeon and we are going to play together with federico morals for that reason I think 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.789
 What an unforgettable experience 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.809
 and hence they do not manufacture 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.300
 a lot of light 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.960
 to everything 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.590
 and we especially wanted to go 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.430
