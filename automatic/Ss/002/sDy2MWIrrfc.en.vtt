you know only one teams get end up on

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.600 
you know only one teams get end up on
top<00:01:57.119> only<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.509> quarterbacks<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> be

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
bowl so you know I think there's been a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.920 
bowl so you know I think there's been a
lot<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.920> good<00:02:05.040> quarterbacks<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
lot of really good quarterbacks that

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
lot of really good quarterbacks that
early<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> career<00:02:07.409> they<00:02:07.619> didn't<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.179> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
early in the career they didn't have the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.729 
early in the career they didn't have the
same<00:02:09.390> success<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.899> they're<00:02:10.050> having<00:02:10.170> now<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
same success that they're having now and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.860 
same success that they're having now and
so

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
so

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.440 
so
you<00:02:12.830> know<00:02:12.920> my<00:02:13.159> goal<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.670> get<00:02:13.819> into<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
you know my goal is to get into the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.559 
you know my goal is to get into the
playoffs<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:15.430> not<00:02:16.430> just<00:02:16.640> when<00:02:16.849> one<00:02:17.060> game<00:02:17.330> but

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
really make a run at I think until I

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.100 
really make a run at I think until I
want<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> play<00:02:20.150> off<00:02:20.269> game<00:02:20.480> people<00:02:20.690> can<00:02:20.900> always

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
games and so we have high expectations

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.140 
games and so we have high expectations
for<00:04:12.079> ourselves<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.739> we<00:04:13.069> expect<00:04:13.579> to<00:04:13.760> come<00:04:13.910> in

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
for ourselves and we expect to come in

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.539 
for ourselves and we expect to come in
our<00:04:14.870> goals<00:04:15.109> win<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.440> division<00:04:15.650> go<00:04:16.280> undefeated

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
our goals win a division go undefeated

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.689 
our goals win a division go undefeated
at<00:04:16.849> home<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.419> then<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:19.070> know<00:04:19.190> really<00:04:19.430> make<00:04:19.669> a

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
at home and then you know really make a

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.490 
at home and then you know really make a
run<00:04:19.940> at<00:04:19.969> once<00:04:20.299> we<00:04:20.419> get<00:04:20.539> into<00:04:20.719> the<00:04:20.870> playoffs<00:04:20.989> and

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
run at once we get into the playoffs and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.250 
run at once we get into the playoffs and
so<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:22.700> goals<00:04:22.909> are<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.270> same<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.870> think<00:04:24.169> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
so the goals are so same I think the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.629 
so the goals are so same I think the
mentality<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:24.890> different<00:04:25.190> because<00:04:25.310> the

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
mentality is different because the

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.779 
mentality is different because the
ended<00:04:26.330> last<00:04:26.509> year<00:04:26.749> you<00:04:27.189> know<00:04:28.189> having<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.610> home

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.279 
ended last year you know having a home
game<00:04:28.969> in<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.180> playoffs<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:29.930> cut<00:04:30.110> and

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
game in the playoffs and it cut and

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.520 
game in the playoffs and it cut and
fallen<00:04:30.590> short<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.129> so<00:04:32.020> now<00:04:33.020> we've<00:04:33.169> got<00:04:33.349> the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
fallen short and so now we've got the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.529 
fallen short and so now we've got the
we've<00:04:33.949> got<00:04:34.129> it<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.460> lot<00:04:34.789> of<00:04:34.909> guys<00:04:35.029> back<00:04:35.330> from
