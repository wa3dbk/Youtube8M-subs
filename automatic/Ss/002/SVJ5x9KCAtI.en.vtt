and<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.030> direct<00:00:42.899> replacement<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
and so on it's a direct replacement of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.220 
and so on it's a direct replacement of
the<00:00:43.530> SD<00:00:43.800> 350<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.359> originally<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.140> were

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the SD 350 and originally all we were

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.590 
the SD 350 and originally all we were
going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.949> move<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> connectors<00:00:48.420> from

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
going to do was move the connectors from

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.450 
going to do was move the connectors from
the<00:00:48.690> back<00:00:49.019> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> panel<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.070> side<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the back of the panel to the side of the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.220 
the back of the panel to the side of the
panel<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.300> put<00:00:51.480> into<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.780> bag<00:00:52.019> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
panel so when you put into your bag it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
panel so when you put into your bag it
doesn't<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> rest<00:00:52.859> on<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> connectors

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
doesn't have to rest on the connectors

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
doesn't have to rest on the connectors
here<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.929> at<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> same<00:00:55.320> time<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:55.769> simplified

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
here we at the same time also simplified

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.939 
here we at the same time also simplified
the<00:00:56.670> connectors<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.210> more<00:00:57.390> standard

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
the connectors to more standard

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.799 
the connectors to more standard
specimens<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.219> find<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.699> your<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.690> know

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
specimens you can find in your you know

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.690 
specimens you can find in your you know
your<00:01:01.019> local<00:01:01.230> mapping<00:01:01.559> store<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.219> something

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.610 

but<00:01:05.700> once<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.720> started<00:01:07.080> doing<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.440> and

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
but once we started doing that and

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.430 
but once we started doing that and
repackaging<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.970> thought<00:01:09.480> oh<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.200> power

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
repackaging it I thought oh this power

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.380 
repackaging it I thought oh this power
supply<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.100> nice<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.700> maybe<00:01:11.910> could<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
supply it's nice but maybe could be a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
supply it's nice but maybe could be a
little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.690> nicer<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.890> completely

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
little bit nicer so we completely

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.100 
little bit nicer so we completely
redesign<00:01:14.909> into<00:01:15.270> internal<00:01:15.659> power<00:01:15.869> supply

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
redesign into internal power supply

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.219 
redesign into internal power supply
right<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.490> by<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.270> point<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.810> spent<00:01:19.079> so

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
right and by this point as we spent so

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.510 
right and by this point as we spent so
much<00:01:19.350> time<00:01:19.409> doing<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.070> thought<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.400> might

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
much time doing it we thought we might

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.660 
much time doing it we thought we might
as<00:01:20.670> well<00:01:20.700> redesign<00:01:21.329> all<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> rest<00:01:22.460> core<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
as well redesign all the rest core to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.819 
as well redesign all the rest core to
soundfield<00:01:24.000> technologies<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.560> call<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
soundfield technologies what we call the

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.740 
soundfield technologies what we call the
a<00:01:25.860> format<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.579> format<00:01:27.060> conversion<00:01:27.600> which

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
a format to be format conversion which

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.960 
a format to be format conversion which
is<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:28.439> four<00:01:28.680> capsules<00:01:29.189> from<00:01:29.579> within<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
is the four capsules from within the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
is the four capsules from within the
microphone<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:30.990> format<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.100> new

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
microphone to be format which is for new

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.090 
microphone to be format which is for new
audio<00:01:32.549> signals<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.810> basically<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.890> hasn't

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
audio signals and basically that hasn't

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.190 
audio signals and basically that hasn't
really<00:01:35.250> been<00:01:35.579> redeveloped<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.780> very<00:01:36.960> very

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
really been redeveloped in a very very

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.679 
really been redeveloped in a very very
long<00:01:37.380> time<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.280> kind<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.579> redid<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> from

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
long time so we kind of redid it from

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.499 
long time so we kind of redid it from
the<00:01:39.810> ground<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:40.680> which<00:01:41.310> very<00:01:42.060> very<00:01:42.299> nice

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the ground up right which very very nice

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.109 
the ground up right which very very nice
result<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.469> although<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.610> direct

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
result so we have although a direct

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.319 
result so we have although a direct
evolution<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.020> 350<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.799> lower<00:01:47.040> noise

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
evolution at 350 we have lower noise

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.420 
evolution at 350 we have lower noise
nicer<00:01:48.329> imaging<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.170> very<00:01:49.710> detailed<00:01:50.009> sound

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
nicer imaging a very detailed sound

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.010 
nicer imaging a very detailed sound
especially<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> mid<00:01:51.240> high<00:01:51.450> mids<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
especially in the mid high mids in the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.319 
especially in the mid high mids in the
high<00:01:52.140> frequencies<00:01:52.740> yes<00:01:53.039> so<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.520> yeah<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
high frequencies yes so it's yeah it's a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.569 
high frequencies yes so it's yeah it's a
very<00:01:54.509> very<00:01:54.719> nice<00:01:54.899> system<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.460> know

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
very very nice system for you know

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.090 
very very nice system for you know
location<00:01:57.060> recording<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.689> maybe<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.799> bit

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
location recording but maybe it's a bit

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.380 
location recording but maybe it's a bit
too<00:01:59.130> good<00:01:59.490> now<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.969> also<00:02:00.090> use<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> for

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
too good now you can also use it for

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.990 
too good now you can also use it for
music<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.460> what<00:02:02.460> about<00:02:02.549> availability

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
music you know what about availability
