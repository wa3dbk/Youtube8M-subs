 journalist with the consolidated career 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.250
 face wrote for several publications 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.250
 including the biggest of our luck 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.720
 he had more relevance was the sound that is 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.399
 a short one in a magazine that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 respect of artists and especially of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.500
 music and over the years he 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.899
 interviewed several thousand 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.750
 artists according to book he did not 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.030
 there how many artists and they will get the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.070
 write a book based on a patio of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.989
 more quantitative interviews of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.090
 really show who is one of those 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.719
 artists from small parts 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.989
 that have never been is edited silver 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.149
 revise your are unpublished passages and do not 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.100
 only any artists are great 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 big names in the same industry 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.890
 total of people with a former owner 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.299
 law because spears klinsmann and mailson 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.710
 cross and so only eilers and the Czech that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.350
 book is that he really wanted to get 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
 those ducks in which according to him 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.680
 said you can define a person 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.689
 in a minute since you choose one 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.070
 minute right then he got some 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.740
 parts that really are a little bit 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.659
 more revealing but I'm not saying to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.299
 revelations of things to my god that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.100
 shock as the dissatisfactions did this and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.600
 Yes, the questions of trying to show a little 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.790
 more of who was that artist of the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.530
 his personality and not simply the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.360
 mask that he usually uses when 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.130
 talk to the public and I can 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.189
 imagine that there will be a lot of fan paraÃ­ba 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.170
 sat are quoted this book with a snippet 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.729
 interview that will see only his name 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.619
 on the cover he will know that he is 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.659
 in the book and will want to run and buy 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.409
 because I have news for the merit 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.509
 his 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.950
 so ours is exclusively for this 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.680
 you can come to stay a little 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.170
 disappointed because the marriage he will not 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.810
 lose so much time with the only artist 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.369
 he's going through a lot 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.009
 in the mind of each one of the 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.349
 interview he selected and is not 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.060
 telling a thing totally 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.610
 chronologically he takes part of the 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.590
 interviews and goes cutting and putting 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.410
 others and back to try to create a 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.269
 sense of narrative I say sense because 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.690
 It is not always clear why 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.930
 chose to do that way they are if he 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.360
 picked up and put this book into great deeds 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.489
 and in which the sole advisor some 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.920
 interviews and places on the big block and 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.650
 this block in general has a theme 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.480
 specific but always makes a lot of sense 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.360
 the way he is doing this 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.980
 clipping understood then if you happen to be by chance 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.840
 understandable because his artist 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.190
 preferred to speak and was disappointed 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.340
 When you talked yesterday, for example, you 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.440
 read the entire book because from the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.900
 sociological view is super 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.980
 interesting you know how it is 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.269
 works a little of the psyche of these 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.180
 celebrities I 'm not saying that you 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.830
 will fully understand this reality 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.680
 precisely with the little cigars that 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.510
 he puts it in this book but it gives 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.170
 to give a greater dimension of who they 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.870
 are not saying ah now I am knowledgeable 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.209
 them but excuses are people 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.130
 with people and perhaps demystify a 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.959
 little of this culture of freedom that 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.880
 we already have today because 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.980
 celebrities are not cell gods 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.620
 are not people above all are 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.420
 people with walnuts are street books giving 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.019
 a little more of this picture to 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.079
 people 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.139
 The book has 523 pages of a good book. 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.840
 thick the pages are super thin and the 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.900
 lowercase letter but there is a very 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.239
 I read it in two days because I did not 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.940
 I could stop was a page behind the 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.380
 another because I do or do not know how to do 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.900
 also part of this culture thing 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.310
 the city I want to be their choice 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.620
 so whenever there was a bigger name 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.569
 I used to stay in my god, I need to read it because 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.130
 I told you the book is doing these things. 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.780
 records then I want to pass 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.760
 passing by and going 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.240
 discovering great names that do not even 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.640
 wants to know 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.440
 Gabriel was full because 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.110
 they are important people but I 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.610
 I just know and I was happy. 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.140
 the only thing I felt a little 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.260
 of lack 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.310
 in this book in the edition and I 'm not 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.739
 saying that it is the fault of the galera record 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.470
 should're so in the original book is 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.140
 know when exactly the interviews 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.660
 were made because it puts the name of the 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.310
 of the person for example here two clubs 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.830
 but he's a man who speaks exactly 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.710
 What year was it supposed to be surprising? 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.780
 without knowing in which part of the 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.820
 actor who was being the singer 's 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.320
 actress to Brazil and what was being done 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.940
 this interview is clear that 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.060
 depending on what he is saying in the 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.160
 interview you can associate which 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.630
 that time but not always it happens and 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.550
 Rick and said that and it was accessed and it was 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.260
 necessary on my part as well as the 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.060
 Do your research and bring knowledge to 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.310
 this chronologically in my 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.560
 But the only thing I missed 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.710
 because he says this is a whore of a 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.170
 cool and fun book of him and me super 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.360
 I recommend and do not have a narrative. 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.250
 character does not have plot so i do not know 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.740
 if it is right for me to want 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.470
 criticize him put him at the level of 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.960
 Lampa Dinho's can not there are two three 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.130
 four five little lamps because I think 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.260
 each had a go in this one 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.580
 totally different experience and I 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.560
 I can not simply tell the 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.040
 characters are bad others are cool 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.600
 because the characters are actors but the 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.940
 that I can say that the author is 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.940
 fantastic new knew how to make the records 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.160
 It was not very fun and funny 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.440
 that the high of some parts when this 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.870
 here mainly I do not know if these 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.790
 people follow me on twitter or even 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.930

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.600

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.290
 beyond her mind and she believes ethical
