that and it's water-resistant and you
know<00:03:56.090> that's<00:03:56.360> pretty<00:03:56.600> much<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.079> on<00:03:57.170> the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
know that's pretty much in on the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.289 
know that's pretty much in on the
features<00:03:57.470> it's<00:03:58.010> very<00:03:58.280> cool<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.150> one

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
features it's very cool the the one

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.330 
features it's very cool the the one
thing<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.570> will<00:03:59.630> say<00:03:59.780> it<00:04:00.489> has<00:04:01.930> 24<00:04:02.930> lumens<00:04:03.530> based

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
thing I will say it has 24 lumens based

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.000 
thing I will say it has 24 lumens based
on<00:04:04.579> five<00:04:04.940> hours<00:04:05.329> of<00:04:05.360> charging

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
on five hours of charging

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.789 
on five hours of charging
the<00:04:06.069> Sun<00:04:06.280> 24<00:04:07.150> lumens<00:04:07.629> ain't<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.349> brightest

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
the Sun 24 lumens ain't the brightest

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.830 
the Sun 24 lumens ain't the brightest
thing<00:04:09.010> in<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.280> ship<00:04:09.519> all<00:04:09.819> right<00:04:10.120> it's<00:04:10.629> not

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
thing in the ship all right it's not

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.780 
thing in the ship all right it's not
putting<00:04:11.230> out<00:04:11.319> a<00:04:11.560> ton<00:04:11.799> of<00:04:11.860> light<00:04:12.099> so<00:04:12.760> that

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
putting out a ton of light so that

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.940 
putting out a ton of light so that
that's<00:04:13.299> kind<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.720> trade-off<00:04:14.140> here<00:04:14.170> right

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
that's kind of the trade-off here right

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.099 
that's kind of the trade-off here right
but<00:04:15.159> with<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:16.030> battery<00:04:16.419> system<00:04:16.959> that

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
but with the the battery system that

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.710 
but with the the battery system that
it's<00:04:17.260> got<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:18.459> way<00:04:18.579> it<00:04:18.729> charges<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.359> stores

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
it's got the way it charges in stores

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.830 
it's got the way it charges in stores
energy<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.769> lumens<00:04:21.360> not<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.479> brightest

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
energy the lumens not the brightest

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.770 
energy the lumens not the brightest
around<00:04:23.139> but<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:24.130> bit<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.490> trade-off<00:04:24.760> for<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
around but a bit of a trade-off for the

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.800 
around but a bit of a trade-off for the
extremely<00:04:26.380> lightweight<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.600> just<00:04:28.600> kind<00:04:28.780> of

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
extremely lightweight and just kind of

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.870 
extremely lightweight and just kind of
