00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.530 
a call on and then 1 because 1 equals
true<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:44.159> 0<00:01:44.610> equals<00:01:45.119> false

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
true or at 0 equals false

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.679 
true or at 0 equals false
so<00:01:45.810> powered<00:01:46.229> equals<00:01:46.979> 1<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so powered equals 1 and then all you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
so powered equals 1 and then all you
need<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.700> press<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> button<00:01:51.119> and
