00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.030

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.519

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.670
 conducted our social studies lessons 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.140
 completely different from the others here in them 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.879
 we are really the most active debate 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:50.550
 we look for our point of view looking for positions and 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:52.199
 I hope we find the truth that the story 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.020
 these are not only dates of chronology of events 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.899
 it is also life experiencing the fate of people 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.399
 X shook learn just not 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.760
 many believe that this table is full 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.670
 chaos 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.799
 no it's a creative mess exactly 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.020
 creative and customary cadets 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.049
 here you can know such notebooks and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.409
 abstract photographs and drawings and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.909
 scripts all sorts of things for inside these 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.380
 people and most importantly he turns 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.270
 for several years now our school 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.180
 Works Museum of Military Glory 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.480
 under the leadership of Alexander 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.660
 why are we talking about war meet 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.900
 with veterans and heroes of labor feats 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.360
 I think you will agree that this is correct 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.970
 when our team honors our memory 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.130
 people in this holy war we have 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.900

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.990

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.190
 steampunk 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.880
 then recently it was like a delivery 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.700
 from the monitor 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.700

 school is an essay home control 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.429
 tasks and for us it is much more 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.290
 it is first of all life on stage 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.140
 performances and concerts and contests and 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:24.760
 Of course, difficult but very interesting 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:24.760

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:37.640

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.760

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.370
 its 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.980
 I hope these 3 are enough for us 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.260

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.049
