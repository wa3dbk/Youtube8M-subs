00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
right now and it will rapidly move on to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.719 
right now and it will rapidly move on to
printing<00:01:22.049> products<00:01:22.500> which<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.549> can

printing products which you actually can

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.350 
printing products which you actually can
use<00:01:23.909> which<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:25.259> materials<00:01:25.890> more

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
use which is more materials more

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.789 
use which is more materials more
functionality<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> really

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
functionality and that is what is really

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.370 
functionality and that is what is really
going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> happen<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> next<00:01:29.610> 12<00:01:30.420> years<00:01:30.450> our
