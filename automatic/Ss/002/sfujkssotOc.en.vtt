00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 supposes 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.510
 Friendly greetings work here and in the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.080
 Today's personal video I come to teach 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.260
 you as a drop in the Pokémon 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 pokémon word more accurately yes no 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.600
 case 100% accuracy knows that forest 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.470
 Are you trying on the father not to drop or even 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.170
 the stick 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.890
 So this time I'm going to teach you the father. 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.279
 it without you needing to redo it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.600
 redo and redo and redo 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.340
 next staff first of all 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.030
 I want to explain why I do not do this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.250
 method in my gameplay is in my series 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 my case the first one that the pokémon word 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.149
 it was not meant to be a series 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.360
 here on the canal but it was a great tapa 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.700
 holes and this I can not deny was 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.739
 even legal to do up to a certain point but 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.079
 Then it got tiresome even for me. 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.570
 to do because I no longer had so much 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.210
 time to play and many 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.180
 things started to come the news channel 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.549
 the tournament came a lot and the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.280
 pokémon word was getting behind 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.710
 until there came a moment that is the game 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.960
 has been released for months and I'm still 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.030
 doing the gameplay 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.049
 anyway i do not do this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.240
 method because it is a bit difficult and 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.470
 because it is a little time-consuming 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.479
 depending on the case so it can be a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.900
 boring to do during the game 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 play there and consume even more time 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.320
 making my adventure adventure for 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.810
 It's a lot more tiring and I do not 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.140
 I have a lot of time but it would be a failure 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.000
 very big I did not put this 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 tutorial here on the channel 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.860
 already to and ending the series already then 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.439
 a chameleon like I do I 'm there 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.659
 against a pokémon i want europe only 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.869
 I 'm already tired of him. 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.890
 never troop chameleon help me next 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.119
 the people you will need to do with 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.520
 that the pokémon drop 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.190
 I advise the first thing you have 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.959
 what to do is buy there that is called more 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.910
 or less stole from something like that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.660
 because that's what he does 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.330
 help a pokémon get dizzy know 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.670
 wobbling there no fools exactly 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.630
 it helps to get this Pokémon 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.900
 state and we need exactly it 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.340
 stay in this state of being dizzy for 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.360
 Because when we stay in this 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.150
 state 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.070
 ah ah ah just defeat him while he 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.310
 you're all over and you can 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.530
 group it 100% accuracy 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.320
 It's just that what else can we do? 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.210
 to help and if anyone gets dizzy 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.850
 a great tip is you get a pokémon 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.070
 Gum if yes, I'll say it's a 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.080
 ability is so it becomes easier to 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.510
 do you understand some Pokémon when 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.060
 exchange they come with a skill and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.850
 is above their name and in the case of 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.190
 axel it is with big and is exactly 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.760
 this skill we need 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.670
 because it increases the chance of 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.040
 Pokemon getting dizzy is that 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.940
 so if you have a Pokemon with 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.709
 this ability and use some movement 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.810
 year opponent pokémon the chance of him 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.120
 getting dizzy is even bigger 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.320
 but there is still more a trick to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.450
 you with ba 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.060
 Ok I advise you to already have 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.750
 available by a mall to change 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.550
 in the victor case is and use the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.850
 pokémon that you have a great chance of 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.380
 put the movement into debt in him 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.280
 because the movement soon it does 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:47.140
 exactly what makes normal games're 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:50.050
 but he is also giving a hit only one 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.140
 of damage and only give where damage then 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.570
 this helps a lot the pokémon stays there all 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.280
 tomtom of course also take one 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.020
 movement that gives enough damage 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.160
 here I have axel as you can 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:06.070
 see and in this case is and is with a 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.320
 cutting and with skill gante and also 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.970
 against blow and then I go in any 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.180
 balloon just to show you not 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.600
 Any boss and then we'll go there. 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.799
 show what you should do 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.380
 Arriving there staff picks up any 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.600
 any monforte preferably if you 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.900
 It's only there to get or the boss 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.550
 Dude, it's over there a month 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.650
 the moments you have some pokémon gives 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.949
 to bill if you do not have pass 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.810
 beaten smoothly and that's how it is 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.090
 if you arrive in the woods, you'll do 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.430
 first you will clean all those 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.889
 pokémons that appear there in 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.289
 try to decrease the amount because 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.970
 they mess up a bit, then you have 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.400
 to clean as much as possible 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.130
 so you clean the most and it goes 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.199
 Do you change the Pokémon that is 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.780
 with large and debonair and some 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.120
 movement there that I had enough damage did 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.850
 I did it now you have to wait. 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.070
 the pokémon get tired the status of 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.639
 tired as it gets with a smoke 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.190
 white on top of him and he is exhaling 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.710
 this smoke is like it's been pounding 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.810
 It's there and he's missing those 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.600
 smoke just like you are seeing there and 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.750
 You get to wear on beverly thats it. 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.539
 very useful because it is comfortable using 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.699
 should and will give a hit only until he gets 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.949
 dizzy when he starts to get dizzy 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.259
 You start using the strongest attack. 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.610
 that if you have not do not switch 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.820
 that I have spoken to you bring a 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.550
 pokémon with gum if it is strong and 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.270
 at the same time have a strong movement 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.570
 there to give a good pokemon damage ok 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.150
 done that you get there it gives a winter 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.770
 Pokemon there sometimes will fail sometimes 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.870
 he will not go dizzy but as soon as 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.729
 he gets dizzy starts to attack him 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.740
 exactly I'm still doing the 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.349
 video and then an hour that will go dizzy 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.699
 and then just down the wood in this pokémon and 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:04.030
 he will worry about 100% accuracy 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.669
 ok and this works on any one because 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.330
 mon is very good at catching pokémons 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:13.510
 legendary is another way of 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.570
 to capture pokémon with 100% accuracy is 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.669
 When it's shining sometimes 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.470
 When you start the battle, it begins. 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.030
 with a glow around him if he 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.990
 start this way you see it 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.120
 on the screen 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.300
 You do not have to worry, it 's just you. 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.580
 go down there for the firewood and he'll change 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.580
 100 percent're also 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.349
 otherwise it will change the 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.849
 randomly as I do 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.440
 I also drove several pokémons 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.110
 legendary 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.200
 randomly in the case of my gameplay 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.120
 I say it again, I did not do it. 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.780
 precisely because it takes a little 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.600
 time 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.730
 in this tutorial I greatly decrease the 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.940
 video I made several cuts only for 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:57.030
 demonstrate to you but year in this case 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:00.210
 What you saw took more or less only 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:03.800
 in the boss about eight minutes 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.840
 So it's a little bit big already 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.880
 for my gameplay that tries to show the 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.300
 most balloons and repeated others 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.140
 balloons and other scenarios of 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.270
 balloons 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.090
 finally eight minutes in a forest 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.400
 It can be a long time then 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.380
 that's why I did not do this I always read 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.960
 the comments always people always 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.690
 They taught me that, and I was doing it. 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.910
 This was off but I did not want to 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.970
 gameplay because it 's my purpose was 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:36.060
 simply show what the balloons were like 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.340
 Okay then it would be my fault not 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.860
 show how to capture with 100% of 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.650
 accuracy before ending means law 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.510
 she's okay to finish then I will show 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.300
 for you maybe next time I 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.550
 I can not do this, I can not 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.340
 I assure you because, as I said, time is 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.530
 so the biggest enemy here on my channel 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:59.030
 and I have a lot to do at 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:01.950
 Sometimes a news comes from nowhere. 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.840
 so that's what I wanted to say to you ok 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.610
 so this is it, the marina is going 

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.020
 staying here a hug friends 

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.020
 See you next time
