imagine<00:00:00.599> that<00:00:00.780> one<00:00:00.989> morning<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.920> day<00:00:02.129> started

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
imagine that one morning the day started

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.610 
imagine that one morning the day started
like<00:00:02.700> any<00:00:03.030> other<00:00:03.330> but<00:00:04.230> with<00:00:04.410> one<00:00:04.589> big

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
like any other but with one big

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.530 
like any other but with one big
difference<00:00:05.569> all<00:00:06.569> humans<00:00:07.170> had<00:00:07.710> vanished<00:00:08.540> what

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
difference all humans had vanished what

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.600 
difference all humans had vanished what
would<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.809> earth<00:00:09.840> be<00:00:10.050> like<00:00:10.530> without<00:00:11.040> people

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
would the earth be like without people

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.499 
would the earth be like without people
obviously<00:00:12.440> much<00:00:13.440> quieter<00:00:14.210> but<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.360> would

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
obviously much quieter but what would

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.990 
obviously much quieter but what would
actually<00:00:15.660> happen<00:00:16.190> could<00:00:17.190> nature<00:00:17.550> wipe<00:00:17.789> out

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
actually happen could nature wipe out

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.380 
actually happen could nature wipe out
all<00:00:18.330> traces<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:19.020> our<00:00:19.439> existence<00:00:20.090> some<00:00:21.090> things

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
all traces of our existence some things

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.610 
all traces of our existence some things
would<00:00:21.720> change<00:00:21.960> very<00:00:22.260> quickly

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.620 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.920 

first<00:00:26.620> the<00:00:27.040> power<00:00:27.280> utilities<00:00:27.940> would<00:00:28.480> start<00:00:28.780> to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
first the power utilities would start to

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.130 
first the power utilities would start to
shut<00:00:29.140> down<00:00:29.170> in<00:00:29.800> a<00:00:30.460> city<00:00:30.700> like<00:00:30.940> New<00:00:31.150> York<00:00:31.480> the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
shut down in a city like New York the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.930 
shut down in a city like New York the
pumps<00:00:32.470> in<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.680> subways<00:00:33.130> would<00:00:33.460> switch<00:00:33.700> off

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
pumps in the subways would switch off

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.870 
pumps in the subways would switch off
and<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.660> water<00:00:34.840> would<00:00:35.080> pour<00:00:35.350> in

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.630 

the<00:00:39.690> streets<00:00:39.990> above<00:00:40.140> Wood<00:00:40.860> Road<00:00:41.130> quickly

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the streets above Wood Road quickly

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.290 
the streets above Wood Road quickly
collapse<00:00:42.650> within<00:00:43.650> days<00:00:44.010> nature<00:00:44.820> would<00:00:44.940> begin

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
collapse within days nature would begin

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.200 
collapse within days nature would begin
its<00:00:45.570> reclamation

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
its reclamation

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
its reclamation
without<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> constant<00:00:49.379> attention<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.250> humans

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
without the constant attention of humans

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.240 
without the constant attention of humans
the<00:00:51.390> exteriors<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.079> buildings<00:00:52.680> would<00:00:52.890> become

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the exteriors of buildings would become

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.090 
the exteriors of buildings would become
filthy<00:00:53.579> crack<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> vegetation<00:00:55.440> would<00:00:55.800> start

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
filthy crack and vegetation would start

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.889 
filthy crack and vegetation would start
to<00:00:56.250> take<00:00:56.460> root<00:00:58.100> step<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.280> step<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.879> strange<00:01:00.540> new

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
to take root step by step a strange new

to take root step by step a strange new
urban<00:01:01.440> ecosystem<00:01:02.219> would<00:01:02.670> begin<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> develop

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
urban ecosystem would begin to develop

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
urban ecosystem would begin to develop
and<00:01:03.750> quickly<00:01:06.200> ten<00:01:07.200> years<00:01:07.229> along<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:08.070> Central

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and quickly ten years along and Central

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
and quickly ten years along and Central
Park<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.090> becoming<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.690> swampy<00:01:10.080> wilderness

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
probably be very different but then who

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.050 
probably be very different but then who
