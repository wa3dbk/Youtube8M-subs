00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.859
 and 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.200
 very good friends of crumbs of the dreamed 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.500
 Berlin and this time I bring you the 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.500
 of life 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.539
 so let's go 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.570
 william friends how can you see this 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.960
 new mode it's about teleportation 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.059
 gives us a new item which is going to be a 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.820
 new brings transportation is going to be very 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:34.159
 economic very simple and very useful as well 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.290
 that we go with the recipe the recipe for 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.870
 This mode is very simple and comes 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.940
 being very very father which comes 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.149
 being we need with advocate that in 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.149
 create table or three and feet of glass in 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.670
 this way we avoid four the rest one 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.399
 interpella in the center a block of 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.140
 iron iron and on the bottom and 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.170
 that's going to give us two fabrics 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.520
 let's sing so that effectively 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.520
 will give us 2 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.190
 is going to give us that this record is what 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.020
 which holder 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.540
 is what is going to store this piece of paper 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.240
 what it serves us for is basically going to 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.190
 contain the information of those of the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.520
 transports or the places where we have 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.520
 been 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.110
 every time we place mind 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.110
 the name will appear 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.610
 in case you do not want 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.890
 put another teleporter and you already have 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.070
 strong companies in my case simply 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.810
 we give you written 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.810
 we give you the right 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.220
 what happens if yes and we do 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.180
 here we have 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.620
 do not 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.620
 will store the information 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.159
 on paper and your truth will appear 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.650
 the coordinates but we will not have 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.750
 no teleportation if we 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.280
 we are in an education and we do not have a 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.140
 teleportation back 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.250
 basically it's up to where we 're going to 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.650
 arrive 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.850
 how it works is very simple and is very 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.090
 father we just have to 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.459
 place 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.220
 with transportation and how will they see 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.490
 leave an effect of 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.920
 and as if it were the portable nothing here 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.440
 will give us the options of fabrics more 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.350
 strong we have and if they are 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.720
 asking if we can go up 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.910
 the meter or even the end using this 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.740
 tele for that is the big advantage and the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.570
 big difference that has unlike 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.460
 of doctor on transports since 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.290
 we can travel between dimensions 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.590
 you can see that this gentleman is not 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.590
 simply 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.840
 another place that many human build 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.819
 this is january 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.970
 obviously I have it in peaceful because 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.680
 They destroy my house but it's very, very 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.180
 very interesting father how this works 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.180
 theme or this mod 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.629
 we can simply leave between 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.120
 dimensions we no longer have to be 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.220
 our where from where is the port to 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.739
 have simply put one by 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.790
 talent in duty and another in our 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.200
 tower image in our country house 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.220
 for example let's visit our house 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.760
 field 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.760
 moment 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.480
 and we are arriving 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:01.000
 We can create plans with youtubers or 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:03.069
 all accounts but for us it is 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.930
 as the difference it has we can 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.930
 traveling to liendo we can also 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.670
 and since when 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.630
 in our world 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.240
 it's basically like we end up if 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.780
 We kill the dragon and introduce us to import 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.780
 back 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.270
 in the message 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.930
 here we are here back in the 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.050
 magic doctor 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:41.660
 these three surroundings that this one does not have for 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.660
 offer please 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.159
 and I will give them also as always in 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.159
 the description 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.129
 that can be fine 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.240
 and you keep doing all of your own 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.240
 I really liked the video 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.520
 and I like them
