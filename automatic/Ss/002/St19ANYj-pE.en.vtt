but<00:00:12.760> I<00:00:12.790> won't<00:00:12.970> like<00:00:13.150> to<00:00:13.270> name<00:00:13.450> individuals<00:00:14.050> but

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
but I won't like to name individuals but

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.680 
but I won't like to name individuals but
overall<00:00:14.620> I<00:00:14.710> think<00:00:15.090> we<00:00:16.090> are<00:00:16.150> not<00:00:16.209> up<00:00:16.420> to<00:00:16.570> the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
overall I think we are not up to the

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.870 
overall I think we are not up to the
mark<00:00:16.720> both<00:00:17.619> in<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:17.830> bowling<00:00:18.160> and<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.610> batting

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
mark both in the bowling and the batting

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.230 
mark both in the bowling and the batting
department<00:00:19.360> because<00:00:19.599> it<00:00:20.560> was<00:00:20.740> not<00:00:20.890> a<00:00:21.060> 300<00:00:22.060> run

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
department because it was not a 300 run

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.330 
department because it was not a 300 run
wicket<00:00:22.599> you<00:00:22.750> know<00:00:22.869> I<00:00:22.960> felt<00:00:23.200> we<00:00:23.650> gave<00:00:23.830> you<00:00:24.099> a<00:00:24.130> few

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
wicket you know I felt we gave you a few

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.580 
wicket you know I felt we gave you a few
extra<00:00:24.490> runs<00:00:24.970> and<00:00:25.180> you<00:00:25.210> may<00:00:26.140> say<00:00:26.170> there<00:00:26.500> were<00:00:26.560> a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
extra runs and you may say there were a

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.950 
extra runs and you may say there were a
few<00:00:26.800> very<00:00:27.070> good<00:00:27.250> shots<00:00:27.550> that<00:00:27.820> were<00:00:27.970> played<00:00:28.180> but

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
few very good shots that were played but

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.830 
few very good shots that were played but
i<00:00:28.990> think<00:00:29.170> you<00:00:30.039> know<00:00:30.070> we<00:00:30.250> gave<00:00:30.430> them<00:00:30.609> with<00:00:30.910> an<00:00:31.150> on

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
i think you know we gave them with an on

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.479 
i think you know we gave them with an on
the<00:00:31.990> wicket<00:00:32.260> like<00:00:32.470> this<00:00:32.680> if<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:33.040> give<00:00:33.280> with

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
the wicket like this if you give with

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.450 
the wicket like this if you give with
then<00:00:33.820> become<00:00:34.180> slightly<00:00:34.390> easy<00:00:34.780> for<00:00:35.020> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
then become slightly easy for the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.759 
then become slightly easy for the
batsman's<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.610> school<00:00:37.030> so<00:00:37.300> i<00:00:37.930> think<00:00:38.379> that<00:00:38.530> was

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
batsman's to school so i think that was

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.310 
batsman's to school so i think that was
one<00:00:38.949> of<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.120> big<00:00:40.120> mistakes<00:00:40.360> that<00:00:41.170> we

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
one of the big mistakes that we

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.259 
one of the big mistakes that we
committed<00:00:41.530> but<00:00:41.949> we<00:00:42.550> were<00:00:42.640> brought<00:00:42.820> back<00:00:43.030> into

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
committed but we were brought back into

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.329 
committed but we were brought back into
the<00:00:43.360> game<00:00:43.570> by<00:00:43.870> spinners<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:44.589> think<00:00:44.949> Jadeja

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
the game by spinners I think Jadeja

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.280 
the game by spinners I think Jadeja
bowled<00:00:45.550> well<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.820> course<00:00:46.030> Yuvraj<00:00:46.930> you<00:00:47.110> know<00:00:47.199> my

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
bowled well of course Yuvraj you know my

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.460 
bowled well of course Yuvraj you know my
quarters<00:00:47.650> those<00:00:48.430> crucial<00:00:49.080> breakthrough<00:00:50.080> is

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
quarters those crucial breakthrough is

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.380 
quarters those crucial breakthrough is
when<00:00:50.620> we<00:00:50.769> really<00:00:50.979> needed<00:00:51.280> those<00:00:51.790> wicked<00:00:52.000> so

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
when we really needed those wicked so

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.079 
when we really needed those wicked so
you<00:00:53.350> may<00:00:53.500> say<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.040> higher<00:00:54.220> side<00:00:54.250> but<00:00:54.790> still

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
you may say on the higher side but still

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.180 
you may say on the higher side but still
before<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.019> start<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:56.409> the<00:00:56.470> setting<00:00:56.830> second

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
before the start of the setting second

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.130 
before the start of the setting second
innings<00:00:57.400> we<00:00:57.489> were<00:00:57.580> quite<00:00:57.729> satisfied<00:00:58.330> with<00:00:58.360> 305

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
innings we were quite satisfied with 305

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.079 
innings we were quite satisfied with 305
runs<00:00:59.440> because<00:00:59.620> it<00:01:00.370> seemed<00:01:00.640> they<00:01:00.820> could<00:01:00.970> have

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
runs because it seemed they could have

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.890 
runs because it seemed they could have
scored<00:01:01.390> more<00:01:01.510> so<00:01:02.470> i<00:01:03.220> think<00:01:03.729> when<00:01:04.420> we<00:01:04.449> started

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
scored more so i think when we started

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.590 
scored more so i think when we started
we<00:01:05.019> were<00:01:05.080> quite<00:01:05.229> happy<00:01:05.409> with<00:01:05.590> it<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.570> know

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
we were quite happy with it and you know

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.000 
we were quite happy with it and you know
after<00:01:07.810> losing<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.290> first<00:01:08.500> wicket<00:01:08.680> i<00:01:08.860> think

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
after losing the first wicket i think

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.760 
after losing the first wicket i think
there<00:01:09.130> was<00:01:09.220> a<00:01:09.250> decent<00:01:09.460> partnership<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:10.770> i

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
there was a decent partnership and i

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.880 
there was a decent partnership and i
think<00:01:12.700> we<00:01:12.820> lost<00:01:13.659> wickets<00:01:13.960> at<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.409> wrong<00:01:14.590> time

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
think we lost wickets at the wrong time

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.319 
think we lost wickets at the wrong time
you<00:01:15.040> know<00:01:15.159> when<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.460> was<00:01:15.609> not<00:01:15.820> need<00:01:16.060> it<00:01:16.180> was

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
you know when it was not need it was

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.080 
you know when it was not need it was
very<00:01:16.509> important<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.460> know<00:01:18.579> you<00:01:18.640> keep

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
very important that you know you keep

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.969 
very important that you know you keep
building<00:01:19.390> partnership<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.890> know

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
building partnership and you know

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.459 
building partnership and you know
convert<00:01:21.399> convert<00:01:21.789> your<00:01:22.119> 40s<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:22.869> 50s<00:01:22.990> into

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
convert convert your 40s and 50s into

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.800 
convert convert your 40s and 50s into
big<00:01:23.649> scores<00:01:23.829> because<00:01:24.189> once<00:01:24.969> you<00:01:25.149> do<00:01:25.329> that<00:01:25.359> if

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
big scores because once you do that if

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.510 
big scores because once you do that if
you<00:01:25.960> are<00:01:26.049> chasing<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.439> score<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.859> three<00:01:27.399> hundred

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
you are chasing a score of three hundred

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.760 
you are chasing a score of three hundred
or<00:01:27.820> three<00:01:27.939> hundred<00:01:28.030> five<00:01:28.450> or<00:01:28.630> more<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.409> becomes

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
or three hundred five or more it becomes

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.590 
or three hundred five or more it becomes
slightly<00:01:30.009> easy<00:01:30.579> for<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.969> individuals<00:01:31.509> who

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
slightly easy for the individuals who

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.419 
slightly easy for the individuals who
are<00:01:31.719> coming<00:01:31.960> after<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.530> n<00:01:32.679> i<00:01:32.890> think<00:01:33.280> that's

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
are coming after you n i think that's

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.490 
are coming after you n i think that's
where<00:01:33.609> we<00:01:33.670> committed<00:01:34.149> mistake<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.689> know<00:01:34.840> we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
where we committed mistake you know we

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.480 
where we committed mistake you know we
lost<00:01:35.859> quite<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.130> few<00:01:36.250> in<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.579> middle<00:01:36.820> overs

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.789 

well<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.609> seemed<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.719> know<00:01:45.380> on<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.619> higher

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
well it seemed you know on the higher

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.039 
well it seemed you know on the higher
side<00:01:45.920> like<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.310> 260<00:01:46.969> or<00:01:47.119> run<00:01:47.329> wicked<00:01:47.659> but<00:01:47.810> again

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
side like a 260 or run wicked but again

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.529 
side like a 260 or run wicked but again
as<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.320> said<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:49.700> know<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:49.939> something<00:01:50.329> that

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
as I said you know it's something that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.179 
as I said you know it's something that
we<00:01:50.659> speculate<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.409> what<00:01:51.859> has<00:01:51.979> really

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
we speculate and what has really

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.120 
we speculate and what has really
happened<00:01:52.369> is<00:01:52.789> 305<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.500> know<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.710> depends

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
happened is 305 so you know it depends

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.679 
happened is 305 so you know it depends
on<00:01:55.310> how<00:01:55.490> well<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.759> have<00:01:56.030> bold<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:56.539> you<00:01:56.600> have

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
on how well you have bold and you have

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.199 
on how well you have bold and you have
to<00:01:56.810> see<00:01:56.990> all<00:01:57.170> those<00:01:57.380> things<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:58.579> also<00:01:58.909> the

I think execution is very important if
you<00:03:10.530> see<00:03:10.769> they<00:03:11.250> didn't<00:03:11.459> give<00:03:11.580> us<00:03:11.610> much<00:03:11.730> room

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970

you<00:03:12.450> know<00:03:12.959> they<00:03:13.140> bowled<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.190> right<00:03:14.370> length<00:03:14.640> I

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.030 
you know they bowled the right length I
I<00:03:14.819> feel<00:03:15.209> length<00:03:15.840> was<00:03:16.050> very<00:03:16.260> important<00:03:16.739> in<00:03:16.890> this

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
I feel length was very important in this

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.979 
I feel length was very important in this
and<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.610> was<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.790> wicked<00:03:18.030> where<00:03:18.420> they<00:03:18.840> could

and it was a wicked where they could
have<00:03:19.110> got<00:03:19.379> slightly<00:03:19.739> more<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.370> they're

fast bowlers could have got slightly

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
more compared to our fast full of the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.520 
more compared to our fast full of the
reason<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.420> know<00:03:24.540> they<00:03:24.750> dig<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.379> ball

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
reason you know they dig in the ball

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.650 
reason you know they dig in the ball
much<00:03:25.769> harder<00:03:26.129> even<00:03:26.280> if<00:03:26.519> they<00:03:27.000> pulled<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.390> same

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
much harder even if they pulled the same

much harder even if they pulled the same
pacing<00:03:28.140> you're<00:03:28.290> still<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.650> their<00:03:28.799> height

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
pacing you're still with their height

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.640 
pacing you're still with their height
and<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:30.299> amount<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.690> shoulder<00:03:31.110> they<00:03:31.290> use<00:03:31.470> they

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
and the amount of shoulder they use they

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860 
and the amount of shoulder they use they
get<00:03:31.799> slightly<00:03:32.040> more<00:03:32.430> bounce<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:33.120> think<00:03:33.660> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
get slightly more bounce so I think the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.380 
get slightly more bounce so I think the
executed<00:03:34.379> their<00:03:34.530> plans<00:03:34.799> really<00:03:35.069> well<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.489> I

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
executed their plans really well and I

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.920 
executed their plans really well and I
think<00:03:36.870> that's<00:03:37.080> where<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:39.000> know<00:03:39.150> we<00:03:39.510> didn't

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
think that's where you know we didn't

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.020 
think that's where you know we didn't
really<00:03:40.049> execute<00:03:40.230> our<00:03:40.680> plans<00:03:41.010> well<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.519> feel

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
really execute our plans well so I feel

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.850 
really execute our plans well so I feel
it's<00:03:42.180> important<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.840> if<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.349> have<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.560> plan

Australia<00:04:05.069> also<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.430> ODI<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.060> let's<00:04:06.989> not<00:04:07.200> raise

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
Australia also in ODI so let's not raise

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.080 
Australia also in ODI so let's not raise
that<00:04:07.650> thing<00:04:07.950> again<00:04:08.099> you<00:04:08.400> know<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.549> lose<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.819> few

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
that thing again you know you lose a few

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.110 
that thing again you know you lose a few
games<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.629> short<00:04:09.930> ball<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.459> I<00:04:11.459> think<00:04:12.000> as

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
games it's the short ball and I think as

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.970 
games it's the short ball and I think as
I<00:04:12.150> said<00:04:12.239> we<00:04:12.690> were<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.049> good<00:04:13.200> position<00:04:13.410> we

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
I said we were in a good position we

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.909 
I said we were in a good position we
played<00:04:14.310> some<00:04:14.340> bad<00:04:14.850> shots<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.380> was<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.560> shot

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
played some bad shots so it was a shot

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.949 
played some bad shots so it was a shot
selection<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.789> was<00:04:18.000> bad<00:04:18.510> more<00:04:18.810> than

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
selection that was bad more than

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.199 
selection that was bad more than
anything<00:04:19.200> else<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:19.639> let's<00:04:20.639> keep<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.180> that

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
anything else so let's keep it to that

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.899 
anything else so let's keep it to that
and<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:22.019> know<00:04:22.139> hopefully<00:04:22.260> will<00:04:22.620> improve

then<00:04:51.319> all<00:04:51.469> of<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.680> sudden<00:04:51.710> before<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.699> start<00:04:52.969> of

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
then all of a sudden before the start of

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.490 
then all of a sudden before the start of
the<00:04:53.210> world<00:04:53.419> cup<00:04:53.479> we<00:04:53.659> can't<00:04:53.870> say<00:04:54.050> okay<00:04:54.259> we<00:04:54.379> don't

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
the world cup we can't say okay we don't

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.350 
the world cup we can't say okay we don't
have<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.740> batsman<00:04:55.189> who<00:04:55.280> bad<00:04:55.430> set<00:04:55.639> for<00:04:55.849> for<00:04:56.060> us<00:04:56.180> we

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
have a batsman who bad set for for us we

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.480 
have a batsman who bad set for for us we
will<00:04:56.419> have<00:04:56.650> when<00:04:57.650> we<00:04:57.680> need<00:04:57.979> some<00:04:58.189> kind<00:04:58.400> of

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
will have when we need some kind of

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.119 
will have when we need some kind of
analog<00:04:58.819> and<00:04:58.969> so<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.780> think<00:05:00.139> we'll<00:05:00.349> have<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.770> give

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
analog and so I think we'll have to give

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.040 
analog and so I think we'll have to give
him<00:05:01.190> some<00:05:01.400> kind<00:05:01.639> of<00:05:01.759> experience<00:05:02.659> you<00:05:02.900> know

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
him some kind of experience you know

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.050 
him some kind of experience you know
batting<00:05:03.349> at<00:05:03.469> number<00:05:03.650> four<00:05:04.039> he<00:05:04.460> has<00:05:04.580> batted<00:05:04.940> too

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
batting at number four he has batted too

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.730 
batting at number four he has batted too
long<00:05:05.270> for<00:05:05.449> number<00:05:05.719> six<00:05:05.900> that<00:05:06.199> that's<00:05:06.560> why<00:05:06.680> you

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
long for number six that that's why you

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.589 
long for number six that that's why you
see<00:05:07.009> at<00:05:07.190> timing<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.520> these<00:05:07.669> instinctive<00:05:08.330> shots

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
see at timing of these instinctive shots

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.689 
see at timing of these instinctive shots
which<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:09.080> see<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.310> bachelor<00:05:10.669> season

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
which you see and the bachelor season

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.300 
which you see and the bachelor season
goes<00:05:11.210> after<00:05:11.569> them<00:05:11.719> so<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.770> think<00:05:12.919> it's<00:05:13.190> very

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
goes after them so I think it's very

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.010 
goes after them so I think it's very
important<00:05:13.819> that<00:05:13.849> he<00:05:14.539> uses<00:05:14.750> these

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
important that he uses these

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.589 
important that he uses these
opportunities<00:05:15.620> really<00:05:16.099> well<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.449> then<00:05:17.449> we'll

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
opportunities really well and then we'll

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:18.999 
opportunities really well and then we'll
have<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:17.990> know<00:05:18.080> too<00:05:18.229> bad<00:05:18.259> showing<00:05:18.650> a<00:05:18.740> fair

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
have you know too bad showing a fair

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:20.469 
have you know too bad showing a fair
amount<00:05:19.129> of<00:05:19.370> exposure<00:05:19.759> batting<00:05:20.210> at<00:05:20.330> number

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
amount of exposure batting at number

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.990 
amount of exposure batting at number
four<00:05:20.840> because<00:05:20.990> all<00:05:21.500> those<00:05:21.800> slots<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.490> know<00:05:22.669> we

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
four because all those slots you know we

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.519 
four because all those slots you know we
have<00:05:23.120> got<00:05:23.360> players<00:05:23.659> and<00:05:23.900> even<00:05:23.960> we<00:05:24.259> have<00:05:24.349> got
