it's the skyrim main theme and this is
another<00:00:12.570> similar<00:00:13.259> design<00:00:13.620> once<00:00:14.580> again<00:00:14.759> took<00:00:15.630> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
another similar design once again took a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.599 
another similar design once again took a
little<00:00:16.260> less<00:00:16.440> time<00:00:16.470> because<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
little less time because of just a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.779 
little less time because of just a
little<00:00:17.850> bit<00:00:17.970> shorter<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.580> sorry<00:00:20.580> about<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
little bit shorter and sorry about the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.689 
little bit shorter and sorry about the
speed<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.949> with<00:00:22.949> no<00:00:23.130> blocks<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.580> only

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
speed of it but with no blocks it only

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.790 
speed of it but with no blocks it only
works<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.119> two<00:00:24.300> different<00:00:24.480> speeds<00:00:24.900> really

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
works in two different speeds really

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.880 
works in two different speeds really
fast<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:27.300> slow<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
fast or really slow so this is a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400 
fast or really slow so this is a
slightly<00:00:29.220> faster<00:00:29.550> than<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> usual<00:00:30.410> Skyrim

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
slightly faster than the usual Skyrim
