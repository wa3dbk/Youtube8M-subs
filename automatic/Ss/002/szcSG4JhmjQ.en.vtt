that's the idea so it's a sitting step
out<00:02:16.150> as<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.690> go<00:02:16.720> down<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.320> way<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.740> can

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
out as you go down that way you can

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.710 
out as you go down that way you can
transfer<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.610> weight<00:02:18.730> forward<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.360> couple

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
transfer the weight forward a couple

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:29.550 
transfer the weight forward a couple
more<00:02:21.900> little<00:02:22.900> late<00:02:24.690> there<00:02:25.690> we<00:02:25.810> go<00:02:28.410> okay<00:02:29.410> and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
more little late there we go okay and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.580 
more little late there we go okay and
that's<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> idea<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:31.080> sitting<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.260> lifting

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that's the idea that sitting and lifting

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.520 
that's the idea that sitting and lifting
remember<00:02:33.040> he's<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.120> ensure<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:35.260> net

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
remember he's going to ensure your net

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.140 
remember he's going to ensure your net
clearance<00:02:36.250> power<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.480> depth
