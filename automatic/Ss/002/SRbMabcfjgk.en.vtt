00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
nutrition that this that this tree

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
nutrition that this that this tree
carries<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.710> save<00:01:04.949> lives<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.519> literally

can save lives um there's about four

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.950 
can save lives um there's about four
hundred<00:01:08.310> thousand<00:01:08.939> Moringa<00:01:09.330> trees<00:01:09.540> planted

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
hundred thousand Moringa trees planted

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.080 
hundred thousand Moringa trees planted
in<00:01:10.140> Rwanda<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.830> now<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.670> tree<00:01:11.970> itself

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
in Rwanda right now and the tree itself

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.170 
in Rwanda right now and the tree itself
has<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.750> 80%<00:01:13.439> germination<00:01:14.280> rate<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.909> seeds

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
has an 80% germination rate the seeds

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820 
has an 80% germination rate the seeds
have<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> eighty<00:01:15.720> percent<00:01:15.869> germination<00:01:16.500> rate

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
have a eighty percent germination rate

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.179 
have a eighty percent germination rate
so<00:01:16.979> very<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.610> easy<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.509> grow<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.890> bottom

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so very very easy to grow the bottom

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
so very very easy to grow the bottom

you have to educate yourself on the
Moringa<00:01:25.950> tree<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.850> may<00:01:27.000> sound<00:01:27.210> too<00:01:27.479> good<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.869> be

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
Moringa tree it may sound too good to be

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.140 
Moringa tree it may sound too good to be
true<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.520> understand<00:01:29.939> how

matter<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.630> Moringa<00:01:33.990> tree<00:01:34.200> does<00:01:34.409> exist

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
matter is the Moringa tree does exist

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.580 
matter is the Moringa tree does exist
they<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.270> growing<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.930> people<00:01:37.409> are

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
they are growing and people are

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
they are growing and people are
surviving<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.790> living<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.600> these

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
surviving and living because of these

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.050 
surviving and living because of these
trees<00:01:39.990> um<00:01:40.380> they<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> nourishment<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
trees um they get the nourishment that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.149 
trees um they get the nourishment that
they<00:01:42.390> need<00:01:42.600> because<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.140> these<00:01:43.259> trees<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.040> if

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
they need because of these trees and if

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.380 
they need because of these trees and if
we<00:01:44.369> could<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.549> spread<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> word<00:01:45.240> about

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
we could just spread the word about

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
we could just spread the word about
these<00:01:45.689> trees<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.259> could<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.920> definitely

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
these trees we could we can definitely
