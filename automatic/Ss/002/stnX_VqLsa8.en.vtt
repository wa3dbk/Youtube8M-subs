00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 my name is romain testud I am 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 student ong so i have this is the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.250
 geometry and graphic design laboratory 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.580
 in the computer section 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.219
 my semester project was actually 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 build create instructions 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.160
 for a lambda user of how 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.080
 build a 3d object in lego then 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.529
 first had to understand the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.359
 specificities of the lego so I had 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.320
 always with me in my pocket 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.730
 little bricks and as soon as I 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.199
 think about the algorithm I'm 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.180
 said ok they must be box 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.370
 than vertical parts what is that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.690
 the number of round stuff on each other 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.309
 be the highest possible 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.829
 it gave me ideas we noticed 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.320
 bac it was not enough just to 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.670
 below divide our model into small 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.579
 bricks one had to make sure that the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.070
 overall final model be solid so 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.300
 for that we used his connections we have 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.460
 actually represented each brick by a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.039
 point and then each connection between 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.420
 bricks by a link is how we could 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.190
 see for example if there was a room 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 who was alone we could not l 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.780
 isolate and then then try to 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.309
 solve these problems there to make sure 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.380
 that the final model they are solid 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.540
 the final result we get is in 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.729
 does the decomposition into jacques 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.150
 level of man so distorted dairy 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.030
 a dairy 2 h 3 until then there are thirty 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.860
 30 floors here we have each forms 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.840
 pieces to put where he 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 will have to put the color she has and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.380
 then we also see the dance level or in 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
 highlight a little bit like that that we 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.650
 allows to align the top piece on 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.150
 know compared to the one below there 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.650
 Fundamental it is no 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.450
 literature on that so that was 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.790
 really a lot of work 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.369
 imagination to be responding to 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.020
 problems with a solution that works 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.220
 they are so fast 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.079
 the problem we had with those 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.399
 left man in lego is we 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.100
 did not have enough bricks of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.960
 colors so here we can see that we have 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.770
 had to cheat a little bit because we 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.540
 missing reds 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.549
 I chose this project because I like 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 a lot of everything that involves 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.259
 build things too so do not 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.640
 do only something to 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.200
 the computer but of really then 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.670
 to be able to play with anything 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 kids will now I make a 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.880
 another project where we have to build 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.930
 things too so I really like this 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.899
 aspect there of 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.280
 do not stay in the virtual m past 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.610
 in the end in something really 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.610
 concrete 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.270
 a lot
