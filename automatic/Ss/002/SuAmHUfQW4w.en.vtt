00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.540
 but 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.850
 - which we prepare now for melarossa.it 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.819
 are the beans with the small bird 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.350
 we have some cannellini tomatoes 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.299
 at the tattoo rooms 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.240
 sage and olive oil 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.180
 let's start with Italian very thin slices and tomato 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.019
 in this way we can dutifully 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.769
 the studio nutritional briefs that are not represented in the classics 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.890
 fat imprinting in the province sends nutrients thematic that we in 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.730
 especially a girl with a picnik 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.240
 which has a very important function in preventing cardiovascular diseases 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.630
 this is how not to mention yourself with the cooking so present also the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.690
 sauce. 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 after which the law was found 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 and I have to admit oil from the non-stick pan 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.830
 and remember to follow your personalized diet for the quantities of oil 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.830
 because it is very important 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.350
 on fire 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.910
 let's brown 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.330
 at this point I take a sage leaf 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.070
 and hand mirror 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.310
 the caption if they are used for their functions 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.609
 organoleptic pines to improve the taste of crying 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.859
 important year your ass. which concerns the antioxidant effect in fighting i 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.040
 free radicals is the antithrombotic effect 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.980
 will be the one who translates to fiat cost 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.260
 it photo 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
 tomatoes 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 that we do solarexpo 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.360
 at this point 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 add the cannellini beans 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 trump 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.619
 the beans are the poisons and as such have characteristics that they 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.570
 differentiate from other vegetables 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.590
 in particular vintage protein percentage around 10% and this is me 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.590
 makes an almost irreplaceable food for vegetarians 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.170
 add a pinch of salt 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.170
 enough 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:29.290
 pet 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.290
 remember that on site you will also find the recipe with lentils 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.820
 very similar to this type of cooking 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.759
 let it cook for 20 minutes 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.759
 evade priest with propellant attitude 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.599
 check if they are ready 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.029
 perfect 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.029
 diamond seems 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.579
 we invest in our dish 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.669
 fac 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.279
 and I discount coupons 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.119
 with a leaf and sage 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:13.559
 and here was the beans with the small bird 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.739
 for me the hotmail thing 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.439
 but 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.989
 but 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.219
 but
