00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.140
 pure syllables and five impure syllables 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.060
 derived 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.450
 let's go and see what is on the chapel 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.450
 wait up 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.909
 so let's see on the table 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.439
 that tells them what we have already done and 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 which await us in this lesson 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.930
 in the past between lessons we did 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:48.680
 the first 15 syllables in this we vi 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.680
 let's give 35 that will be thaci to the top 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.940
 let's go see a little quickly for 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:03.659
 understand what we are talking about and for 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:09.840
 see the order of the traits 123 equitable the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:16.980
 first character eta 1 and 2 the second e 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:22.769
 there is only one trait and this is another 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.010
 the only trait is the 1 and 2 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:34.020
 the last act but let's see them a little 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:37.020
 more calmly the first character and to 1 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.020
 2 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.689
 3 and 4 as you notice the iii and iv sign 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:53.760
 they look like the syllable coop 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:55.680
 the second character is c1 and hard I for 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.760
 remember this character I associate it 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.049
 to a 5 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:06.480
 the third character is up and is formed by 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:09.920
 one trait the fourth and you and also 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:17.260
 the latter is formed by a single sign 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:20.319
 in the last one is top 1 and 2 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.900
 30 remember to keep in mind that 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.959
 you always have the word at hand 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.599
 in Japanese means by hand and 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.640
 you can find the character yourself on 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.349
 your 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 try to understand your right hand and 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.790
 you will find it 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.129
 here it is maybe not perfect but there is 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.409
 so you have the character you want 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.909
 say hand on your nice hand no 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.069
 let's see them again one by one a little more 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:04:01.659
 quickly to remind us of the order of the 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:04:06.510
 facts 1 2 3 and 4 1 and 2 a single one another 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.510
 single sign 1 and 2 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.530
 as I said at the beginning of the episode too 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.000
 these five syllables can change 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.670
 their pronunciation with transformation 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.389
 between michael da cota and turn into 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.489
 five impure syllables we go to see them 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.530
 ok let's see how they change 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.460
 these five syllables with the addition of 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:33.529
 dap tries with the addition of the powerful 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:40.389
 becomes from there becomes g 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:45.079
 su becomes Jun while Network becomes Tea 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.639
 two will become do 

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:48.739
 let's go see them one by one a little 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:54.129
 quickly to remind us of the order of the 

00:04:48.739 --> 00:05:00.210
 treat with the addition of from cooper 12 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:05:05.669
 34 of da cota 1 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:09.449
 and 2 by adding them in quotes 1 and 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:14.430
 goria bills one single and always from cut 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:16.050
 to 1 and 2 of the government read but that pays the 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.240
 we can compose with the syllables that 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.470

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.639
