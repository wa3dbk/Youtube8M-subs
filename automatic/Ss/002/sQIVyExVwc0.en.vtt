 but unfortunately still because of the theme 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.520
 it's about following a very diet 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.080
 strict to keep me in shape but 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.370
 If the event ends there, it will 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.370
 try some food 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:15.920

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:55.410
 marcus at 147 kilos to have 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.840
 problems to bundle this country so 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.700
 general, people are not that size, 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.959

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.139
 Peru, however , follows it a little bit 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.790
 because this one who wants to go to Machu Picchu 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.919

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.220
 of soccer as is the case of Claudio 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.550

 how are you by my side 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.950
 in this framework the initial 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.900
 that they do not tell us about a little 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.789
 about the event to be carried 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.259
