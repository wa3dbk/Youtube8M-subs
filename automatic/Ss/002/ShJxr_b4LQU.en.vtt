00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.120
 health is already back and now it is 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:16.390
 Therapy time is here with me gabriela 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.170
 She is a therapist with a specialty like that. 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.029
 massage baths and hydrotherapy cabin 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.760
 We are going to talk about baths today. 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.070
 alternates I want to know what the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.330
 so that only with these indications of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.580
 alternating baths 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.529
 then alternating bath is a hot bath 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.390
 and cold is the same as the bath 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.370
 contract he could not find himself 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.280
 Then we'll show you three minutes in the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.680
 warm and a minute in the cold also 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.890
 count can be local as if you are 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.410
 make on your feet or hands at joints and 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.450
 also in the whole body that the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.309
 showerhead, okay? 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.960
 Usually, we already have to 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.000
 showing the football that we did here 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.130
 in the health video thesis school I no longer 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.670
 I did it several times and I know for example 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.079
 School feet for headache is fabulous 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.600
 the school asks that the headache 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.969
 people only indicate the heat only the bath 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.189
 hot on the feet is alternated for the 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:12.069
 feet even to activate the circulation are 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.159
 indications are because when you put 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:18.130
 a part of the body in hot water 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.170
 brass vases and in the cold makes 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.299
 vasoconstriction then this movement 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
 activates the circulation but there are lots of people 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.409
 What are you afraid of this contrast? 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.889
 because look what we brought here 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.249
 that bp asked is one with ice and already the 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:35.920
 gelato really counted and hot water x 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.869
 bearable we advise from 37 to 40 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.859
 degrees and who does not have a thermometer as 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.020
 what do you do to measure 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.090
 then we know that you have part of the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.729
 our most sensitive body right 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.840
 if we put part of the elbow to 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.719
 people can have a sensitivity 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.810
 It's better, then, but we 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:56.639
 Starts and tone so warmer wizard 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.079
 not too hot and as it was 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:01.119
 passing the time you put more 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.310
 Hot water is not cool this tip because 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.590
 you can not force too there will have to 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.749
 endure endured is bearable 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.700
 Yeah, but we need this contrast. 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:13.510
 so the more ice cream the better 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.930
 now give me examples of what it's for 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.909
 these alternate goods 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.530
 type of diseases what type of problems 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.959
 can solve with this type of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.219
 treatment because this contrast medium 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.620
 As I said, it will activate circulation. 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.239
 then it will increase the supply of 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.010
 defense cells 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.650
 that is, it will stimulate the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.480
 immune system will increase the supply of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.540
 oxygen and nutrients and oxygen and 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.750
 nutrients and this helps is also the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.730
 metabolism of our cells 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.650
 increase and this helps healing and 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.659
 restoration of a tissue then by 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.569
 You cut yourself off. 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:50.329
 she made a cut has a wound and that is 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.739
 they heal so ok then this is a 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.400
 good treatment that helps in healing 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.950
 of the diabetic tissue that has problem 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.260
 with circulation can make ball has to 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.400
 doing here is great because you need to activate 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.750
 circulation, especially in 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.760
 neat ends 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.859
 So be careful because the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.359
 diabetic it has little sensitivity 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.709
 on the feet 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.540
 so if we put some water 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.879
 very hot it can have a burn 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.349
 and neither fish nor even realize the 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.480
 diabetic we will put this 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.000
 save people with diabetes and people with 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.459
 sensitivity babies babies 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.500
 We need someone's help. 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.720
 there your thermometer is better to identify 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.560
 beauty there are more babies babies can 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.120
 do 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.099
 but also take care of the temperature 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.780
 because they are more sensitive in this self 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.900
 I have information here that bathes the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.090
 coach serves you for circulation 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.909
 neuralgia rheumatism atrocious grit is 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.189
 very good headaches already gone 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.439
 the immune system now you have a 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.810
 practical example of how this worked 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.549
 here for you dealing here with sergeant 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.459
 here from the clinic then everything we had 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.669
 shows that she has a very bad ulcer 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.739
 big on her legs and then every day she 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.439
 put in a scalding feet up to more water 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.139
 or less at knee height in a bath 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.909
 contrast to the alternating tse, then 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.829
 I stayed three minutes in the fifth minute in the 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.810
 cold she used to make us everyday 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.269
 Pomegranate bark tea is also placed 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.819
 has a healing effect and within 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.099
 the same or sometimes closed the 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.159
 person is in trouble for years she 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.870
 dragging shaq vu-m dressings 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.370
 What, for example, do you have? 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.690
 the bath 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.699
 facial rhinitis and sinusitis and 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.520
 enough in the winter season he has 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.500
 Our allergies are a bath that 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.210
 own experience works very well 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.610
 I've already done these people sitting 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.490
 and so study fabulous but a lot of people 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.860
 Are you afraid to talk or face taco pie? 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.090
 It is the moment of truth. 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.340
 care that we need to have 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.160
 do this alternate two care bath 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.810
 first always end with a cold so 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.940
 financially independent you do 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.620
 ends with the cold because it will close the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.310
 pores is a protection for our body. 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.350
 one and the other is also a rest after 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.300
 the treatment if you do a treatment 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.440
 that will stimulate your body like this 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.789
 and get out in the cold 90 and then not good either 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.729
 the ldu will not get her mouth twisted 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.229
 because the cold will not only protect 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.300
 any form is important the rest 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.760
 after this treatment 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.250
 a home a home of at least 30 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.860
 minutes before leaving because the body 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.360
 wanting can not be water in these 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.240
 people think it will not do much 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.970
 effect but very stimulating treatment is 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.700
 that they really do understand that 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.800
 needs to be observed right 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.930
 Now let's talk about the general bath shower. 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.880
 of contrast of the shower for example 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.460
 what are the benefits because people 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.349
 should make the circulation of the body active 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.360
 whole and stimulates the system 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:47.120
 immune do not know when we 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.039
 feel that you will have a cold 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.039
 contrast in the shower is a remedy 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.750
 excellent to fight because the active 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.840
 movement, we better distribute the 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.010
 defense cells 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.349
 I know people who spoke to you 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.840
 had limit by it issues with a bath 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.940
 and then take a hot shower that I do not open 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.889
 hand and take a cold shower as many 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.830
 minutes and should be in charge of a 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.530
 minute feel the body cooled shopping 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.870
 in the head the whole island 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.460
 sufficient minute included in the 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.310
 our daily bath 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.900
 even if we do not do otherwise 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.550
 several exchanges the important thing is to finish 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.860
 always trusted even in winter 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.990
 he wants the body to protect people 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.970
 find more in the cold winter will stay 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.219
 will not protect your body 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.590
 against virus and body 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.720
 strangers in recharge to optimum protection 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.120
 look me 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.270
 You suddenly feel like doing 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.240
 But you do not have the courage, I've already done it. 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.560
 I always do at home too and the sensation 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.230
 that gives after the shower that you 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.860
 turn off that water is hot alloy pond 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.810
 ugly is a days sensation individual to
