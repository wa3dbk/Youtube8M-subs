00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi girls a video today 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.629
 special tour from my balcony 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.040
 because in my room it's all 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.330
 simply impossible to minutes and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.269
 during the winter 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.040
 even the winter is tense as the sun 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.509
 bangs right behind the window then with 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.690
 the leaf is quite this land of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.789
 both very delicate winter needs 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.609
 we not been so suddenly going the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.070
 videos at my home the summer is tracing on the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.160
 balcony and early morning is already 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.449
 another beast these cicadas what I believe 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.820
 you hear them by that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.980
 I'm trying to juggle work 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 the kids who play must leave 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.090
 to go beyond the heat is a little tense 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.379
 it was so here I did you this 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.789
 evening makeup makeup 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.789
 I was just going a girlfriend 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.870
 with the gorgeous garbage and that 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.129
 I love to mac a red orange that 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.479
 I can m TVs that because 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.149
 otherwise it's troubling it's help 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.370
 sorry and that's always this verb on 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.830
 the chords that this tube is what it is 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.380
 so absolute forgiveness but all so Jesus 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.600
 I'll do the wind is 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.670
 feasible with the asptt hyÃ¨res the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.420
 valette au naturel you demonstrate the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.460
 alternatives 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.880
 I personally use the year 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.470
 crisis of the schedule i tunes to do it 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.200
 so here is not a lot of 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.270
 maquis not much sense at a pace 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.500
 many colors super fast easy 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.610
 and windows is what is it you 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.610
 interested continuation 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.770
 I do not use to hide all 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.280
 tasks the buttons etc 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.659
 anti darks darling of at benefit 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.969
 see it's cream that's on 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.520
 outline and in the middle it's the color 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.850
 it is to moisturize dark circles and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.770
 wrinkles 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.450
 so stop issime there is the medium and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.450
 this winter it will be the light 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.920
 I sew with ben 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.920
 my the panting banana 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.180
 I add a touch of 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.180
 iridescent hours 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.040
 the billion touch 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.530
 I emphasize it with these different 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.530
 proposals 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.250
 a touch of music but it's 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.440
 really had to say your muscles but that's 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.880
 really optional because the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.510
 colors they are they take well 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.510
 itself 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.310
 cryo I want to use so this casting 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.380
 has created to overcome between the black is 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.860
 the divided color of the arcade 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.600
 eyebrow blurs page and I'm going 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.430
 repeat the operation until 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.430
 I had a good intensity 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.020
 I'm going to put it in the lining and 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.910
 you 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.810
 filmed but I also put on the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:49.270
 outer corner in water and so after with 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.270
 the blackout I continue to accentuate 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.339
 and the finishing touches with lady danger of 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.339
 mac
