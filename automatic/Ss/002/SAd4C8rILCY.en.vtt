00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.170
 york state 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.360

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.680
 video gone down there I will leave you 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.980
 the link so you can go 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.960
 watching the channel of the roast king the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.849
 importance that this grease has 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.950
 interspersed the famous marbling for 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.739
 give juiciness to our meat and 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.989
 additionally very good taste three 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.640
 wonderful cuts for roasting because 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.470
 one has to choose good cuts 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.809
 when he goes to take care of his friends his 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.030
 relatives one of those is this the level 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.100
 that state is also up and that was 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.080
 the one that makes them last class and for 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.729
 course the secret and secretive tail 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.580
 for meats that have the fat of 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.229
 this side this is the first thing this fat 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.820
 just like if it was the churrasco 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.100
 also that he has his fat on one side 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 it's the first thing that goes on the grill 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.500
 first of all then to seal it by 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.360
 course in gas ovens we have 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.159
 all these temperatures here are 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.450
 just that they are indicating us the 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.340
 maximum the minimum and everything but when 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.229
 We have another type of grills for 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.600
 know if it is high ideal to put 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.130
 our flesh you have to put your hand what 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.820
 close as possible to the grill and 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.300
 count 1 2 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.370
 3 white this floor means that it is 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.350
 very high ideal to place it there then 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.000
 to know that it's short, we put the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.040
 hand to the same distance and we can 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 hold for about ten seconds means 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.610
 that is ready you know from the side of the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.440
 grasita goes there 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.240
 why did not you salt you why 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.670
 I do not throw salt, I'm going to throw the room 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.440
 final because if you do not remember that salt 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.750
 what it does is also dehydrate 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.210
 our meat on the grill so 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.190
 it's the last thing I'm going to put there without 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.860
 import the term of the meat that goes 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.500
 to be very roasted medium blue or flip flop 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.030
 as my friendship says it 's scott if what 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.280
 yes it is very important is that fats 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.520
 all these fats have to go well 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.410
 well roasted well we already have our 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.020
 Let's see how this was 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.930
 let's take off the grill and 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.820
 Look, look how pretty was that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.590
 grease 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.000
 Now we are simply going to do our 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.350
 sealing process we seal by this 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.790
 side we sealed on the other side and then 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.280
 on the other side that are the four sides 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.500
 of the meat so that the juices remain 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.390
 there now the term that I very much 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.430
 people ask how do I know what is 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.410
 the normal term that you should use in 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.600
 the meat you are going to use the following 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.400
 trick your hand very well and they will start to 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.160
 do the following and touch here in 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.870
 this point this texture is blue term 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.000
 so if I do this and play the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.720
 meat I realize that it is very similar 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.820
 so I know what the term without 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.110
 a little higher, a medium term 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.260
 just look what I'm going to do 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.950
 under my finger and here it gives me the texture of 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.720
 here average of three quarters and 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.520
 here flip flop and now the time has come 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.840
 of going around to continue with 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.160
 our sealed look who took the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.630
 colorcito remember that what we are 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.400
 simply looking is that we do not know 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.680
 escape the juices and now please 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.810
 go let the meat there a good 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.820
 time and we're going to turn it around when 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.400
 let's see that they come out on this side of the 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.400
 meat the juices there we turn 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.519
 look here that the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.049
 what do I look for on this side and we're going to 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.960
 withdraw it also because we do not want it 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.300
 it's called is hitting him so much 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.250
 in this beauty for god's sake you see 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.890
 incredible and we are going to place it here and by 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.410
 course we are going to lower the temperature 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.310
 we're going to put everything down so that 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.320
 flame do not hit the meat and not the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.600
 get where I get these cuts of 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.330
 certified and good and you already know in 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.650
 all the success of the country carulla 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.050
 very easy, they will also have a jewel 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.790
 because not all angles are the same 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.860
 and we're going to leave it there with a lot 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.010
 patience without being punctured without 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.530
 be touching it without turning it around 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.720
 approximately 20 25 more minutes or 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.480
 less by the thickness of this meat for 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.940
 that has a uniform cooking by 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.520
 inside and outside we were left with the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.440
 caramelized seal that we are so looking for 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.739
 Look at this 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.540
 look at this for God's sake ' was and is not 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.130
 is food makeup do not think about 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.800
 what I'm doing absolutely nothing 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.360
 it was wonderful to remember secret is 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.760
 very important let's let it rest 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.710
 a couple of minutes there so that then 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.870
 when the court releases those juicy 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.580
 but in a moderate way if the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.280
 We cut immediately while it is 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.570
 hot is going to release all the juices and 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.570
 we are going to lose them of the meat 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.949
 and it's only at this moment that he 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.180
 I'm going to put salt salt to taste for both 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:52.729
 sides let's go around a bit 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.789
 more salt around here and you will see 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.110
 how they want it and we are going to cut 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:02.030
 cut them around here so that you 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:05.050
 can see it very well look at this or how 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.180
 Look at this, it was absolutely 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.060
 wonderful indeed the term is a 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.150
 very juicy medium term look what 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.840
 beauty the brilliant shines of these 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.810
 meats give a few fantastic touches 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.779
 incredible aromas and some notes in the mouth 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.270
 that few meats are certified 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.529
 angus vip that we have here in Colombia and 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.020
 that you get in all 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:31.430
 supermarkets you have to thank the 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.919
 Atlantic people for giving us the 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.550
 opportunity to have these cuts for 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:40.099
 our courses of the roast king I am 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.250
 fascinated with what we achieved here I'm going to 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.289
 take out a piece of these and now I'm going to 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.389
 distribute it all over the place 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.189

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.819
 known for the love of god look how 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.819

 two 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.639
