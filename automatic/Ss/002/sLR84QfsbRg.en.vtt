better than - real
at<00:01:06.290> all<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:07.780> we're<00:01:08.780> going<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:08.960> do<00:01:09.110> two<00:01:09.410> exactly

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
at all so we're going to do two exactly

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.500 
at all so we're going to do two exactly
down<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.220> preferential<00:01:10.730> writing<00:01:11.390> position

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
down to a preferential writing position

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.290 
down to a preferential writing position
and<00:01:12.200> hit<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.950> backslash<00:01:13.340> versus<00:01:13.760> rebound

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.510 

now<00:01:21.170> as<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.409> can<00:01:21.500> see<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:21.799> much<00:01:21.979> softer<00:01:22.280> I

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
now as you can see it's much softer I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.160 
now as you can see it's much softer I
can<00:01:22.759> bloom<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.560> but<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:24.710> not<00:01:24.860> too<00:01:25.130> soft

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
can bloom it but it's not too soft

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.630 
can bloom it but it's not too soft
that<00:01:27.170> my<00:01:27.320> weight<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:28.009> going<00:01:28.189> to<00:01:28.250> throw<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.549> off

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
that my weight is going to throw it off

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.240 
that my weight is going to throw it off
let<00:01:28.850> me<00:01:28.909> sit<00:01:29.149> on<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.329> bike<00:01:29.770> balance<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.070> see

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
let me sit on the bike balance and see

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.179 
let me sit on the bike balance and see
if<00:01:31.369> we<00:01:31.490> can<00:01:31.640> figure<00:01:31.789> out<00:01:31.939> if<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:32.329> is<00:01:32.479> good

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
if we can figure out if this is good

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.580 
if we can figure out if this is good
that's<00:01:34.189> pretty<00:01:34.520> good<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:35.659> first<00:01:36.020> pretty<00:01:36.380> darn

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
that's pretty good is first pretty darn

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.499 
that's pretty good is first pretty darn
stiff<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:37.670> can<00:01:37.789> see<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.030> returning<00:01:38.329> up

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
stiff you can see it's returning up

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.840 
stiff you can see it's returning up
