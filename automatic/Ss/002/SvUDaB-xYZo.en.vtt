00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.900
 hello technocrats played tonight jose 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.310
 techno fanatic dotcom 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.220
 unpacking of smart watch 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.540
 classic ojito this clock in between 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.540
 companies with nec device 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.660
 now we are going with the unpacking 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.770
 facilitated waited until the moment we 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.770
 the box is giving problems 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.020
 all right 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.970
 but here we have the clock is something else 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.600
 It is very elegant and the design is fine 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.410
 nice and good we will continue to open and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.860
 here we have it if you can see 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.720
 let's go 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.750
 so it does not give me the dirty game that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.300
 you can not open where is here is 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.740
 that is not written down but here we have some 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.740
 areas that we have to cut 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.470
 there it is here we have a quick guide 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.770
 of user 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.440
 and here we have what comes to be the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.560
 presentation of the watch 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.730
 let's remove it and now what I'm going to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.220
 do is you give them the respective 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.720
 specifications of the classic cogito the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.660
 cogito classic which is a version 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.750
 totally improved much more advanced 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.120
 that what was the cucu watch in terms of 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.430
 design is also superior to you 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.380
 can see what comes with what is 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.720
 metal in the front and the age then 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.720
 another connotation I really know very 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.540
 elegant has an analogous movement 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.160
 as well as a digital display one goes to 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.200
 to be able to visualize who is the one who 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.630
 call as you also want me to send you 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.760
 messages comes in various colors in 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.140
 purple black green orange 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.510
 silver or white in the case of the part 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.040
 of the edge in some changes as per 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.960
 example, you will be able to appreciate it 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.280
 in orange in green color 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.990
 silver which is what I have also in 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.730
 white color there are other cases that also 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.520
 the belt changes that you are going to be able to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.130
 visualize the strap in white 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.830
 handles what is bluetooth 4.0 for a 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.780
 better energy saving has what in 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.580
 make 10 atm or resist 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.290
 at 1 to be able to dive to swim 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.810
 to be able to shower as well as be 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.340
 in rain is compatible with systems 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.080
 operatives help those as well 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.400
 Android in the case of Android is 4 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.040
 points 4.3 sorry forward and there is 7 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.319
 henceforth the clock does not need to be 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.940
 charged and you are going to have a 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.500
 battery that can simply be 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.380
 replace you in the back 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.640
 are going to have an area where with a 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.470
 currency can move what they will be able to 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.750
 Remove the battery from placing a new one 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.770
 and that's all the time duration and it 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.269
 says it's a year but it's going to depend 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.390
 really the amount of notifications 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.940
 hear more than one receive no but the most 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.840
 that can erase you is going to be a year in 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.130
 the cost is 179 dollars with 95 and 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.050
 you can get it by means of 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.790
 the website with jito watch puntocom 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.400
 I'm looking at the description below 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.290
 to leave the link the synchronization has 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.790
 been simple the only thing that you 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.040
 have to do is press that this 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.530
 First set the clock when tighten 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.380
 this button for about three seconds to 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.440
 to activate then go to what comes to 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.440
 do 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.709
 and once you see that you have 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.590
 connected or click to connect or 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.030
 match one that is done that we go 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.700
 what the application does not do 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.640
 and what you do is go to 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.400
 testing there this 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.800
 we are going to make watches and they were going to wait 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.440
 you connect that connects one is going 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.569
 to be able to change some parts 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.959
 of the clock as for example what comes 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:21.280
 to be here is what they want to do 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.319
 what is this message is either mail 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.599
 electronic events what is the 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.250
 battery and calls now and also 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.930
 some commands like for example if 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.550
 you want to find your watch 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.970
 pressing the command button for a few seconds 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.729
 will start looking for your cell phone 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.259
 smart then we go to what 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.220
 comes to be the calls we're going to 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.960
 make a call for you 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.669
 can see what it is that presents us with 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.669
 lita I just received a message too 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.750
 then you can see that I was 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.570
 flashing and when you receive a message 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.070
 you will be able to visualize in what 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.680
 in doing the part of the screen 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.260
 superior there is figure the person who is 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.970
 calling then they will be able to visualize 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.530
 you who is the person who is 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.450
 calling the and if you who 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.970
 answer because they take out the cell phone 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.750
 to decline and they will have here in the 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.720
 higher also the amount of either 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:18.090
 notifications and alerts either messages 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.090
 calls but you can see here 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.180
 you can see that it appears in the 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.280
 top then that should 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.600
 do and time in case you 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.920
 be a bit lazy and do not want to see the 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.660
 analogous way but they will also have 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.560
 in the other way and in case 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.210
 want to see the amount of 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.730
 they let you notifications by 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.470
 visualize then it's pretty much what 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.510
 that you are going to be able to do more 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.910
 ahead is going to be the respective revised 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.470
 more complete then we also have to 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.550
 they will be able to control the music and in 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.500
 case they want to take a picture 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.140
 they can also enter what is the 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.150
 photography application we are going to do 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.630
 from here we go to the application of 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.580
 photography and for example we click on 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.449
 this command button 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.449
 for example 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.100
 and how we just took a picture 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.010
 we usually press here 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.320
 and then they will be able to control 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.040
 the camera will be able to control the 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.050
 music and they will be able to visualize their 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.120
 notifications were not going to have a 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.410
 who will also 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.820
 is sending messages or you have the 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.470
 person who is calling as he could see 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.150
 the number of notifications you receive 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.010
 well let's be reviewed full more 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.570
 go ahead but just now I'm 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.840
 happy and in one of the watches that 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:32.120
 I was waiting for you in the classic code 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.580
 for the design as you can see and 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.170
 also by in the classifications we go 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.460
