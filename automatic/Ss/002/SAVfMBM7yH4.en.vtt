okay<00:00:01.380> so<00:00:01.620> right<00:00:01.800> now<00:00:01.829> we're<00:00:02.100> sitting<00:00:02.250> in<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.550> BMW

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
okay so right now we're sitting in a BMW

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.950 
okay so right now we're sitting in a BMW
e46<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:04.380> we<00:00:04.680> are<00:00:04.799> using<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.520> hotel<00:00:07.790> md80<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
e46 and we are using the hotel md80 to

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.360 
e46 and we are using the hotel md80 to
the<00:00:09.960> scan<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> vehicle<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> ignition<00:00:11.250> is

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
the scan the vehicle the ignition is

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.720 
the scan the vehicle the ignition is
turned<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:13.099> what<00:00:14.099> we're<00:00:14.190> going<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.549> is

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
turned on and what we're going to do is

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.039 
turned on and what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.030> try<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.299> pick<00:00:15.719> up<00:00:15.839> some

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
we're going to try and pick up some

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.109 
we're going to try and pick up some
fault<00:00:16.320> codes<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:16.710> know<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> BMW<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.730> running<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
fault codes we know the BMW is running a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.179 
fault codes we know the BMW is running a
little<00:00:18.240> rough<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.619> we're<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:19.859> exactly<00:00:19.980> sure

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
little rough so we're not exactly sure

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.950 
little rough so we're not exactly sure
what<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> problem<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.359> code<00:00:21.689> reader

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
what the problem is but this code reader

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.450 
what the problem is but this code reader
is<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> tell<00:00:22.529> us<00:00:22.560> exactly<00:00:22.859> what<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
is going to tell us exactly what the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640 
is going to tell us exactly what the
problem<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.170> where<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.199> folders

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
problem is and where the folders

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.300 
problem is and where the folders
occurring<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.470> basically<00:00:28.800> choosing<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
occurring so just basically choosing the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.790 
occurring so just basically choosing the
vehicle<00:00:29.640> were<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.970> 3-series<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:31.380> an<00:00:31.560> 8<00:00:31.710> 46

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
vehicle were in a 3-series it's an 8 46

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.440 
vehicle were in a 3-series it's an 8 46
as<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.040> see<00:00:35.130> establishing<00:00:35.790> vehicle

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
as you can see establishing vehicle

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
as you can see establishing vehicle
communications<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.890> important<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
communications it is important of the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.990 
communications it is important of the
stage<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> ignition<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.809> turned<00:00:39.840> on

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.690 

that<00:00:45.000> way<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.739> scan<00:00:46.739> tool<00:00:46.980> can't<00:00:47.309> connect

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that way the scan tool can't connect

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.810 
that way the scan tool can't connect
with<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> vehicle<00:00:51.170> right<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.860> select<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
with the vehicle right so select the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.150 
with the vehicle right so select the
vehicle<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.430> 42<00:00:59.879> compact

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
vehicle and it is and then 42 compact

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.679 
vehicle and it is and then 42 compact
316<00:01:02.160> ti<00:01:03.710> its<00:01:05.210> European<00:01:06.210> right-hand<00:01:06.750> drive

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
316 ti its European right-hand drive

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.380 
316 ti its European right-hand drive
okay<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:11.150> right<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.880> we'll<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.240> an

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
okay to that right so we'll just do an

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:31.070 
okay to that right so we'll just do an
auto<00:01:15.540> scan

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.140 

and<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.070> doing<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.490> searching<00:01:32.910> through

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and what it's doing is searching through

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.930 
and what it's doing is searching through
all<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.920> available<00:01:34.920> modules<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
all of the available modules on the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.450 
all of the available modules on the
vehicle<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.080> showing<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.650> any<00:01:40.920> faults

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
vehicle and it's showing but any faults

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.940 
vehicle and it's showing but any faults
that<00:01:42.110> may<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.170> occurring<00:01:45.230> where<00:01:46.230> it<00:01:46.350> says<00:01:46.560> past

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that may be occurring where it says past

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700 
that may be occurring where it says past
no<00:01:47.220> fault<00:01:47.580> means<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.660> are<00:01:48.780> no<00:01:49.200> particular

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
no fault means there are no particular

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.220 
no fault means there are no particular
faults<00:01:50.070> within<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.730> module<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> vehicle

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.710 

and<00:01:55.230> as<00:01:55.440> we<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:56.940> through<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.540> modules

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
and as we as we go through the modules

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.690 
and as we as we go through the modules
you<00:01:58.230> will<00:01:58.260> see<00:01:58.650> that<00:01:58.800> there<00:01:58.950> will<00:01:59.160> be<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> fault

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you will see that there will be a fault

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:15.230 
you will see that there will be a fault
on<00:02:00.080> one<00:02:01.080> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.260> two<00:02:01.440> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.650> modules

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.540 

mmm<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.320> we<00:02:16.410> go<00:02:16.560> there<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:16.890> go<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.310> there<00:02:17.460> was

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
mmm there we go there we go so there was

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:29.250 
mmm there we go there we go so there was
a<00:02:17.580> fault<00:02:17.910> within<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.390> module

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.240 

well<00:02:30.260> give<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.680> line<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:33.500> they<00:02:33.800> go<00:02:34.040> this

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
well give you a line like they go this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.570 
well give you a line like they go this
one<00:02:34.400> here<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:34.820> there's<00:02:35.000> five<00:02:35.360> faults

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
one here you see there's five faults

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.310 
one here you see there's five faults
within<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.790> system<00:02:40.960> sometimes<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:42.110> lot<00:02:42.230> of

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
within this system sometimes a lot of

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.780 
within this system sometimes a lot of
the<00:02:42.380> faults<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.740> come<00:02:43.100> up<00:02:43.870> they<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.170> be<00:02:45.790> you

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
the faults that come up they can be you

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.790 
the faults that come up they can be you
know<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:46.940> vehicle<00:02:47.360> can<00:02:47.540> still<00:02:47.810> be<00:02:47.960> completely

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
know the vehicle can still be completely

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.970 
know the vehicle can still be completely
serviceable<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.610> perfectly<00:02:50.030> fine<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.360> drive

serviceable and perfectly fine to drive

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.280 
serviceable and perfectly fine to drive
a<00:02:51.980> lot<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:52.970> these<00:02:53.120> faults<00:02:53.570> do<00:02:53.720> occur<00:02:54.080> without

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
a lot of these faults do occur without

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.710 
a lot of these faults do occur without
anybody<00:02:54.800> even<00:02:55.700> ever<00:02:55.970> knowing<00:02:56.330> about<00:02:56.450> them

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
anybody even ever knowing about them

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.210 
anybody even ever knowing about them
because<00:02:57.020> they<00:02:57.170> are<00:02:57.290> such<00:02:57.620> small<00:02:57.980> little

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
because they are such small little

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.600 
because they are such small little
faults<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.630> know<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.930> drive<00:03:00.410> or<00:03:00.680> the

users experience is never affected and

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.340 
users experience is never affected and
it<00:03:04.610> certainly<00:03:04.790> won't<00:03:05.120> produce<00:03:05.450> any<00:03:05.840> dashboard

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
it certainly won't produce any dashboard

so<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.270> lot<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.570> times<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.960> faults<00:03:12.260> are<00:03:12.350> nothing

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
so a lot of times the faults are nothing

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:22.120 
so a lot of times the faults are nothing
to<00:03:12.770> worry<00:03:12.980> about

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.570 

I<00:03:22.190> think<00:03:22.910> see<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:23.210> a<00:03:23.270> very<00:03:23.300> thorough<00:03:24.580> check

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
I think see it's a very thorough check

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.150 
I think see it's a very thorough check
that<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.210> hotel<00:03:26.890> md80<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.340> doing<00:03:28.640> here

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
that the hotel md80 to is doing here

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.890 
that the hotel md80 to is doing here
it's<00:03:31.160> been<00:03:31.370> scanning<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:32.060> lot<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.510> modules

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
it's been scanning a lot of the modules

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.350 
it's been scanning a lot of the modules
available<00:03:33.710> and<00:03:34.250> we're<00:03:34.340> still<00:03:34.520> only<00:03:34.640> seventy

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
available and we're still only seventy

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.520 
available and we're still only seventy
eight<00:03:35.570> percent<00:03:35.600> through<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:38.440> it's<00:03:39.440> an

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
eight percent through so it's an

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.580 
eight percent through so it's an
excellent<00:03:39.830> kit<00:03:40.600> if<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.900> are<00:03:42.080> thinking<00:03:42.320> of

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
excellent kit if you are thinking of

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.970 
excellent kit if you are thinking of
getting<00:03:42.770> one<00:03:43.390> not<00:03:44.390> only<00:03:44.540> does<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.900> cover<00:03:45.140> BMW

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
getting one not only does it cover BMW

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.080 
getting one not only does it cover BMW
would<00:03:46.070> have<00:03:46.160> covers<00:03:46.430> pretty<00:03:46.610> much<00:03:46.820> any

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
would have covers pretty much any

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.830 
would have covers pretty much any

there<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.419> go<00:04:51.539> so<00:04:51.690> it's<00:04:51.840> just<00:04:51.930> basically

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
there you go so it's just basically

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.290 
there you go so it's just basically
going<00:04:52.560> through<00:04:52.919> each<00:04:53.520> system<00:04:53.970> now<00:04:54.120> there's

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
going through each system now there's

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.760 
going through each system now there's
fault<00:04:54.539> nine<00:04:54.780> faults<00:04:55.199> on<00:04:55.319> this<00:04:55.440> particular

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
fault nine faults on this particular

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.960 
fault nine faults on this particular
system<00:04:56.069> so<00:04:56.400> we're<00:04:56.550> going<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.759> go<00:04:56.789> ahead<00:04:56.849> and

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
system so we're going to go ahead and

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.149 
system so we're going to go ahead and
have<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.150> look<00:04:57.300> at<00:04:57.449> them<00:05:00.050> need<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.199> codes

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:16.189

you<00:05:16.349> can<00:05:16.470> see<00:05:16.620> on<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.800> left<00:05:16.949> hand<00:05:17.099> side<00:05:17.220> it's

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
you can see on the left hand side it's

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.399 
you can see on the left hand side it's
giving<00:05:17.849> you<00:05:17.970> like<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.150> actual<00:05:18.840> fault<00:05:19.169> code

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
giving you like the actual fault code

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:30.740 
giving you like the actual fault code
itself<00:05:26.840> when<00:05:27.840> there's<00:05:28.080> 273<00:05:29.210> so<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.330> mass<00:05:30.509> air

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
itself when there's 273 so the mass air

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.749 
itself when there's 273 so the mass air

the<00:05:51.090> faults<00:05:51.449> as<00:05:51.599> well<00:05:51.870> that's<00:05:52.289> not<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.560> problem

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
the faults as well that's not a problem

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.730 
the faults as well that's not a problem
at<00:05:53.069> all<00:05:53.690> but<00:05:54.690> it's<00:05:54.840> best<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.199> actually<00:05:55.500> look<00:05:55.620> at

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
at all but it's best to actually look at

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.700 
at all but it's best to actually look at
the<00:05:55.889> actual<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:57.780> parts<00:05:58.199> first<00:05:58.409> of<00:05:58.590> all

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
the actual the parts first of all

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.680 
the actual the parts first of all
replace<00:05:59.099> the<00:05:59.250> parts<00:05:59.580> then<00:06:00.000> clear<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.389> fault

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
replace the parts then clear the fault

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.230 
replace the parts then clear the fault
then<00:06:01.139> the<00:06:01.770> vehicle<00:06:02.159> will<00:06:02.340> run<00:06:02.520> as<00:06:02.669> normal<00:06:02.699> so

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
then the vehicle will run as normal so

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.209 
then the vehicle will run as normal so
that<00:06:03.900> is<00:06:04.050> that's<00:06:04.199> just<00:06:04.319> a<00:06:04.500> quick<00:06:04.620> scan<00:06:04.949> through

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
that is that's just a quick scan through

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.620 
that is that's just a quick scan through
on<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.610> Otel<00:06:06.289> md80<00:06:07.289> to
