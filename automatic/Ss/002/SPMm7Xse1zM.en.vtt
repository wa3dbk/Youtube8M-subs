of clothing that I went through and cut
up<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.600> did<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.640> heart<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
up and did that the heart here in the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.000 
up and did that the heart here in the
middle<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:02.480> was<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.660> some<00:01:04.470> sentimental

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
middle is was actually some sentimental

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
middle is was actually some sentimental
clothing<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.430> well<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.240> nice

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
clothing as well it was a really nice

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870 
clothing as well it was a really nice
velvety<00:01:07.049> dress<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> thought<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.729> would<00:01:08.850> be

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
velvety dress so I thought that would be

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.320 
velvety dress so I thought that would be
perfect<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:09.930> heart<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> middle

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
perfect for a little heart in the middle

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.450 
perfect for a little heart in the middle
and<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.869> see<00:01:13.100> we've<00:01:14.100> done<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.700> here

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
and as you can see we've done this here

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.679 
and as you can see we've done this here
I'll<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.640> try<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:17.970> give<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.509> bit

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
I'll just try and give you a little bit

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.420 
I'll just try and give you a little bit
close-up<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.830> quilting<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.560> did<00:01:22.830> in

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
close-up of the quilting so we did in

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.480 
close-up of the quilting so we did in
the<00:01:24.210> borders<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.189> hard<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the borders it's a little bit hard to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.080 
the borders it's a little bit hard to
see<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.439> it's<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:29.070> meant<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.640> too

Turtles<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.420> was<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.630> pillowcase

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200

side it was one of these pictures and so

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.710 
side it was one of these pictures and so
we<00:02:32.020> just<00:02:32.200> split<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.280> two<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.910> we<00:02:33.940> put<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.660> on

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
we just split it in two and we put it on

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.440 
we just split it in two and we put it on
the<00:02:34.870> back<00:02:35.050> but<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.010> interesting<00:02:36.610> thing<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.180> as

can that you can buy and with the puffy
comforters<00:02:51.489> well<00:02:51.760> that's<00:02:51.910> what<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.239> was<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.690> had

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
comforters well that's what it was I had

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.430 
comforters well that's what it was I had
to<00:02:52.959> unpick<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.500> all<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:54.570> then<00:02:55.570> cut<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:55.989> up<00:02:56.200> into

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
to unpick it all and then cut it up into

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.759 
to unpick it all and then cut it up into
pieces<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:57.070> make<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.400> fit<00:02:57.640> around<00:02:58.090> these

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
pieces to make it fit around these

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.890 
pieces to make it fit around these
pillowcases<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.239> thought<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.540> was

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
pillowcases and so I thought that was

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.039 
pillowcases and so I thought that was
that's<00:03:02.140> kind<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.680> cool<00:03:02.890> idea<00:03:02.920> too<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.480> that's

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
that's kind of a cool idea too so that's

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.990 
that's kind of a cool idea too so that's
what<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:05.320> did<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.709> it's<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.950> real<00:03:06.220> memory<00:03:06.610> quilt
