00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
make it go in fast so that if I would

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.040 
make it go in fast so that if I would
you<00:01:00.019> know<00:01:00.140> apply<00:01:00.769> it<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.309> go<00:01:01.489> like<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:02.050> it

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
wouldn't just like stay in place and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.690 
wouldn't just like stay in place and
actually<00:01:05.630> go<00:01:06.440> into<00:01:06.470> my<00:01:06.920> skin<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.430> would<00:01:07.520> just

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
actually go into my skin it would just

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.880 
actually go into my skin it would just
move<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.210> foundation<00:01:08.840> down<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.350> then<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.650> go

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
move the foundation down so then and go

move the foundation down so then and go
like<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.310> then<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:10.729> move<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.180> up<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.600> and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
like this and then I move it up and and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.959 
like this and then I move it up and and
then<00:01:12.229> I'd<00:01:12.350> go<00:01:12.500> like<00:01:12.620> this<00:01:12.800> so<00:01:12.979> I<00:01:13.250> really<00:01:13.490> didn't

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
then I'd go like this so I really didn't

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.440 
then I'd go like this so I really didn't
like<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.509> I<00:01:14.930> just<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.159> wasn't<00:01:16.579> using<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.149> for

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450

Vita Lumiere from Chanel and it's not
doesn't<00:02:46.140> cover<00:02:46.560> much<00:02:46.830> okay<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:47.970> very

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
doesn't cover much okay so it's very

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.900 
doesn't cover much okay so it's very
thin<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:49.350> not<00:02:49.530> very<00:02:49.739> thick<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.340> very<00:02:50.670> thin

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
thin it's not very thick it's very thin

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.009 
thin it's not very thick it's very thin
and<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:52.620> has<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.130> light<00:02:53.580> coverage<00:02:54.480> really<00:02:54.930> it

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
and it has like light coverage really it

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.650 
and it has like light coverage really it
doesn't<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.440> lot<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.680> coverage<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.660> this

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
doesn't have a lot of coverage and this

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.530 
doesn't have a lot of coverage and this
is<00:02:57.860> not<00:02:58.860> good<00:02:59.280> with<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.790> brush<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.420> I'll

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
is not good with this brush and I'll

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.089 
is not good with this brush and I'll
show<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.130> okay<00:03:02.130> I'll<00:03:02.790> just<00:03:03.000> take<00:03:03.299> some<00:03:04.099> with

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
show you okay I'll just take some with

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.740 
show you okay I'll just take some with
this<00:03:05.250> brush<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.970> apply<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:07.260> my<00:03:07.290> hand<00:03:10.580> okay

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
this brush and apply it to my hand okay

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.330 
this brush and apply it to my hand okay
so<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:13.380> doesn't<00:03:13.530> really<00:03:13.829> do<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.160> trick

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
so it doesn't really do the trick

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.410 
so it doesn't really do the trick
because<00:03:14.880> right<00:03:15.359> now<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:17.010> not<00:03:17.280> covering<00:03:17.910> much

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
because right now it's not covering much

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.979 
because right now it's not covering much
at<00:03:18.750> all<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.480> pushing<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.810> you

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
at all really it's just pushing it you

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.680 
at all really it's just pushing it you
probably<00:03:22.350> can't<00:03:22.680> tell<00:03:22.799> but<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.299> pushes

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
probably can't tell but it just pushes

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.000 
probably can't tell but it just pushes
the<00:03:25.019> foundation<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:27.120> brush<00:03:27.450> don't<00:03:28.380> use

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
the foundation so this brush don't use

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.309 
the foundation so this brush don't use
it<00:03:29.280> with<00:03:29.579> very<00:03:31.130> light<00:03:32.900> light<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.140> medium

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
it with very light light to medium

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.280 
it with very light light to medium
coverage<00:03:34.910> foundations<00:03:35.910> don't<00:03:36.750> use<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.170> it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
coverage foundations don't use it it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.610 
coverage foundations don't use it it
just<00:03:37.470> that's<00:03:37.920> what<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.310> does<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:40.670> use<00:03:41.670> this

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
just that's what it does so use this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.110 
just that's what it does so use this
kind<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.829> foundation<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.639> light<00:03:44.790> one<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
kind of foundation that light one the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.039 
kind of foundation that light one the
more<00:03:45.329> liquidy<00:03:45.750> one<00:03:46.019> with<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.389> lush<00:03:48.389> brush<00:03:48.720> like

more liquidy one with a lush brush like
this<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.069> use<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.549> just<00:03:50.579> use<00:03:50.940> that's

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
this and this I use I just use that's

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.830 
this and this I use I just use that's
why<00:03:51.389> it's<00:03:52.230> all<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:52.950> dirty<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.549> stuff<00:03:54.000> so

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
why it's all like dirty and stuff so

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.949 
why it's all like dirty and stuff so
this<00:03:55.319> if<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.950> go<00:03:56.130> over<00:03:56.489> my<00:03:56.519> hand<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.359> I<00:03:57.540> buff<00:03:57.780> it

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.640 
this if I go over my hand and I buff it
out<00:03:58.910> okay<00:04:00.829> then<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:02.069> just<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:03.720> blends<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.500> very

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
out okay then it just it blends in very

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.640 
out okay then it just it blends in very
well<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.970> can't<00:04:06.329> see<00:04:06.630> where<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:06.989> ends<00:04:07.290> and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
well and you can't see where it ends and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.640 
well and you can't see where it ends and
where<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.040> begins<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.269> that's<00:04:10.079> what<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.530> want

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
where it begins and that's what you want

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.890 
where it begins and that's what you want
to<00:04:10.829> achieve<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.850> don't<00:04:12.030> want<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.269> stay<00:04:12.600> two

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
to achieve you don't want to stay two

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.000 
to achieve you don't want to stay two
hours<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.940> just<00:04:14.940> push<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.959> foundation<00:04:16.739> here

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
hours and just push the foundation here

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.870 
hours and just push the foundation here
there<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.060> what<00:04:18.300> I<00:04:18.480> use<00:04:18.750> this<00:04:18.990> brush<00:04:19.580> with<00:04:20.580> the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
there so what I use this brush with the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.800 
there so what I use this brush with the
other<00:04:21.090> Foundation<00:04:21.900> which<00:04:22.140> is<00:04:22.170> in<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.810> bigger

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
other Foundation which is in this bigger

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.840 
other Foundation which is in this bigger
container<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:27.260> take<00:04:28.260> some<00:04:28.560> on<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.890> brush

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:41.990 

and<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:33.390> applied<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.140> my<00:04:34.290> hand<00:04:39.980> okay<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.670> can

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
and I applied to my hand okay and I can

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.660 
and I applied to my hand okay and I can
see<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:46.020> doesn't<00:04:46.470> push<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.920> foundation

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
see that it doesn't push the foundation

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.060 
see that it doesn't push the foundation
on<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.940> side<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.600> brush<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.080> just<00:04:49.140> ships

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
on the side of the brush and just ships

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.230 
on the side of the brush and just ships
it<00:04:50.310> over<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:51.150> actually<00:04:52.110> covers<00:04:52.760> quite<00:04:53.760> well

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
it over it actually covers quite well

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.230 
it over it actually covers quite well
and<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:55.530> when<00:04:55.980> I<00:04:56.010> was<00:04:56.250> putting<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.760> on<00:04:56.910> because

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
and so when I was putting it on because

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.230 
and so when I was putting it on because
I<00:04:57.570> had<00:04:57.810> no<00:04:57.990> other<00:04:58.200> foundation<00:04:58.610> brushes<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.970> use

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
I had no other foundation brushes to use

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.110 
I had no other foundation brushes to use
I<00:05:00.570> said<00:05:01.200> let<00:05:01.350> me<00:05:01.470> try<00:05:01.620> this<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.640> used<00:05:02.910> it

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
I said let me try this and I used it

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.730 
I said let me try this and I used it
with<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.360> Colorstay<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:03.930> wasn't<00:05:04.320> really<00:05:04.440> happy

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
with the Colorstay I wasn't really happy

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.950 
with the Colorstay I wasn't really happy
with<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.100> color<00:05:05.130> stay<00:05:05.640> either<00:05:05.940> I<00:05:06.300> didn't

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
with the color stay either I didn't

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.950 
with the color stay either I didn't
think<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.350> was<00:05:07.440> giving<00:05:07.830> giving<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.910> was<00:05:09.660> getting

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
think it was giving giving I was getting

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.500 
think it was giving giving I was getting
enough<00:05:10.140> coverage<00:05:10.470> with<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.390> know

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
enough coverage with it and you know

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.290 
enough coverage with it and you know
people<00:05:12.750> were<00:05:13.020> always<00:05:13.260> saying<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.300> videos

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
people were always saying on the videos

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.420 
people were always saying on the videos
I<00:05:15.510> was<00:05:15.660> seeing<00:05:15.930> on<00:05:16.170> YouTube<00:05:16.620> how<00:05:16.830> great<00:05:17.100> it<00:05:17.280> was

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
I was seeing on YouTube how great it was

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.840 
I was seeing on YouTube how great it was
but<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:19.050> didn't<00:05:19.740> agree<00:05:19.980> with<00:05:20.070> them<00:05:20.370> very<00:05:20.580> much

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
but I didn't agree with them very much

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.990 
but I didn't agree with them very much
but<00:05:21.120> then<00:05:21.330> by<00:05:21.930> chance<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.980> just<00:05:23.160> by<00:05:23.340> chance<00:05:23.610> I

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
but then by chance and just by chance I

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.170 
but then by chance and just by chance I
used<00:05:24.720> it<00:05:25.040> with<00:05:27.950> with<00:05:28.950> this<00:05:29.130> brush<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.790> I<00:05:29.910> think

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
used it with with this brush and I think

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.820 
used it with with this brush and I think
it's<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.540> best<00:05:31.250> brush<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.790> cover<00:05:33.830> everything

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
it's the best brush to cover everything

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.640 
it's the best brush to cover everything
and<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.430> apply<00:05:35.790> thick<00:05:36.440> foundation<00:05:37.440> because
