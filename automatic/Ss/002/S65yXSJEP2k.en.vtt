00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.200
 teaching a new seed that many 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.089
 of you asked me before 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.690

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.780
 it was super flat hyper that you ultra 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.000
 mega flat and finally the found one can 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.210
 be very much looking very much 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.060
 online has found it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.160
 spells well turn off dyes I do not know what 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.200
 you are going to see better look at the image and there 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 better or else the comments because if 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.109
 I 'm not and tijd is ok back from the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.219
 tide in English well is a seed that 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:50.129
 it's very flat it has a super large area 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.319
 of plain with a difference of 23 blocks 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.149
 as much one two two blocks you go 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.760
 to see already in the area where we came out 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.010
 that this is the area that is already out 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.469
 directly to the super flat area is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.479
 authentically great already the map looks 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.760
 because of the green color it has 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.229
 characteristic of the plains that is 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.759
 flat look I'm looking at all the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620
 sites and the only mountain I see is 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.720
 the one that was 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.010
 I will go to the area of the sun has 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.890
 vegetation has the va has water has 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:24.390
 sand has coal surface stone 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.260
 superficial has also good already you see 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.070
 there are new small trees have 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:35.100
 topics that more than more cactus has cane 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.870
 for finding absolutely everything in 5 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 minutes that I was looking at it did not make me 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.650
 missing see more to see to verify 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 I was thinking there was a mine 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.550
 no but there are also mines we find the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.530
 mine you are going to see right now the truth 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.770
 which as you can see is the characteristic green 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.360
 that you see in the on the map is very typical 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.610
 when that area is flat there is 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.740
 stones we will see it then look over here 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.690
 below you see water also below 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.460
 the earth that's pretty good for not 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.320
 have to get far away from the area 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.119
 to look for the look and you're going to see a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.580
 Cactus on the right hand but facing 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.649
 right now so I would have to 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.479
 be good to make green wool and dye 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.030
 green 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.190
 the truth that I liked a lot 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.810
 because the unevenness that has that extreme 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.540
 it varies very little now I'm going 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.519
 for the area down to where I was born and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.400
 you see he has that little hill and that 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.500
 It is a small mountain and has a cave 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.170
 but good from that hill now when 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.390
 climb again all to the north you go to 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.940
 see the distance there is until 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.239
 a mountain reappears the truth 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.099
 which is great because flatten had to 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.459
 flatten the justito just had to 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.930
 level more than flatten and that's what 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.000
 I liked I like very much look 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.180
 part for area from there to the area of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.040
 bottom there are snowy mountains good to go 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.129
 the flat area but to go to the bottom there is 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.379
 pretty high mountains that are snowfall 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.959
 and that's also good because in case of 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.340
 that you open a zone to build 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.049
 only to build as is the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.819
 flat that is usually used mostly 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.019
 to build, then you can go to a 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.940
 mountain area to do some kind 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.109
 of construction at height or for 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.090
 even make a waterfall of water and a 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.230
 water slide what you want to look at I'm going 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.090
 to go to zone here because if I do not 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.140
 mistake on the map gave me the impression 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.660
 what good part 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.710
 animals there you have the cane also that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.170
 means that at the moment it has 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.880
 found everything and good if I do not 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.340
 I 'm wrong with via sand what happens 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.660
 I do not know if the recording is anchored because 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.340
 then it was another round by the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.290
 mass at the bottom but I did not want to stretch 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.000
 a lot this video because the seeds me 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.860
 I know that if they look at each other for a long time 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.080
 time bored because it 's so much better than 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.450
 with the name you go to at 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.610
 world builder you live it in 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.140
 your console because to be the best 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.970
 way to explore yet so here I am going 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.550
 You see we bring it blocks their 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.940
 boyfriend this area of ​​what I say that is 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.580
 stone was in the area of ​​also 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.900
 clay and what he told you he has 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.970
 a lot of things the truth I do not want 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.250
 to tire a euro and no more I'm going to do here 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.739
 a minute since I have in print 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.810
 that around here a lava area does not pass 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.670
 the same is not where it is but good 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.070
 I think it's around here I'm going to find 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.019
 now mismito and that he wanted that the life 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.519
 It is also the map in what area it is because 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.100
 also if you want to come here it's a 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.079
 good good place to take the go apart 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.880
 is the rod wash your forgiveness wise me 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.320
 Lock the tongue the lava is still 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.010
 it means that you can catch all 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.550
 all the juices of each of the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.040
 that's very good because it gives a lot 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.420
 non-Slavic game that is so continuous 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.180
 because you could only take it from the 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.920
 base and as you see the truth this seed 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.010
 it's fantastic it's great you wanted a 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.450
 flat is super hyper black ultra flat 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.520
 you just have to pave a little bit already 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.560
 you see that everything that you see - that area of 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.890
 there the rest is all plane from where 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.720
