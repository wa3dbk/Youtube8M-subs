so<00:00:08.000> having<00:00:08.420> left<00:00:08.780> the<00:00:09.349> kitchen<00:00:09.700> the<00:00:10.700> Cold<00:00:11.120> War

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:11.549 
so having left the kitchen the Cold War

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.119 
so having left the kitchen the Cold War
goes<00:00:12.089> in<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.539> case<00:00:12.839> I<00:00:13.200> mean<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.860> some

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:14.129 
goes in this case I mean in some

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.070 
goes in this case I mean in some
properties<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.789> goes<00:00:14.940> under<00:00:15.209> the<00:00:15.330> floor<00:00:15.539> but

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
properties it goes under the floor but

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.230 
properties it goes under the floor but
in<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.770> case<00:00:17.009> it<00:00:17.250> goes<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.609> into<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.060> ceiling

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
in this case it goes up into the ceiling

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.870 
in this case it goes up into the ceiling
space<00:00:18.660> runs<00:00:19.439> across<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.949> ceiling<00:00:20.340> space<00:00:20.610> and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
space runs across the ceiling space and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.550 
space runs across the ceiling space and
down<00:00:21.919> into<00:00:23.419> this<00:00:24.419> pipe<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:24.989> this<00:00:25.199> one's<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
down into this pipe here this one's the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.589 
down into this pipe here this one's the
hot<00:00:25.739> coming<00:00:25.980> from<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> tap<00:00:26.520> but<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
hot coming from the tap but this is the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.420 
hot coming from the tap but this is the
cold<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.169> has<00:00:28.290> come<00:00:28.529> from<00:00:28.739> the<00:00:28.950> kitchen<00:00:29.340> from

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
cold that has come from the kitchen from

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.650 
cold that has come from the kitchen from
the<00:00:29.520> rising<00:00:29.969> way<00:00:30.149> down<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.700> another<00:00:32.700> isolation

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the rising way down to another isolation

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.150 
the rising way down to another isolation
valve<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.129> just

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
valve and you can see in this is just

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.440 
valve and you can see in this is just
how<00:00:35.670> easy<00:00:35.700> these<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.719> operate<00:00:38.030> you<00:00:39.030> simply

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
how easy these are to operate you simply

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.120 
how easy these are to operate you simply
turn<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.930> once<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.949> quarter<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.520> turn<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
turn it once the quarter of a turn and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.340 
turn it once the quarter of a turn and
once<00:00:44.130> it's<00:00:44.370> running<00:00:44.700> across<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> pipe<00:00:45.390> in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
once it's running across the pipe in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410 
once it's running across the pipe in
that<00:00:46.680> direction<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.370> 90<00:00:47.700> degrees<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.150> pipe

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that direction at 90 degrees to the pipe

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
that direction at 90 degrees to the pipe
you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.890> off<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:51.090> turn<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you can see that it's off and to turn it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.319 
you can see that it's off and to turn it
on<00:00:51.510> again<00:00:51.860> you<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.130> turn<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
on again you just turn it so it's in the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
on again you just turn it so it's in the
line<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.410> pipes<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.950> waters<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
line with the pipes of the waters just

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.150 
line with the pipes of the waters just
running<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:57.239> okay<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> cold

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
running up and down okay so the cold

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
running up and down okay so the cold
waters<00:00:59.550> come<00:00:59.910> down<00:01:00.180> there's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> tea<00:01:00.750> piece

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
waters come down there's a tea piece

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.369 
waters come down there's a tea piece
here<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.610> salty<00:01:02.610> piece<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.450> feeds<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> cold

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
here a salty piece which feeds the cold

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.760 
here a salty piece which feeds the cold
water<00:01:05.009> supply<00:01:05.579> to<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.180> Han<00:01:06.509> basin<00:01:07.079> and<00:01:07.259> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
water supply to the Han basin and you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.010 
water supply to the Han basin and you
can<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.460> turn<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
can see as I turn that on but that is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
can see as I turn that on but that is
quite<00:01:10.409> obviously<00:01:10.860> still<00:01:11.159> under<00:01:11.430> minus

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
quite obviously still under minus

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.919 
quite obviously still under minus
pressure<00:01:12.030> okay<00:01:13.579> so<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.790> cold<00:01:15.030> supply<00:01:15.420> has<00:01:15.689> fed

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
pressure okay so the cold supply has fed

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.980 
pressure okay so the cold supply has fed
the<00:01:16.590> cold<00:01:16.859> water<00:01:17.100> tap<00:01:17.810> through<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the cold water tap through the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.699 
the cold water tap through the
t-junction

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709 
t-junction

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:24.559 
t-junction
and<00:01:19.889> it<00:01:20.459> continues<00:01:20.999> down<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:23.179> this<00:01:24.179> little

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
and it continues down to this little

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.769 
and it continues down to this little
valve<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.079> and<00:01:25.369> which<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.579> tap<00:01:27.209> insert

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:27.779 
valve here and which is a tap insert

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.199 
valve here and which is a tap insert
inserted<00:01:28.200> inserted<00:01:29.039> into<00:01:29.279> the<00:01:29.369> pipe<00:01:29.579> which

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
inserted inserted into the pipe which

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.109 
inserted inserted into the pipe which
can<00:01:30.450> feed<00:01:30.889> another<00:01:31.889> outside<00:01:32.429> tap<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.969> other

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
can feed another outside tap the other

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
can feed another outside tap the other
outside<00:01:33.600> tap<00:01:33.840> operates<00:01:34.289> exactly<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.859> the<00:01:34.950> same

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
outside tap operates exactly on the same

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.459 
outside tap operates exactly on the same
principle<00:01:35.609> as<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.719> one<00:01:36.869> you'll<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.350> our

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
principle as the one you'll see in our

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.370 
principle as the one you'll see in our
installing<00:01:38.219> an<00:01:38.310> outside<00:01:38.670> tap<00:01:38.939> video<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
installing an outside tap video so this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.940 
installing an outside tap video so this
valve<00:01:40.709> is<00:01:41.959> closed<00:01:42.959> during<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.499> winter<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
valve is closed during the winter and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.819 
valve is closed during the winter and
the<00:01:44.069> tap<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.909> open<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.509> stop<00:01:45.719> it<00:01:45.869> freezing<00:01:46.289> so

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
the tap is open to stop it freezing so

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
the tap is open to stop it freezing so
this<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.490> isolate<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.509> outside<00:01:48.719> tap

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
this can isolate the the outside tap

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.719 
this can isolate the the outside tap
which<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.709> instance<00:01:49.770> runs<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.579> back

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
which in this instance runs on the back

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.059 
which in this instance runs on the back
of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.969> property<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:52.109> water<00:01:52.319> carries<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.950> its

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
of the property the water carries on its

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.499 
of the property the water carries on its
journey<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.639> as<00:01:53.789> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.240> from<00:01:54.419> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
journey then as you can see from the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.419 
journey then as you can see from the
pipe<00:01:54.689> that's<00:01:54.929> clipped<00:01:55.169> to<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.499> the<00:01:56.099> skirting

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
pipe that's clipped to the the skirting

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.620 
pipe that's clipped to the the skirting
board<00:01:57.349> it's<00:01:58.349> entirely<00:01:59.340> necessary<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.359> clip

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
board it's entirely necessary to clip

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.599 
board it's entirely necessary to clip
these<00:02:00.840> pipes<00:02:01.229> about<00:02:01.619> every<00:02:01.919> four<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.369> five

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
these pipes about every four to five

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.909 
these pipes about every four to five
hundred<00:02:02.639> millimetres<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:04.109> stop<00:02:04.380> any<00:02:04.590> rattle

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:04.919 
hundred millimetres to stop any rattle

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:06.889 
hundred millimetres to stop any rattle
within<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> pipe<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.179> sometimes<00:02:06.659> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
within the pipe because sometimes that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.550 
within the pipe because sometimes that
as<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.649> turn<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.889> tap<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.989> judder<00:02:10.289> of
