next<00:04:10.069> time<00:04:10.370> in<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.730> mod<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.660> can<00:04:11.720> actually

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
next time in the mod you can actually

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.940 
next time in the mod you can actually
add<00:04:12.350> like<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.880> zipline<00:04:13.880> that<00:04:14.600> makes<00:04:15.319> you<00:04:15.620> fly

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
and that they'll actually add another

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:28.600 
and that they'll actually add another
crows<00:04:20.570> nests<00:04:22.480> so<00:04:23.480> yeah<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:26.810> wish<00:04:27.160> since<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
crows nests so yeah and I wish since the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.930 
crows nests so yeah and I wish since the
mod<00:04:28.940> it's<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.870> mod<00:04:30.160> instead<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.190> using<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.700> ladder

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
mod it's a mod instead of using a ladder

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.159 
mod it's a mod instead of using a ladder
it<00:04:32.390> could<00:04:32.900> have<00:04:32.990> use<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.380> zip<00:04:34.010> line<00:04:34.250> off

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
it could have use that zip line off

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.540 
it could have use that zip line off
again<00:04:36.169> just<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.950> zip<00:04:37.790> line<00:04:38.000> mod<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.770> or<00:04:39.770> they
