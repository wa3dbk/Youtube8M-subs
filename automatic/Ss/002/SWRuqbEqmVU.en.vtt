00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.360
 today I come to 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.640
 to teach some enamels that good what 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.360
 does teach 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:23.020
 nothing yesterday or before yesterday in a video 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.290
 that the web of machinery asked for and 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.660
 I happened to try them to see if by 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.500
 coincidence worked for the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.650
 prints 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.660
 and water has not been my surprise that yes 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.900
 do they work 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.690
 also how a little girl does 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.020
 from here of youtube marinova rose a 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.300
 video showing Kiko's enamels 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.910
 the mirror collection that worked 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.489
 also very well to stamp the only 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.610
 that those enamels had as a 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.390
 finished satin and good the problem 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.400
 is that they were collectible and he was good 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.300
 very difficult to find the collection 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.960
 whole or even some color then 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:13.009
 good as this also works and that 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.440
 so there are fixed line colors that 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.860
 that are always there, it has occurred to me 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.110
 show them also if you like 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.470
 how you can have an option 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.630
 cheaper than conan and more to the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.520
 hand that perhaps to those of kiko so that 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 are from a collection that has already passed and 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.740
 that will no longer be available 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.220
 Then I'll show you how 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.220
 is 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.939
 you see stamped to perfection is not 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.790
 no problem to stamp these 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.620
 enamels is also true that those who 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.200
 I have tried are all that do not have 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.620
 glitter or satin that are let's say the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.390
 smooth color now I will try to see how 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.890
 they work on the ebay plates that 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.799
 many girls who ask me if 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.959
 the ebay boards also work the 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.010
 enamels well then well let's 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.010
 try on one of ebay 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.140
 good girls, as you see in the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:35.850
 ebay plates and on the chicken plates 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.850
 they work perfectly they go great 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.889
 I'm taking some time to buy some 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.889
 another color if you take why 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:54.259
 these discoveries are very good for 

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:58.619
 one side but very bad for another and good 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:01.499
 I hope you liked it to serve you 

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:03.839
 and if you try it, tell me what 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:05.520
 such have you gone see you in the next 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.270
 video 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.270
 goodbye
