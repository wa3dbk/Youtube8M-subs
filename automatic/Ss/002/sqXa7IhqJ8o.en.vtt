this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.420> that<00:00:00.630> tracer<00:00:01.199> when<00:00:01.439> you're<00:00:01.530> gonna

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
this is that tracer when you're gonna

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.290 
this is that tracer when you're gonna
get<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:02.190> know<00:00:02.370> more<00:00:02.520> Marlin<00:00:02.939> this<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.210> the

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
get to know more Marlin this is the

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:13.100 
get to know more Marlin this is the
front<00:00:03.540> one<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.870> tracer<00:00:04.200> sets<00:00:11.929> and<00:00:12.929> then

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
front one of the tracer sets and then

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:27.849 
front one of the tracer sets and then
you<00:00:13.440> attach<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:14.599> one<00:00:15.599> sit<00:00:15.780> through<00:00:16.020> very<00:00:17.010> long

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.560 

then<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.130> wrap<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.490> around<00:00:29.760> not<00:00:30.330> too

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
then you just wrap it around not too

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:47.850 
then you just wrap it around not too
many<00:00:30.779> layers<00:00:31.080> otherwise<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.650> gets<00:00:31.740> too<00:00:31.859> thick

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.209 

okay

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
okay

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.189 
okay
the<00:00:49.910> first<00:00:50.149> part<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.600> hardest<00:00:50.899> part<00:00:51.079> you

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
the first part of the hardest part you

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.290 
the first part of the hardest part you
just<00:00:51.350> gotta<00:00:51.500> feed<00:00:51.739> it<00:00:51.859> through<00:00:52.089> that<00:00:53.089> it'll

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
just gotta feed it through that it'll

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.569 
just gotta feed it through that it'll
hold<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.750> line<00:00:54.530> feed<00:00:54.829> and<00:00:55.010> once<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:55.370> passed

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
hold the line feed and once it's passed

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:04.139 
hold the line feed and once it's passed
there<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:55.879> goes<00:00:56.089> through<00:00:56.390> very<00:00:56.629> easy<00:00:57.309> okay

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.530 

there<00:01:05.149> it<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:06.310> perfectly<00:01:07.310> done<00:01:07.610> still

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
there it is perfectly done still

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.219 
there it is perfectly done still
together<00:01:08.750> all<00:01:09.500> sorted<00:01:10.450> I'd<00:01:11.450> say<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.780> best<00:01:11.960> not

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
together all sorted I'd say the best not

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.600 
together all sorted I'd say the best not
to<00:01:12.380> use<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:12.770> boy<00:01:12.979> I'll<00:01:13.159> show<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.399> is<00:01:13.490> the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
to use and boy I'll show you is the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.460 
to use and boy I'll show you is the
figure<00:01:13.909> eight<00:01:14.060> there's<00:01:14.690> no<00:01:14.960> chance<00:01:15.229> of<00:01:15.380> it

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
figure eight there's no chance of it

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.620 
figure eight there's no chance of it
ever<00:01:15.649> pulling<00:01:15.950> through<00:01:16.159> very<00:01:16.700> easy<00:01:16.940> be<00:01:17.210> undone

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
ever pulling through very easy be undone

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:27.910 
ever pulling through very easy be undone
afterwards<00:01:24.819> it's<00:01:25.819> just<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.090> figure<00:01:26.300> eight<00:01:26.920> turn

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
afterwards it's just a figure eight turn

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.550 
afterwards it's just a figure eight turn
as<00:01:28.069> hard<00:01:28.310> as<00:01:28.399> you<00:01:28.490> can<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.060> there's<00:01:29.240> no<00:01:29.560> stretch

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
as hard as you can so there's no stretch

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.100 
as hard as you can so there's no stretch
and<00:01:31.550> now<00:01:31.700> we're<00:01:31.880> ready<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.630> do<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.810> front

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
and now we're ready to do the front

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.010 
and now we're ready to do the front

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
never kind of too short to live a little

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.870 
never kind of too short to live a little
bit<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.800> then<00:01:37.490> things<00:01:37.700> there<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:42.880> okay

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880

up<00:02:33.760> you'll<00:02:34.760> see<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.209> nearly<00:02:35.390> let<00:02:36.019> it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
up you'll see that it's nearly let it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.570 
up you'll see that it's nearly let it
down<00:02:37.150> leave<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.180> down<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:39.410> also<00:02:39.709> straight<00:02:40.400> in

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
down leave it down it also straight in
