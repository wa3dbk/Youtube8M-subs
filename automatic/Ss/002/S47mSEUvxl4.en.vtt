00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.700
 we already knew the peak wolf 125 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.480
 a small roadster Sporty and 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.240
 tight price 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.180
 now this machine is available in version 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.890
 250 cubic cm is already distributed in 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.620
 various countries of europe and with the return 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.120
 of category 250 in France it is 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.400
 could well that the French importer 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.850
 decide to bring in this machine for 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.850
 our market 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 2 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.089
 visually this machine takes over the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.440
 general style of the 125 with small 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.750
 differences like these side scoops 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.180
 more generous who conceals a 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.280
 radiator and an expansion tank we 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.110
 also find a motor shoe a 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.149
 stainless steel exhaust line and bigger 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.570
 brake front braking is now 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.810
 entrusted to a disc of 288 mm pinched by 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.280
 a radial piston 4-piston caliper 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.259
 while at the back the tomb made 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.360
 place to a disc pinched by a stirrup at 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.670
 simple piston a system perfectly 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.710
 measurable and above all more powerful in 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.940
 adequacy with power go from 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.100
 11 to 25 horses 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.590
 indeed this hymn now embodies a 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.300
 modern engine so a single cylinder to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.550
 liquid cooling and 4 valves 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.770
 fueled by injection that allows it 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.700
 a top speed of 135 km / h 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.800
 On the plate 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.080
 last specificity of this wolf top 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.090
 250 the front brake lever is 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.860
 now adjustable while we 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.140
 find the presentation that we 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.270
 know about the 125 with 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.219
 commodos to Japanese standards a call 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.380
 from headlights to index the dashboard 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.180
 complete digital and a plug of 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.640
 hinged tank question 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.130
 ergonomics we find the position of 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.079
 typical driving of the 125 namely the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.789
 knees to has folded a little bit 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.679
 of support on the wrists so a 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.329
 rather sporty position and if one 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.079
 appreciated the rigor of the fork on 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.390
 big braking 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.010
 we regret, however, the flexibility of 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.579
 the rear shock in driving 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.100
 athletic 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.810
 that said it induces a good comfort for 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.269
 the driver at least because the passenger seat 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.040
 remains measured in the city we appreciate the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.390
 motor flexibility and the agility of the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.940
 machine despite a turning radius 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 means and if the narrowness of the handlebars makes 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.090
 the direction a heavy hair 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.160
 this facilitates however the reassemblies 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.200
 queues on fast lanes the occasions 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.150
 of satisfaction and if ventured the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.280
 pace is accelerating we take advantage of a box 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.380
 is gentle and accurate and a behavior 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.299
 overall very simple indeed 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.549
 pneumatic ride offers a good feeling 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.019
 the framework is sufficiently rigorous 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.390
 will only observe some vibrations 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.010
 in the wrists the feet rest and 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.560
 the mirrors at high speed 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.620
 without revolutionizing the sim category we 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.780
 offers there a well finished modern bike and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.909
 seriously built a little 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.130
 Roadster with an assertive and rewarding look 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.640
 which represents an alternative interest 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.350
 on the segment a small roadster look 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.250
 valuing and affirming that they 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.250
 present as a business
