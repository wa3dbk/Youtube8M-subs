00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.030
 This is a valve plug expansion 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.890
 cistern 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.620
 decisive noggin appear high 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.410
 pressure and this pressure puts pressure on the valve 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.179
 and under a certain pressure is needed and 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.359
 starts to shrink and opens this 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.180
 valve and that this spring was 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.580
 adjustable I made a fixture 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.580
 can someone come in handy who makes them 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.489
 Here is such a traffic jam 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.440
 and this is god 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.960
 there is a place well of course you can and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 hands twist action with so under 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.100
 screwdriver if you turn down the spring 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.260
 starts to shrink and pressure becomes 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.230
 in the decisive kick more 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 if you twist the spring becomes 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.379
 weaker and the valve opens under 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.350
 slight pressure i.e. pressure 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.470
 will be small so how to do it 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:10.100
 I 'll tell you 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:14.689
 I took this one coin here and 1 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.689
 plumbing plug here such here 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.030
 coins from there quietly enters but everything 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.180
 Equally, I had to grind the edges 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.150
 so that it is generally weakly free there was 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:34.290
 in this place further here did 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.340
 hole and plastic well pulled out and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.090
 I put aside that there's this here 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 pen 19 or 20 shorter on top 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.970
 put in the middle and cut this 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.970
 plastics on further took 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.729
 strongly pressed and screwed thread can 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.630
 spun completely back into the coins 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.979
 in the middle I 'll try a little hole 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.979
 now disassemble and show you 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:35.599
 and I also had a nut 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:37.459
 cut here from this old tap then 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:43.560
 pulling out 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:47.430
 adapt well here's the coin 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:53.030
 there is this here is such a coin 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:56.340
 she's a coin turned and this cosmos on 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.879
 Here is such a visit from vipka was inside 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.329
 especially for springs and spring there 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.959
 was set and she stayed 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.549
 since I'm here and so cut a circle and 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.909
 I have this space left with 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.909
 skirt 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.859
 but here it is like this 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.790
 so this is this secured for reliability 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:37.010
 and now I will collect take take 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.620
 the coin is needed but on the coin 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.140
 the hole is not in the middle but it turned out 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.300
 when turned she goes back and forth and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.440
 can install this hole with that 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:53.660
 the holes that is, I'll put this one 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.980
 plastic well I stack that is if 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:02.180
 cover put there inside this 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.830
 the cap will be in the level that is here 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.870
 free man holds that is if 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.650
 so here to do that there are problems 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:17.530
 no, that is, there is a place and sets 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.530
 if everything is set and now snap 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.840
 you see see and the hole is a curve 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:32.260
 not centered now i will 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:32.260
 set and tighten 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.990
 all spun 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:50.300
 left to bring the roof bedtime barrel 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:55.760
 tighten to give compressor pressure and 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:59.690
 set the desired pressure on the spring 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.690
 what you need 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.730
 if the spring is rotten but he put 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.960
 you can safely trade 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.960
 all while someone can come in handy
