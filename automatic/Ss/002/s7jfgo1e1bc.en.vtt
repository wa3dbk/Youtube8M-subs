default class number 1 this is when

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120 
default class number 1 this is when
there's<00:01:06.210> more<00:01:06.900> than<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.260> infected<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.070> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
to get by throwing knives makes it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.039 
to get by throwing knives makes it
easier<00:01:30.540> makes<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:32.420> if<00:01:33.420> i<00:01:33.570> find<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> makes

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
easier makes it more if i find it makes

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.710 
easier makes it more if i find it makes
it<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> bit<00:01:34.439> more<00:01:34.590> fun<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.329> what<00:01:36.329> when<00:01:36.570> you're

infected<00:01:36.990> make<00:01:37.290> some<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.560> fun<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.920> when

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
infected make some more fun but when

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.609 
infected make some more fun but when
your<00:01:38.250> survivor<00:01:38.549> no<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> can't<00:01:40.110> camp<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> have

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
