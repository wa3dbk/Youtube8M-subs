00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
okay sir um this is using an ITF

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.140 
okay sir um this is using an ITF
mechanism<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.540> I'll<00:01:44.540> take<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:44.930> cover<00:01:45.170> off

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
mechanism so I'll take this cover off

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.180 
mechanism so I'll take this cover off
this<00:01:47.150> piece<00:01:47.479> here<00:01:47.780> will<00:01:48.320> lock<00:01:48.590> into<00:01:48.979> that

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
this piece here will lock into that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.670 
this piece here will lock into that
groove<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.300> blade<00:01:50.570> can't<00:01:51.229> come<00:01:51.500> out

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
groove so that the blade can't come out

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.100 
groove so that the blade can't come out
when<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.010> shot<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.760> that<00:01:53.390> piece<00:01:53.660> here<00:01:53.900> will

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
lock into the back there so that the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.700 
lock into the back there so that the
blade<00:01:56.300> locks<00:01:56.630> out<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.140> can't<00:01:57.350> come<00:01:57.560> back

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
blade locks out and it can't come back

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
all right now it's a lot and the blade

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.069 
all right now it's a lot and the blade
can't<00:03:01.220> come<00:03:01.400> back<00:03:01.610> in<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:04.209> that's<00:03:05.209> how<00:03:06.049> it

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
can't come back in and so that's how it

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.160 
can't come back in and so that's how it
works<00:03:06.290> pretty<00:03:06.650> much<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.459> close<00:03:07.850> it

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
works pretty much and then to close it

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.590 
works pretty much and then to close it

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
you push this one up it'll pull up the
