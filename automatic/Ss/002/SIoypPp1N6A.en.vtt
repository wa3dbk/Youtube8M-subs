place it on top with the seal and put
the<00:02:15.580> cover<00:02:15.790> back<00:02:15.879> on<00:02:16.060> top<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:20.549> obviously

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
the cover back on top of it obviously

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.580 
the cover back on top of it obviously
want<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> make<00:02:22.150> sure<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.629> holes<00:02:22.900> for<00:02:23.560> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
want to make sure that the holes for the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.789 
want to make sure that the holes for the
cover<00:02:23.920> are<00:02:24.280> lined<00:02:25.000> up<00:02:25.209> with<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:25.989> holes<00:02:26.349> in<00:02:26.560> the

cover are lined up with the holes in the
housing<00:02:29.459> like<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.700> now<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.989> tricky

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
housing like so now this is the tricky

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.320 
housing like so now this is the tricky
part<00:02:32.640> because<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.730> want<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:33.940> get<00:02:34.030> these<00:02:34.180> in

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
part because you want to get these in

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.680 
part because you want to get these in
there<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.730> we<00:02:36.730> would<00:02:36.879> suggest<00:02:37.060> doing<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.660> just

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
there and we would suggest doing is just

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.380 
there and we would suggest doing is just
put<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> few<00:02:38.310> turns<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.489> each<00:02:39.640> one<00:02:39.879> maybe

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
put a few turns on each one maybe

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.520 
put a few turns on each one maybe
started<00:02:40.720> opposite<00:02:41.170> ends

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.720 

now<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.680> all<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.890> screws<00:02:49.190> are<00:02:49.370> into<00:02:49.610> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
now that all the screws are into the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.070 
now that all the screws are into the
