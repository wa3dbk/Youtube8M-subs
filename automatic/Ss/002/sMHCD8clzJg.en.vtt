number<00:01:01.170> 26<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.309> jump<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.670> route

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
number 26 is going to jump this route

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.179 
number 26 is going to jump this route
the<00:01:03.600> same<00:01:03.899> thing<00:01:04.170> happens<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.710> batting

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the same thing happens in batting

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
the same thing happens in batting
because<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> computer<00:01:06.930> has<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> create<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
because the computer has to create the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.670 
because the computer has to create the
illusion<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.760> they're<00:01:08.970> playing<00:01:09.180> smarter<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
illusion that they're playing smarter it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
illusion that they're playing smarter it
doesn't<00:01:11.010> matter<00:01:11.189> who<00:01:11.490> he<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.729> that's<00:01:12.240> right

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
doesn't matter who he is that's right

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
doesn't matter who he is that's right
here<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.740> route<00:01:14.040> gets<00:01:14.310> jumped<00:01:14.760> no<00:01:14.850> matter

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
here this route gets jumped no matter

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.130 
here this route gets jumped no matter
what<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> doesn't<00:01:15.600> matter<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:15.960> there's<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
what it doesn't matter if there's a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.719 
what it doesn't matter if there's a
defensive<00:01:16.619> tackle<00:01:16.799> right<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> defense

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
defensive tackle right here the defense

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.200 
defensive tackle right here the defense
attacker<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.270> jump<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.689> route<00:01:18.960> now<00:01:20.210> onto

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
attacker would jump this route now onto

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.109 
attacker would jump this route now onto
a<00:01:21.479> bigger<00:01:21.869> issue<00:01:22.049> number<00:01:22.920> 13<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.970> wide

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
a bigger issue number 13 the wide

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
a bigger issue number 13 the wide
receiver<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> pass

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
receiver is going to go out for the pass

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.480 
receiver is going to go out for the pass
also<00:01:26.400> he's<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> jump<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:28.220> right<00:01:29.220> here

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
also he's going to jump up right here

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.260 
also he's going to jump up right here
now<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.619> computer<00:01:32.159> has<00:01:32.430> an<00:01:32.670> advantage<00:01:32.970> over

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
now the computer has an advantage over

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.929 
now the computer has an advantage over
you<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.439> two<00:01:34.619> animations<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.520> year<00:01:35.700> 1

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
you they get two animations to year 1

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.499 
you they get two animations to year 1
which<00:01:36.600> means<00:01:36.810> number<00:01:37.439> 5<00:01:37.880> misses<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.000> cake<00:01:39.299> as

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
which means number 5 misses this cake as

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.780 
which means number 5 misses this cake as
he<00:01:39.720> clearly<00:01:39.990> does<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:41.070> gets<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> complete<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
he clearly does he gets to complete a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.569 
he clearly does he gets to complete a
second<00:01:42.210> animation<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.960> midair<00:01:43.439> which<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
second animation in midair which is this

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.510 
second animation in midair which is this
he<00:01:45.060> gets<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> break<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.259> law<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.799> gravity<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
he gets to break the law of gravity and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.649 
he gets to break the law of gravity and
physics<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:50.189> doing<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
physics and doing this because this is

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.660 
physics and doing this because this is
what<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:51.990> asking<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.189> doesn't<00:01:53.369> matter

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
what I'm asking for it doesn't matter

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.209 
what I'm asking for it doesn't matter
who's<00:01:53.970> standing<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:54.990> jumping<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.619> front

what we're asking for

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.780 
what we're asking for
and<00:02:18.249> this<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.579> why<00:02:18.730> morphing<00:02:19.569> warping

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and this is why morphing warping

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.220 
and this is why morphing warping
teleporting<00:02:21.790> holding<00:02:22.120> cells<00:02:22.389> this<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:22.930> why

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
teleporting holding cells this is why

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.020 
teleporting holding cells this is why
has<00:02:23.349> been<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.739> game<00:02:23.980> for<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.459> many<00:02:24.609> years

has been in the game for so many years

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.809 
has been in the game for so many years
because<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.569> emulates<00:02:25.959> better<00:02:26.769> gameplay<00:02:27.129> how

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
because it emulates better gameplay how

because it emulates better gameplay how
else<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.299> they<00:02:28.450> make<00:02:28.659> number<00:02:28.989> five<00:02:29.230> play

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
else can they make number five play

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.789 
else can they make number five play
better<00:02:29.859> if<00:02:30.310> he<00:02:30.489> misses<00:02:30.700> this<00:02:30.849> pick<00:02:31.560> how<00:02:32.560> else

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
better if he misses this pick how else

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.679 
better if he misses this pick how else
can<00:02:32.980> they<00:02:33.129> make<00:02:33.340> him<00:02:33.609> appear<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.299> be<00:02:34.420> playing

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
can they make him appear to be playing

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.720 
can they make him appear to be playing
better<00:02:34.930> without<00:02:35.620> stopping<00:02:36.250> him<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.519> midair

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
better without stopping him in midair

better without stopping him in midair
and<00:02:37.180> turning<00:02:37.629> like<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:37.980> because

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
and turning like this because

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.970 
and turning like this because
realistically<00:02:40.389> if<00:02:40.599> he<00:02:40.750> misses<00:02:41.019> he<00:02:41.769> goes

realistically if he misses he goes

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.619 
realistically if he misses he goes
flying<00:02:42.189> towards<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> sideline

of the skill level it would easily
determine<00:02:57.250> who<00:02:57.609> is<00:02:57.760> good<00:02:57.969> at<00:02:58.120> these<00:02:58.269> games<00:02:58.629> who
