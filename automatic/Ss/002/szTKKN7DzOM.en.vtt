00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
so getting into it today this was pretty

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.440 
so getting into it today this was pretty
much<00:04:43.950> Germany<00:04:44.950> all<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.550> way<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:46.180> Dutch

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
much Germany all the way the Dutch

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.740 
much Germany all the way the Dutch
defense<00:04:47.080> was<00:04:47.530> horrid<00:04:48.190> worse<00:04:48.940> than<00:04:49.240> Portugal's

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750

Dutch<00:04:50.290> defense<00:04:50.830> was<00:04:51.070> horrid<00:04:52.680> terrible<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:53.860> I

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
Dutch defense was horrid terrible and I

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.750 
Dutch defense was horrid terrible and I
blame<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.360> for<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.720> reason<00:04:56.140> why<00:04:56.290> they<00:04:56.500> lost

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760

score on a nice goal of his all foot but

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.710 
score on a nice goal of his all foot but
that<00:05:38.680> doesn't<00:05:39.010> make<00:05:39.130> up<00:05:39.550> for<00:05:39.580> all<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:39.970> chances

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
that doesn't make up for all the chances

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.260 
that doesn't make up for all the chances
he<00:05:40.780> missed<00:05:41.200> that<00:05:41.590> could<00:05:42.040> have<00:05:42.130> put<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.970> Dutch

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270
