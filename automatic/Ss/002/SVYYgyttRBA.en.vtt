the first thing that we noticed when we
did<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> consultation<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.650> there<00:00:13.799> was<00:00:13.920> a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
did the consultation is that there was a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.530 
did the consultation is that there was a
dead<00:00:14.219> tree<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> yard<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.240> had<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
dead tree in the yard so we had the

around the base of the tree to catch the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.450 
around the base of the tree to catch the
chi<00:00:30.779> energy<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.500> comes<00:00:31.769> up<00:00:31.920> towards<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
chi energy as it comes up towards the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
path does have an angle to it so it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.150 
path does have an angle to it so it's
not<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.540> straight<00:00:42.780> path<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.620> goes<00:00:43.739> through

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
so what we've done is placed a mirror at

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.480 
so what we've done is placed a mirror at
all<00:01:35.640> four<00:01:36.119> walls<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.070> bathroom

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
all four walls so that the bathroom

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.760 
all four walls so that the bathroom
disappears<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.720> used<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.079> decorative<00:01:40.409> mirror

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
disappears we used a decorative mirror

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.899 
disappears we used a decorative mirror
so<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.970> could<00:01:42.680> accent<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.130> entryway<00:01:44.579> as

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so that we could accent the entryway as

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.179 
so that we could accent the entryway as
you<00:01:45.030> come<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> typically<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:46.920> want

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you come in and typically you don't want

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.520 
you come in and typically you don't want
a<00:01:47.220> mirror<00:01:47.490> facing<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> front<00:01:48.240> door<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
a mirror facing the front door but as I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.450 
a mirror facing the front door but as I
turn<00:01:49.860> around

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
turn around

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.359 
turn around
you'll<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> mirror<00:01:51.750> reflects<00:01:52.369> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you'll see that the mirror reflects the
