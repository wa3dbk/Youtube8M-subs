00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.480
 but 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.340
 good all the time of the day my name is 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.170
 Viktor and I greet you on the 95th video 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.720
 podcast which is called on the board 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.690
 our topic today is dedicated to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.240
 whether to update content on old 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.840
 pages of the site and either old pages 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.510
 blog post 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.850
 why I touched on this topic because 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.840
 most bloggers most of those 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.970
 who lead information resources 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.280
 Well, even more than 95 percent 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.950
 percent never update old 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.100
 articles on the blog and in vain let's consider 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.050
 well, most probably the main points and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.240
 next you determine it is worth doing 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.600
 or not worth it is everything again 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.989
 depends on the situation well let's assume 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.739
 you have a large number of pages let's say 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.450
 500 on the blog then we are either 1000 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 most of these pages are perspective 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.240
 seo there is in the top 10 top 20 well in 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.220
 which in some sense they generate 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.170
 traffic from onigiri search engines 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.869
 generates traffic can this cool 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.520
 page maybe there for recommendations 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.440
 on from social networks and so on but 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.690
 the question immediately arises why update 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.619
 not content on old pages that 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.869
 once wrote well, the first is the most 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.179
 probably the most important is relevance 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.740
 that is, how relevant is that content 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.610
 which bed have you ever 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.050
 Well, I will give the simplest example if all 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.729
 a selection of keywords 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.590
 five years ago was one now 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.319
 a bunch of new services appeared 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.319
 opportunities and how about everything 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.600
 attitudes and practical skills like this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.990
 you can do an order of magnitude faster better in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.229
 the result 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.420
 If such a post is updated, then it can 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.340
 give more results and usually 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.069
 user can log in and you and you most likely 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.709
 see astray either just 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.810
 show irrelevant information this is still 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.709
 just gives him the opportunity to either leave 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.860
 your resource 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.970
 either search for something pretty 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.400
 and fresher 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.290
 and the second moment is the most important moment 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.190
 it's more visibility 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.100
 that is, more 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.210
 traffic from your posts that are old 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.280
 that is, in general, more feedback let's 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.310
 think about how this can be done 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.720
 that is, the question immediately arises how 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.690
 the first thing you can do is go to 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.270
 service promote yuri or 7rash well 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.080
 depending if it is google if it is 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.560
 index then we go spywords we drive in 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.540
 your blog url 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.000
 choose the most frequent requests well then 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.650
 there are those who are more than a thousand more 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.740
 5 500 visits per month have and we look 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.810
 what posts exactly are below under 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.300
 Video basically pretty and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.420
 this moment will be analyzed in detail for 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.170
 those who want to understand this 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.170
 actually we see a list of those posts 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.880
 which is not so far from the top 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.740
 but you can work on them 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.450
 we highlight this list then create but 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.980
 For starters, you can not strongly 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.370
 sprayed take 5 10 such articles and 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.680
 fourth moment 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.370
 improving these articles as they can 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.650
 improve 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.470
 that is, the first is better to optimize 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.630
 look not slept on or is there a title either 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.820
 How can this be improved ? 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.550
 from issuing better moved there 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:55.590
 make it more so people more 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.510
 conversions add some selling 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.570
 Plus properties, you can add some more 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.700
 then keywords so that the whole article 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.050
 better rank further look at 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.300
 errors technically this if h1 is registered 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.019
 likewise a normal disc is possible 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.050
 this 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.880
 there if this article is possible there is text 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.700
 out of date can add something new 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.430
 add the same text pictures yet 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.790
 something pictures can be signed the same 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.040
 al there and so on then there are well on 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.840
 really moments for optimization and 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.210
 Improvements like this can be done 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.419
 look 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.300
 article infographic below 12 key 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.460
 optimization ranking factors 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.689
 pages of the site and there you will find more 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.149
 more tips 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.429
 that in the end we get well, that is, by 

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:46.830
 my experience as I am probably the first 

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:50.209
 what do I do with any sites whenever I want 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.189
 pretty fast without any special 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:56.849
 straining increase attendance while 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:59.789
 without creating new articles and 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.039
 what else will we need for this 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.939
 Well, most likely the links under which would be 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.989
 the content was not even if it is old if 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.759
 he is authoritative 

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:11.579
 but if it is not fed normal 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.399
 ssylochkami natural thematic 

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:17.309
 then the benefits of it will not be so 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:22.800
 a lot that you can do this case well, 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:24.839
 option 1 do for example miralinks 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.969
 and articles in which there will be a link 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:31.439
 Well, the article will be written well, for example 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:34.610
 if we have there I do not know the article about well 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:37.679
 or is there a recipe such as 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.919
 there is a mimosa salad yes and we need this 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:42.629
 Salad mimosa raise to the top here is our ours 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.489
 the main post that we improve then we 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:46.709
 how to make a salad 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:49.519
 mimosa there roughly speaking in 30 minutes 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:53.099
 article for miralinks and it describes 

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:55.619
 all highlights but there bison corne 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:58.769
 its natural either link picture 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:02.579
 will go to our post such 2-5 

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:04.709
 ssylochek and this request frequency request 

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:08.279
 which is quite often requested 

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:11.309
 you can raise the first top-5 can cat 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:13.499
 three if the top 1 will easily become you 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.779
 really feel and search traffic 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:18.539
 if we go through these keys 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:20.909
 keywords that are really 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.949
 have frequency has potential but how 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:26.159
 would you score on them well find the pages then 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.949
 benefit 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:30.719
 very close all you need is 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.719
 really improve what will help 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:36.479
 users get more relevant 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:38.489
 information but you better optimize 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.489
 give your website time and get it 

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:42.360
 the output is more traffic in general is 

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:43.949
 probably all 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.019
