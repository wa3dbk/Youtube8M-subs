00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
and I'm going to run these wires through

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.930 
and I'm going to run these wires through

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.540 
here because it's like all spaces from
the<00:00:53.030> factory<00:00:53.630> with<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:55.340> plastic<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:58.430> I'm

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
the factory with the plastic and I'm

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.580 
the factory with the plastic and I'm
going<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.760> start<00:00:59.030> it<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.720> this<00:00:59.840> because<00:01:00.200> it<00:01:00.410> is

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
and I'm going to attach it to a switch

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.980 
and I'm going to attach it to a switch
to<00:01:07.670> micro<00:01:08.030> switch<00:01:08.360> that<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.630> got<00:01:08.869> from

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
to micro switch that I got from

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.430 
to micro switch that I got from
RadioShack<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:11.360> then<00:01:11.510> I<00:01:11.600> split<00:01:12.230> a<00:01:12.380> little

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
RadioShack and then I split a little

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.430 
RadioShack and then I split a little
over<00:01:15.440> here<00:01:15.830> I'm<00:01:16.340> going<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.610> glue<00:01:16.790> it<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:17.440> I'm

going to attach the wise to that so when
I<00:01:20.780> don't<00:01:21.140> want<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.440> on<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:21.909> could<00:01:22.909> just<00:01:23.060> switch

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
I don't want it on I could just switch

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.870 
I don't want it on I could just switch
it<00:01:23.300> off<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:25.690> yeah<00:01:27.159> this<00:01:28.159> is<00:01:28.220> what<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.580> little
