00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 his people are here with michael again 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.859
 the tip of the week the animals one 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.859
 school 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.210
 yes the school can of course also 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.640
 representative of each other 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.860
 flatfish from the principle is all that 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.140
 like this one already here 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.400
 ready to cook the kitchen ready chorus 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.310
 already there is a separate video 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.590
 planned was at the end of a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.470
 now we see here these middle rÃ¶sler 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.720
 we have a filleting knife that is one 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.430
 knife that important here from mine 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.610
 teaching is 30 years old because of that 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.949
 Wood handle as you see it should be front 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.449
 be sharp and sharp and a bit 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:52.299
 we better go here exactly where we see 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:59.309
 here with the middle we set the knife 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:59.309
 to cut to the devices 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.520
 Let's go in and finger it 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.720
 feel there's a hill there because 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:17.420
 the very principle like a spine 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:21.190
 That's why people offer the knife 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.640
 and answers it very carefully here 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.640
 search there 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.810
 along the bone along the bone 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.680
 then too careful 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.630
 Of course it can also buy politics 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.500
 but now angela the passionate 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.400
 Attitude is absolutely the whole school 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.140
 always a little piece of fresh the 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.690
 branches for that will be natural 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.290
 machine filleted these days 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.870
 water with mine we have a clean 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.160
 Kelly, I would still be here now 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.860
 Remove bit simple with clean 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.340
 say I mean it is mine 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.940
 bad you can eat everything 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.340
 Now you have the goal you can do this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.800
 You do not have to do that either 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.040
 but not both we have the second 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.120
 Turn this side was this 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.090
 Here we go again sees here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.860
 you twirl this one 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 cut behind and now completely again 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.860
 carefully 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:47.020
 certainly requires a bit of practice 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.930
 and stick that sensible knife 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.320
 important at knife is sharp 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.700
 if she is not quite so flexible 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.570
 not quite as dramatic but create 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.570
 you can see this clean lot 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.030
 the back is exactly the same again 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.510
 sharp cut goes a bit 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.510
 difficult 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.200
 again 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.980
 along the bank 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.860
 actually quite simple 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.200
 the awesome is almost her now 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.209
 separates here seared it 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.280
 as much as one is not so often do 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:59.540
 in the bright side you can see of course 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.540
 is better advised
