00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello you hello you hello dear internet 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.529
 Hello youtube that is sometimes completely 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.880
 nice difficult with a camera too 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.440
 Talk like your camera 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.300
 be addressed as you would like 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.750
 be addressed 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.580
 knowledge 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:26.760
 in the comments and we are laying now 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:29.130
 let's go with the news who of you already has 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 time his pee 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.700
 those who have done so many times 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.280
 probably have something 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.070
 Sensational noted the curtain 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.350
 the urination it takes on average 21 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 at least for terrestrial critters 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 three kilogram body weight have 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.059
 I suppose most of you count 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.700
 to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.430
 david found that out 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.739
 dertour works in atlanta and is 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.969
 known for its whimsical 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.610
 research results he and his team 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.969
 spent days in the zoo 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.280
 yes and the animals with animals watched 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.320
 with animals that is the technical term for 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 my new water investors turn up 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.250
 a mathematical equation 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.220
 which shows that the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.380
 rejection rate in variant against the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 Body size is so it does not matter if you 're with 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.180
 an elephant a cat a goat 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.100
 or battery evolved when the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.409
 Bubble is completely filled when we all 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.470
 finished at the same time in 21st 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.470
 seconds 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.909
 we figured it out 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.670
 Of course, the animals have first 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.890
 I looked closely at the time stopped 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.079
 and then the anatomical composition of the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.329
 bubble and the associated Hanover 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.610
 examined and he came out 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.929
 That's only on the length of the urethra 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.420
 actually arrives 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.860
 I know the length again 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.789
 how fast the whole thing 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.369
 goes on 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.770
 because the longer the harburg the bigger 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.420
 are the gravitational forces on it 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.590
 act and so faster then comes the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.459
 good says down 21 seconds to bring 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.200
 yes, not everybody does what women need 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.780
 then a little longer than they have 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.940
 a comparatively short craftsman 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.190
 I suppose that's the reason 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.959
 is why women always like to go to the toilet? 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.900
 go because the probably just 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.870
 somehow boring handle is already 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.150
 an incredible phenomenon that is always 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.120
 so also filled with exciting relaxed 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.959
 Charging empty unload as 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.959
 with a battery 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.989
 one or the other may know 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.209
 following situation is waiting for one 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.469
 important message and then zack is the 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.540
 learn battery yes I sometimes have that 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.109
 Feeling the thing goes well 29 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.849
 seconds 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.010
 researchers could now another 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.079
 Therefore, lithium decodes lithium 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.560
 ion batteries with the time of performance 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.510
 to lose 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.730
 to understand that we should 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.889
 first the basic construction of a 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.129
 lithium ion batteries clear as me 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:05.019
 do not know 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.669
 but then we have to go through it very briefly 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.959
 must also be promised pain 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.299
 we propose our first times a 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.319
 electronically hungry metal as well as nickel 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.959
 or cobalt 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.930
 therefore we set positively charged 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.000
 Take lithium ion to the other side 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.769
 We later graphit the team as a garage 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.209
 for our lithium between rhine still 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.400
 a separator that there is no 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.019
 Short circuit is around the whole with cable 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.209
 connected and a power source on it 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.030
 Now the following happens 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.879
 electrons pulled out of the metal and 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.469
 the wanderings to the coffee lithium thinks 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.509
 now juhu we use the favor of 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.799
 hour and carriages through the separator 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:41.019
 grab the electrons are 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.530
 happy and laughing at the other one 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.419
 metal now we close as 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.489
 power source off and our battery is 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.620
 loaded 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.359
 Now a consumer dranetzen then 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.909
 the electricity price is closed again 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.489
 because there is no power source but only 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.290
 in this consumer of the cable ins 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.209
 can consider the cable 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.639
 Metal ions on the other side again 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.549
 pull on the electron and snatch 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.439
 I really need the ammunition 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.599
 but try on the other as well 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.280
 to come to the side again 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.919
 to grab electrons but unfortunately 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.799
 in vain and thereby explains the 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.989
 battery which crystal formation settles 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.330
 the lithium on and thereby reduced 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.159
 the capacity of this battery is that 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.800
 is due to the quality of the electrodes 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.370
 if the really nice classes happened 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.050
 Nothing 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.000
 but unfortunately you can do that technically 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.830
 hard to realize once there are small ones 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.110
 it is just like at 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.550
 snowflakes since sat down even 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.590
 Crystals can also be used 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.400
 arise when there is a dirt particle 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.660
 indicates euros 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.340
 out of nowhere and there are no 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.380
 Snowflakes are also the only 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.030
 to small particles and that's how it is 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.150
 These crystals then form 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.160
 bumps modern lithium ion battery 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.270
 as well as today's cars are installed 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.400
 they are usually not yet 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.980
 one hundred percent he is crazy about that 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.150
 whole is so complicated that the 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.820
 Researchers just prefer something 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.530
 try and then new ones 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.380
 create knowledge rather than the 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.680
 to recognize complete chemistry first and 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.970
 sometimes to suggest what the cuckoo should 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.000
 Actually we are all really 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.890
 only tester apropos cuckoo so the 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.890
 Cuckoo he is really the last one before 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.370
 The cuckoo lays its eggs in strangers 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.590
 nester we will be a boat parasit yes 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.289
 And it gets even worse 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.330
 as soon as the eggs of foreign birds 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.490
 were trained and the cuckoo 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.499
 he throws the others the rest 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.389
 not yet trained from the nest 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:41.400
 and then suddenly frank and lets himself 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.930
 From these meet parents happen 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.879
 already quite cheeky 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.039
 now it is so the biz birds 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:49.289
 try to protect yourself by the 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.150
 eggshell 1 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.909
 you can almost say a QR code 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.550
 a barcode gets so try the 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.419
 Birds recognize and recognize their eggs 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.490
 to be able to distinguish 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.159
 of dementia coke the cuckoo costs 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.439
 Of course, that's a biological thing 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.550
 So what's going on? 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.009
 not only the coco moved the whole 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.529
 thing is actually crazy the 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.360
 cuckoo egg are like one to one 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:18.199
 these are now and as I said it is 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:20.639
 a back and forth in evolution is not 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:23.219
 so it was again on the know 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.080
 and if you 're down there like that 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.969
 then a small feet down meets 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.520
 Of course you are welcome to press and 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.110
 but do not love caution 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.960
 confuse this thumb here is the 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.610
 made evil and look at it 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.370
 last video on then you will learn 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.649
 how men have to dance that women do that 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.389
 find it particularly attractive or go 

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:44.399
 times the whole news playlist by that 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.229
 a whole lot of exciting topics 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:47.520
 I would like to thank Tim pollard 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:49.139
 me the cuckoo picture 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.270
 kindly provided 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.529
 has the polka of the animal photographer if 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.289
 you are looking for something like that 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:57.210
 but at his side over so and 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.039
 Now a few more people and sizes 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.719
 Although the dear sarah I am 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.939
 namely now looking forward to a 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:04.680
 new great postcard from the end of the world 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:07.409
 and maybe I can get you somewhere 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.539
 somehow also show go greet 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:11.669
 out to the best photoshop in the world 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.889
 little of the world but of the universe 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.510
 of the universe summ summ summ summ summ 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.580
 summ 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.530
 he just does not want to be named 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.780
 will not be available until I subscribe to 5000 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.830
 So you need a little bit of Euro 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.180
 Support of the takes namely 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.280
 apparently something else 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.320
 Another greeting goes out to the 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.700
 stefan me so energetic times 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.830
 supported if I ask for 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.580
 has business and animations and me 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.430
 I think that sometimes I am something 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.470
 exhausting was exhausting and will 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.490
 even more exhausting his game remains 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.410
 for understanding 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.810
 last but not least is a bit 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.280
 out to the nano of me and mine 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.010
 crazy ideas endure again 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.630
 yes, that was it from me here and 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.130
 I hope we see each other in the next 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.090
 video again, I would be such a 

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.590
 a little bit pleased 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.590
 until then , have a good time
