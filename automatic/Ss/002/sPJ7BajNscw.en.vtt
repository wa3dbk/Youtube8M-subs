00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
are two different ends of the spectrum

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.920 
are two different ends of the spectrum
one<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.560> them<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:29.450> you're<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.780> putting

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
one of them is you're not really putting

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.660 
one of them is you're not really putting
