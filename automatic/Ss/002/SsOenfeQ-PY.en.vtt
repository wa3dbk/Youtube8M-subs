00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.850
 Gray 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.910
 in 2014 a new pcex has arrived more 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.770
 current these led lights that have you 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.290
 They give a very attractive design very 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.570
 technological and also the forms are a 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.550
 little more angular I think that this is 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.450
 a big step forward at an aesthetic level and 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:41.160
 I think that reinforces that successful layer that 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.160
 has this attractive model 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.280
 has a good union between what is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.649
 agility and ease of use to those 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 14-inch wheels give it very good 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.780
 stability but at the same time it's a scooter 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.870
 low low not too high of seat 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.440
 and very easy to handle and I've also 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.500
 seen that it's being a 125 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's a pretty powerful motorcycle has a 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.170
 pretty happy boot and you do not throw in 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.970
 lack power and mix it with that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.920
 agility and that ease of use that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.920
 final they make a very competent package 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.869
 the pcex is a fairly compact scooter 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.329
 and it is very accessible for people of little 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.610
 height of smaller size because good was 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.759
 a seat a fairly low height 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.640
 and it's easy to manage but it also has 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.140
 very well structured dimensions 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.600
 for people of greater size than 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.520
 you will also find comfortable 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 one the lights read interesting highlight 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.979
 that we are facing an element that not only 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.020
 improves vehicle lighting but 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.500
 It also makes you recognize yourself 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.950
 before and better other vehicles a factor 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 important in terms of safety 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.420
 I was very surprised by the air stop 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.100
 that every time the bike is stopped 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 for three seconds the motor will 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.929
 It deactivates and I liked it a lot for me 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.239
 in the different seasons that you have 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.280
 with him and also the fact that little by little 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.959
 that you give the accelerator right away 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.319
 start the engine and start with 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.319
 a lot of ease 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.239
 It's the first bike I've tried with the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.099
 air the stop I've already tried some 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.200
 occasion some car but this is very 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.299
 different because with a car for the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.069
 engine and you're in the same environment but 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.890
 When you arrive with the motorbike at a traffic light 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.629
 here the engine shuts down and suddenly 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.060
 you are in the environment you start to listen 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.069
 new things start to realize 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.099
 the noise that engines generate when 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.220
 idling of other vehicles and you give yourself 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.379
 mind that with the engine stopped you are in 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.569
 the environment nothing else for me has been a 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.480
 very pleasant feeling 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.859
 during the filming in the team I 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.319
 they asked good is all of law of the 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.299
 stock will not affect the battery and good is 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.709
 one of the improvements of this 2014 model 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.200
 that has an intelligent system that 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.480
 detects if the battery is low charged 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.609
 with which there will be a point at which 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.939
 will stop working and the engine will 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.530
 the engine will obviously idle 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.739
 Consumption also benefits me 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.959
 you are stopping the engine during the time 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.969
 that you can be using in a 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.819
 displacement at the traffic light 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:25.310
 there is the engine stopped and good is 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.409
 announced in consumption higher than 370 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.830
 kilometers of autonomy for which it is 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:33.380
 a very good economic advantage 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.900
 the pcex has the capacity to put a 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.240
 full-face helmet under the seat plus 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.610
 of good maybe a jacket if it is 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.650
 small or maybe others or someone else 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.050
 accessory gloves and other things that come in 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.420
 under the seat is perfectly the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.670
 left side glove box is pretty 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.650
 deep narrow but it is very deep 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.330
 is the ability to get a good 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.130
 mobile phone perhaps those gloves 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.200
 the ones we talked about and the interesting thing is 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.640
 that has an outlet that you 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.960
 allows you to carry a charger for the 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.630
 phone that I think now is so 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.400
 usual that we take over there are two 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.130
 little things that could be improved 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.620
 How is the seat that might be a 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.200
 little hard I have to emphasize that during 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.510
 we filmed for many hours until 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.700
 eight hours doing tests with the motorcycle 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.650
 and maybe that was the feeling that I 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.780
 I thought it was too hard for a 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.400
 normal use that is to be at 10 15 minutes 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.680
 about the scooter itself I do not think 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.900
 that is a problem and something that does 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.660
 like to add on the scooter would be something 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.820
 of information in the box as a 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.520
 temperature clock or some 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.590
 extra digital information 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.569
 as a conclusion it seems to me that it brings together 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.069
 most of the advantages of the aspects 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.560
 Searchable on a scooter 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:46.039
 these features is attractive is 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.199
 economic level of daily use also 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.889
 it's very economical for this one for this one there 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.050
 of the stop that has increase the autonomy 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.699
 and low consumption but also a 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.190
 little takes that step forward at level 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.310
 technological with elements like lights 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.199
 of led is a scooter that was already good and 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.819
 now it has been improved in aspects 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.819
 as interesting as these 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.330
 to some greens
