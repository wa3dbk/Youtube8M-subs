okay<00:00:00.690> and<00:00:00.900> now<00:00:01.170> if<00:00:01.530> we<00:00:01.800> somehow<00:00:02.220> achieved<00:00:02.820> this

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
okay and now if we somehow achieved this

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.310 
okay and now if we somehow achieved this
position<00:00:05.899> we'll<00:00:06.899> play<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.670> and<00:00:08.809> now<00:00:09.809> instead

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
position we'll play this and now instead

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.880 
position we'll play this and now instead
of<00:00:10.500> Knight<00:00:11.780> to<00:00:12.780> c3<00:00:13.469> which<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> good<00:00:14.670> Mouse

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
of Knight to c3 which is a good Mouse

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.270 
of Knight to c3 which is a good Mouse
she<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.670> also<00:00:17.940> play<00:00:18.600> like<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.800> set<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
she can also play like this to set a

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.200 
she can also play like this to set a
simple<00:00:20.790> trap

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.560 

but<00:00:23.869> it's<00:00:24.380> actually<00:00:24.949> a<00:00:24.980> weak<00:00:25.310> move<00:00:25.579> and<00:00:25.970> I<00:00:26.359> am

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
but it's actually a weak move and I am

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.200 
but it's actually a weak move and I am
going<00:00:26.810> to<00:00:26.960> show<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:27.579> how<00:00:28.579> to<00:00:28.989> refute<00:00:29.989> this

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
going to show you how to refute this

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.310 
going to show you how to refute this
because<00:00:32.210> if<00:00:32.870> black<00:00:33.559> is<00:00:33.829> not<00:00:34.640> careful<00:00:35.320> black

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
because if black is not careful black

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.610 
because if black is not careful black
can<00:00:36.590> easily<00:00:37.340> lose<00:00:37.730> here<00:00:39.820> so<00:00:40.989> what<00:00:41.989> we<00:00:42.320> should

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
can easily lose here so what we should

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.560 
can easily lose here so what we should
do<00:00:42.829> here<00:00:43.159> is<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.579> play<00:00:44.739> d5<00:00:46.059> don't<00:00:47.059> think<00:00:47.420> about

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
do here is to play d5 don't think about

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.090 
do here is to play d5 don't think about
anything<00:00:48.110> else<00:00:48.589> if<00:00:49.180> if<00:00:50.180> Bishop<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:51.110> attacking

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
anything else if if Bishop is attacking

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.990 
anything else if if Bishop is attacking
this<00:00:52.489> diagonal<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.210> light<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.720> already<00:00:53.960> here

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
this diagonal and light is already here

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.360 
this diagonal and light is already here
because<00:00:56.000> if<00:00:56.390> we<00:00:56.629> don't<00:00:56.840> move<00:00:57.050> here<00:00:57.469> then<00:00:57.739> this

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
because if we don't move here then this

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.869 
because if we don't move here then this
might<00:00:58.609> goes<00:00:58.879> here<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.160> he<00:01:01.160> wins<00:01:01.339> either<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
might goes here and he wins either the

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.030 
might goes here and he wins either the
queen<00:01:02.149> or<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.429> the<00:01:04.429> rook

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.700 

so<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.800> position<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.730> just<00:01:10.970> go

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
so in this in this position we just go

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.749 
so in this in this position we just go
d5<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.220> now<00:01:14.000> take<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.810> look<00:01:15.080> what<00:01:15.290> can<00:01:15.500> happen

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.010 

he<00:01:20.360> has<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:21.020> do<00:01:21.170> something<00:01:21.439> about<00:01:21.710> this<00:01:21.950> pawn

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
he has to do something about this pawn

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.120 
he has to do something about this pawn
so<00:01:24.020> probably<00:01:24.799> her<00:01:25.009> capture<00:01:25.640> here

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.300 

so<00:01:28.700> now<00:01:28.970> don't<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:29.810> they're<00:01:30.110> capturing<00:01:31.100> this

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
so now don't you they're capturing this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.920 
so now don't you they're capturing this
poem<00:01:31.640> because<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.630> an<00:01:33.229> equal<00:01:33.740> game<00:01:34.180> so<00:01:35.180> we

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
poem because it is an equal game so we

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.230 
poem because it is an equal game so we
have<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.290> punish<00:01:36.590> him<00:01:37.009> for<00:01:37.040> playing<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:37.970> move

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
have to punish him for playing this move

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.420 
have to punish him for playing this move
here

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
here

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.980 
here
instead<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.990> good<00:01:42.170> move<00:01:42.380> like<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:44.570> we

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
instead of a good move like this so we

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.610 
instead of a good move like this so we
punish<00:01:45.470> him<00:01:46.330> playing<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.660> night<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.500> this

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
punish him playing a night to this

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.130 
punish him playing a night to this
square<00:01:48.980> and<00:01:49.400> now<00:01:49.960> his<00:01:50.960> bishop<00:01:51.470> is<00:01:51.620> attacked

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
square and now his bishop is attacked

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.900 
square and now his bishop is attacked
his<00:01:54.140> pawn<00:01:54.560> is<00:01:55.310> attacked<00:01:56.200> if<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:57.500> moved<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
his pawn is attacked if we moved the the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.150 
his pawn is attacked if we moved the the
night

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
night

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.950 
night
this<00:02:01.160> man<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.550> also<00:02:02.060> attacked

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
this man is also attacked

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.940 
this man is also attacked
so<00:02:04.500> he<00:02:04.830> has<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.610> what<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.710> let's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so he has to think what to do so let's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.600 
so he has to think what to do so let's
say

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
say

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.860 
say
goes<00:02:10.210> here

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
goes here

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.809 
goes here
then<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:12.830> take<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.280> pawn<00:02:14.860> but

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
then we just take the pawn but

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.740 
then we just take the pawn but
you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.540> also<00:02:18.719> go<00:02:19.019> here

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
you can also go here

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
you can also go here
and<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.860> position

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
and in this position

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.810 
and in this position
don't<00:02:24.400> captured<00:02:24.880> upon<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:27.520> can

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
don't captured upon because we can

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.430 
don't captured upon because we can
punish<00:02:28.540> him<00:02:28.900> even<00:02:29.560> better

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.210 

just<00:02:33.190> kick<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.090> night

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220

here

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.160 

for<00:02:40.150> example<00:02:40.600> he<00:02:40.810> will<00:02:40.930> fill<00:02:41.380> out<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.950> right

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
for example he will fill out this right

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.190 
for example he will fill out this right
it's<00:02:44.170> it's<00:02:45.100> safe<00:02:45.520> here<00:02:45.880> but<00:02:46.090> note<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:47.340> his

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
it's it's safe here but note that his

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.290 
it's it's safe here but note that his
development<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.560> quite<00:02:51.070> problematic<00:02:51.490> already

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
development is quite problematic already

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.590 
development is quite problematic already
and<00:02:52.630> our<00:02:53.380> development<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.570> very<00:02:55.570> good<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:57.600> now

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
and our development is very good so now

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.470 
and our development is very good so now
we<00:02:58.660> need<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.050> play<00:02:59.530> before<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.640> kick<00:03:01.300> this

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
we need to play before and kick this

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.450 
we need to play before and kick this
bishop<00:03:01.900> again<00:03:03.480> he<00:03:04.480> goes<00:03:04.630> here

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
bishop again he goes here

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:21.410 
bishop again he goes here
and<00:03:07.460> then<00:03:07.700> we<00:03:08.450> just<00:03:08.720> grabbed<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.350> pawn

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.800 

okay<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.400> another<00:03:23.400> possibility<00:03:23.910> here<00:03:25.550> of<00:03:26.660> 35

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
okay and another possibility here of 35

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.559 
okay and another possibility here of 35
instead<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.800> this<00:03:29.950> move

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.240 

she<00:03:35.110> can<00:03:35.319> play<00:03:36.069> this<00:03:36.430> way

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
she can play this way

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.460 
she can play this way
and<00:03:38.760> now

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.199 

it's

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.170 

now<00:03:45.959> white<00:03:46.439> has<00:03:46.829> some<00:03:47.159> problems<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.969> play

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
