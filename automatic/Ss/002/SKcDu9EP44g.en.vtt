00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.369
 the despondency or the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.470
 sadness impulses someone 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.180
 Therefore, a depression has come in 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.380
 brain that gets mixed up 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.480
 now directly boring 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.429
 namely the nerves about carriers 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.990
 will be distributed in a different way 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.820
 and resumed that can 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.260
 are triggered by very different 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.910
 things that can be genetic that can 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.940
 through some bad experience 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.800
 that can happen through quite a few 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.000
 Life situations happen to one 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.430
 make it unhappy but it can 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.110
 also easy and controllable physically 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.190
 By means of medication one can do it 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.330
 make the nerves over 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.070
 Carrier substances back into the right place 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.510
 balance come there are a few 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.220
 funny tricks is a trick to 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.049
 Example that one ensures that one 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.309
 certain nerve transferor not so 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.720
 is recorded quickly as usual 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.680
 is resumed so sounds 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.720
 somehow illogical 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.640
 but things like that work 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.500
 medical or drug side 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.030
 But you can also try that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.320
 to get ass up with the help of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.790
 others possibly and thereby 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.710
 create beautiful experiences and the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.270
 of course, also ensure that in the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.740
 brain again other substances 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.100
 to be distributed or to others 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.500
 wise 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.020
 and so that comes a depression in 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.480
 first line just an imbalance 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.770
 from a very complicated branching 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.540
 apparatus is when it comes to the brain 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.860
 presents with loud little lights 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.360
 always when just small 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.409
 discharges somewhere to the brain 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.300
 works with electricity 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.890
 then you would if you were on top of it 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.840
 You could watch all the time 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.400
 so many flickering lights 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.680
 who are watching this way and that 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.570
 any disturbance in it can lead to it 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.010
 that either special 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.659
 happy becomes exaggerated happy that 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.800
 there is also but unfortunately also 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.290
 especially sad and depressed 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.210
 and unpowered it is ultimately us 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.979
 just electrical discharges the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.530
 carry by chemical transfers 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.640
 Substances and transmission routes are simple 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.640
 no longer work properly
