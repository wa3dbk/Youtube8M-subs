00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.369
 special services 

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.200
 but I'm Mongolia billionaires 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.680
 warner bros fire started with a massive short 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.840
 but it is clear that 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.209
 I felt 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.859
 team coach 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.479
 last computer minute 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.909
 reflection is not only positive 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.909
 density abstract away from 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.829
 even last minute 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.749
 Semshov moment I think that in general was 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.279
 equal game 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.099
 however quickly missed as a whole 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.409
 gai first half was enough 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.039
 equal fight we had moments a year 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.689
 soccer game 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.270
 yes we have Escobar 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.780
 that is why 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.350
 In general, probably all that was born from 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.220
 what is he of course last minute 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.470
 drive tied the score it's always a part 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.710
 series a certain amount of luck 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.800
 I think that while I feel in roaming 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 result limits 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.350
 question 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.920
 have questions 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 between father 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.750
 but I think it’s rather east 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.310
 mastery in the first 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.990
 case of quiet 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750
 soon so 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
 after board 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.030
 no matter, we have enough 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.740
 serious personnel losses 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.270
 here and belozerov despite the fact that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.659
 was in the application he is not ready today 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.320
 the match 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.900
 nbu got injured and with amkarom therefore 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.250
 the only possible option 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.180
 of those who survived the exchange 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.870
 Europe 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.090
 and I think that 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.090
 played very well 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.520
 and the fact is that he 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.490
 wanted to go to the game in support that's not 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.910
 quite a flank game 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.690
 so as it was 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.630
 but counted on the fact that I’ll just have 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.640
 transfer in both directions salugin here 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.230
 cancel kalacheva who just 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.090
 left in the right zone 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.340
 it would not be entirely logical 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.620
 amount and decided this case donate 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.099
 Andrei Tikhonov 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.599
 the service is essentially the left zone released 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.279
 two ports in a convoy 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.279
 all requests 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.899
 but we equalized 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.899
 as it says what to do 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.669
 upon request 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.759
 in the manual when she was already there 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.709
 Once I repeat that 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.720
 and I and the whole team are very grateful not 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.409
 Malevich 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.519
 he spent very 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.680
 a lot of work in a team and country 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.189
 very comfortable working because 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.879
 the beginning of the sports component 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.659
 corporatization make those decisions 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.309
 who consider it necessary to Libya 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.629
 d let's say so 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.849
 not very often, by decision but not 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.389
 less so we are all professionals but all 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.009
 existing contracts 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.389
 and here we are naturally a group 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.659
 continuing formation 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.659
 bands think that I refused 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.479
 there are no questions 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.569
 Thank you all for your question
