00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
hands are dry for about three hours and

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.490 
hands are dry for about three hours and
I<00:03:18.090> actually<00:03:18.299> went<00:03:18.720> as<00:03:18.780> far<00:03:18.959> as<00:03:19.109> using<00:03:19.319> this

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
I actually went as far as using this

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.129 
I actually went as far as using this
five<00:03:19.829> nights<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.459> row<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.030> by<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.629> end<00:03:21.900> of

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
five nights in a row and by the end of

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.509 
to six hours after using this treatment
so<00:03:28.109> I<00:03:28.139> have<00:03:28.379> tested<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:28.829> stuff<00:03:29.040> out<00:03:29.220> at<00:03:29.340> home

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
so I have tested this stuff out at home

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.369 
so I have tested this stuff out at home
you<00:03:30.180> can<00:03:30.329> give<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.569> a<00:03:30.629> shot<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.109> takes<00:03:31.260> about

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
you can give it a shot it takes about

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.259 
you can give it a shot it takes about
five<00:03:31.680> days<00:03:31.889> your<00:03:32.160> body<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.489> acclimate<00:03:32.940> itself

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
five days your body to acclimate itself

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.809 
five days your body to acclimate itself
to<00:03:33.419> it<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.949> it<00:03:34.949> should<00:03:35.129> work<00:03:35.160> out<00:03:35.459> for<00:03:35.699> you

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819
