reviews<00:00:39.460> are<00:00:39.640> usually<00:00:40.059> skewed<00:00:40.480> either<00:00:40.750> way

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
reviews are usually skewed either way

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.099 
reviews are usually skewed either way
especially<00:00:41.590> on<00:00:42.280> console<00:00:43.149> exclusive<00:00:43.809> games

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
especially on console exclusive games

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.080 
especially on console exclusive games
and<00:00:44.469> that's<00:00:44.769> obviously<00:00:45.010> because<00:00:45.550> fanboys

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
and that's obviously because fanboys

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.639 
and that's obviously because fanboys
want<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.510> come<00:00:46.660> in<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:46.989> give<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.320> score<00:00:47.620> a

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
want to come in and give the score a

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.490 
want to come in and give the score a
zero<00:00:48.250> or<00:00:48.579> whatever<00:00:49.269> because<00:00:49.570> they<00:00:49.989> don't<00:00:50.230> own

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
zero or whatever because they don't own

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.229 
zero or whatever because they don't own
an<00:00:50.769> xbox<00:00:50.920> one<00:00:51.489> or<00:00:51.519> they<00:00:51.879> don't<00:00:52.059> own<00:00:52.210> a

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239

an xbox one or they don't own a
playstation<00:00:52.960> 4<00:00:53.230> but<00:00:53.679> I<00:00:53.710> think<00:00:53.829> if<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.250> are

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
playstation 4 but I think if you are

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.579 
playstation 4 but I think if you are
going<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.789> look<00:00:54.910> at<00:00:55.059> critic<00:00:55.420> reviews<00:00:55.870> I<00:00:56.109> think

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
going to look at critic reviews I think

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.380 
going to look at critic reviews I think

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
because it takes everyone's opinion but

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.340
