wanted to control what I did and for

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.939 
wanted to control what I did and for
example<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.820> would<00:00:54.120> jaw<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.719> class<00:00:55.410> like

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
example when we would jaw in class like

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.750 
example when we would jaw in class like
he<00:00:56.280> taught<00:00:57.149> me<00:00:57.680> how<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.190> loose<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
he taught me how to just be loose and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.130 
he taught me how to just be loose and
carefree<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.149> round<00:01:03.149> tight<00:01:03.870> on

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
carefree and not be so round tight on

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.510 
carefree and not be so round tight on
what<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.949> was<00:01:05.100> doing<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:06.140> think<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
what I was doing I think that when you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.870 
what I was doing I think that when you
learn<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.260> release<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:11.540> control<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.779 

you<00:01:16.390> learn<00:01:17.219> how<00:01:18.219> to<00:01:18.610> just<00:01:19.979> enjoy<00:01:20.979> what<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.640> do

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
you learn how to just enjoy what you do

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.920 
you learn how to just enjoy what you do
and<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:23.759> wasn't<00:01:24.759> really<00:01:25.060> enjoying<00:01:25.270> what<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.810> was

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
and I wasn't really enjoying what I was

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.950 
and I wasn't really enjoying what I was
doing<00:01:27.090> necessarily<00:01:28.090> before<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.420> had<00:01:28.600> his<00:01:28.720> class

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
doing necessarily before I had his class

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.960 
doing necessarily before I had his class
I<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:30.460> did<00:01:30.579> he<00:01:30.670> really<00:01:31.140> Tommy<00:01:32.140> how<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
I think did he really Tommy how to just

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.389 
I think did he really Tommy how to just
let<00:01:34.210> go<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.689> just<00:01:34.780> have<00:01:35.649> fun<00:01:35.679> with<00:01:35.920> what<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.310> was

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.399 
let go and just have fun with what I was
doing<00:01:37.020> that's<00:01:38.020> really<00:01:38.200> important<00:01:40.110> factor<00:01:41.110> in

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
doing that's really important factor in

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:49.100 
doing that's really important factor in
our<00:01:42.360> removal<00:01:43.360> our<00:01:43.659> process<00:01:45.149> he

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.940 

it's<00:01:49.680> very<00:01:49.830> important<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.370> them<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.950> de-stress

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it's very important to them to de-stress

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.490 
it's very important to them to de-stress
that<00:01:53.250> people<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.120> look<00:01:55.110> inside

that people to really look inside

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.190 
that people to really look inside
