00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
let's go ahead and get started reason

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.390 
let's go ahead and get started reason
number<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.050> no<00:00:25.380> quick<00:00:25.710> charging<00:00:26.160> now

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
number one is no quick charging now

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.790

for<00:00:29.039> me<00:00:29.130> wireless<00:00:29.609> charging<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.060> not<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
for me wireless charging is not really a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.450 
for me wireless charging is not really a
deal<00:00:31.019> breaker<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> reason<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.340> buy

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
deal breaker or a reason not to buy

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
quick charging and also no removable
battery<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.920> disappointment<00:01:35.579> in

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
battery is kind of a disappointment in

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.840 
battery is kind of a disappointment in
my<00:01:36.030> eyes<00:01:36.270> now<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.110> far<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.740> no<00:01:37.950> micro<00:01:38.340> SD

my phones very often I really am NOT a
big<00:01:43.799> app<00:01:44.009> hog<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.180> of

those<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.740> things<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.159> really

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
those kind of things I don't really

are<00:01:55.500> lots<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.759> really

are lots of you out there that really

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.240 
are lots of you out there that really

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
need that extra expandable storage and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429 
need that extra expandable storage and
you're<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> be<00:02:00.090> stuck<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.780> OTG

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you're going to be stuck with like OTG

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.679 
you're going to be stuck with like OTG
types<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.340> storage<00:02:02.729> because<00:02:03.000> there's<00:02:03.540> not

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
types of storage because there's not

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.870 
types of storage because there's not
going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.259> microSD<00:02:05.159> card<00:02:05.399> slot<00:02:05.460> now<00:02:05.850> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
going to be a microSD card slot now I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.850 
going to be a microSD card slot now I
kind<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.149> thought<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.840> an<00:02:07.110> obvious

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
kind of thought that this was an obvious

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.680 
kind of thought that this was an obvious
thing<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.729> they<00:02:08.849> actually<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> dual

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
thing because they actually have a dual

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
thing because they actually have a dual
SIM<00:02:10.349> slot<00:02:10.649> now<00:02:10.800> while<00:02:10.950> dual<00:02:11.250> sim<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.819> pretty

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
SIM slot now while dual sim is pretty

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.090 
SIM slot now while dual sim is pretty
cool<00:02:12.209> because<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.410> say

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
cool because you can have like say

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.530 
cool because you can have like say
business<00:02:14.340> phone<00:02:14.580> number<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.240> also<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
business phone number and also a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.790 
business phone number and also a
personal<00:02:15.750> phone<00:02:16.080> number<00:02:16.110> that's<00:02:16.410> pretty<00:02:16.650> cool

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
personal phone number that's pretty cool

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.740 
personal phone number that's pretty cool
most<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.490> us<00:02:17.610> probably<00:02:17.820> won't<00:02:18.150> use<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.360> dual

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
most of us probably won't use that dual

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.360 
most of us probably won't use that dual
SIM<00:02:19.110> card<00:02:19.410> slot<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.740> don't<00:02:19.890> know<00:02:19.980> maybe<00:02:20.130> it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
SIM card slot I don't know maybe it's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.950 
SIM card slot I don't know maybe it's
more<00:02:20.550> popular<00:02:21.000> than<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.270> think<00:02:21.510> let<00:02:21.660> me<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.840> in

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
more popular than I think let me know in

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.450 
more popular than I think let me know in
the<00:02:21.990> comments<00:02:22.410> below<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> feeling<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
the comments below I have a feeling that

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.370 
the comments below I have a feeling that
most<00:02:23.670> people<00:02:23.940> won't<00:02:24.150> use<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.690> dual<00:02:24.840> SIM<00:02:25.140> card

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
most people won't use the dual SIM card

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.750 
most people won't use the dual SIM card
and<00:02:25.620> maybe<00:02:25.800> what<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.100> could<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.310> done<00:02:26.400> is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
and maybe what they could have done is

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.330 
and maybe what they could have done is
included<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.330> microSD<00:02:28.080> card<00:02:28.320> slot<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.010> sim

included a microSD card slot and a sim

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.030 
included a microSD card slot and a sim

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.900 
for me it's just kind of a weird
omission<00:03:01.140> I'm<00:03:01.260> not<00:03:01.440> someone<00:03:01.860> who<00:03:01.980> uses<00:03:02.310> NFC<00:03:02.820> on

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
omission I'm not someone who uses NFC on

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.300 
omission I'm not someone who uses NFC on
a<00:03:02.940> daily<00:03:03.120> basis<00:03:03.570> but<00:03:04.110> if<00:03:04.260> Android<00:03:04.770> pay<00:03:04.950> were<00:03:05.190> to

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
a daily basis but if Android pay were to

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.980 
a daily basis but if Android pay were to
take<00:03:05.460> off<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.910> many<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.510> places<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.810> I

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
take off in many of the places that I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.380 
take off in many of the places that I
shop<00:03:07.230> took<00:03:07.500> Android<00:03:07.890> pay<00:03:08.070> then<00:03:08.640> maybe<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.000> would

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
shop took Android pay then maybe I would

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.330 
shop took Android pay then maybe I would
have<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.600> use<00:03:09.960> for<00:03:09.990> that<00:03:10.200> NFC<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.250> think

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
have a use for that NFC I just think

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.650 
have a use for that NFC I just think
it's<00:03:11.490> kind<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.760> weird<00:03:11.790> omission<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.480> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
it's kind of a weird omission and that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.360 
it's kind of a weird omission and that
would<00:03:12.810> be<00:03:12.930> my<00:03:13.380> third<00:03:13.410> reason<00:03:13.830> for<00:03:14.100> not<00:03:14.220> buying

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
would be my third reason for not buying

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.600 
would be my third reason for not buying
the<00:03:14.550> oneplus<00:03:14.910> 2<00:03:15.480> reason<00:03:15.930> number<00:03:16.020> 4<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.620> no<00:03:17.010> 2k

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
the oneplus 2 reason number 4 is no 2k

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.330 
the oneplus 2 reason number 4 is no 2k
just<00:03:18.510> 1080p<00:03:19.170> depending<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.740> who<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.010> are<00:03:20.160> this

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
may be a deal breaker or it may be a

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.690 
may be a deal breaker or it may be a
plus<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:22.830> you're<00:03:22.980> someone<00:03:23.250> who's<00:03:23.400> more

interested in battery life the 1080p

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.140 
interested in battery life the 1080p
screen<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.070> going<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> plus<00:03:26.700> for<00:03:26.940> you

screen is going to be a plus for you

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.170 
screen is going to be a plus for you
because<00:03:28.020> 1080p<00:03:28.860> just<00:03:29.400> saves<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.760> little<00:03:29.970> bit<00:03:30.090> of

because 1080p just saves a little bit of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.970 
because 1080p just saves a little bit of

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
better like the 2k display drains better

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.250 
better like the 2k display drains better
a<00:03:32.070> little<00:03:32.310> quicker<00:03:32.610> not<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.780> much<00:03:33.990> quicker
