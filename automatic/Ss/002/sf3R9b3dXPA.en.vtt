then honestly after that it's like I
don't<00:01:44.940> remember<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:46.549> because<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.729> had

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
don't remember it because because we had

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
don't remember it because because we had
rain<00:01:48.150> we<00:01:48.360> were<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.890> was

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
rain we were in and out and it was

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.680 
rain we were in and out and it was
really<00:01:50.220> encouraging<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> me<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.330> I<00:01:51.360> saw

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
really encouraging to me because I saw

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.780 
really encouraging to me because I saw
well<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> play<00:01:52.470> well<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
well when I play well I have the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.460 
well when I play well I have the
potential<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> keep<00:01:55.140> improving

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
potential I just want to keep improving

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
potential I just want to keep improving
I<00:01:55.920> think<00:01:56.220> it's<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.420> easy<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.810> get

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
I think it's really easy to get

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.960 
I think it's really easy to get
complacent<00:01:58.320> sometimes<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.640> want<00:01:59.940> to

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
complacent sometimes and I just want to

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.490 
complacent sometimes and I just want to
make<00:02:00.119> sure<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.479> always<00:02:00.780> am<00:02:01.140> working

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
make sure that I always am working

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.410 
make sure that I always am working
harder<00:02:01.830> wanting<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.490> better<00:02:02.700> finding<00:02:03.300> new

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
harder wanting to get better finding new

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
harder wanting to get better finding new
ways<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.810> get<00:02:03.930> better<00:02:04.080> but<00:02:04.619> there's<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> lot<00:02:05.159> to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
ways to get better but there's a lot to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.649 
ways to get better but there's a lot to
