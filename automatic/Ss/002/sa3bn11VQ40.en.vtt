00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
know ideal my larger spec for doing that

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.729 
know ideal my larger spec for doing that
I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:36.510> Martinez<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> gonna<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> little

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
I think Martinez is gonna be a little

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
I think Martinez is gonna be a little
bit<00:00:37.860> too<00:00:38.010> much<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.219> him<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.300> Martinez

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
bit too much for him I think Martinez

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.959 
bit too much for him I think Martinez
this<00:00:39.870> quicker<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.500> smarter<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> ring<00:00:41.370> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
this quicker and smarter in the ring so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.619 
this quicker and smarter in the ring so
I<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:42.120> mightiness<00:00:42.540> wins<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:44.300> go<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> look

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.880 
beating here he has taken he took his
margarito<00:01:46.640> or<00:01:47.000> he<00:01:47.210> took<00:01:47.450> against<00:01:47.929> pack<00:01:48.500> up<00:01:48.710> our

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.649 
margarito or he took against pack up our
things<00:01:49.399> don't<00:01:49.789> be<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:49.969> type<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.179> fight<00:01:50.420> I

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
things don't be that type of fight I

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.990 
things don't be that type of fight I
think<00:01:51.079> with<00:01:51.200> Martinez<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:52.189> be<00:01:52.310> more<00:01:52.490> Martinez

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
think with Martinez to be more Martinez

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.419 
think with Martinez to be more Martinez
just<00:01:53.810> dominate<00:01:54.350> him<00:01:54.439> with<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.649> jab<00:01:54.679> and<00:01:55.280> and

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
just dominate him with the jab and and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.520 
just dominate him with the jab and and
fighting<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.209> outside<00:01:56.569> just<00:01:57.140> like<00:01:57.259> he<00:01:57.380> was

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
fighting on the outside just like he was

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.029 
fighting on the outside just like he was
doing<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.770> guess<00:01:57.950> Chavez<00:01:58.280> Jr<00:01:59.740> that's<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.829> part

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
doing I guess Chavez Jr that's the part

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.029 
doing I guess Chavez Jr that's the part
I<00:02:01.100> see<00:02:01.310> if<00:02:01.819> he<00:02:02.299> has<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.689> good<00:02:02.959> punch<00:02:03.500> he<00:02:03.860> could

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
I see if he has a good punch he could

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.399 
I see if he has a good punch he could
not<00:02:04.130> come<00:02:04.310> out<00:02:04.490> but<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.479> see<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.899> fight<00:02:06.110> going
