00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.310
 we will continue to talk about the settings 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.020
 computer for games 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.389
 separately discuss the settings of the mouse and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.450
 control for a start I would like to say 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.420
 that there is such a program as 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.139
 secret link to download will be in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.570
 description 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.090
 with it you can how to clean the disk 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.080
 so and the registry that will be favorable 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.470
 affect our performance 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.490
 yes i would like to go to mouse settings 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.270
 to start 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.829
 I can say that mice are not different 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 such mice and mice for computer mice 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.910
 come from 300 rubles 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:49.590
 Chinese and gaming mice about 3 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.239
 5 7 thousand rubles today we will talk about 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.460
 granddaughter's extensive settings that is like 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.219
 inspired mouse and gaming 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.379
 settings principle a bit to start 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.379
 in changing mouse pointers can 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.560
 repeat the action that is the right button 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.110
 mouse pointer change personalization 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.090
 mouse pointer options and here in this 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.320
 field we remove the checkboxes that is, it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 we will stand it simply 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.420
 choose click apply and further ok 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.250
 what is it for 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.409
 mouse on sharp movements cuts 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 distance on the rug and we are cleaning 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.210
 tick off this function and in order 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.979
 to turn a certain angle 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.140
 we spend the usual distance for us 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:42.200
 mouse on the mat further I would like to 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 go to the driver settings for the mouse 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.049
 here we have a mouse speed check 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.979
 we expose the greatest that is 1000 hertz 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.149
 it affects 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.399
 that's the same mouse speed usually 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.119
 expose about 500 hertz why because 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.190
 what 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.259
 food hertz still loads our 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.509
 processor performance drops when 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.670
 Well, if you have a powerful computer 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.660
 put nothing be afraid everything will be 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.489
 excellent here it is written click for 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.019
 checking though really it is speed 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.060
 mouse response speed 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:26.310
 ordinary mice about 15 18 units that is 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.010
 milliseconds and here we have one 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.959
 millisecond is gaming mice can with 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.290
 so fast react well to him and and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.990
 exhibit given would like to say height 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.580
 response 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.610
 that is , we adjust the height 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.230
 I personally use very low 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.690
 because 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.269
 I often have to twist jag 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.290
 screw the thunder something else and I 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.299
 I lift the mouse as I play 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.060
 low sensitivity i have to and 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:02.269
 when you lift and carry further you 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.019
 expose as already you are comfortable here it is 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:10.560
 does not change anything and pluto is 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.220
 apple or whatever i click apply 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.530
 as if we are looking at these columns 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.319
 should be five macros is not yet 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.810
 I know berries looked about 4 months 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.970
 ago I download a program that is well driver 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.799
 on my mouse looked what was needed 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.019
 mask some kind of fuckin on download 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.329
 I did not do this 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.730
 driving like a present moment joy 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.700
 because macros and everything else her 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.730
 forbidden warface that I actually 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.700
 learned from this message that is about 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:47.700
 four months ago I wrote back 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.410
 support services tech support is it possible 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.340
 use a double cloak Here eral 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.480
 click because 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.530
 and friends said something that sometimes can 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.959
 write what you macro and something else 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.459
 there is that time they answered me like that 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.769
 use the double and triple keys 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.870
 click you can at your own risk 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.069
 since they can be counted as macros 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.849
 which are prohibited 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.890
 but this is not a macro the first time such 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.549
 prohibited any automation systems and 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.919
 devices answered me a good little boy well 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.850
 this is our favorite support service from 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:28.810
 nothing else for them to wait 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.160
 it was worth further at least proceed to the setting 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.160
 varfeysa himself 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.260
 mouse sensitivity in the game is worth 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.510
 I am 12 units 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.660
 players playing vkontakte sometimes for 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.320
 different classes put well different 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.979
 Sensitivity for attack aircraft 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.610
 15 units for a medic about 40 units for 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.680
 sniper and even less than 12 there 10 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.770
 let's say less than the attack aircraft I don't and 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.780
 well, an engineer of about 20-25 years 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.820
 also close range i play at all 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:10.600
 grades 12 units and even on medics 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.960
 very rarely i have sensitivity further 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.380
 I would like to say that I put a blow 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:22.210
 I'm standing on the mouse button 4 that is me 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:24.039
 much more comfortable to play and know what i'm 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.919
 at any moment I can not click on the mouse 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.740
 look for a key on the keyboard to 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.099
 respond quickly and hit hit 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.099
 butt 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.520
 I would also like to talk about 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.320
 a key arrangement that is many 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:48.610
 players put grenades 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:52.289
 4 put on Mr. as much that is possible 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.840
 it was quick to throw a grenade down and 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:06:01.539
 it did not take time to choose it 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.430
 and switch and conclusion would be desirable 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.930
 say that in the previous video we already 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.270
 considered how to increase 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.970
 performance of your computer for 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.210
 pps shooters on the example of the game Warface 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.870
 for other shooters there will be a setting 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.970
 similarly in this video we met 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.300
 with the setting of the mouse with the setting 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.090
 mouse drivers with mouse sensitivity 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.229
 and now wish you good luck 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.840
 go to pvp and bend if this is for you 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.440
 fails against dudes with don 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.780
 crowns 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.630
 then just take more boxes and 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.539
 then recover become especially 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.330
 scary bums in stormtroopers since 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.669
 having boxes of ammunition 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.110
 you raise a gun and replenish 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:50.490
 ammo well thanks for watching 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.039
 I will throw a reference in the description 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.810
 likes subscribe to the channel good luck to all 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.810
