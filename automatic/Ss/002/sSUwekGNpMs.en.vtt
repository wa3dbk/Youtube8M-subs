00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.129
 if there is a rule to respect on 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.420
 youtube is that if like me thanks to 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.500
 you and your support we come to 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.760
 increase its number of subscribers 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.020
 spectators are waiting for it to be done by 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.550
 a special video when weeks 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.050
 number is divisible by its but not 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.340
 no matter how one can make one 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.140
 for the 1000 subscribers but nobody 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.210
 will make one for the 1800 subscribers that would be 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.050
 completely stupid in my case I got 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.099
 says that instead of doing like all 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.359
 world is to hand over the trophy to 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.250
 number 1000 why not put it back 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.390
 at numbers 1134 and since 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.500
 it's the one on my channel 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.600
 when I write these lines 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.460
 in addition to that it will give a good 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.290
 lesson at this number he you thought all 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.480
 was due to the number 1000 the baths missed 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.250
 so I give this trophy to number 1134 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.629
 that he has deserved more than you and 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.770
 now let 's be honest a lot 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.239
 of you have discovered kardon 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.440
 pasqualino was pretty cool for you 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.180
 catapult on my channel with his 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.039
 blessing and I thank him for it 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.059
 but this has raised some expectations of 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.199
 the part of some who wanted 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.579
 fervently that I criticize a game in 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.079
 ozone and not 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.309
 professionalism youtube well i have 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.480
 preferred to ignore these queries 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.100
 and that's where gives pasqualino is 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.239
 came to see me by proposing nicely with 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.440
 all the sweetness that falls to him of 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.089
 do a team video together 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.619
 fortress 2 that's why of my full 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.399
 I decided to accept his request and 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.509
 I will now read this 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.050
 statement we wrote 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.640
 together 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.050
 I am particularly happy 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.909
 and honored to leave my place to dan 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.140
 pasqualino we would have all revered his 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.280
 greatness and thank him for us 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.780
 protect every day from the threat 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.759
 extraterrestrial that hovers over our 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.170
 miserable little lives that's it 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.280
 done so I leave voluntarily the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.439
 place in deurne and you have interest in 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.110
 be careful even roof at the back do not 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.430
 do not think we do not see you thank you 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.020
 plouffe team fortress 2 is a 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.860
 valve created hat simulator is 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 released in 2007 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.439
 the goal of the game is to accumulate the most 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.579
 as many virtual hats as possible 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.930
 and this in the way of your choice in 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.280
 win them via the game by buying them 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.630
 by opening virtual cases with 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.860
 virtual keys by pre-ordering others 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.340
 games or exchanging them with 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.810
 other players 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.070
 if you arrive at the level of the headphones 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.450
 you can already be happy but 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.619
 keep in mind that some hat 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.840
 is trading at the price of a car 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.490
 Used ie around $ 5000 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.259
 and we are talking about real money 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.700
 yes yes you heard me all that 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.259
 for a few pixels on a screen me 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.490
 will you say to that some will answer 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.049
 probably only to buy a video game or 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.729
 even tiny on a different scale 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.350
 also paid to see pixels 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.340
 move on a screen the simulator of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.369
 valve cap has this particular 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.869
 than apart from which one announces at the moment 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.549
 that team fortress 2 is actually a 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.200
 unique multiplayer fps that 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.579
 offers a balanced original gameplay 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.260
 and that in addition to being fun is totally 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.190
 free this information seems to have 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.790
 passed under the nose of a lot of players 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.079
 but either 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.489
 like in most fps online 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.449
 the game sees two teams clashed 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.590
 in different game modes 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.940
 with the difference that players can 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.690
 choose from nine classes that offers 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.460
 nine styles of play 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.900
 different the small and fast scout the 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.400
 soldier and his rockets the mysterious 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.810
 pierrot the demoman often stuffed the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.060
 heavy the engineer and his constructions 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.140
 the medic the sniper and the spy all 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.400
 works with many subtleties 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.780
 mostly very balanced 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.280
 that will have to be discovered 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.780
 parties each of these classes to his 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.740
 very specific role in a team even though 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.240
 some find it smart to have 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.890
 a team with over 300 hours in 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.180
 attack the fair also very present 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.620
 and quite pleasant and impressive to 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.910
 look on the competitive stage at high 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.650
 level because it is focused both on the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.030
 tactical pure skip and coordination 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.680
 teams even though the game came out in 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.940
 2007 he did not really get old because he 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.740
 do not look for realism and style 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.880
 a little colorful cartoon very appreciable 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.020
 and then the advantage is that the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.340
 game is not too greedy even a 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.690
 toaster can rotate it from our 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.830
 days if you ask yourself anyway 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.060
 why the game has not aged the 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.380
 answer is simple indeed if you 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.370
 compare the game as it was at its 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.660
 exit and the one as it is 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.980
 today there is a huge chasm 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.000
 such a comparative approach is 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.530
 by the way possible by doing a trick 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 on the console version of the game that in 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.230
 more to be more desert than the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.730
 pluton surface did not know the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.020
 hundreds of balancing updates 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.730
 twic and new objects in the 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.570
 pc version to which hundreds of 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.700
 thousands of players connect each 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.080
 day has benefited one of the updates 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.610
 who marked the turning point of the game and who 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.270
 shows well small economic genius 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.620
 guy from home 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.510
 finally a little guy how to talk 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.650
 because gabe newell that's what so 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.420
 this update is the month of 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.130
 June 2011 when valve sensing that his 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.300
 tiring tiring decided not to 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.950
 down the two armies two maps in one 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.820
 nice stamped package says she went there 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.440
 sold 15 euros 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.940
 no they decided instead to make the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.260
 free game I can already see it wide 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.489
 the eyes of astonishment and astonishment do not 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.660
 do not understand how to make a game 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.190
 free may increase his 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.959
 recipes without offering paid content 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.130
 that it is obligatory to obtain this 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.360
 which is undoubtedly the Calais definition 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.230
 chronicart that in mind when we 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.360
 say they want to bet in the 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.560
 future on free to play with big 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.730
 quotation marks well it's not the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.050
 valve vision indeed in team 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.489
 fortress 2 any case the slightest influence 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.690
 on the gameplay can be obtained very 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.950
 easily by any player 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.450
 even one who did not spend a single 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.739
 penny in the game besides the weapons 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.730
 basic that we have as soon as we launch the 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.230
 game are very often the most effective 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.790
 we are far from the world where we have to pay 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.630
 to get the most powerful weapon and 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.980
 smash everyone 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.690
 invest money in the young will have 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.920
 an effect that on the aesthetic value of 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.330
 your characters in game thanks to the hat 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.010
 to the armies slice it that counts 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.420
 number of kills to get these items 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.830
 you will have to spend money or do 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.450
 trade activity for which he 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.010
 must be premium a real 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.450
 economy was created each object at its 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.650
 eigenvalue determined by its rarity 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.030
 in the game and by supply and demand 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.590
 players who trade and 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.210
 valve manages to make money there 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.860
 on it and not just a little money 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.330
 a mountain of money that barely arrives 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.040
 to imagine people to pay 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.600
 for a few pixels is unthinkable 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.100
 where valve has succeeded is that the fact 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.210
 to exchange and obtain even objects 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.980
 if they have no influence on the 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.420
 gameplay is very addictive it will be 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.590
 really a game in the game and then 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.760
 even if sometimes we have the impression of 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.020
 spend the money to wind it 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.370
 justify by thinking that at least we 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.900
 supports the developers of a lot of 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.160
 our favorite games of people who are at 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.390
 the origin of an excellent platform for 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.500
 games on pc and who has a vision of 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.640
 the industry much closer to the players 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.890
 than yesterday's activision-blizzard 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.120
 thuy soft and consorts in the end 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.410
 the important thing is not to lose 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.360
 of view that tf2 before being a 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.160
 Guard simulator virtual dress to pay 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.960
 win is an online multiplayer fps game 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
 both excellent and refreshing 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.540
 do not forget to play and 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.650
 to enjoy what you want 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.310
 do it for free and without restriction 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.420
 any 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.420
 hat to the valves 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.960
 bah 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.160
 happy
