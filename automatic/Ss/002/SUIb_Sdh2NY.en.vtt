00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:23.208
Tonight, the Moon will come closer to the Earth
than ever during the last two thousand year.

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:29.542
Yaaay!

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:37.167
Hello. Yeah! Don't you worry, Dad.
We're all just fine!

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:40.607
Got it: In bed by ten. Alright.
Love you. Bye-bye.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.690
Mom and Dad are going to get home
later than they thought. Dad said you

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.816
guys have to do whatever I say and
I say that it's time to go to bed!

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:01.125
Didn't you hear what I just said? Alex?

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:02.625
Just one more minute...

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:07.167
Liza... Do you have any idea
what an important day this is?

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:10.559
The day is over now! Mom and Dad
expect us all to be in our beds

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:13.649
by ten o'clock. And they've made
me their official enforcer!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.417
But...

00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:17.003
I'm not interested in your "but".
All of you get to

00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:19.524
bed this minute. And I will
be checking up on you.

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:39.167
Someone's out of bed!

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.999
The halfback passes... Max steals it again...

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:51.167
Alex! Are you asleep?

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:10.249
Max!!!! Maaax!!!!

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.707
He kicks the ball... Goal!!

00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:14.833
Brother, wake up!!!!

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:20.833
Somebody has made a copy of Alex! Two
Alexes are out there! I'm scared Max!

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:21.750
Two...

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:23.083
Alexes??!

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:57.125
Hurry, tie him up! Quick!
Give up, doggelganger!!

00:02:57.126 --> 00:03:00.358
What are you doing? It's me! Let me go!
Gotcha! Don't try anything stupid!

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:02.750
What are you guys doing? Is that Alex?

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.208
This is not Alex. Alex is in bed!

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.875
Alex! Alex, wake up!

00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:23.667
This isn't Alex. It's just
some pillows and a computer.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:24.000
Well, of course I am! What is going on?

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:25.667
Alex! You're yourself!

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.500
We thought you'd been a little cloned.

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:33.982
No. It's a decoy! It's
programmed to turn on the sleep

00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:37.441
sounds if someone happens to open the door.
Check this out.

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:42.208
When you open the door these levers and
weights switch the computer recording

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:46.232
on. And when the door gets closed, the
sound turns off again. And that's all.

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:49.874
What a good idea!

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.334
It's pretty awesome, Alex.

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:53.750
But why on Earth did you bother to build it?

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.925
To keep you from getting in the
way of my Moon research on

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.025
this unique night! The Moon will
be coming closer to the Earth

00:03:58.026 --> 00:04:00.059
tonight than it ever has in the
last two thousand years. I'm

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:01.982
talking about twenty centuries, people!
I can't miss it!

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:09.592
00:04:07;06	00:04:11:14	And you're worried about
some silly bedtime. We're all missing history!

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:33.667
Wow! It looks so close! It's beautiful!

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.125
Alex, thanks so much!
