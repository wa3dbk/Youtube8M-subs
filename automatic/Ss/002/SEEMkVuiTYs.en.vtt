that's really about it about it how do
we<00:00:34.780> stop<00:00:35.110> him<00:00:35.440> well<00:00:35.920> we<00:00:36.219> have<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.670> find<00:00:36.879> things

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
we stop him well we have to find things

that<00:00:43.000> must<00:00:43.239> be<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.480> energy<00:00:43.600> flux<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.260> picked<00:00:44.500> up

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
that must be the energy flux I picked up

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.680 
that must be the energy flux I picked up
in<00:00:44.769> the<00:00:44.860> meadow<00:00:45.040> but<00:00:45.879> how<00:00:46.030> do<00:00:46.089> we<00:00:46.180> find<00:00:46.449> ed

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
in the meadow but how do we find ed

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.069 
in the meadow but how do we find ed
Trobe<00:00:46.989> with<00:00:47.470> my<00:00:47.680> PDA<00:00:48.250> it's<00:00:49.120> been<00:00:49.329> pre<00:00:49.600> tuned<00:00:49.870> to

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
Trobe with my PDA it's been pre tuned to

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.209 
Trobe with my PDA it's been pre tuned to
enter<00:00:50.440> AUB's<00:00:50.559> energy<00:00:51.129> spectrum<00:00:52.920> aha

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
enter AUB's energy spectrum aha

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:11.219 
enter AUB's energy spectrum aha
there's<00:00:54.429> the<00:00:54.609> PDA<00:00:54.879> alarm<00:00:55.300> now<00:01:09.450> Emma<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.660> think

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
there's the PDA alarm now Emma I think

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.150 
there's the PDA alarm now Emma I think
they're<00:01:11.380> up<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.619> something

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
they're up to something

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.880 
they're up to something
really<00:01:12.909> I<00:01:13.149> never<00:01:13.690> would<00:01:13.899> have<00:01:13.960> guessed<00:01:14.229> well

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
really I never would have guessed well

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.910 
really I never would have guessed well
that's<00:01:15.250> why<00:01:15.550> I'm<00:01:15.789> what<00:01:16.330> Berman<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:17.500> course

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
that's why I'm what Berman of course

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.859 
that's why I'm what Berman of course
they're<00:01:18.159> up<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.310> something<00:01:18.820> they're<00:01:19.600> going<00:01:19.750> to

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
they're up to something they're going to

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.120 
they're up to something they're going to
blow<00:01:20.020> up<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.259> mountain<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.679> trigger<00:01:20.979> volcanic

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
blow up the mountain to trigger volcanic

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.219 
blow up the mountain to trigger volcanic
eruption<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.149> that<00:01:22.420> could<00:01:22.630> destroy<00:01:23.020> the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
eruption and that could destroy the

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.039 
eruption and that could destroy the
island<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:24.250> have<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.729> stop<00:01:25.030> them<00:01:25.390> right<00:01:25.750> we

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
island we have to stop them right we

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.340 
island we have to stop them right we
have<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.380> stop<00:01:26.409> them<00:01:26.799> how<00:01:27.640> well<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.960> only<00:01:29.079> a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
have to stop them how well the only a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.149 
have to stop them how well the only a
lava<00:01:29.710> lamp

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
lava lamp

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.249 
lava lamp
good<00:01:30.520> idea<00:01:31.270> that'll<00:01:31.570> go<00:01:31.689> great<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.170> then

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
good idea that'll go great and then

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:53.160 
good idea that'll go great and then
troves<00:01:32.530> trap

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.080 

hyperman<00:01:54.200> can<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:54.860> suggest<00:01:55.430> we<00:01:55.580> go<00:01:55.700> look<00:01:55.880> at<00:01:55.970> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
hyperman can I suggest we go look at the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.680 
hyperman can I suggest we go look at the
chalkboard<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:01.490> angle<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.000> incidence<00:02:02.180> equals

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
chalkboard the angle of incidence equals

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.380 
chalkboard the angle of incidence equals
the<00:02:02.960> angle<00:02:03.050> of<00:02:03.440> reflection<00:02:03.730> this<00:02:04.730> means<00:02:05.000> that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
the angle of reflection this means that

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.180 
the angle of reflection this means that
whatever<00:02:05.630> angle<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.200> light<00:02:06.380> hits<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.800> mirror

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
whatever angle the light hits the mirror

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.219 
whatever angle the light hits the mirror
it<00:02:07.460> will<00:02:07.700> bounce<00:02:07.850> off<00:02:08.149> at<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.479> same<00:02:08.690> angle<00:02:08.960> in

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
it will bounce off at the same angle in

00:02:09.229 --> 00:03:02.630 
it will bounce off at the same angle in
the<00:02:09.380> opposite<00:02:09.860> direction

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:32.800 

with<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.820> Walker<00:03:04.120> okay<00:03:04.900> good<00:03:05.260> thank<00:03:05.500> you

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.330 

maybe<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:34.080> can<00:03:34.230> use<00:03:34.350> my<00:03:34.530> optical<00:03:35.040> refraction

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
maybe we can use my optical refraction

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.910 
maybe we can use my optical refraction
experiment<00:03:36.240> to<00:03:36.510> bounce<00:03:36.720> sunlight<00:03:37.020> inside<00:03:37.710> the

experiment to bounce sunlight inside the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.740 
experiment to bounce sunlight inside the

mineshaft and melt the ice around the
bomb<00:03:39.960> I've<00:03:40.470> been<00:03:40.680> experimenting<00:03:41.070> with

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
bomb I've been experimenting with

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.070 
bomb I've been experimenting with
mirrors<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:41.970> an<00:03:42.060> attempt<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.480> illuminate<00:03:42.930> the

inside<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.560> mineshaft<00:03:43.770> I've<00:03:44.610> mounted<00:03:44.880> a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
inside of the mineshaft I've mounted a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.670 
inside of the mineshaft I've mounted a
high-powered<00:03:45.630> lens<00:03:45.780> at<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.110> entrance<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.560> the

high-powered lens at the entrance to the
mineshaft

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
mineshaft

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.370

to<00:03:47.490> direct<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.850> sunlight<00:03:48.210> inside<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.200> from

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
to direct the sunlight inside and from

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.620 
to direct the sunlight inside and from
there<00:03:49.620> using<00:03:50.280> other<00:03:50.430> mirrors<00:03:50.820> we<00:03:51.300> should<00:03:51.510> be

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
there using other mirrors we should be

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.150 
there using other mirrors we should be
able<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.840> aim<00:03:51.990> the<00:03:52.140> sunlight<00:03:52.500> directly<00:03:52.740> on<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.980 
able to aim the sunlight directly on the
bomb<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.850> can<00:03:54.030> adjust<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.480> mirrors<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
bomb you can adjust the mirrors in the
