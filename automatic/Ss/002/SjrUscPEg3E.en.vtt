00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.870
 new booster years this morning I hope 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.520

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.840
 today I thought we're going 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.270
 put back to blister packs 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 because the normal and low boosters 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.810
 we got a little fed up why because 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.460
 I think you understood it a juice 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.289
 far too rare lately 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.360
 and I told myself that if I buy 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.040
 maybe a bit more expensive but how 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.330
 the booster sound blister I would have 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.129
 maybe still a lot more 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.420
 chances of having good picks and I 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.220
 I'm sure that lack by buying them 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.480
 not on the internet where the boosters 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.730
 circulates a bit no matter how 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.379
 well, I could have the maximum of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.770
 chances on my side and have a good 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.899
