00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
Nikon d610 which is a higher-end model

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
Nikon d610 which is a higher-end model
but<00:00:51.420> I'll<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.750> using<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> lower<00:00:52.350> end<00:00:52.590> model<00:00:52.920> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
we are going to Porto Cove for this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.100 
we are going to Porto Cove for this
tutorial<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.040> second<00:01:05.670> degree

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
tutorial and that is a second degree

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.899 
tutorial and that is a second degree
pollution<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.700> some

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pollution so we're going to get some

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.170 
pollution so we're going to get some
light<00:01:09.060> pollution<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.680> look<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:11.340> sunset

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
light pollution and look up when sunset

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.600 
light pollution and look up when sunset
is<00:01:12.360> since<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.869> at<00:01:13.229> 7:00<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.250> time<00:01:14.490> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
is since it is at 7:00 at the time of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.870 
is since it is at 7:00 at the time of
this<00:01:14.760> tutorial<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.710> plan<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.130> earliest

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
this tutorial and plan to get earliest

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.340 
this tutorial and plan to get earliest
one<00:01:18.210> hour<00:01:18.330> after<00:01:18.600> sunset

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
one hour after sunset

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.620 
one hour after sunset
because<00:01:20.130> half<00:01:20.610> hour<00:01:20.790> after<00:01:20.939> sunset<00:01:21.270> looks

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
because half hour after sunset looks

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.030 
because half hour after sunset looks
like<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.810> two<00:01:24.810> hours<00:01:25.350> after<00:01:25.799> sunset

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
like this and two hours after sunset

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.160 
like this and two hours after sunset
looks<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:29.040> later<00:01:29.390> better<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
looks like this so the later better the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.640 
looks like this so the later better the
darker<00:01:31.619> better<00:01:32.610> conditions<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.900> detailed

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
darker better conditions for a detailed

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.190 
darker better conditions for a detailed
Milkyway<00:01:35.189> shot<00:01:35.460> also<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.689> sure<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
Milkyway shot also make sure that the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.530 
Milkyway shot also make sure that the
wind<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:37.860> too<00:01:38.040> strong<00:01:38.150> because<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> shaky

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
wind is not too strong because the shaky

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090 
wind is not too strong because the shaky
tripod<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> make<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> horrible

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
tripod is going to make for a horrible

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.510 
tripod is going to make for a horrible
picture<00:01:42.020> next<00:01:43.020> look<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.619> when<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> moon<00:01:44.490> is

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
Milky Way tonight the moon however it's
a<00:02:00.230> 30%<00:02:00.830> but<00:02:00.980> it's<00:02:01.130> gonna<00:02:01.310> set<00:02:01.760> at<00:02:02.090> around<00:02:03.130> 843

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
a 30% but it's gonna set at around 843

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.680 
a 30% but it's gonna set at around 843
so<00:02:04.340> we're<00:02:04.460> going<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.640> get<00:02:04.790> there<00:02:05.000> around<00:02:05.180> 9:00

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
so we're going to get there around 9:00

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.070 
so we're going to get there around 9:00
yeah<00:02:06.490> if<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.730> live<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.150> city<00:02:08.330> then<00:02:08.930> you

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
yeah if you live in the city then you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.540 
yeah if you live in the city then you
need<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.320> get<00:02:09.440> away<00:02:09.590> from<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.160> city<00:02:10.369> lights

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
need to get away from the city lights

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.820 
need to get away from the city lights
and<00:02:10.729> light<00:02:11.030> pollution<00:02:11.210> you<00:02:11.750> will<00:02:12.500> most<00:02:12.740> likely

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
and light pollution you will most likely

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.680 
and light pollution you will most likely
have<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.340> drive<00:02:13.550> at<00:02:13.670> least<00:02:13.700> half<00:02:14.120> an<00:02:14.240> hour<00:02:14.330> I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
have to drive at least half an hour I

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.170 
have to drive at least half an hour I
will<00:02:15.380> be<00:02:15.500> driving<00:02:15.770> 45<00:02:16.070> minutes<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.730> pórtico

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
will be driving 45 minutes the pórtico

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.470 
will be driving 45 minutes the pórtico
to<00:02:17.840> get<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.460> fairly<00:02:19.460> decent<00:02:19.670> low<00:02:20.240> light

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
to get a fairly decent low light

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.280 
to get a fairly decent low light
pollution<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.310> visible<00:02:22.310> night<00:02:22.640> sky<00:02:23.290> all

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
pollution and visible night sky all

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.140 
pollution and visible night sky all
right<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:24.890> you've<00:02:25.130> reached<00:02:25.400> your<00:02:25.580> stargazing

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
right so you've reached your stargazing

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.050 
right so you've reached your stargazing
location<00:02:26.780> now<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.440> time<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.680> find<00:02:28.130> out<00:02:28.610> where

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
location now it's time to find out where

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.810 
location now it's time to find out where
the<00:02:29.180> Milky<00:02:29.450> Way<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.050> sky<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:31.580> photo

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
the Milky Way is on the sky in a photo

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.630 
the Milky Way is on the sky in a photo
Milky<00:02:32.390> Way<00:02:32.480> looks<00:02:32.660> more<00:02:33.050> detailed<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.310> camera

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
Milky Way looks more detailed the camera

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.630 
Milky Way looks more detailed the camera
gathers<00:02:35.030> more<00:02:35.270> light<00:02:35.510> than<00:02:35.870> your<00:02:36.080> eyeball<00:02:36.640> so

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
gathers more light than your eyeball so

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.730 
gathers more light than your eyeball so
this<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.120> how<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.330> Milky<00:02:38.690> Way<00:02:38.780> actually<00:02:39.050> looks

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
this is how the Milky Way actually looks

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.120 
this is how the Milky Way actually looks

show you where the Milky Way is

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.390 
show you where the Milky Way is
positioned<00:02:47.270> but<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.440> recognize<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.310> with

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
positioned but I just recognize it with

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.230
