00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
as a vet I get the opportunity to take

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.999 
as a vet I get the opportunity to take
my<00:00:19.180> dogs<00:00:19.570> out<00:00:19.720> on<00:00:19.930> my<00:00:20.080> rounds<00:00:20.290> with<00:00:20.619> me<00:00:20.800> which

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
my dogs out on my rounds with me which

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.910 
my dogs out on my rounds with me which
is<00:00:21.189> fun<00:00:21.430> for<00:00:21.460> them<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.970> good<00:00:22.119> company<00:00:22.360> for<00:00:22.570> me

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
is fun for them and good company for me

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.320 
is fun for them and good company for me
but<00:00:23.920> I<00:00:23.950> never<00:00:24.189> take<00:00:24.460> them<00:00:24.490> out<00:00:24.730> if<00:00:24.939> I<00:00:25.029> think<00:00:25.090> the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
but I never take them out if I think the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.790 
but I never take them out if I think the
weather<00:00:25.509> is<00:00:25.660> going<00:00:25.779> to<00:00:25.840> be<00:00:25.900> hot<00:00:26.170> because<00:00:26.560> I

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
weather is going to be hot because I

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.380 
weather is going to be hot because I
know<00:00:26.919> about<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.430> risks<00:00:27.730> involved<00:00:30.150> every<00:00:31.150> year

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
know about the risks involved every year

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.759 
know about the risks involved every year
we<00:00:31.660> get<00:00:31.810> dogs<00:00:32.110> brought<00:00:32.379> to<00:00:32.529> us<00:00:32.559> with

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
we get dogs brought to us with

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.500 
we get dogs brought to us with
heatstroke<00:00:33.100> dogs<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:33.850> have<00:00:33.970> been<00:00:34.120> left<00:00:34.360> in

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
heatstroke dogs that have been left in

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.960 
heatstroke dogs that have been left in
hot<00:00:34.720> cars<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.980> despite<00:00:36.370> our<00:00:36.400> best<00:00:36.730> efforts

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
hot cars and despite our best efforts

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.110 
hot cars and despite our best efforts
some<00:00:37.930> of<00:00:38.019> them<00:00:38.170> died<00:00:38.580> the<00:00:39.580> trouble<00:00:39.879> is<00:00:39.970> people

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
some of them died the trouble is people

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.030 
some of them died the trouble is people
don't<00:00:40.360> realize<00:00:40.870> just<00:00:41.140> how<00:00:41.260> dangerous<00:00:41.530> cars

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
don't realize just how dangerous cars

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.820 
don't realize just how dangerous cars
are<00:00:42.309> because<00:00:43.000> they<00:00:43.090> heat<00:00:43.239> up<00:00:43.269> so<00:00:43.540> quickly<00:00:43.830> so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
are because they heat up so quickly so

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.039 
are because they heat up so quickly so
let's<00:00:44.979> do<00:00:45.159> a<00:00:45.190> little<00:00:45.309> experiment<00:00:46.000> but<00:00:46.780> first

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.049 
let's do a little experiment but first

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:56.579 
let's do a little experiment but first
of<00:00:47.199> all<00:00:47.379> I'll<00:00:47.680> just<00:00:47.979> take<00:00:48.190> my<00:00:48.309> dogs<00:00:48.549> out<00:00:55.589> so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
of all I'll just take my dogs out so

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.109 
of all I'll just take my dogs out so
I've<00:00:56.860> got<00:00:57.070> this<00:00:57.190> handy<00:00:57.580> little<00:00:57.699> thermometer

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
I've got this handy little thermometer

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:00.840 
I've got this handy little thermometer
here<00:00:59.190> that's<00:01:00.190> going<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.400> tell<00:01:00.610> me<00:01:00.729> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
here that's going to tell me the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.289 
here that's going to tell me the
temperature<00:01:01.360> inside<00:01:01.839> and<00:01:02.320> outside<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.710> car

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
temperature inside and outside the car

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.030 
temperature inside and outside the car
now<00:01:04.299> instantly<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:05.110> tells<00:01:05.379> us<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.890> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
now instantly it tells us that the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.920 
now instantly it tells us that the
temperature<00:01:06.190> outside<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.820> 21<00:01:07.330> degrees<00:01:07.690> which

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
temperature outside is 21 degrees which

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.780 
temperature outside is 21 degrees which
is<00:01:08.049> not<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.350> hot<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:08.890> yet<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.430> temperature

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
is not that hot and yet the temperature

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.630 
is not that hot and yet the temperature
inside<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.180> car<00:01:10.510> is<00:01:10.659> 26<00:01:11.200> degrees

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.860 

I've<00:01:17.640> been<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:17.940> car<00:01:18.150> ten<00:01:18.390> minutes<00:01:18.690> now

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
I've been in this car ten minutes now

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.450 
I've been in this car ten minutes now
and<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.530> getting<00:01:19.620> quite<00:01:19.950> warm<00:01:20.220> in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and it's really getting quite warm in

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
and it's really getting quite warm in
fact<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.180> than<00:01:21.300> 10<00:01:21.540> degrees<00:01:21.870> warmer

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
fact it's more than 10 degrees warmer

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
fact it's more than 10 degrees warmer
than<00:01:22.380> outside<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.190> I'm<00:01:23.280> beginning<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.640> sweat

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
than outside and I'm beginning to sweat

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.510 
than outside and I'm beginning to sweat
now<00:01:24.240> dogs<00:01:25.140> can't<00:01:25.440> sweat<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.040> only<00:01:26.160> pant

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
now dogs can't sweat they can only pant

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
now dogs can't sweat they can only pant
they<00:01:27.270> lose<00:01:27.480> heat<00:01:27.810> by<00:01:28.260> pulling<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.770> cool<00:01:29.070> air

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
they lose heat by pulling in cool air

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.800 
they lose heat by pulling in cool air
and<00:01:29.520> warming<00:01:30.120> it<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.510> their<00:01:30.630> body

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and warming it up with their body

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.660 
and warming it up with their body
temperature<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:31.950> airs<00:01:32.070> already<00:01:32.370> worn

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
temperature and if the airs already worn

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.480 
temperature and if the airs already worn
the<00:01:33.060> panting<00:01:33.480> doesn't<00:01:33.660> work<00:01:34.340> people<00:01:35.340> leave

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the panting doesn't work people leave

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
the panting doesn't work people leave
bowls<00:01:35.760> of<00:01:35.910> water<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.420> cars<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.080> dogs<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
bowls of water in cars for dogs and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.780 
bowls of water in cars for dogs and
maybe<00:01:37.680> leave<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.010> window<00:01:38.250> open<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> few<00:01:38.640> inches

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
maybe leave the window open a few inches

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.610 
maybe leave the window open a few inches
but<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.080> going<00:01:40.260> to<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.440> any

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
but that's really not going to make any

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.470 
but that's really not going to make any
difference<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:41.550> temperature<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.120> this<00:01:42.210> car

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
difference the temperature in this car

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:52.130 
difference the temperature in this car
is<00:01:42.720> climbing<00:01:43.260> rapidly

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690

very<00:01:55.920> unpleasant<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.180> out

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
very unpleasant and I'm going to get out

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.720 
very unpleasant and I'm going to get out
