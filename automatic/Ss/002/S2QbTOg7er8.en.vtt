here<00:00:44.910> where<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.870> hard<00:00:46.110> drive<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.710> now<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
here where the hard drive is now the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
here where the hard drive is now the
hard<00:00:47.489> drive<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.910> P<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
hard drive and this P and this a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.290 
hard drive and this P and this a
computer<00:00:49.559> has<00:00:49.680> already<00:00:49.890> been<00:00:50.070> removed<00:00:50.300> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
computer has already been removed so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.529 
computer has already been removed so
we're<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> skip<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.260> step<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:53.539> let's

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
we're going to skip that step but let's

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:14.359 
we're going to skip that step but let's
get<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.160> doing<00:00:56.160> this<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.170> voila<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:14.100> comes

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
get to doing this and voila out comes

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.499 
get to doing this and voila out comes
this<00:01:14.549> piece<00:01:16.340> okay<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.759> our<00:01:17.880> ram<00:01:18.090> slots

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
this piece okay these are our ram slots

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.560 
this piece okay these are our ram slots
in<00:01:18.810> case<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> add<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.799> RAM<00:01:20.570> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
in case you want to add more RAM and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
in case you want to add more RAM and
this<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> empty<00:01:22.259> chamber<00:01:22.710> where<00:01:23.130> our<00:01:23.159> hard

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
this is the empty chamber where our hard

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
this is the empty chamber where our hard
drive<00:01:23.670> will<00:01:23.820> go<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.509> went<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> micro<00:01:25.259> center

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
drive will go so we went to micro center

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.420 
drive will go so we went to micro center
in<00:01:25.970> cambridge<00:01:26.970> set<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.750> getting<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.530> box<00:01:28.860> hard

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
in cambridge set up getting a box hard

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.550 
in cambridge set up getting a box hard
drive<00:01:29.700> which<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.140> much<00:01:31.380> more

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
drive which is actually much more

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
drive which is actually much more
expensive<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.159> fancy<00:01:32.310> packaging<00:01:32.549> they

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
expensive for the fancy packaging they

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.910 
expensive for the fancy packaging they
buy<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.720> bulk<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.500> bunch<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.770> these

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
buy in bulk so they get a bunch of these

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.140 
buy in bulk so they get a bunch of these
hard<00:01:35.130> drives<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.759> they're<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.030> not

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
hard drives and they're just not
