so<00:00:06.390> now<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.600> have<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.020> valve<00:00:07.230> box<00:00:07.589> here<00:00:07.980> pretty

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
so now we have the valve box here pretty

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.980 
so now we have the valve box here pretty
much<00:00:08.340> pretty<00:00:08.940> well<00:00:09.150> buttoned<00:00:09.450> up<00:00:09.599> we've<00:00:09.960> got

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
much pretty well buttoned up we've got

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.049 
much pretty well buttoned up we've got
the<00:00:10.620> two<00:00:10.800> valves<00:00:11.040> installed<00:00:11.519> all<00:00:11.880> the

variety of functions right in the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.389 
variety of functions right in the
programmer<00:00:36.000> you'll<00:00:36.780> want<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.140> turn<00:00:37.469> utilize

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
programmer you'll want to turn utilize

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.130 
programmer you'll want to turn utilize
this<00:00:38.700> while<00:00:39.120> you've<00:00:39.329> got<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.719> two-wire<00:00:40.110> path

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
this while you've got the two-wire path

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.799 
this while you've got the two-wire path
energized<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.670> right<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.270> decoders

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
energized so right now this decoders

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690

what we'll do is we're going to press
the<00:02:36.310> forward<00:02:36.670> arrow<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.270> continue<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.989> it

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
the forward arrow to continue and it

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.979 
the forward arrow to continue and it
shows<00:02:38.980> us<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.250> output<00:02:39.550> number<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.480> set<00:02:40.810> at

shows us the output number one is set at
zero<00:02:41.290> zero<00:02:41.620> zero<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:42.250> this<00:02:42.370> decoder<00:02:42.700> has<00:02:42.910> not

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
zero zero zero so this decoder has not
