next<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.720> an<00:02:41.720> iphone<00:02:42.230> 3g<00:02:42.670> for<00:02:43.670> size<00:02:44.889> see<00:02:45.889> this

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
next to an iphone 3g for size see this

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.319 
next to an iphone 3g for size see this
is<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.750> 123<00:02:48.760> by<00:02:49.760> 59<00:02:50.180> by<00:02:50.510> 12<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.099> it's<00:02:52.120> it's<00:02:53.120> pretty

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
is a 123 by 59 by 12 so it's it's pretty

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.819 
is a 123 by 59 by 12 so it's it's pretty
thin<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> little<00:02:54.049> bit<00:02:54.230> longer<00:02:54.409> and<00:02:54.650> it

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
thin it is a little bit longer and it

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.319 
thin it is a little bit longer and it
does<00:02:55.069> feel<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> little<00:02:55.400> bit<00:02:55.750> big<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:56.900> your<00:02:57.019> hand

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
does feel a little bit big in your hand

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
big in the pocket too but it's pretty

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.500 
big in the pocket too but it's pretty
it's<00:03:01.250> pretty<00:03:01.459> thin<00:03:01.849> and<00:03:03.069> it's<00:03:04.069> got<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.250> its<00:03:04.700> got

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
it's pretty thin and it's got a its got

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.610 
it's pretty thin and it's got a its got
a<00:03:05.629> nice<00:03:05.840> chrome<00:03:06.230> trim<00:03:06.920> on<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.069> which<00:03:08.500> makes<00:03:09.500> it

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
a nice chrome trim on it which makes it

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.869 
a nice chrome trim on it which makes it
actually<00:03:09.950> feel<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.459> little<00:03:10.579> bit<00:03:10.730> more

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
actually feel a little bit more

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.349 
actually feel a little bit more
expensive<00:03:11.120> than<00:03:11.389> it<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.659> and<00:03:12.700> then<00:03:13.700> i'll<00:03:14.299> go

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
expensive than it is and then i'll go

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.309 
expensive than it is and then i'll go
into<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.870> camera<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.840> can<00:03:17.900> take<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.109> look

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
into the camera so you can take a look

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.229 
into the camera so you can take a look
at<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:18.500> view<00:03:18.680> finder<00:03:18.829> on<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.190> camera<00:03:19.489> just

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
at the view finder on the camera just

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.890 
at the view finder on the camera just
pretty<00:03:20.389> nice<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:23.060> can<00:03:23.180> hold<00:03:23.329> it<00:03:23.449> down<00:03:23.569> it

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
pretty nice so you can hold it down it

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.670 
pretty nice so you can hold it down it
will<00:03:24.049> focus<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.989> takes<00:03:27.169> pretty<00:03:27.349> decent

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
will focus in it takes pretty decent

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.240 
will focus in it takes pretty decent
shots<00:03:27.859> for<00:03:28.639> 8<00:03:28.699> megapixel<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:30.069> have<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.190> here

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
shots for 8 megapixel I have it here

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.140 
shots for 8 megapixel I have it here
next<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:34.639> old<00:03:34.760> n95<00:03:35.389> 8<00:03:35.840> gigabyte<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:38.030> can

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
next to the old n95 8 gigabyte you can

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.140 
next to the old n95 8 gigabyte you can
see<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.419> thickness<00:03:38.599> the<00:03:39.169> difference<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.650> that

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
see the thickness the difference in that

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:49.000 
see the thickness the difference in that
we<00:03:41.150> can<00:03:41.299> take<00:03:41.419> a<00:03:41.449> picture<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.870> these<00:03:42.079> two

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.760 

so

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.310 

so<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:56.580> does<00:03:56.730> shoot<00:03:57.470> those<00:03:58.470> shoot<00:03:58.650> photos<00:04:00.320> very

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
so it does shoot those shoot photos very

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.400 
so it does shoot those shoot photos very
nicely<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.720> obviously<00:04:03.990> there's<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.200> ton<00:04:04.380> of

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
nicely and obviously there's a ton of

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.150 
nicely and obviously there's a ton of
applications<00:04:05.070> you<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.400> uh<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:06.690> can<00:04:06.720> download

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
applications you can uh you can download

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.110 
applications you can uh you can download
pretty<00:04:08.160> much<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.490> same<00:04:08.670> ones<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.000> will

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
pretty much of the same ones that will

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.540 
pretty much of the same ones that will
run<00:04:09.300> on<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:10.530> n97<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.430> 5800<00:04:13.310> so<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.400> comes

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
run on the n97 and the 5800 so it comes

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.160 
run on the n97 and the 5800 so it comes
down<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.000> there's<00:04:15.150> things<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.720> like<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:15.960> I

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
down to it there's things I like and I

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.740 
down to it there's things I like and I
dislike<00:04:16.500> about<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.799> phone<00:04:17.010> first<00:04:17.660> I'm<00:04:18.660> gonna

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
dislike about the phone first I'm gonna

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.270 
dislike about the phone first I'm gonna
start<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.110> the<00:04:19.380> things<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.830> dislike

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
start with the things that I dislike

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.730 
start with the things that I dislike
first<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.330> all<00:04:21.390> there's<00:04:21.600> no<00:04:21.630> there's<00:04:22.440> no<00:04:22.500> real

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
first of all there's no there's no real

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
first of all there's no there's no real
camera<00:04:23.100> cover<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.850> cameras<00:04:25.520> expose<00:04:26.520> all

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
camera cover so the cameras expose all

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.480 
camera cover so the cameras expose all
the<00:04:26.850> time<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.930> it's<00:04:28.830> pretty<00:04:29.010> much<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.220> same

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
the time and it's pretty much the same

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.640 
the time and it's pretty much the same
as<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:30.120> n95<00:04:30.480> eight<00:04:31.170> gig<00:04:33.230> one<00:04:34.230> other<00:04:34.350> thing<00:04:34.500> I

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
as the n95 eight gig one other thing I

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.870 
as the n95 eight gig one other thing I
didn't<00:04:34.830> like<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.100> obviously<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.610> way<00:04:35.790> it

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
didn't like is obviously the way it

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.310 
didn't like is obviously the way it
feels<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.270> little<00:04:36.420> it's<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.750> little<00:04:36.780> cheapen

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
feels a little it's a little cheapen

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.270 
feels a little it's a little cheapen
finger<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:38.900> attracts<00:04:39.900> fingerprints<00:04:40.530> you

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
finger in attracts fingerprints you

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.740 
finger in attracts fingerprints you
would<00:04:41.400> think<00:04:41.430> for<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:42.000> six-hundred-dollar

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
would think for a six-hundred-dollar

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.560 
would think for a six-hundred-dollar
phone<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.500> would<00:04:43.620> feel<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.860> little<00:04:44.100> bit<00:04:44.450> maybe<00:04:45.450> a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
phone it would feel a little bit maybe a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.410 
phone it would feel a little bit maybe a
little<00:04:45.660> bit<00:04:45.810> more<00:04:45.930> solid<00:04:47.000> kind<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.090> like<00:04:48.210> how

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
little bit more solid kind of like how

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.280 
little bit more solid kind of like how
the<00:04:48.480> touchy<00:04:48.810> HD<00:04:49.650> feels<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:51.870> terms<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.200> the

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
the touchy HD feels in terms of the

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.920 
the touchy HD feels in terms of the
browser<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:53.220> still<00:04:53.520> has<00:04:53.670> a<00:04:53.700> long<00:04:53.910> way<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.690> go<00:04:54.870> to

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
browser it still has a long way to go to

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.460 
browser it still has a long way to go to
catch<00:04:55.020> up<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.700> to<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.030> iphone<00:04:57.390> it<00:04:58.260> felt

catch up to the to the iphone it felt

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.140 
catch up to the to the iphone it felt
the<00:04:58.560> same<00:04:58.740> way<00:04:58.890> with<00:04:58.980> the<00:04:59.040> n97<00:04:59.550> just<00:04:59.910> the

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
the same way with the n97 just the

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.700 
the same way with the n97 just the
Symbian<00:05:00.540> browsers<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:02.280> me<00:05:02.430> it's<00:05:02.610> just<00:05:03.680> not<00:05:04.680> a

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
Symbian browsers for me it's just not a

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.920 
Symbian browsers for me it's just not a
not<00:05:05.250> as<00:05:05.340> web<00:05:05.520> friendly<00:05:05.760> as<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.420> iphone<00:05:06.750> yet

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
not as web friendly as the iphone yet

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.280 
not as web friendly as the iphone yet
and<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:09.390> biggest<00:05:09.600> disappointment<00:05:10.200> is

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
and the biggest disappointment is

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:17.090 
and the biggest disappointment is
obviously<00:05:10.560> no<00:05:11.810> xenon<00:05:12.810> flash<00:05:14.030> so<00:05:15.440> eight<00:05:16.440> even

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
obviously no xenon flash so eight even

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.160 
obviously no xenon flash so eight even
though<00:05:17.190> it's<00:05:17.340> 8-megapixel<00:05:17.570> eight<00:05:18.570> megapixels

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
though it's 8-megapixel eight megapixels

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.430 
though it's 8-megapixel eight megapixels
you<00:05:19.350> can<00:05:19.500> nad<00:05:20.310> nad<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:21.150> will<00:05:21.390> outperform<00:05:22.050> this
