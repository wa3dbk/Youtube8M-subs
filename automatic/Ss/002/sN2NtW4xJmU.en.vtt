Janelle let me do it with you again so
you'll<00:04:52.930> see<00:04:53.139> how<00:04:53.290> I<00:04:53.320> relocate<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.070> foot

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
you'll see how I relocate the foot

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.260 
you'll see how I relocate the foot
slightly<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:55.650> create<00:04:56.650> shape<00:04:57.130> again<00:04:58.120> I'm

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
slightly and create shape again I'm

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.180 
slightly and create shape again I'm
staying<00:04:58.660> back<00:04:58.960> so<00:04:59.230> as<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.380> not<00:04:59.590> put<00:04:59.830> my<00:04:59.950> upper

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
staying back so as to not put my upper

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.070 
staying back so as to not put my upper
body<00:05:00.340> weight<00:05:00.669> on<00:05:00.850> Janelle's<00:05:01.330> shaping<00:05:01.900> and

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
body weight on Janelle's shaping and

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.190 
body weight on Janelle's shaping and
when<00:05:02.980> I<00:05:03.010> put<00:05:03.310> her<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.460> my<00:05:03.700> right<00:05:03.880> leg<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.419> shape

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
when I put her to my right leg I shape

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.159 
when I put her to my right leg I shape
strongly<00:05:06.100> back<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.610> left<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:07.660> give<00:05:07.960> her

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
strongly back and left to give her

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.980 
strongly back and left to give her
opposition<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.370> is<00:05:09.550> weight<00:05:10.210> opposing<00:05:10.870> her

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
opposition that is weight opposing her

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.860 
opposition that is weight opposing her
so<00:05:11.230> she<00:05:11.290> feels<00:05:11.440> balanced<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:13.150> know<00:05:13.180> okay<00:05:13.840> so

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
so she feels balanced you know okay so

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.050 
so she feels balanced you know okay so
I'm<00:05:14.169> using<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:14.740> opposition<00:05:15.220> weight<00:05:15.760> this<00:05:16.000> is

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
I'm using that opposition weight this is

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.969 
I'm using that opposition weight this is
a<00:05:16.210> step<00:05:16.540> that's<00:05:16.750> really<00:05:17.050> difficult<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.590> do<00:05:17.740> all

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
a step that's really difficult to do all

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.740 
a step that's really difficult to do all
along<00:05:18.090> you<00:05:19.090> wouldn't<00:05:19.330> want<00:05:19.450> to<00:05:19.479> do<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.600> alone

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
along you wouldn't want to do it alone

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.510 
along you wouldn't want to do it alone
anyways<00:05:20.229> but<00:05:20.740> I'm<00:05:21.630> pressuring<00:05:22.630> my<00:05:22.900> body

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
anyways but I'm pressuring my body

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.190 
anyways but I'm pressuring my body
forward<00:05:24.520> so<00:05:24.850> that<00:05:25.060> because<00:05:25.810> I'm<00:05:25.990> taking

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
forward so that because I'm taking

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.050 
forward so that because I'm taking
myself<00:05:26.710> away<00:05:26.979> so<00:05:27.040> far<00:05:27.400> so<00:05:27.790> I'm<00:05:27.850> gonna<00:05:27.940> do<00:05:28.030> it

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
myself away so far so I'm gonna do it

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.700 
myself away so far so I'm gonna do it
from<00:05:28.240> open<00:05:28.630> so<00:05:29.139> say<00:05:29.350> I've<00:05:29.560> gone<00:05:30.060> back<00:05:31.060> and

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
from open so say I've gone back and

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.560 
from open so say I've gone back and
lifting<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:32.890> pointing<00:05:33.880> I<00:05:34.030> don't<00:05:34.210> want<00:05:34.450> to

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
lifting and pointing I don't want to

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.600 
lifting and pointing I don't want to
actually<00:05:34.720> go<00:05:35.169> back<00:05:35.200> like<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:36.010> looks<00:05:36.160> like<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.490> am

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
actually go back like it looks like I am

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.750 
actually go back like it looks like I am
I'm<00:05:36.880> pressing<00:05:37.840> forward<00:05:38.290> through<00:05:38.919> my<00:05:39.130> knee<00:05:39.190> and

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
I'm pressing forward through my knee and

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.000 
I'm pressing forward through my knee and
then<00:05:40.570> as<00:05:40.750> I<00:05:40.900> take<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.260> next<00:05:41.470> step<00:05:41.800> I'm

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
then as I take the next step I'm

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.340 
then as I take the next step I'm
pressing<00:05:42.880> forward<00:05:43.300> through<00:05:43.810> my<00:05:43.960> knee<00:05:44.020> and

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
pressing forward through my knee and

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.680 
pressing forward through my knee and
upper<00:05:44.590> body<00:05:44.740> so<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:45.729> appears<00:05:46.090> that<00:05:46.180> I'm<00:05:46.450> back

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
upper body so it appears that I'm back

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.930 
upper body so it appears that I'm back
but<00:05:46.960> really<00:05:47.289> my<00:05:47.440> weight<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:48.160> forward<00:05:48.550> of<00:05:48.789> my

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
but really my weight is forward of my

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.930 
but really my weight is forward of my
foot<00:05:49.240> my<00:05:49.810> head<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.169> toe<00:05:50.380> is<00:05:50.590> back<00:05:50.830> one<00:05:51.760> thing

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
foot my head and toe is back one thing

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.279 
foot my head and toe is back one thing
that<00:05:52.090> you<00:05:52.180> can<00:05:52.330> always<00:05:52.510> practice<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.110> it's<00:05:53.200> a

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
that you can always practice and it's a

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.810 
that you can always practice and it's a
kind<00:05:53.470> of<00:05:53.590> piggybacking<00:05:54.070> what<00:05:54.340> Janelle<00:05:54.580> said

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
kind of piggybacking what Janelle said

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.230 
kind of piggybacking what Janelle said
is<00:05:54.970> when<00:05:55.600> you<00:05:55.750> bend<00:05:56.289> your<00:05:56.590> knee<00:05:56.830> in<00:05:57.520> order<00:05:58.060> to

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
is when you bend your knee in order to

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.080 
is when you bend your knee in order to
get<00:05:58.450> back<00:05:58.750> we<00:05:59.410> send<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.979> knee<00:06:00.160> forward<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:00.940> it

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
get back we send the knee forward and it

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.060 
get back we send the knee forward and it
gives<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.419> illusion<00:06:01.510> of<00:06:01.990> being<00:06:02.229> back<00:06:02.560> we

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
gives the illusion of being back we

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.310 
gives the illusion of being back we
don't<00:06:03.250> leave<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.820> knee<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.240> go<00:06:04.539> back<00:06:04.780> because

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
don't leave the knee and go back because

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.690 
don't leave the knee and go back because
that<00:06:05.500> makes<00:06:05.680> you<00:06:05.860> just<00:06:05.890> off-balance<00:06:06.550> and

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
that makes you just off-balance and

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.060 
that makes you just off-balance and
heavy<00:06:06.880> so<00:06:07.390> we<00:06:07.419> call<00:06:07.840> this<00:06:08.020> cantilever<00:06:08.800> ring

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
heavy so we call this cantilever ring

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.340 
heavy so we call this cantilever ring
you're<00:06:09.580> sending<00:06:10.060> part<00:06:10.600> of<00:06:10.720> you<00:06:10.840> forward<00:06:11.320> so

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
you're sending part of you forward so

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
you're sending part of you forward so
that<00:06:11.710> part<00:06:12.190> of<00:06:12.310> you<00:06:12.400> can<00:06:12.640> appear<00:06:13.360> to<00:06:13.930> be<00:06:14.110> back

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
that part of you can appear to be back

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.590 
that part of you can appear to be back
