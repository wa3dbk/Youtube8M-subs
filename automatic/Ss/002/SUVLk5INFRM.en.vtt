00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
then since mines named HD k2 there

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.670 
then since mines named HD k2 there
should<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.539> an<00:00:54.629> HT<00:00:54.989> k2<00:00:55.230> h<00:00:56.010> VA<00:00:56.250> h<00:00:56.449> DK<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.260> doc

v XL or hg k to turn so you don't have

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.980 
v XL or hg k to turn so you don't have
all<00:01:05.580> four<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> those<00:01:08.330> you're<00:01:09.330> missing<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> few
