00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.680
 Welcome everyone together 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.109
 a new series of incredible trains 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 Today I consider myself important to the aesthetic 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.260
 example crazy and indeed from the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.200
 game 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:19.080
 krishna against anyway played in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.060
 guangzhou 2010 have a look 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.880
 the position what only the springer 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.429
 So knows the train first by springer 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.730
 ff7 hangs yes black has a farmer 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.460
 more that you do not look so bad for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.059
 black but white has one here 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.610
 pretty good in the city 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.340
 So you 're back at the train please 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 stop the video and find the one here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.850
 best train for white everything will be easy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 show it now so if not like that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.480
 far be hold again if now 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.610
 knows where to jump who where we pull 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.830
 after e5 or g5 well then that is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.970
 black disturbances okay but that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 can jump on a very specific 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.340
 pull box and that is incredible here 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.439
 springer d6 but I like these trains 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.640
 when she falls she was a figure 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.100
 on recommends it probably three times 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.560
 is attacked and no matter how black 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.909
 beats it all just flies 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 apart what should I say 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.130
 So after c piece the 66 is clear here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.650
 because then the lady here on the spring 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.509
 the five does not cover anymore and that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.549
 problem more knows the springer p3 falls 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.520
 even with that means that knows 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.460
 immediately wins a figure now was the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.280
 other question but what if the lady 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.689
 black must also beat in the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.460
 principle , we already depend on it 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.460
 two figures springer on the five 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.790
 Subtone on 8 so suggests black 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.470
 the lady but now has the lady covers 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.570
 the then field b5 no longer and now 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.600
 come the white lady and look at it 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.500
 once four characters are attacked 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.090
 with a single train both towers and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.940
 both springer you can really see that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.830
 not often that the lady so many 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.120
 figures again 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.890
 and you probably already 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.150
 everything can not think black 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.770
 defend and he loses that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.270
 problem is yes he could both 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.380
 Towers cover the towers can become 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.780
 think each other but the problem is 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.470
 again this is just both springer 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.930
 fly away 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.459
 she should also be the tower maybe yes 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.459
 just go back and forward for 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.910
 anything black that is, more 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.160
 Black played rook d8 ceiling so that the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.250
 jump on the 5 but now beats white 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.959
 Just jump on a4 can get in 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.280
 security 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.160
 save but it remains what has 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.480
 a quality more for a farmer 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.940
 intact position of a profit position 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.860
 I'm here too native to the victory 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.350
 By the way, recycled here spoke nothing 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.750
 against runner 3 and then just the 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.230
 to collect farmers here on 7 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.989
 but also as well as hall krishna played tom 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.920
 DC1 it went on a few trains but 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.600
 he recovered and safely to victory 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.280
 you like to write again 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.230
 down in the comments and then see 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.230
 I set you back next week
