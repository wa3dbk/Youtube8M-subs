00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
superhero powers what would they be and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
superhero powers what would they be and
why<00:00:27.089> I<00:00:27.570> guess<00:00:28.019> I'd<00:00:28.169> be<00:00:28.259> Superman<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> mean<00:00:29.070> he

has the least amount of weaknesses and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.410 
has the least amount of weaknesses and
seems<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.220> most<00:00:32.430> things<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:33.150> for
