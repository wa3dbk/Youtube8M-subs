today<00:00:00.989> we're<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.500> make<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.680> flexible

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
today we're going to make a flexible

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.510 
today we're going to make a flexible
foam<00:00:02.790> prop<00:00:03.300> hammer<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.190> previous<00:00:05.190> videos

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
foam prop hammer and previous videos

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.700 
foam prop hammer and previous videos
we've<00:00:05.790> got<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> rigid<00:00:06.450> foam<00:00:06.660> hammer<00:00:06.990> but<00:00:07.440> now

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
we've got a rigid foam hammer but now

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.890 
we've got a rigid foam hammer but now
I'm<00:00:07.980> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.340> do<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:08.730> with<00:00:08.970> flexible<00:00:09.630> foam

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
I'm going to do one with flexible foam

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.310 
I'm going to do one with flexible foam
now<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.130> an<00:00:11.280> f5<00:00:11.910> flexible<00:00:12.690> foam<00:00:12.900> cast

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
now this is an f5 flexible foam cast

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.250 
now this is an f5 flexible foam cast
that<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.490> poured<00:00:14.790> some<00:00:14.849> f5<00:00:15.480> flexible<00:00:16.020> foam

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
that we we poured some f5 flexible foam

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.760 
that we we poured some f5 flexible foam
into<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.180> 7120<00:00:18.180> mold<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:19.260> embedded<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
into a 7120 mold and we embedded a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.650 
into a 7120 mold and we embedded a
wooden<00:00:20.070> dowel<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> stabilize<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
wooden dowel in it to stabilize the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.160 
wooden dowel in it to stabilize the
handle<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.970> we're<00:00:23.970> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.240> paint<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.840> but

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
handle and we're going to paint this but

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.320 
handle and we're going to paint this but
before<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.710> paint<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.310> need<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> prime<00:00:27.000> this

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
before we paint it we need to prime this

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.929 
before we paint it we need to prime this
using<00:00:28.050> some<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> new<00:00:28.560> primate<00:00:28.980> primer<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
using some of the new primate primer and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.229 
using some of the new primate primer and
the<00:00:30.900> primer<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.619> using<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.279> bonds<00:00:32.880> very

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the primer we're using here bonds very

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090 
the primer we're using here bonds very
well<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> lot<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.320> different<00:00:34.620> urethanes

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
well to a lot of different urethanes

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.250 
well to a lot of different urethanes
including<00:00:35.790> flexible<00:00:36.059> foams<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.140> we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
including flexible foams like the one we

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
including flexible foams like the one we
have<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> coat<00:00:38.969> this

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
have here so we're going to coat this

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.030 
have here so we're going to coat this
with<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> good<00:00:39.570> coating<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.320> private

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
with a good coating of the private

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
with a good coating of the private
primer<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.610> over<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> let<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.540> dry

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
primer all over and let that dry

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.229 
primer all over and let that dry
and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.890> we'll<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.160> ready<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.610> paint<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and then we'll be ready to paint the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
and then we'll be ready to paint the
handle<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.930> acrylics<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:47.010> we'll<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.309> using

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
handle with acrylics now we'll be using

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
handle with acrylics now we'll be using
two<00:00:47.850> different<00:00:47.879> paint<00:00:48.390> techniques<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
two different paint techniques for this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.830 
two different paint techniques for this
hammer<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> handle<00:00:50.700> we're<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> use

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
hammer for the handle we're going to use

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.799 
hammer for the handle we're going to use
a<00:00:52.250> acrylic<00:00:53.250> paint<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.879> standard<00:00:54.300> acrylic

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
a acrylic paint just standard acrylic

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.830 
a acrylic paint just standard acrylic
paint<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.430> for<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> top<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> hammer<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
paint and for the top of the hammer the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
paint and for the top of the hammer the
part<00:00:58.500> where<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> simulate<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.730> steel

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
part where we want to simulate the steel

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
part where we want to simulate the steel
part<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> hammer<00:01:00.780> we're<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> paint

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
part of the hammer we're going to paint

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
part of the hammer we're going to paint
that<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.190> some<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.399> our<00:01:02.489> iron<00:01:02.730> B<00:01:03.180> metal

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that with some of our iron B metal

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.649 
that with some of our iron B metal
coating<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.790> we<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.600> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
coating and we want to do that just so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.660 
coating and we want to do that just so
we<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.110> more<00:01:07.140> realistic<00:01:07.770> look<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
we get a lot more realistic look to the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
we get a lot more realistic look to the
head<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> hammer<00:01:09.240> now<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> do

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
head of the hammer now what I like to do

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190 
head of the hammer now what I like to do
is<00:01:11.070> still<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.520> light<00:01:11.850> dry<00:01:12.210> brushing<00:01:12.720> technique

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
is still a light dry brushing technique

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.780 
is still a light dry brushing technique
of<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> couple<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.070> different<00:01:14.400> shades<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of just a couple of different shades of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.289 
of just a couple of different shades of
brown<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.360> simulate<00:01:15.630> wood<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:18.000> could<00:01:18.180> do

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
brown to simulate wood and you could do

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.210 
brown to simulate wood and you could do
this<00:01:18.420> by<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.869> mixing<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.860> barely

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
this by just mixing up just barely

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
this by just mixing up just barely
mixing<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.119> couple<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.450> shades<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.869> brown<00:01:22.110> so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
mixing up a couple of shades of brown so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
mixing up a couple of shades of brown so
that<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.040> intentionally<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.850> some<00:01:24.000> streaks

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that you intentionally get some streaks

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
that you intentionally get some streaks
in<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.960> paint<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.590> helps<00:01:25.890> simulate

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
in that paint and that helps simulate

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.060 
in that paint and that helps simulate
the<00:01:26.939> wood<00:01:27.150> grain<00:01:27.450> effect<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the wood grain effect and you can get a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
the wood grain effect and you can get a
lot<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> lot<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.610> involved<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
lot a lot more involved in this this is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
lot a lot more involved in this this is
a<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.200> quick<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> dirty<00:01:31.920> paint<00:01:32.280> job<00:01:32.549> we're

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
a really quick and dirty paint job we're

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.940 
a really quick and dirty paint job we're
doing<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.900> using<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.530> couple<00:01:34.860> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
doing here just using just a couple of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.980 
doing here just using just a couple of
shades<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.340> brown<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.880> quickly<00:01:36.180> dry<00:01:36.630> brushed

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
shades of brown very quickly dry brushed

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.990 
shades of brown very quickly dry brushed
over<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.380> handle<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.700> go<00:01:38.820> back

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
over the handle and then you can go back

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.149 
over the handle and then you can go back
with<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.780> those<00:01:39.990> same<00:01:40.290> shades<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.979> brown

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
with with those same shades of brown

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.060 
with with those same shades of brown
individually<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.990> accent<00:01:43.619> different

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
individually and to accent different

you've painted the handle to your liking
we're<00:01:50.250> ready<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.549> let<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.880> dry<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.600> then

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
we're ready to let that dry and then

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.870 
we're ready to let that dry and then

than what they appear to be when they're

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.319 
than what they appear to be when they're
wet<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.219> want<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> compensate<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
wet so you want to compensate for that

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.270 
wet so you want to compensate for that
anytime<00:02:06.960> you're<00:02:07.170> doing<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.530> paint<00:02:07.799> job<00:02:08.039> with

anytime you're doing a paint job with
standard<00:02:08.849> acrylic<00:02:09.270> paints<00:02:09.690> always<00:02:10.560> paint<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
standard acrylic paints always paint it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.460 
standard acrylic paints always paint it
little<00:02:11.650> bit<00:02:11.770> lighter<00:02:12.660> than<00:02:13.660> with<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> little

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
because when it dries it will darken a

because when it dries it will darken a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
little bit now here's our dry handle

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.370 
little bit now here's our dry handle
with<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.820> head<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.570> hammer<00:02:22.810> ready<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.290> be

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
painted and for that we're going to use

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.740 
painted and for that we're going to use
some<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.410> iron<00:02:26.680> B<00:02:27.100> paint<00:02:27.460> now<00:02:28.120> iron<00:02:28.570> B

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
some of the iron B paint now iron B

some of the iron B paint now iron B
painting<00:02:29.230> by<00:02:29.530> sculpt<00:02:30.010> Nouveau<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.730> as<00:02:31.300> an

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
painting by sculpt Nouveau is a as an

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.140 
painting by sculpt Nouveau is a as an
acrylic<00:02:31.810> base<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.070> contains<00:02:33.430> actual<00:02:33.970> iron

acrylic base but it contains actual iron

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.240 
acrylic base but it contains actual iron
particles<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.380> use<00:02:35.590> reactive

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
particles so you can use reactive

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.970 
particles so you can use reactive
patinas<00:02:36.760> over<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.630> paint<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.740> first

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
patinas over that paint so the first

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.710 
patinas over that paint so the first
step<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.340> want<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.850> completely<00:02:40.510> coat

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
step we want to do is completely coat

step we want to do is completely coat
that<00:02:40.959> with<00:02:41.200> some<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> iron<00:02:42.550> B<00:02:42.850> paint<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that with some of the iron B paint and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.550 
that with some of the iron B paint and
allow<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.280> dry<00:02:45.310> our<00:02:45.820> first<00:02:46.540> coat<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
allow that to dry our first coat of the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.610 
allow that to dry our first coat of the
iron<00:02:47.980> paint<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.670> just<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.420> base<00:02:49.660> coat<00:02:49.989> we<00:02:50.380> want

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
iron paint is just a base coat we want

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.290 
iron paint is just a base coat we want
that<00:02:50.770> there<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.580> case<00:02:51.820> any<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.150> this

that there just in case any of this

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.870 
that there just in case any of this
shows<00:02:52.600> through<00:02:53.080> if<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.440> patina<00:02:53.770> moves<00:02:54.520> any<00:02:54.760> of

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
shows through if the patina moves any of

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.580 
shows through if the patina moves any of
that<00:02:55.000> paint<00:02:55.300> around<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.930> don't<00:02:56.110> want<00:02:56.380> any<00:02:56.530> of

that paint around we don't want any of

that paint around we don't want any of
that<00:02:56.620> red<00:02:56.980> primered<00:02:57.550> surface<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.090> show

that red primered surface to show

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.920 
that red primered surface to show
through<00:02:58.890> now<00:02:59.890> as<00:03:00.220> soon<00:03:01.090> as<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.360> brush<00:03:01.690> on<00:03:01.900> a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
through now as soon as I brush on a

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.810 
through now as soon as I brush on a
layer<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.230> always<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.709> stipple<00:03:03.220> out<00:03:03.489> any

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
layer I always like to stipple out any

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.330 
layer I always like to stipple out any
brushstrokes<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:05.320> also<00:03:05.530> helps<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
brushstrokes and this also helps the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.790 
brushstrokes and this also helps the
appearance<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.360> very<00:03:07.870> realistic<00:03:08.350> rust

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
appearance of a very realistic rust

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.860 
appearance of a very realistic rust
because<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.190> gives<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:10.209> rust<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.540> lot<00:03:10.630> more

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
because it gives the rust a lot more

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.920 
because it gives the rust a lot more

second coat and again we want to brush
that<00:03:18.850> on<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:19.480> stipple<00:03:20.200> out<00:03:20.320> our

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
brushstrokes and give it a really good

still<00:03:34.750> wet<00:03:35.080> we<00:03:35.350> want<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.680> spray<00:03:36.010> on<00:03:36.220> our<00:03:36.430> patina

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
still wet we want to spray on our patina

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.180 
still wet we want to spray on our patina
now<00:03:37.390> here<00:03:37.630> we're<00:03:37.810> using<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.380> tiffany<00:03:38.890> green

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
now here we're using the tiffany green

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.590 
now here we're using the tiffany green
patina<00:03:40.079> now<00:03:41.079> any<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.769> green<00:03:42.340> patinas<00:03:42.970> like

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
patina now any of the green patinas like

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.569 
patina now any of the green patinas like
the<00:03:43.810> light<00:03:44.049> green<00:03:44.290> patina<00:03:44.650> or<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.220> tiffany

the light green patina or the tiffany

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.210 
the light green patina or the tiffany
group<00:03:45.790> green<00:03:46.209> patina<00:03:46.570> will<00:03:46.870> work<00:03:47.079> both<00:03:47.950> of

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
group green patina will work both of

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.520 
group green patina will work both of
those<00:03:48.340> patinas<00:03:48.880> will<00:03:49.060> result<00:03:49.540> in<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.989> rust

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
those patinas will result in a rust

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.910 
those patinas will result in a rust
effect<00:03:51.180> when<00:03:52.180> you're<00:03:52.360> using<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.900> over<00:03:53.140> iron<00:03:53.650> or

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
effect when you're using it over iron or

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.630 
effect when you're using it over iron or
steel<00:03:54.750> now<00:03:55.750> again<00:03:56.230> it's<00:03:56.440> very<00:03:56.530> important<00:03:57.430> that

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
steel now again it's very important that

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.150 
steel now again it's very important that
we<00:03:57.880> sprayed<00:03:58.269> this<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.660> while<00:03:59.019> our<00:03:59.380> second<00:03:59.950> coat

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
we sprayed this on while our second coat

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.240 
we sprayed this on while our second coat
of<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.700> iron<00:04:01.030> B<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.420> wet<00:04:01.750> if<00:04:02.410> we<00:04:02.680> wait<00:04:02.890> till<00:04:03.070> it

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
of the iron B is wet if we wait till it

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.160 
of the iron B is wet if we wait till it
dries<00:04:03.549> we're<00:04:03.970> going<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.150> get<00:04:04.269> very<00:04:04.660> little<00:04:05.019> if

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
dries we're going to get very little if

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.330 
dries we're going to get very little if
any<00:04:05.440> rust<00:04:05.829> forming<00:04:06.720> once<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.019> paint<00:04:08.620> dries<00:04:08.739> it

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
any rust forming once the paint dries it

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.490 
any rust forming once the paint dries it
seals<00:04:09.700> in<00:04:09.940> those<00:04:10.150> iron<00:04:10.420> particles<00:04:10.780> it's<00:04:11.260> very

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
seals in those iron particles it's very

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.770 
seals in those iron particles it's very
difficult<00:04:11.980> for<00:04:12.100> those<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.400> oxidize<00:04:12.940> now<00:04:13.720> the

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
difficult for those to oxidize now the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.449 
difficult for those to oxidize now the
other<00:04:14.079> patina<00:04:14.500> we're<00:04:14.739> going<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.010> use<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.430> a

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
other patina we're going to use is a

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.270 
other patina we're going to use is a
little<00:04:15.880> bit<00:04:16.180> of<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.930> tan<00:04:17.530> patina

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
little bit of the tan patina

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.210 
little bit of the tan patina
now<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.209> tan<00:04:19.630> patina<00:04:20.049> will<00:04:20.650> give<00:04:20.830> you<00:04:20.950> more<00:04:21.190> of

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
now the tan patina will give you more of

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.290 
now the tan patina will give you more of
a<00:04:21.400> yellowish<00:04:22.000> orange<00:04:22.390> kind<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.229> rust

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
a yellowish orange kind of rust

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.200 
a yellowish orange kind of rust
I<00:04:24.360> use<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.139> lot<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.500> create<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.889> more<00:04:26.669> new

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
I use this a lot to create a more new

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.980 
I use this a lot to create a more new
rust<00:04:27.629> effect<00:04:28.110> as<00:04:28.379> opposed<00:04:29.159> to<00:04:29.430> when<00:04:29.639> a<00:04:30.090> piece

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
rust effect as opposed to when a piece

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.050 
rust effect as opposed to when a piece
of<00:04:31.020> iron<00:04:31.500> or<00:04:31.740> steel<00:04:31.949> has<00:04:32.190> rusted<00:04:32.639> for<00:04:32.819> a<00:04:32.849> long

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
of iron or steel has rusted for a long

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.059 
of iron or steel has rusted for a long
period<00:04:33.449> of<00:04:33.479> time<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:34.259> starts<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.710> get<00:04:34.860> just

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
period of time it starts to get just

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.450 
period of time it starts to get just
more<00:04:35.129> of<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.460> uniform<00:04:35.759> reddish<00:04:36.479> brown<00:04:36.840> all<00:04:37.229> over

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
more of a uniform reddish brown all over

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.980 
more of a uniform reddish brown all over
the<00:04:38.460> adding<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:39.000> tan<00:04:39.330> just<00:04:39.659> gives<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:39.930> a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
the adding the tan just gives you a

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.839 
the adding the tan just gives you a
little<00:04:40.169> bit<00:04:40.379> more<00:04:40.620> orange<00:04:41.099> and<00:04:41.220> yellow<00:04:41.460> going

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
little bit more orange and yellow going

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.820 
little bit more orange and yellow going
on<00:04:41.970> with<00:04:42.210> your<00:04:42.330> rest<00:04:42.539> that<00:04:42.810> just<00:04:43.409> adds<00:04:43.650> a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
on with your rest that just adds a

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.640 
on with your rest that just adds a
little<00:04:43.949> more<00:04:44.069> realism<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.819> the<00:04:44.940> effect<00:04:45.650> now

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
little more realism to the effect now

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.189 
little more realism to the effect now
here's<00:04:47.129> our<00:04:47.250> part<00:04:47.550> oxidized<00:04:48.210> over<00:04:48.810> about<00:04:49.050> an

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
here's our part oxidized over about an

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.980 
here's our part oxidized over about an
hour's<00:04:49.590> time<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.250> we're<00:04:51.060> going<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.330> add<00:04:51.479> some

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
hour's time and we're going to add some

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.710 
hour's time and we're going to add some
additional<00:04:52.139> iron<00:04:52.949> paint<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.669> it<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:53.970> oxidize

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
additional iron paint to it and oxidize

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.050 
additional iron paint to it and oxidize
it<00:04:54.960> even<00:04:55.319> more<00:04:55.530> now<00:04:56.039> we<00:04:56.099> if<00:04:56.460> we<00:04:56.610> left<00:04:56.819> it<00:04:56.940> alone

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
it even more now we if we left it alone

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.820 
it even more now we if we left it alone
it<00:04:57.449> would<00:04:57.569> continue<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:58.020> turn<00:04:58.349> even<00:04:58.650> more

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
it would continue to turn even more

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.520 
it would continue to turn even more
reddish-brown<00:04:59.729> but<00:05:00.479> in<00:05:00.690> this<00:05:00.810> case<00:05:01.050> we<00:05:01.259> want

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
reddish-brown but in this case we want

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.189 
reddish-brown but in this case we want
to<00:05:01.650> really<00:05:02.280> create<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.699> thick<00:05:03.210> aggressive<00:05:03.930> rust

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
to really create a thick aggressive rust

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.170 
to really create a thick aggressive rust
so<00:05:04.560> what<00:05:05.069> we're<00:05:05.190> going<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.460> do<00:05:05.639> is<00:05:05.879> add<00:05:06.120> another

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
so what we're going to do is add another

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.070 
so what we're going to do is add another
layer<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.379> iron<00:05:07.590> B<00:05:07.979> and<00:05:08.569> then<00:05:09.569> again<00:05:09.870> while

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
layer of the iron B and then again while

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.320 
layer of the iron B and then again while
this<00:05:10.229> is<00:05:10.379> wet<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:11.340> time<00:05:11.580> we're<00:05:11.789> just<00:05:11.819> going

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
this is wet this time we're just going

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.089 
this is wet this time we're just going
to<00:05:12.389> spray<00:05:12.780> on<00:05:13.020> some<00:05:13.319> of<00:05:13.409> the<00:05:13.469> tiffany<00:05:13.860> green

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
to spray on some of the tiffany green

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.790 
to spray on some of the tiffany green
patina<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.940> you'll<00:05:15.870> notice<00:05:16.229> when<00:05:16.409> you<00:05:16.500> spray

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
patina and you'll notice when you spray

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.129 
patina and you'll notice when you spray
that<00:05:16.830> on<00:05:17.280> you'll<00:05:17.819> almost<00:05:18.030> immediately<00:05:18.810> see

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
that on you'll almost immediately see

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.170 
that on you'll almost immediately see
some<00:05:19.379> of<00:05:19.469> the<00:05:19.530> reddish-brown<00:05:20.159> forming<00:05:20.819> and

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
some of the reddish-brown forming and

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.209 
some of the reddish-brown forming and
it's<00:05:21.810> also<00:05:21.990> important<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:22.530> note<00:05:22.740> that<00:05:22.770> the

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
it's also important to note that the

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.029 
it's also important to note that the
more<00:05:23.430> humid<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.060> is<00:05:24.180> when<00:05:24.509> you're<00:05:24.659> working

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
more humid it is when you're working

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.800 
more humid it is when you're working
warm<00:05:26.039> humid<00:05:26.490> days<00:05:26.729> you're<00:05:27.360> going<00:05:27.539> to<00:05:27.659> get<00:05:27.780> a

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
warm humid days you're going to get a

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.200 
warm humid days you're going to get a
really<00:05:28.199> nice<00:05:28.560> rust<00:05:29.069> effect<00:05:29.460> when<00:05:29.789> it's<00:05:29.940> really

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
really nice rust effect when it's really

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.870 
really nice rust effect when it's really
dry<00:05:30.690> outside<00:05:31.020> it's<00:05:31.860> gonna<00:05:32.039> take<00:05:32.340> a<00:05:32.370> little<00:05:32.669> bit

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
dry outside it's gonna take a little bit

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.269 
dry outside it's gonna take a little bit
longer<00:05:33.120> for<00:05:33.330> that<00:05:33.569> to<00:05:33.840> really<00:05:34.440> react<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:35.219> get

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
longer for that to really react and get

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:39.200 
longer for that to really react and get
a<00:05:35.340> good<00:05:35.550> rich<00:05:35.819> rust<00:05:36.210> effect<00:05:37.669> now<00:05:38.669> once<00:05:39.000> we've

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
a good rich rust effect now once we've

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.269 
a good rich rust effect now once we've
allowed<00:05:39.539> that<00:05:39.779> to<00:05:39.810> dry<00:05:40.199> ready<00:05:40.620> for<00:05:40.949> some

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
allowed that to dry ready for some

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.490 
allowed that to dry ready for some
finishing<00:05:41.729> touches<00:05:41.759> and<00:05:42.630> just<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.319> add<00:05:43.469> a

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
finishing touches and just to add a

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.439 
finishing touches and just to add a
little<00:05:43.680> bit<00:05:44.009> more<00:05:44.250> realism<00:05:44.729> to<00:05:45.000> our<00:05:45.029> prop

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
little bit more realism to our prop

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.320 
little bit more realism to our prop
we're<00:05:45.900> going<00:05:46.169> to<00:05:46.349> put<00:05:46.800> some<00:05:47.009> silver<00:05:47.430> B<00:05:47.819> coating

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
we're going to put some silver B coating

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.019 
we're going to put some silver B coating
on<00:05:48.479> now<00:05:48.719> this<00:05:48.870> is<00:05:48.990> another<00:05:49.229> acrylic<00:05:50.029> paint

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
on now this is another acrylic paint

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.360 
on now this is another acrylic paint
from<00:05:51.210> sculpting<00:05:51.630> Nouveau<00:05:51.900> that<00:05:52.370> simulates

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
from sculpting Nouveau that simulates

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.550 
from sculpting Nouveau that simulates
the<00:05:53.729> look<00:05:53.849> of<00:05:54.680> silver<00:05:55.680> or<00:05:56.039> of<00:05:56.610> aluminum<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:57.870> I

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
the look of silver or of aluminum and I

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.529 
the look of silver or of aluminum and I
like<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.889> dry<00:05:59.219> brush<00:05:59.279> a<00:05:59.729> little<00:06:00.090> bit<00:06:00.330> of<00:06:00.449> the

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
like to dry brush a little bit of the

like to dry brush a little bit of the
silver<00:06:00.810> B<00:06:01.139> paint<00:06:01.529> over<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.069> surface<00:06:02.520> of<00:06:02.729> a

prop like this just on the corners or

prop like this just on the corners or
any<00:06:05.310> edge<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.909> might<00:06:06.090> see<00:06:06.300> some<00:06:06.509> wear<00:06:06.690> and

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
any edge that might see some wear and

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.950 
any edge that might see some wear and
tear<00:06:07.080> just<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:08.009> complete<00:06:08.639> that<00:06:08.789> illusion<00:06:09.150> of<00:06:09.539> a

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
tear just to complete that illusion of a

tear just to complete that illusion of a
part<00:06:10.620> that's<00:06:10.909> rested<00:06:11.909> steel<00:06:12.210> but<00:06:12.750> it's<00:06:12.900> still

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
part that's rested steel but it's still

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.680 
part that's rested steel but it's still
still<00:06:14.190> being<00:06:14.400> used<00:06:14.610> some<00:06:14.940> just<00:06:15.210> enough<00:06:15.509> to

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
still being used some just enough to

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.790 
still being used some just enough to
expose<00:06:16.199> some<00:06:16.949> of<00:06:17.039> the<00:06:17.129> steel<00:06:17.400> underneath<00:06:17.819> and

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
expose some of the steel underneath and

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.499 
expose some of the steel underneath and
there<00:06:19.800> we<00:06:19.919> have<00:06:20.129> it<00:06:20.159> here's<00:06:20.940> our<00:06:21.150> finished

there we have it here's our finished

there we have it here's our finished
prop<00:06:22.669> that<00:06:23.669> very<00:06:24.569> closely<00:06:24.930> mimics<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:26.310> look

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
prop that very closely mimics the look
