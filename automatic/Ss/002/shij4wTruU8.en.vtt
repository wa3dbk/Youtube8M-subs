00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.530 
but you also were a model for the
character<00:01:14.200> Walt<00:01:15.200> wanted<00:01:15.700> was<00:01:16.700> for<00:01:16.939> me<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.360> do

the<00:01:18.110> modeling<00:01:19.040> as<00:01:19.310> well<00:01:19.450> because<00:01:20.450> again<00:01:20.750> it

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
the modeling as well because again it

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.550 
the modeling as well because again it
was<00:01:21.470> more<00:01:22.460> natural<00:01:22.640> he<00:01:23.479> wanted<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:24.079> little<00:01:24.259> bill

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
was more natural he wanted a little bill

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.140 
was more natural he wanted a little bill
to<00:01:24.799> do<00:01:24.950> then<00:01:25.189> because<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.700> could<00:01:25.820> be<00:01:25.939> more

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
to do then because it could be more

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.450 
to do then because it could be more
little<00:01:26.450> girl<00:01:26.659> types<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.619> movements<00:01:28.220> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
little girl types of movements and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.880 
little girl types of movements and
drawing<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.810> human<00:01:30.020> figure<00:01:30.439> was<00:01:30.649> more

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
drawing the human figure was more

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.570 
drawing the human figure was more
complicated<00:01:31.670> for<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.970> anime

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
complicated for the anime

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.290 
complicated for the anime
so<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.630> he<00:01:33.810> did<00:01:34.080> was<00:01:34.140> film<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.370> go<00:01:35.970> back<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
so what he did was film it go back and

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.180 
so what he did was film it go back and
wide<00:01:36.450> philometor<00:01:36.930> 16-millimeter<00:01:37.620> and<00:01:37.980> all<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
wide philometor 16-millimeter and all of

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.300 
wide philometor 16-millimeter and all of
that<00:01:38.370> and<00:01:38.940> they<00:01:39.870> would<00:01:40.050> look<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that and they would look and get the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330 
that and they would look and get the
idea<00:01:41.730> of<00:01:41.940> all<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.300> movements<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.980> they

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
idea of all the movements and then they

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.710 
idea of all the movements and then they
could<00:01:44.580> draw<00:01:44.910> those<00:01:45.240> more<00:01:45.690> realistic<00:01:46.080> way<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
could draw those more realistic way and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.830 
could draw those more realistic way and
Alice<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.440> loved<00:01:50.600> because<00:01:51.600> the

like<00:02:24.860> well<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.220> saddle<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.540> know<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.690> could

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
like well the saddle you know I could

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.820 
like well the saddle you know I could
bend<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.980> move<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.670> saddle<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:31.530> had

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
bend and move in the saddle and that had

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.580 
bend and move in the saddle and that had
the<00:02:32.010> appearance<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.790> my<00:02:33.030> floating<00:02:33.690> down<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the appearance of my floating down the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.540 
the appearance of my floating down the
hole<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.360> moving<00:02:36.360> as<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.410> was<00:02:37.770> floating<00:02:38.310> down

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
hole and moving as I was floating down

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.650 
hole and moving as I was floating down
to<00:02:39.120> bottom

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
to bottom

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.990 
to bottom
okay<00:02:40.110> did<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.950> sit<00:02:41.310> there

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
okay did that sit there

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.680 
okay did that sit there
had<00:02:44.160> perpendicular<00:02:45.160> board<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.300> pole

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
had perpendicular board with a pole

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
had perpendicular board with a pole
across<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:49.420> had<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.990> put<00:02:50.170> my<00:02:50.380> feet

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
across and I had to put my feet

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.360 
across and I had to put my feet
underneath<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.240> I<00:02:52.270> lay<00:02:52.630> down<00:02:53.070> my<00:02:54.070> feet

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
underneath that so I lay down my feet

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.660 
underneath that so I lay down my feet
under<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.360> then<00:02:55.600> they<00:02:55.810> raised<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.350> up

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
under it and then they raised it up

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.160 
under it and then they raised it up
perpendicular<00:02:57.670> then<00:02:58.420> when<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.960> scene

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
perpendicular then when the scene

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.490 
perpendicular then when the scene
started<00:02:59.770> I<00:03:00.010> had<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.520> drop<00:03:00.940> from<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.450> as<00:03:01.630> if<00:03:02.260> I

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
started I had to drop from it as if I

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.350 
started I had to drop from it as if I
was<00:03:03.010> dropping<00:03:03.640> from<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.830> hole<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.550> down<00:03:07.090> on

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
was dropping from the hole and down on

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.620 
was dropping from the hole and down on
to<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.660> ground<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.520> made<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.060> look<00:03:10.209> you

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
to the ground so that made it look you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.230 
to the ground so that made it look you
know<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.900> was<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.140> natural<00:03:11.560> thing<00:03:11.590> with<00:03:11.980> my

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
know that was the natural thing with my

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.610 
know that was the natural thing with my
dropping<00:03:13.240> down<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:14.020> I<00:03:14.140> had<00:03:14.320> turned

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
dropping down because I had turned

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.979 
dropping down because I had turned
upside<00:03:15.190> down<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.489> think<00:03:15.910> at<00:03:16.030> some<00:03:16.060> point<00:03:16.270> then

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
upside down I think at some point then

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.890 
upside down I think at some point then
dropped<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.430> had<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.850> get<00:03:19.030> up<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.390> run

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
dropped and then I had to get up and run

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.040 
dropped and then I had to get up and run
to<00:03:20.260> find<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:21.040> door<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.280> follow<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.940> rabbit<00:03:22.060> so

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
to find the door to follow the rabbit so

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.050 
to find the door to follow the rabbit so
that<00:03:23.800> was<00:03:23.950> just<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.370> couple<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.730> things<00:03:24.970> that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
that was just a couple of things that

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.780 
that was just a couple of things that
was<00:03:25.270> every<00:03:25.660> every<00:03:26.260> scene<00:03:26.590> had<00:03:27.220> something

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
was every every scene had something

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.030 
was every every scene had something
unique<00:03:28.000> like<00:03:28.510> that<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.320> that's<00:03:29.530> why<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:29.800> was

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
unique like that so that's why it was

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.860 
unique like that so that's why it was
kind<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.400> special<00:03:30.790> experience<00:03:31.180> doing<00:03:31.720> that

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
kind of a special experience doing that

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.160 
kind of a special experience doing that
modeling<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.300> we<00:03:34.420> got<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.959> same

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
modeling and so we got to do the same

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.960 
modeling and so we got to do the same
for<00:03:35.320> Wendy<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.739> Peter<00:03:35.770> Pan<00:03:38.610> Roland<00:03:39.610> Duprey

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
for Wendy in Peter Pan Roland Duprey

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.410 
for Wendy in Peter Pan Roland Duprey
really<00:03:40.420> did<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.780> modeling<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.350> be<00:03:41.470> Japan<00:03:41.890> and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
really did the modeling to be Japan and

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.120 
really did the modeling to be Japan and
there<00:03:43.420> was<00:03:43.540> much<00:03:44.220> involved<00:03:45.220> because<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.799> and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
there was much involved because and and

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.840 
there was much involved because and and
if<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.610> was<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.330> had<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.660> be<00:03:50.640> attached<00:03:51.640> with

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
if it was you had to be attached with

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.530 
if it was you had to be attached with
hysterical

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
hysterical

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.420 
hysterical
that<00:03:53.659> went<00:03:53.870> up<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.230> top<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.159> ceiling

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
that went up to the top of the ceiling

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.050 
that went up to the top of the ceiling
of<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.750> stage<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:59.409> saw<00:04:00.409> where<00:04:00.829> Roland<00:04:01.760> was

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
of the stage and I saw where Roland was

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.649 
of the stage and I saw where Roland was
back<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.719> saying<00:04:02.930> he<00:04:03.260> was<00:04:03.469> way<00:04:03.950> up<00:04:04.250> there<00:04:04.629> was<00:04:05.629> a

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
back to saying he was way up there was a

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.020 
back to saying he was way up there was a
problem<00:04:06.019> with<00:04:06.439> it--<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:07.400> all<00:04:07.819> I<00:04:07.849> could

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
problem with it-- and all I could

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.640 
problem with it-- and all I could
imagine<00:04:08.269> was<00:04:09.549> looking<00:04:10.549> down<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:14.540> he<00:04:15.409> realized

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
imagine was looking down so he realized

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.189 
imagine was looking down so he realized
that<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.370> were<00:04:16.519> very<00:04:16.729> uncomfortable<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.630> easily

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
that I were very uncomfortable so easily

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.020 
that I were very uncomfortable so easily

used<00:04:25.100> to<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.340> wire<00:04:25.520> being<00:04:25.820> there<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.690> then

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
used to the wire being there and then

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.779 
used to the wire being there and then
we'll<00:04:27.110> just<00:04:27.289> raise<00:04:27.530> up<00:04:27.710> literature's<00:04:28.430> and

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
we'll just raise up literature's and

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.689 
we'll just raise up literature's and
just<00:04:29.330> do<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.509> again<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.349> he<00:04:30.949> just<00:04:31.190> kept<00:04:31.460> doing

this with me and we would flow back and
forth<00:04:34.750> do<00:04:35.750> some<00:04:36.410> activity<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.430> then<00:04:38.030> he<00:04:38.240> would

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:48.749 
forth do some activity and then he would
raise<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.349> a<00:04:39.380> little<00:04:39.590> higher<00:04:44.830> way<00:04:45.830> up<00:04:45.949> there

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759
