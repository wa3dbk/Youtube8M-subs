00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250 

going<00:00:00.149> to<00:00:00.240> talk<00:00:00.329> about<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.690> histogram

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
going to talk about the histogram

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.560 
going to talk about the histogram
histogram<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.310> nothing<00:00:02.760> more<00:00:02.939> than<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.270> visual

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
histogram is nothing more than a visual

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.740 
histogram is nothing more than a visual
representation<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.680> every<00:00:05.670> single<00:00:06.089> pixel<00:00:06.330> in

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
representation of every single pixel in

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.350 
representation of every single pixel in
your<00:00:07.230> photograph<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:09.000> left-hand

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
your photograph so on this left-hand

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.049 
your photograph so on this left-hand
side<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.929> start<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> value<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.980> zero<00:00:11.309> and

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
side we start with a value of zero and

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.039 
side we start with a value of zero and
then<00:00:12.929> there<00:00:13.080> are<00:00:13.639> 255<00:00:14.639> bar<00:00:15.000> bars<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.809> follow

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
then there are 255 bar bars that follow

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.359 
then there are 255 bar bars that follow
that<00:00:16.789> and<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.090> end<00:00:18.270> over<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.980> there's<00:00:20.160> two

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
that and we end over here so there's two

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.130 
that and we end over here so there's two
actually<00:00:20.760> including<00:00:21.449> zero<00:00:21.689> there's<00:00:21.900> actually

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
actually including zero there's actually

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.189 
actually including zero there's actually
256<00:00:23.010> bars<00:00:23.310> now<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> bars<00:00:24.330> represent<00:00:25.019> is

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
256 bars now what the bars represent is

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.240 
256 bars now what the bars represent is
every<00:00:26.189> possible<00:00:26.849> shade<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.840> either<00:00:28.519> green

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
every possible shade of either green

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.100 
every possible shade of either green
blue<00:00:32.750> or<00:00:33.750> red<00:00:34.160> sorry<00:00:35.250> RGB<00:00:36.090> green<00:00:36.450> blue<00:00:36.690> red<00:00:36.719> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
blue or red sorry RGB green blue red so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.750 
blue or red sorry RGB green blue red so
that's<00:00:37.290> where<00:00:37.469> you've<00:00:37.620> maybe<00:00:37.950> heard<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.370> RGB

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that's where you've maybe heard of RGB

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.040 
that's where you've maybe heard of RGB
before<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.920> all<00:00:41.129> possible<00:00:41.780> shades<00:00:42.780> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
before and it's all possible shades of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
before and it's all possible shades of
these<00:00:43.290> three<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:43.920> usually<00:00:44.700> some

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
these three and then usually some

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.180 
these three and then usually some
softwares<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.840> Photoshop<00:00:46.649> does<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.010> as

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
softwares and Photoshop does this as

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
softwares and Photoshop does this as
well<00:00:47.340> they'll<00:00:47.610> give<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.850> an<00:00:47.940> RGB<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:48.690> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
well they'll give you an RGB which is

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
well they'll give you an RGB which is
sort<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> an<00:00:49.140> average<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.800> each<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.489> those<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
sort of an average of each of those in

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.209 
sort of an average of each of those in
one<00:00:51.570> representation<00:00:52.050> now<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.100> does<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
one representation now what does a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
one representation now what does a
height<00:00:53.489> come<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.210> told<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> about<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
height come from I told you about the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
height come from I told you about the
width<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.860> these<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.280> shades<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.910> green

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
width here these are the shades of green

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.310 
width here these are the shades of green
blue<00:00:57.390> red<00:00:58.140> green<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.160> blue<00:00:59.399> but<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.079> height

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
blue red green and blue but the height

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.840 
blue red green and blue but the height
is<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:02.370> how<00:01:02.579> many<00:01:02.969> pixels<00:01:04.250> there<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
is actually how many pixels there are of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
is actually how many pixels there are of
that<00:01:06.090> particular<00:01:06.659> color<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.560> right

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that particular color so this one right

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.580 
that particular color so this one right
here<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> scale<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.380> but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
here we don't have a scale here but

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.789 
here we don't have a scale here but
there's<00:01:10.799> more<00:01:11.729> pixels<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:13.200> particular

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
there's more pixels of this particular

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.960 
there's more pixels of this particular
color<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> say<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.909> around<00:01:15.900> 100

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
color we can say that this is around 100

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
color we can say that this is around 100
then<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.200> around

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
then there are of this one which around

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.470 
then there are of this one which around
98<00:01:22.280> okay<00:01:23.780> or<00:01:24.780> 95<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
98 okay or 95 or so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.960 
98 okay or 95 or so
and<00:01:26.570> then<00:01:27.230> way<00:01:27.620> over<00:01:27.650> here<00:01:28.340> maybe<00:01:28.670> around<00:01:29.890> 180

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
and then way over here maybe around 180

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.610 
and then way over here maybe around 180
that's<00:01:31.970> what<00:01:32.210> we<00:01:32.300> have<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.690> most<00:01:33.020> of<00:01:33.290> that

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
that's what we have the most of that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.570 
that's what we have the most of that
particular<00:01:34.280> shade<00:01:34.870> so<00:01:35.870> we<00:01:36.140> also<00:01:36.290> have<00:01:36.650> so

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
particular shade so we also have so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.950 
particular shade so we also have so
basically<00:01:37.970> what<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.450> saying<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:38.780> we've

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
basically what this is saying is we've

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.960 
basically what this is saying is we've
got<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.170> pretty<00:01:39.440> well<00:01:39.620> exposed<00:01:40.070> photo<00:01:40.400> there's

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
got a pretty well exposed photo there's

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.780 
got a pretty well exposed photo there's
very<00:01:41.510> few<00:01:41.630> highlights<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.860> way<00:01:43.280> up<00:01:43.460> here

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
very few highlights this is way up here

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.430 
very few highlights this is way up here
at<00:01:45.100> almost<00:01:46.100> white<00:01:46.930> colors<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:48.260> there's

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
at almost white colors and then there's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.640 
at almost white colors and then there's
very<00:01:48.830> few<00:01:49.060> shadows<00:01:50.060> as<00:01:50.570> well<00:01:51.020> which<00:01:51.230> is<00:01:51.260> over

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
very few shadows as well which is over

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.960 
very few shadows as well which is over
in<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:51.920> area<00:01:52.220> but<00:01:52.670> there's<00:01:52.940> a<00:01:53.030> lot<00:01:53.270> of

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
in this area but there's a lot of

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.330 
in this area but there's a lot of
mid-tone<00:01:55.970> colors<00:01:56.530> okay<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:59.860> we<00:02:00.860> also<00:02:01.070> have

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
mid-tone colors okay so we also have

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.410 
mid-tone colors okay so we also have
some<00:02:01.550> terms<00:02:01.820> called<00:02:03.340> loci<00:02:04.340> which<00:02:04.970> means<00:02:05.240> this

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
some terms called loci which means this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.690 
some terms called loci which means this
is<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.630> photo<00:02:06.020> if<00:02:06.380> photo<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.370> histogram

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
is a photo if photo of the histogram

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.150 
is a photo if photo of the histogram
sort<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.300> looks<00:02:08.480> like<00:02:08.540> this<00:02:08.960> we<00:02:09.649> have<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.800> lot<00:02:10.130> of

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
sort of looks like this we have a lot of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.270 
sort of looks like this we have a lot of
shadows<00:02:10.780> no<00:02:11.780> highlights<00:02:12.350> this<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.040> called

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
shadows no highlights this is called

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.760 
shadows no highlights this is called
loci<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:14.660> we<00:02:14.780> also<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.170> high<00:02:15.440> key

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
loci and then we also have high key

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.000 
loci and then we also have high key
which<00:02:16.610> would<00:02:16.790> look<00:02:16.940> like<00:02:17.000> this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
which would look like this

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.440 
which would look like this
where<00:02:19.010> almost<00:02:19.250> all<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.690> pixels<00:02:21.380> are

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
where almost all of the pixels are

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.120 
where almost all of the pixels are
highlights<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.780> no<00:02:24.310> shadows<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.920> let's<00:02:28.070> look

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
highlights and no shadows so let's look

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.580 
highlights and no shadows so let's look
at<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.310> photo<00:02:28.780> here's<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.870> photo<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.230> my<00:02:30.350> daughter

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
at a photo here's a photo of my daughter

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.949 
at a photo here's a photo of my daughter
in<00:02:30.950> Lightroom<00:02:31.459> Lightroom<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.420> what<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.600> use<00:02:32.810> to

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
in Lightroom Lightroom is what I use to

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.570 
in Lightroom Lightroom is what I use to
store<00:02:33.200> all<00:02:33.290> my<00:02:33.320> photos<00:02:33.620> here's<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> histogram

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
store all my photos here's the histogram

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.240 
store all my photos here's the histogram
here<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.050> that<00:02:36.230> there's<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.680> lot<00:02:37.040> of

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
here you can see that there's a lot of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.530 
here you can see that there's a lot of
well<00:02:38.060> exposed<00:02:39.220> parts<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.490> photo<00:02:40.760> there's

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
well exposed parts of this photo there's

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.900 
well exposed parts of this photo there's
some<00:02:41.930> highlights<00:02:42.680> down<00:02:42.980> here<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:43.760> there's

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
some highlights down here but there's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.600 
some highlights down here but there's
almost<00:02:44.060> no<00:02:44.980> shadows<00:02:45.980> there's<00:02:46.220> almost<00:02:46.370> no

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
almost no shadows there's almost no

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.190 
almost no shadows there's almost no
lights<00:02:46.850> low<00:02:47.300> light<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.690> can<00:02:47.750> see<00:02:47.870> that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
lights low light so you can see that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.920 
lights low light so you can see that
there's<00:02:48.380> there's<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.770> gap<00:02:49.040> there<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:50.270> something

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
there's there's a gap there so something

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.310 
there's there's a gap there so something
that<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.080> always<00:02:51.380> like<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.890> do<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.570> identify<00:02:53.570> a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
that I always like to do is identify a

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.580 
that I always like to do is identify a
dark<00:02:55.250> point<00:02:55.520> at<00:02:55.760> least<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.330> start<00:02:56.630> in

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
dark point at least it's to start in

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.240 
dark point at least it's to start in
Lightroom<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.160> can<00:02:58.370> click<00:02:58.550> alt<00:02:58.850> and<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:01.100> can

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
Lightroom you can click alt and you can

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.010 
Lightroom you can click alt and you can
start<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.610> drag<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.030> down<00:03:02.180> here<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.900> can

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
start to drag it down here and you can

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.729 
start to drag it down here and you can
see<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.470> darks<00:03:03.950> come<00:03:04.220> out<00:03:04.989> so<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.020> just<00:03:06.530> let<00:03:06.709> it

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
see that darks come out so I just let it

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.170 
see that darks come out so I just let it
go<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.100> can<00:03:07.250> see<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.430> okay<00:03:07.700> these<00:03:07.940> are

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
go and you can see that okay these are

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.940 
go and you can see that okay these are
now<00:03:08.420> all<00:03:08.750> black<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.320> can<00:03:09.470> see<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.830> the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
now all black you can see that the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.020 
now all black you can see that the
histogram<00:03:10.070> now<00:03:10.610> has<00:03:10.850> black<00:03:11.180> pieces<00:03:13.030> okay

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
histogram now has black pieces okay

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.760 
histogram now has black pieces okay
they're<00:03:14.239> starting<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.570> come<00:03:14.750> there<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.650> now

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
they're starting to come there so now

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.410 
they're starting to come there so now
there's<00:03:15.950> some<00:03:16.130> black<00:03:16.340> values<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.150> can<00:03:17.330> do

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
there's some black values and I can do

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.710 
there's some black values and I can do
the<00:03:17.540> same<00:03:17.720> for<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.020> white<00:03:18.430> click<00:03:19.430> alt

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
the same for the white click alt

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.960 
the same for the white click alt
and<00:03:20.810> those<00:03:21.290> pieces<00:03:21.710> will<00:03:22.010> now<00:03:22.160> be<00:03:22.370> all<00:03:22.640> white

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
and those pieces will now be all white

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.210 
and those pieces will now be all white
all<00:03:23.900> right<00:03:23.960> so<00:03:24.290> now<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.830> little<00:03:25.040> bit

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
all right so now this is a little bit

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.930 
all right so now this is a little bit
more<00:03:25.960> has<00:03:26.960> a<00:03:26.990> full<00:03:27.440> range<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.920> values<00:03:28.310> like

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
more has a full range of values like

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.700 
more has a full range of values like
what<00:03:29.270> else<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.660> can<00:03:29.720> actually<00:03:29.990> do<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.530> can

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
what else I can actually do is I can

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.510 
what else I can actually do is I can
start<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.100> drag<00:03:32.030> these<00:03:33.020> highlights<00:03:33.740> up<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.340> can

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
start to drag these highlights up I can

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.310 
start to drag these highlights up I can
get<00:03:34.670> more<00:03:35.030> highlight<00:03:35.570> values<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:36.080> see<00:03:36.170> what's

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
get more highlight values to see what's

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.560 
get more highlight values to see what's
happening<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:36.980> photo<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.490> can<00:03:38.060> get<00:03:38.210> more

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
happening to the photo I can get more

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.560 
happening to the photo I can get more
shadows<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.500> what<00:03:40.400> this<00:03:40.550> in<00:03:40.760> essence<00:03:41.060> does<00:03:41.300> is

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
shadows and what this in essence does is

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.840 
shadows and what this in essence does is
it<00:03:41.690> creates<00:03:41.840> contrast<00:03:42.710> that's<00:03:43.130> what<00:03:43.310> contrast

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
it creates contrast that's what contrast

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.930 
it creates contrast that's what contrast
does<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:45.020> splits<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.530> histogram<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.370> can

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
does is it splits the histogram I can

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.730 
does is it splits the histogram I can
actually<00:03:47.210> go<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.390> contrast<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:48.200> we<00:03:48.230> can<00:03:48.380> watch

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
actually go to contrast and we can watch

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.490 
actually go to contrast and we can watch
it<00:03:48.770> split<00:03:49.370> see<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.450> takes<00:03:50.810> everything<00:03:51.140> out<00:03:51.470> of

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
it split see it takes everything out of

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.080 
it split see it takes everything out of
the<00:03:51.680> mid-tones<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.550> gives<00:03:52.790> them<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:52.970> the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
the mid-tones and gives them to the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.390 
the mid-tones and gives them to the
highlights<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.840> lowlights<00:03:54.220> highlights<00:03:55.220> and

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
highlights and lowlights highlights and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.940 
highlights and lowlights highlights and
shadows<00:03:56.770> alright

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
shadows alright

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.950 
shadows alright
double<00:03:58.250> click<00:03:58.460> on<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.820> word<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.300> now<00:03:59.510> go<00:03:59.750> back

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
double click on the word and now go back

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.570 
double click on the word and now go back
to<00:03:59.990> zero<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.470> did<00:04:03.740> like<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:03.950> little<00:04:04.280> bit<00:04:04.400> more

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
to zero so I did like a little bit more

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.420 
to zero so I did like a little bit more
black<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.360> whites<00:04:05.600> fine<00:04:05.990> for<00:04:06.320> me<00:04:06.440> that's<00:04:07.100> okay

histogram another visual that's related
to<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.549> histogram<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.209> tone<00:04:20.420> curve<00:04:20.720> or

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
to the histogram is the tone curve or

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.210 
to the histogram is the tone curve or
the<00:04:21.470> curves<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:22.450> Photoshop<00:04:23.450> lexical<00:04:24.050> so<00:04:24.950> this

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
the curves is Photoshop lexical so this

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220 
the curves is Photoshop lexical so this
you<00:04:25.760> can<00:04:25.940> see<00:04:26.180> in<00:04:26.360> grey<00:04:26.660> there<00:04:26.960> in<00:04:27.140> the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
you can see in grey there in the

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.840 
you can see in grey there in the
background<00:04:27.500> that's<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.190> histogram<00:04:28.640> that's

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
background that's the histogram that's

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.920 
background that's the histogram that's
right<00:04:29.450> there

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
right there

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.900 
right there
that<00:04:30.260> just<00:04:30.530> made<00:04:30.890> it<00:04:31.010> a<00:04:31.040> little<00:04:31.340> bit<00:04:31.550> more

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
that just made it a little bit more

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.770 
that just made it a little bit more
truncated<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.980> can<00:04:34.190> literally<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.940> good

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
truncated and I can literally a good

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.770 
truncated and I can literally a good
place<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.200> start<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:37.280> make<00:04:37.730> it<00:04:37.910> an<00:04:38.090> s-curve

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
place to start is to make it an s-curve

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.650 
place to start is to make it an s-curve
so<00:04:39.050> I<00:04:39.080> can<00:04:39.230> grab<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:39.710> guy<00:04:39.950> down<00:04:40.250> here<00:04:40.669> let<00:04:41.570> me

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
so I can grab this guy down here let me

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.040 
so I can grab this guy down here let me
move<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:43.430> grab<00:04:43.700> that<00:04:44.060> it's<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.720> little

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
move that and grab that it's a little

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.530 
move that and grab that it's a little
too<00:04:45.169> dark<00:04:45.410> for<00:04:45.530> me<00:04:46.210> you<00:04:47.210> can<00:04:47.330> see<00:04:47.510> the

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
too dark for me you can see the

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.390 
too dark for me you can see the
histogram<00:04:47.870> changing<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:48.980> can<00:04:49.100> grab<00:04:49.250> the

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
histogram changing and I can grab the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.940 
histogram changing and I can grab the
highlights<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.690> can<00:04:50.840> drag<00:04:51.050> it<00:04:51.110> up<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:51.770> make

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
highlights and I can drag it up to make

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.480 
highlights and I can drag it up to make
this<00:04:52.100> S<00:04:52.400> shape<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:53.780> in<00:04:54.590> essence<00:04:54.950> also

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
this S shape so that in essence also

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.450 
this S shape so that in essence also
creates<00:04:56.110> more<00:04:57.110> contrast<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.919> gets<00:04:58.160> things

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
creates more contrast and gets things

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.760 
creates more contrast and gets things
away<00:04:58.790> from<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:59.270> mid-tones<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.960> can<00:05:00.500> also<00:05:00.620> just

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
away from the mid-tones I can also just

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.909 
away from the mid-tones I can also just
drag<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.340> mid-tones<00:05:01.790> up<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:03.560> can<00:05:03.680> see

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
drag the mid-tones up and you can see

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.440 
drag the mid-tones up and you can see
the<00:05:04.040> histogram<00:05:04.340> rising<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:06.790> moving<00:05:07.790> to<00:05:08.360> the

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
the histogram rising and moving to the

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.500 
the histogram rising and moving to the
right<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:09.400> then<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.490> same<00:05:10.700> thing<00:05:10.730> if<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.240> lower

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
right and then the same thing if I lower

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.290 
right and then the same thing if I lower
it<00:05:11.690> down<00:05:11.720> histogram<00:05:12.710> gets<00:05:12.950> lower<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:13.520> moves

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
it down histogram gets lower and moves

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.460 
it down histogram gets lower and moves
to<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.630> left

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
to the left

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.250 
to the left
so<00:05:17.040> those<00:05:17.190> are<00:05:17.340> two<00:05:17.370> visual<00:05:18.270> representations

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
so those are two visual representations

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.950 
so those are two visual representations
both<00:05:19.560> applications<00:05:19.800> of<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.550> histogram

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
both applications of the histogram

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.870 
both applications of the histogram
itself<00:05:21.960> just<00:05:22.710> remember<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.730> goes

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
itself just remember that it goes

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.590 
itself just remember that it goes
shadows<00:05:24.780> mid-tones<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:26.340> highlights<00:05:26.480> and<00:05:27.480> I

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
shadows mid-tones and highlights and I

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.560 
shadows mid-tones and highlights and I
definitely<00:05:27.960> recommend<00:05:28.580> using<00:05:29.580> your<00:05:29.700> DSLR<00:05:30.300> on

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
definitely recommend using your DSLR on

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.000 
definitely recommend using your DSLR on
the<00:05:30.720> setting<00:05:31.140> that<00:05:31.290> shows<00:05:31.590> you<00:05:31.830> your

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
the setting that shows you your

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.700 
the setting that shows you your
histogram<00:05:32.310> immediately<00:05:33.300> after<00:05:34.230> taking<00:05:34.500> the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
histogram immediately after taking the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.830 
histogram immediately after taking the
photo<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.280> that's<00:05:35.670> a<00:05:35.790> great<00:05:36.030> objective<00:05:36.690> way

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
photo and that's a great objective way

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.990 
photo and that's a great objective way
to<00:05:36.870> judge<00:05:37.320> if<00:05:37.530> your<00:05:37.740> photograph<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.490> well

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
to judge if your photograph is well

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.450 
to judge if your photograph is well
exposed
