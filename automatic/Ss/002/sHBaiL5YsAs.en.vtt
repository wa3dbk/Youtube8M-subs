in<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.510> park<00:00:47.750> exactly<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:48.710> we're<00:00:48.890> just<00:00:48.920> gonna<00:00:49.160> go

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
in a park exactly so we're just gonna go

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.910 
in a park exactly so we're just gonna go
down<00:00:49.690> feel<00:00:50.690> free<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:50.930> pause<00:00:51.140> at<00:00:51.440> any<00:00:51.530> certain

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
down feel free to pause at any certain

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.510 
down feel free to pause at any certain
percentage<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.590> percentage<00:00:55.039> is<00:00:55.129> listed

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
percentage and the percentage is listed

percentage and the percentage is listed
down<00:00:55.550> below<00:00:56.030> there<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.550> that's<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.850> full

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
down below there so that's the full

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.790 
down below there so that's the full
range<00:01:05.330> of<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.780> aura<00:01:05.990> h2o

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
range of the aura h2o

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.440 
range of the aura h2o
do<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.430> same<00:01:07.640> thing<00:01:07.850> with<00:01:07.970> this<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.360> then

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
do the same thing with this and then

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.420 
do the same thing with this and then
we'll<00:01:08.600> point<00:01:08.869> out<00:01:09.020> inconsistencies<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:10.160> the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
we'll point out inconsistencies in the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.750 
we'll point out inconsistencies in the
screen<00:01:13.479> seems<00:01:14.479> both<00:01:14.960> equally<00:01:15.500> as<00:01:15.760> responsive

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
screen seems both equally as responsive

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.500 
screen seems both equally as responsive
we're<00:01:17.210> doing<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.930> slider<00:01:18.260> thing

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.760 

so<00:01:25.510> now<00:01:25.660> we're<00:01:25.780> going<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:25.990> put<00:01:26.140> them<00:01:26.260> both<00:01:26.500> at

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
so now we're going to put them both at

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.920 
so now we're going to put them both at
max<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.550> we're<00:01:27.760> just<00:01:27.850> going<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.180> look<00:01:28.330> at<00:01:28.570> what

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
max and we're just going to look at what

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.530 
max and we're just going to look at what
we<00:01:29.050> can<00:01:29.200> see<00:01:29.470> on<00:01:29.650> these<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.820> we<00:01:31.240> were<00:01:31.330> talking

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
we can see on these so we were talking

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.720 
we can see on these so we were talking
before<00:01:32.080> we<00:01:32.110> filmed<00:01:32.650> this<00:01:32.830> just<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.340> kind<00:01:33.580> of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
before we filmed this just to kind of

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.640 
before we filmed this just to kind of
get<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> good<00:01:34.060> idea<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.630> we've<00:01:35.170> noticed<00:01:35.530> that

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
get a good idea and we've noticed that

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.730 
get a good idea and we've noticed that
the<00:01:35.800> left<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.210> right<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.900> top<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.410> h2

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
the left the right and the top of the h2

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.290 
the left the right and the top of the h2
are<00:01:38.860> pretty<00:01:39.190> consistent<00:01:39.880> with<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.120> light

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
are pretty consistent with the light

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.420 
are pretty consistent with the light
going<00:01:40.630> directly<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.650> edge<00:01:41.800> I'm<00:01:42.070> using<00:01:42.220> the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
going directly to the edge I'm using the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.850 
going directly to the edge I'm using the
Sony<00:01:42.730> stylus<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.390> show<00:01:43.540> you<00:01:43.600> guys<00:01:43.810> whereas<00:01:44.620> on

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
Sony stylus to show you guys whereas on

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.070 
Sony stylus to show you guys whereas on
the<00:01:45.040> Kobo<00:01:45.400> if<00:01:45.580> we<00:01:45.910> had<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.240> nitpick<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.810> course

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
the Kobo if we had to nitpick of course

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.830 
the Kobo if we had to nitpick of course
you<00:01:47.650> see<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:48.040> it's<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.280> lot<00:01:48.580> more<00:01:48.880> gray<00:01:49.300> here

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
you see that it's a lot more gray here

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.230 
you see that it's a lot more gray here
as<00:01:49.990> well<00:01:50.860> as<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.190> sides<00:01:51.520> has<00:01:51.910> all<00:01:52.090> this

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
as well as the sides has all this

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.890 
as well as the sides has all this
clouding<00:01:53.170> going<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:53.710> almost<00:01:54.640> like<00:01:55.210> one<00:01:55.660> or<00:01:55.780> two

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
clouding going on almost like one or two

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.020 
clouding going on almost like one or two
millimeters<00:01:56.140> outside<00:01:56.890> from<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.250> side<00:01:57.580> of<00:01:57.910> the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
millimeters outside from the side of the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.270 
millimeters outside from the side of the
bezel<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.570> especially<00:01:59.410> at<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.590> bottom<00:01:59.770> but

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
bezel and especially at the bottom but

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.760 
bezel and especially at the bottom but
the<00:02:00.730> bottom<00:02:01.090> on<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.240> h2o<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.350> aura<00:02:02.500> are

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
the bottom on the h2o and the aura are

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.350 
the bottom on the h2o and the aura are
pretty<00:02:02.980> much<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.310> same<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.760> both<00:02:03.940> get<00:02:04.180> this

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
pretty much the same you both get this

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.719 
pretty much the same you both get this
kind<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.690> gray<00:02:05.040> clouding<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.160> that's<00:02:06.280> because

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
kind of gray clouding and that's because

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.240 
kind of gray clouding and that's because
the<00:02:06.970> LEDs<00:02:07.420> come<00:02:07.720> from<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:07.960> bottom<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:08.950> can

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the LEDs come from the bottom so you can

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.450 
the LEDs come from the bottom so you can
really<00:02:09.490> see<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.940> intensity<00:02:10.479> one<00:02:11.470> two<00:02:11.890> three

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
really see the intensity one two three

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.480 
really see the intensity one two three
four<00:02:12.940> five<00:02:13.300> LEDs<00:02:13.780> yeah<00:02:14.350> same<00:02:14.650> with<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.010> you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
four five LEDs yeah same with this you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.820 
four five LEDs yeah same with this you
get<00:02:15.700> all<00:02:16.000> five<00:02:16.780> at<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:16.990> bottom<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.650> gets

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
get all five at the bottom and it gets

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.980 
get all five at the bottom and it gets
really<00:02:18.190> intense<00:02:18.490> around<00:02:18.940> where<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.330> beam<00:02:19.600> is

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
really intense around where the beam is

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.230 
really intense around where the beam is
but<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.890> course<00:02:21.220> when<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.730> look<00:02:21.760> at<00:02:22.090> them

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
but of course when you look at them

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.550 
but of course when you look at them
you're<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.540> wow<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> glow<00:02:23.380> light

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
you're like wow this is a glow light

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.710 
you're like wow this is a glow light
ereader<00:02:23.860> period<00:02:24.310> but<00:02:24.730> if<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.030> had<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.390> assess

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
ereader period but if you had to assess

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.300 
ereader period but if you had to assess
it<00:02:25.900> go<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.230> extra<00:02:26.320> mile<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.770> say<00:02:26.890> what<00:02:27.190> is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
it go the extra mile and say what is

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.100 
it go the extra mile and say what is
what<00:02:27.820> are<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.030> inconsistencies<00:02:28.660> what<00:02:28.989> are

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
what are the inconsistencies what are

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.110 
what are the inconsistencies what are
the<00:02:29.170> shortcomings<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:30.250> would<00:02:30.520> be<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.850> that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
the shortcomings that would be it that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640 
the shortcomings that would be it that
there's<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.420> little<00:02:31.660> bit<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.870> puffing<00:02:32.410> around

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
there's a little bit of puffing around

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.229 
there's a little bit of puffing around
the<00:02:32.770> sides<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.580> lights<00:02:33.820> are<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> little

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
the sides and the lights are a little

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.420 
the sides and the lights are a little
too<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.570> okay<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.230> exactly<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:35.950> glow<00:02:36.220> like

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
too it okay what exactly is glow like

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.530 
too it okay what exactly is glow like
technology<00:02:36.820> well<00:02:37.420> with<00:02:38.260> tablets<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:40.120> say

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
technology well with tablets like say

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.830 
technology well with tablets like say
the<00:02:41.020> iPad<00:02:41.650> Mini<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.940> light<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.360> emitting

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
the iPad Mini that the light is emitting

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.620 
the iPad Mini that the light is emitting
from<00:02:44.350> behind<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.950> screen<00:02:45.310> into<00:02:45.580> your<00:02:45.790> eyes<00:02:45.970> so

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
from behind the screen into your eyes so

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.840 
from behind the screen into your eyes so
it's<00:02:47.320> okay<00:02:47.680> when<00:02:47.830> you're<00:02:47.950> reading<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:48.820> a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
it's okay when you're reading like a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.820 
it's okay when you're reading like a
comic<00:02:49.300> book<00:02:49.330> or<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.630> magazine<00:02:49.780> or<00:02:50.350> an<00:02:50.470> e-book

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
comic book or a magazine or an e-book

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.070 
comic book or a magazine or an e-book
when<00:02:51.550> you're<00:02:51.700> only<00:02:51.820> reading<00:02:52.239> for<00:02:52.540> maybe<00:02:52.989> like

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
when you're only reading for maybe like

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.080 
when you're only reading for maybe like
a<00:02:53.290> few<00:02:53.500> minutes<00:02:53.739> or<00:02:53.920> 10<00:02:54.220> or<00:02:54.340> 15<00:02:54.670> minutes<00:02:54.940> but

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
a few minutes or 10 or 15 minutes but

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.390 
a few minutes or 10 or 15 minutes but
with<00:02:55.510> an<00:02:55.660> e-reader<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.590> lakes<00:02:56.830> not<00:02:57.040> emitting

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
with an e-reader the lakes not emitting

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.040 
with an e-reader the lakes not emitting
from<00:02:57.459> behind<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> screen<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:58.269> LED<00:02:58.810> lights

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
from behind the screen this LED lights

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.290 
from behind the screen this LED lights
on<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.200> bottom<00:02:59.590> they're<00:02:59.739> shiny<00:03:00.220> upwards<00:03:00.940> and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
on the bottom they're shiny upwards and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.100 
on the bottom they're shiny upwards and
so<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:02.530> much<00:03:03.010> easier<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.910> read<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.900> long

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
so it's much easier to read for a long

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.310 
so it's much easier to read for a long
term<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.950> not<00:03:06.370> have<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.239> type<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.840> eye<00:03:08.140> strain

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
term and not have the type of eye strain

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.160 
term and not have the type of eye strain
that<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.100> would<00:03:09.310> see<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:09.880> your<00:03:10.360> computer

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
that you would see on your computer

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.990 
that you would see on your computer
monitor<00:03:11.320> your<00:03:11.920> smartphone<00:03:12.459> or<00:03:12.760> your<00:03:12.790> tablet
