take a lot of vibration and shock out of
the<00:01:08.900> boat<00:01:09.110> as<00:01:10.070> well<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.880> know<00:01:10.970> with<00:01:11.120> with<00:01:11.390> the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
the boat as well you know with with the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.630 
the boat as well you know with with the
past<00:01:11.690> parallel<00:01:11.900> limb<00:01:12.230> design<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.860> lot<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.520> these

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
past parallel limb design a lot of these

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.520 
past parallel limb design a lot of these
forces<00:01:14.030> cancel<00:01:14.300> when<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.720> shoot<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.050> bow<00:01:15.200> and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
forces cancel when you shoot the bow and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.550 
forces cancel when you shoot the bow and
it<00:01:15.920> just<00:01:16.100> translates<00:01:16.490> into<00:01:17.230> such<00:01:18.230> a<00:01:18.260> smooth

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
it just translates into such a smooth

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.020 
it just translates into such a smooth
shot<00:01:18.800> I<00:01:18.830> mean<00:01:18.980> this<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:19.310> bow<00:01:19.490> doesn't<00:01:19.700> have

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
shot I mean this this bow doesn't have

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.030 
shot I mean this this bow doesn't have
an<00:01:20.270> shock<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:21.230> has<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.440> little<00:01:21.620> bit<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.860> feedback

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
an shock it has a little bit of feedback

it's<00:01:23.000> maybe<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.510> best<00:01:23.750> way<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:23.990> describe<00:01:24.380> it

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710
