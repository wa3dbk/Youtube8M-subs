 Ukrainian gunners this part 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.660
 cities nearby 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.330
 boiler room apparently Ukrainian troops 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.850
 They wanted to destroy the boiler put 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.410
 people without heat but initially their shells 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.180
 just went to the seventh and eighth house 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.570
 half the house burned out but as we see 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.480
 windows doors are sealed and people continue 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.160
 live despite the fact that they have 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.610
 almost no property left to them 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.140

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.150
 I repeat the Ukrainian troops inflicted 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.360
