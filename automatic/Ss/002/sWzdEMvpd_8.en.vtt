00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
No so the next thing I'm gonna show you

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.450 
No so the next thing I'm gonna show you
is<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.510> noop<00:00:03.780> which<00:00:04.440> are<00:00:04.680> these<00:00:04.859> lovely<00:00:05.339> little

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
is a noop which are these lovely little

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.230 
is a noop which are these lovely little
guys<00:00:05.730> now<00:00:06.540> oops<00:00:06.899> are<00:00:07.200> used<00:00:07.500> in<00:00:07.710> lace<00:00:08.000> much<00:00:09.000> more

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
guys now oops are used in lace much more

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.060 
guys now oops are used in lace much more
often<00:00:09.420> than<00:00:09.599> bobbles<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> reason<00:00:10.889> for

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
often than bobbles and the reason for

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.470 
often than bobbles and the reason for
this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.400> actually<00:00:11.550> uses<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> little<00:00:12.300> bit

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
this is it actually uses a little bit

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.310 
this is it actually uses a little bit
less<00:00:12.690> yarn<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.139> it's<00:00:13.259> less<00:00:15.230> kind<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
less yarn and it's less kind of

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.429 
less yarn and it's less kind of
obstructive<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.750> actual<00:00:18.750> lace<00:00:18.960> pattern

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
obstructive of the actual lace pattern

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.890 
obstructive of the actual lace pattern
now<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> bobble<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.420> essentially<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
now what a bobble is it's essentially a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.330 
now what a bobble is it's essentially a
very<00:00:22.140> short<00:00:23.150> patch<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.449> short<00:00:24.750> rows<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.680> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
very short patch of short rows so you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.349 
very short patch of short rows so you
would<00:00:26.519> increase<00:00:27.000> into<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> stitch<00:00:28.429> by<00:00:29.429> many

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
would increase into a stitch by many

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.959 
would increase into a stitch by many
times<00:00:30.689> maybe<00:00:31.140> increased<00:00:31.980> five<00:00:32.309> stitches<00:00:32.790> into

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
times maybe increased five stitches into

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.470 
times maybe increased five stitches into
that<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.390> stitch<00:00:33.660> turn<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:34.860> work<00:00:35.100> knit<00:00:35.969> back

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that one stitch turn your work knit back

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.360 
that one stitch turn your work knit back
or<00:00:36.750> purl<00:00:37.050> back<00:00:37.290> across<00:00:37.350> those<00:00:37.920> five<00:00:38.190> stitches

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
or purl back across those five stitches

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
or purl back across those five stitches
turn<00:00:38.790> again<00:00:39.120> knit<00:00:39.510> back<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:40.110> knit<00:00:40.379> them<00:00:40.530> all

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
turn again knit back or knit them all

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.970 
turn again knit back or knit them all
together<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.700> several<00:00:41.969> rows<00:00:42.559> what<00:00:43.559> Anoop

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
together and do several rows what Anoop

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.240 
together and do several rows what Anoop
does<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.730> instead<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.239> actually<00:00:45.629> increasing

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
does is instead of actually increasing

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.770 
does is instead of actually increasing
directly<00:00:47.250> into<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.700> stitch<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.300> many<00:00:48.450> times

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
directly into that stitch so many times

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.410 
directly into that stitch so many times
it<00:00:49.110> has<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> pattern<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.309> increasing<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.120> yarn

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it has a pattern of increasing and yarn

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
it has a pattern of increasing and yarn
overs<00:00:51.780> now<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> yarn<00:00:52.949> overs<00:00:53.250> are<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.579> kind

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
overs now the yarn overs are what kind

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.639 
overs now the yarn overs are what kind
of<00:00:53.879> throw<00:00:54.360> people<00:00:54.570> off<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> do

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
of throw people off because if you do

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.610 
of throw people off because if you do
them<00:00:55.800> too<00:00:55.949> tightly<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.789> very<00:00:57.030> hard<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.620> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
them too tightly it's very hard to you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.700 
them too tightly it's very hard to you
know<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:59.550> make<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> new<00:01:00.420> work<00:01:00.780> but

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
know actually make the new work but

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.319 
know actually make the new work but
another<00:01:02.190> thing<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.670> separates<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> from

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
another thing that separates it from

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.210 
another thing that separates it from
bobbles<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.769> actually<00:01:05.070> worked

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
bobbles is that it's actually worked

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039 
bobbles is that it's actually worked
over<00:01:05.489> two<00:01:05.700> rows<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> knitting<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.810> can

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
over two rows of the knitting so you can

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
over two rows of the knitting so you can
just<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.490> side<00:01:08.700> part<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> new

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
just do the right side part of the new

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
just do the right side part of the new
and<00:01:09.570> when<00:01:09.689> you're<00:01:09.840> purling<00:01:10.650> back<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> next

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and when you're purling back on the next

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.390 
and when you're purling back on the next
row<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.780> when<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.229> actually<00:01:13.380> work<00:01:14.189> all

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
row that's when you actually work all

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.190 
row that's when you actually work all
the<00:01:14.549> stitches<00:01:14.880> back<00:01:15.060> together<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.049> don't

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the stitches back together so you don't

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.270 
the stitches back together so you don't
have<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> turn<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.650> work<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> whole<00:01:17.009> bunch<00:01:17.189> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
have to turn your work a whole bunch of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.270 
have to turn your work a whole bunch of
times<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.670> actually<00:01:17.939> very<00:01:18.210> quick<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> it's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
times it's actually very quick and it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.429 
times it's actually very quick and it's
a<00:01:20.369> lot<00:01:20.520> lighter<00:01:20.729> weight<00:01:20.850> than<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> bobble<00:01:21.630> so

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
a lot lighter weight than a bobble so

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.890 
a lot lighter weight than a bobble so
the<00:01:22.619> way<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.799> would<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.750> it's<00:01:24.750> gonna

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the way you would do that it's gonna

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.649 
the way you would do that it's gonna
make<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.320> pattern<00:01:25.619> look<00:01:25.770> very<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.280> funny

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
make this pattern look very very funny

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.499 
make this pattern look very very funny
that's<00:01:27.659> okay<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.170> swatch<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.240> what<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> do

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that's okay it's a swatch so what you do

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.030 
that's okay it's a swatch so what you do
is<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.810> pick<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> stitch<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.710> want<00:01:31.920> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
is you pick the stitch that you want to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
is you pick the stitch that you want to
noop<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.270> case<00:01:33.509> I'm<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.049> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
noop in this case I'm gonna go for this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
noop in this case I'm gonna go for this
guy<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:36.470> knit<00:01:37.470> into<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.180> yarn<00:01:39.180> over

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
guy right here knit into it yarn over

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.170 
guy right here knit into it yarn over
knit<00:01:40.400> into<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.600> yarn<00:01:42.600> over<00:01:42.780> knit<00:01:43.490> into<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
knit into it yarn over knit into it and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
knit into it yarn over knit into it and
you<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.229> want<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.369> kind<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you you want to do this in this kind of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.580 
you you want to do this in this kind of
pattern<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.090> five<00:01:48.390> stitch<00:01:48.810> loop<00:01:49.350> so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
pattern this is a five stitch loop so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
pattern this is a five stitch loop so
it's<00:01:49.740> always<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.579> knit<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.450> either

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it's always going to be a knit on either

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.209 
it's always going to be a knit on either
side<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.110> gonna<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.470> an<00:01:53.189> odd<00:01:54.000> number<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.869> it's

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
side it's gonna be an odd number so it's

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.219 
side it's gonna be an odd number so it's
knit<00:01:56.219> into<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.700> yarn<00:01:57.060> over<00:01:57.210> knit<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.020> yarn

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
knit into it yarn over knit into it yarn

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.109 
knit into it yarn over knit into it yarn
over<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.579> as<00:01:59.670> many<00:01:59.759> times<00:01:59.880> as

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
over you can do that as many times as

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.370 
over you can do that as many times as
you<00:02:00.210> want<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> knit<00:02:01.229> into

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
you want and then you have to knit into

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.230 
you want and then you have to knit into
it<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> end<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> would<00:02:03.210> just

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it at the end and then you would just

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.980 
it at the end and then you would just
continue<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.549> knit<00:02:05.549> across<00:02:05.700> your<00:02:06.149> row<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.570> do

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
continue and knit across your row or do

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.830 
continue and knit across your row or do
whatever<00:02:07.200> your<00:02:07.530> pattern<00:02:07.829> dictates<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.910> then

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
whatever your pattern dictates and then

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.860 
whatever your pattern dictates and then
when<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.470> turn<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.860> around<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
when you turn it around and you go to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.860 
when you turn it around and you go to
purl<00:02:12.870> everything

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
purl everything

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.820 
purl everything
you<00:02:14.230> do<00:02:14.470> pearl<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.129> all<00:02:15.340> together<00:02:16.049> now<00:02:17.049> the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
you do pearl it all together now the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.259 
you do pearl it all together now the
funny<00:02:18.340> part<00:02:18.610> about<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:20.549> it's<00:02:21.549> it's<00:02:21.909> a

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
funny part about that is it's it's a

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.630 
funny part about that is it's it's a
little<00:02:22.510> difficult<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.170> get<00:02:23.409> all<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.519> those

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
little difficult to get all of those

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.030 
little difficult to get all of those
stitches<00:02:24.909> to<00:02:25.180> work<00:02:25.420> at<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.780> same<00:02:26.049> time<00:02:26.409> but

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
stitches to work at the same time but

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.890 
stitches to work at the same time but
the<00:02:27.280> trick<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.700> don't<00:02:28.120> have<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.450> do<00:02:28.569> it<00:02:28.599> all

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the trick is you don't have to do it all

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.100 
the trick is you don't have to do it all
at<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:29.170> same<00:02:29.379> time<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.819> here's<00:02:31.690> my<00:02:31.870> five

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
at the same time so here's my five

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.530 
at the same time so here's my five
stitches<00:02:32.409> of<00:02:32.769> mine<00:02:33.010> OOP

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
stitches of mine OOP

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.289 
stitches of mine OOP
so<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.569> could<00:02:35.019> try<00:02:35.379> to<00:02:35.739> purl<00:02:36.129> all<00:02:36.430> five<00:02:36.760> stitches

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
so I could try to purl all five stitches

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.699 
so I could try to purl all five stitches
together<00:02:37.480> all<00:02:37.900> at<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.079> same<00:02:38.230> time<00:02:38.290> as<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.680> can

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
together all at the same time as you can

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.199 
together all at the same time as you can
see<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.099> kind<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.310> hard<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.519> pick<00:02:39.730> up<00:02:39.940> isn't

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
see that's kind of hard to pick up isn't

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.140 
see that's kind of hard to pick up isn't
it<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:42.099> can<00:02:42.250> do<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.489> if<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.700> want<00:02:42.970> you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
it so you can do that if you want you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.240 
it so you can do that if you want you
can<00:02:43.299> kind<00:02:44.049> of<00:02:44.140> wiggle<00:02:44.379> it<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.950> could<00:02:45.099> use<00:02:45.129> a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
can kind of wiggle it you could use a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.789 
can kind of wiggle it you could use a
smaller<00:02:45.730> gauge<00:02:46.030> needle<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.440> right-hand

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
smaller gauge needle and the right-hand

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.020 
smaller gauge needle and the right-hand
needle<00:02:47.950> if<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.250> want<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.519> if<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:48.640> had<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> cable

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
needle if you want to if you had a cable

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.300 
needle if you want to if you had a cable
needle<00:02:49.299> or<00:02:49.720> just<00:02:49.989> like<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.109> very<00:02:50.319> small<00:02:50.650> DPN<00:02:51.129> you

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
needle or just like a very small DPN you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.619 
needle or just like a very small DPN you
could<00:02:51.430> use<00:02:51.609> that<00:02:51.819> if<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.090> want<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.299> do<00:02:52.450> all<00:02:52.599> of

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
could use that if you want to do all of

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.400 
could use that if you want to do all of
them<00:02:52.840> at<00:02:52.959> once<00:02:53.140> or<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:54.579> can<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:55.260> purl<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
them at once or you can just purl a

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.020 
them at once or you can just purl a
couple<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.799> them<00:02:56.890> together<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.459> then<00:02:57.579> slip

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
couple of them together and then slip

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.740 
couple of them together and then slip
the<00:02:58.329> next<00:02:58.629> several<00:02:58.810> stitches<00:02:59.170> over<00:03:00.750> because

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
the next several stitches over because

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.880 
the next several stitches over because
essentially<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.379> going<00:03:02.409> to<00:03:02.560> create<00:03:02.769> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
essentially it's going to create the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.559 
essentially it's going to create the
same<00:03:03.069> stitch<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:03.609> I'm<00:03:03.730> just<00:03:03.909> gonna<00:03:04.000> do<00:03:04.269> all

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
same stitch so I'm just gonna do all

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:05.759 
same stitch so I'm just gonna do all
five<00:03:04.930> at<00:03:05.319> once

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
five at once

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.030 
five at once
purl<00:03:06.400> five<00:03:06.700> together<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.750> that's<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.319> there's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
purl five together and that's it there's

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.680 
purl five together and that's it there's
a<00:03:09.099> new<00:03:09.310> pond<00:03:09.519> there<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.940> looks<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.299> little<00:03:10.390> funny

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
a new pond there it looks a little funny

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.089 
a new pond there it looks a little funny
because<00:03:10.870> this<00:03:11.079> is<00:03:11.200> worsted<00:03:11.530> weight<00:03:11.680> yarn<00:03:11.709> and

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
because this is worsted weight yarn and

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.369 
because this is worsted weight yarn and
usually<00:03:12.849> you<00:03:13.000> wouldn't<00:03:13.269> see<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:14.019> on<00:03:14.319> a

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
usually you wouldn't see that on a

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.550 
usually you wouldn't see that on a
heavier<00:03:15.190> yarn<00:03:16.079> but<00:03:17.079> if<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.290> could<00:03:17.409> imagine

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
heavier yarn but if you could imagine

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.949 
heavier yarn but if you could imagine
shrink<00:03:18.160> this<00:03:18.310> down<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.790> actually<00:03:19.120> looks<00:03:19.329> just

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
shrink this down it actually looks just

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.020 
shrink this down it actually looks just
like<00:03:20.230> this<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.680> kind<00:03:20.859> of<00:03:20.919> see<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.669> main

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
like this you can kind of see that main

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.509 
like this you can kind of see that main
stitch<00:03:22.450> here<00:03:23.019> with<00:03:23.290> all<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.829> other<00:03:24.069> little

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
stitch here with all of the other little

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.890 
stitch here with all of the other little
added<00:03:24.910> yarn<00:03:25.180> overs<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.959> lumps<00:03:26.769> behind<00:03:27.220> it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
added yarn overs and and lumps behind it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.210 
added yarn overs and and lumps behind it
so<00:03:28.900> what's<00:03:29.200> great<00:03:29.440> about<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.950> new<00:03:30.040> business

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
so what's great about the new business

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.099 
so what's great about the new business
actually<00:03:30.579> once<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.209> do<00:03:31.389> a<00:03:31.419> couple<00:03:31.690> of<00:03:31.959> them

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
actually once you do a couple of them

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.740 
actually once you do a couple of them
it's<00:03:32.290> not<00:03:32.590> difficult<00:03:32.859> at<00:03:33.190> all<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.299> it'll<00:03:34.540> kind

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
it's not difficult at all and it'll kind

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.559 
it's not difficult at all and it'll kind
of<00:03:34.840> be<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:34.989> little<00:03:35.260> Eureka<00:03:35.739> moment<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.069> oh

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
of be that little Eureka moment like oh

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.770 
of be that little Eureka moment like oh
okay

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
okay
