00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 3 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.000
 yes 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.260
 good morning friends about doctor jaime camacho and like every Saturday 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.189
 who your programs say to you 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.169
 let's talk about an interesting health topic today I'm going 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.140
 to talk about testicular diseases 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.420
 the testicles are the sexual organs of man that produce the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.390
 male hormones 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.849
 and also produce the expert 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.879
 it is very easy to injure the testicles because they are not protected by bones or 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:33.810
 muscles 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.900
 the presence of pain redness spots or some other alteration that 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.970
 can mean a medical problem should be consulted immediately 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.380
 There may be future complications in both fertility and sexual life hello 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.520
 In general, the testicles can become inflamed, can become infected or can 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.540
 develop cancer then I will refer some of these problems 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.490
 the inspection against masion of the testicle 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.930
 is when the testicle itself or the duct that carries the sperm of the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.720
 testicle to have the pain swelling produces heat and redness and is 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.490
 caused by an infection 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.490
 this infection can can come from urinary tract infections 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.760
 I've heard of sexually transmitted infections and it's treated like analgesic antibiotics. 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.570
 another problem that we see is the varicocele 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.450
 is when one of the veins in the testicle is dilated and swollen 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.290
 one in ten men may have some degree of varicocele said dena 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.660
 inflamed 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.720
 This epic can cause heaviness in the testicular area pain 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.410
 heat and may also fertility problems 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.510
 many times it can be confused with a tumor 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.590
 or it can also be confused with a tour 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.580
 also the patient will notice that a witness of this a little bit more 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.650
 great than the other 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.090
 the diagnosis is with a testicular examination and with ultrasound 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 in infertile men you should always check for seafood l as one of the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.700
 causes of infertility in man this is here can be corrected 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.089
 up to 90% with an operation 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:21.709
 another problem is he who knows 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.220
 what is the accumulation of fluid inside the testicle 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.989
 growing the testicle a lot and causing a lot of pain regret the cause 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.469
 it is otan infections well by some blow 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.180
 my general advice for this problem is that if you have some kind of 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.929
 testicular problem 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:44.579
 you should see your doctor immediately so that it is diagnosed mystic 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.679
 cause and be treated properly
