[Music]

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.280 

so<00:00:08.849> unappreciative<00:00:09.389> take<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> look<00:00:10.230> at

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
so unappreciative take a look at

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.320 
so unappreciative take a look at
something<00:00:10.500> called<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.860> looping<00:00:11.340> pendulum<00:00:11.910> now

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
something called a looping pendulum now

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.549 
something called a looping pendulum now
we<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.599> make<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> variety<00:00:13.530> of

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
we can make this with a variety of

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.200 
we can make this with a variety of
materials<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.490> let's<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:14.790> start<00:00:14.940> off<00:00:15.030> using

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
materials but let's just start off using

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.510 
materials but let's just start off using
a<00:00:15.420> coffee<00:00:15.630> mug<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.139> short<00:00:16.710> length<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.039> string<00:00:17.340> in

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
a coffee mug a short length of string in

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.400 
a coffee mug a short length of string in
a<00:00:17.580> lead<00:00:17.760> weight<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.330> we're<00:00:18.930> gonna<00:00:19.050> hang<00:00:19.289> it

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
a lead weight and we're gonna hang it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.439 
a lead weight and we're gonna hang it
over<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.710> bar<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.340> I'm<00:00:20.789> gonna<00:00:20.880> release<00:00:21.210> this

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
over this bar and I'm gonna release this

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.090 
over this bar and I'm gonna release this
well<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:21.990> would<00:00:22.140> expect<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.590> talking<00:00:22.769> about<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
well we would expect it talking about to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500 
well we would expect it talking about to
go<00:00:23.220> down<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.550> shatter<00:00:23.820> against<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> table

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
go down and shatter against the table

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.530 
go down and shatter against the table
but<00:00:25.140> watch<00:00:25.320> what<00:00:25.529> happens<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:32.189> does<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.640> well

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
but watch what happens it does it well

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.479 
but watch what happens it does it well
what's<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.410> let's<00:00:34.829> take<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> closer<00:00:35.520> look

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
what's going on let's take a closer look

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.590 
what's going on let's take a closer look
it<00:00:38.489> appears<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.030> small<00:00:39.270> weight<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it appears that the small weight is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.970 
it appears that the small weight is
going<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.140> wrapping<00:00:40.440> around<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> pole

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
going up and wrapping around the pole

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.440 
going up and wrapping around the pole
and<00:00:41.219> stopping<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> cup<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.120> shorted

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and stopping the cup just shorted

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
and stopping the cup just shorted
hitting<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> table<00:00:43.399> this<00:00:44.399> could<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> good

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
hitting the table this could be a good

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.250 
hitting the table this could be a good
demonstration<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.750> students<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
demonstration for students to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.500 
demonstration for students to
investigate<00:00:46.430> they<00:00:47.430> could<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:47.789> washers<00:00:48.329> or

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
investigate they could use washers or

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
investigate they could use washers or
nuts<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> investigate<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> ratio<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
nuts and investigate the ratio of the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
nuts and investigate the ratio of the
light<00:00:50.820> weight<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> heavy<00:00:51.449> weight<00:00:51.690> we

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
light weight to the heavy weight we

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.540 
light weight to the heavy weight we
found<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.649> pretty<00:00:52.829> good<00:00:52.980> ratio<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.430> about

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
found a pretty good ratio of about

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.510 
found a pretty good ratio of about
fourteen<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.829> other<00:00:55.829> variables<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
fourteen to one other variables to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
fourteen to one other variables to
investigate<00:00:57.059> would<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> ideal<00:00:57.809> angle<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
investigate would be the ideal angle to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
investigate would be the ideal angle to
release<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.680> from<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.129> also<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
release it from and also what is the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.930 
release it from and also what is the
ideal<00:01:00.660> string<00:01:01.140> length<00:01:01.489> now<00:01:02.489> let's<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:02.879> we

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
ideal string length now let's see if we

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
ideal string length now let's see if we
can<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> better<00:01:03.359> view<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.989> what's<00:01:04.170> going

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
can get a better view just what's going

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890 
can get a better view just what's going
on<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.799> demonstration<00:01:05.479> I've<00:01:06.479> added<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
on in this demonstration I've added a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
on in this demonstration I've added a
green<00:01:07.170> LED<00:01:07.380> light<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> light<00:01:08.250> weight<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
green LED light to the light weight and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
green LED light to the light weight and
a<00:01:08.970> blue<00:01:09.210> LED<00:01:09.420> light<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> heavyweight<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
a blue LED light to the heavyweight and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.289 
a blue LED light to the heavyweight and
then<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> record<00:01:11.880> them<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
then I'm going to record them in the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.289 
then I'm going to record them in the
dark<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> results<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.189> get

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.960 

now<00:01:18.299> let's<00:01:18.540> try<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> dark<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.820> see

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
now let's try it in the dark we can see

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.190 
now let's try it in the dark we can see
the<00:01:24.090> initial<00:01:24.270> movement<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> single

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the initial movement of the single

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.570 
the initial movement of the single
weight<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> two<00:01:25.560> swing<00:01:25.799> down<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> pendulum

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
weight is two swing down like a pendulum

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.609 
weight is two swing down like a pendulum
but<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> heavier<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.720> weight<00:01:27.960> forces<00:01:28.500> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
but the heavier of weight forces it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.020 
but the heavier of weight forces it
upwards<00:01:28.950> causing<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> loop<00:01:29.700> around<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
upwards causing it to loop around the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.330 
upwards causing it to loop around the
support<00:01:30.500> friction<00:01:31.500> stops<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> heavy<00:01:32.159> way

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
support friction stops the heavy way

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100 
support friction stops the heavy way
from<00:01:32.579> falling<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.720> weight<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
from falling when that little weight is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.920 
from falling when that little weight is
about<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> same<00:01:34.710> height<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.189> bar<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.930> now

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
about the same height as the bar is now

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.679 
about the same height as the bar is now
let's<00:01:37.110> try<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.320> again<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.650> different<00:01:37.979> colors

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
let's try it again with different colors

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.030 
let's try it again with different colors
once<00:01:39.689> again<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> same<00:01:40.290> result<00:01:40.829> as

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
once again we see the same result as

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
once again we see the same result as
that<00:01:41.579> weight<00:01:41.759> wraps<00:01:42.030> around<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> bar<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
that weight wraps around the bar the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
that weight wraps around the bar the
width<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> path<00:01:43.380> stays<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> same<00:01:43.950> until

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
width of the path stays the same until

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
width of the path stays the same until
it<00:01:44.939> reaches<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> center<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.530> called<00:01:46.770> an

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
it reaches a center this is called an

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.260 
it reaches a center this is called an
Archimedes<00:01:47.520> spiral

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.550 

that's<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.479> try<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.840> experiment<00:01:52.259> with

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that's gonna try this experiment with

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
that's gonna try this experiment with
some<00:01:52.679> other<00:01:52.829> materials<00:01:53.280> here's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.969> small

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
some other materials here's a small

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.389 
some other materials here's a small
pumpkin<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> tiny<00:01:55.109> weight<00:01:55.409> let's<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.280> how

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
pumpkin and a tiny weight let's see how

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.050 
pumpkin and a tiny weight let's see how
this<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.729> works<00:02:01.369> now<00:02:02.369> let's<00:02:02.579> try<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.819> on<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this one works now let's try it on the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.669 
this one works now let's try it on the
larger<00:02:03.359> scale<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> twenty-one<00:02:04.409> pound

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
larger scale I have a twenty-one pound

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:17.700 
larger scale I have a twenty-one pound
pumpkin

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:45.480 

[Applause]

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.830 

here's<00:02:46.490> another<00:02:46.610> investigation<00:02:47.300> we<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.660> try

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
here's another investigation we can try

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.570 
here's another investigation we can try
replace<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.710> single<00:02:49.100> weight<00:02:49.250> with<00:02:49.430> two

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
replace that single weight with two

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.640 
replace that single weight with two
smaller<00:02:49.970> weights<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.480> two<00:02:50.600> strings<00:02:50.990> when<00:02:51.620> I

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
smaller weights and two strings when I

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.810 
smaller weights and two strings when I
pull<00:02:51.890> them<00:02:51.950> out<00:02:52.100> on<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.280> same<00:02:52.460> side<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
pull them out on the same side and

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820 
pull them out on the same side and
reduce<00:02:53.090> them<00:02:53.300> we<00:02:53.780> see<00:02:53.990> that<00:02:54.110> they<00:02:54.290> both<00:02:54.500> act

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
reduce them we see that they both act

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.100 
reduce them we see that they both act
together<00:02:55.040> as<00:02:55.490> one<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:56.000> seen<00:02:56.540> by<00:02:56.720> these<00:02:56.780> two

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
together as one as seen by these two

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.619 
together as one as seen by these two
coils

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
coils

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.809 
coils
and<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.829> result<00:03:00.189> again<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.579> release

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
and this is result again if I release

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.480 
and this is result again if I release
them<00:03:01.060> from<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.390> opposite<00:03:01.870> sides<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.469> bar

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
them from the opposite sides of the bar

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.240 
them from the opposite sides of the bar
I<00:03:05.110> also<00:03:06.110> thought<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:06.560> might<00:03:06.740> be<00:03:06.800> fun<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.070> make

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
I also thought this might be fun to make

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.620 
I also thought this might be fun to make
into<00:03:07.460> some<00:03:07.640> type<00:03:07.820> of<00:03:07.850> game<00:03:08.150> for<00:03:08.540> example

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
into some type of game for example

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.490 
into some type of game for example
here's<00:03:09.140> Homer<00:03:09.380> Simpson<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.130> an<00:03:10.640> axe

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
here's Homer Simpson and an axe

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.330 
here's Homer Simpson and an axe
obviously<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.620> point<00:03:12.770> of<00:03:12.920> this<00:03:13.010> would<00:03:13.160> be<00:03:13.220> to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
obviously the point of this would be to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.310 
obviously the point of this would be to
have<00:03:13.610> Homer<00:03:13.940> saved<00:03:14.300> by<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.540> acts<00:03:14.780> rather<00:03:15.050> than

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
have Homer saved by the acts rather than

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.730 
have Homer saved by the acts rather than
get<00:03:15.470> hit<00:03:15.650> by<00:03:15.830> it<00:03:17.350> where<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.410> could<00:03:18.530> have

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
get hit by it where you could have

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.470 
get hit by it where you could have
action<00:03:19.160> figures<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.580> all<00:03:19.670> sorts<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.090> dangerous

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
action figures to all sorts of dangerous

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.420 
action figures to all sorts of dangerous
stunts<00:03:20.750> for<00:03:21.470> example<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:21.950> guy<00:03:22.190> could<00:03:22.400> be

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
stunts for example this guy could be

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.850 
stunts for example this guy could be
dropped<00:03:22.850> over<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.210> bed<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.540> nails<00:03:26.860> or

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
dropped over a bed of nails or

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.980 
dropped over a bed of nails or
performance<00:03:28.430> done<00:03:28.610> over<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:29.150> tank<00:03:29.690> full<00:03:29.930> of

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
performance done over a tank full of

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.440 
performance done over a tank full of
sharks

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.910 

we<00:03:35.450> put<00:03:35.690> on<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.840> fire<00:03:36.080> seat<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.410> suspend<00:03:36.860> a

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
we put on a fire seat you suspend a

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.100 
we put on a fire seat you suspend a
motor<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.220> big<00:03:37.400> ball<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.730> flames<00:03:40.600> or<00:03:41.600> just<00:03:41.930> keep

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
motor a big ball of flames or just keep

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.660 
motor a big ball of flames or just keep
it<00:03:42.230> simple<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.590> see<00:03:42.800> how<00:03:42.950> close<00:03:43.160> you<00:03:43.400> can<00:03:43.520> get

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
it simple and see how close you can get

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.490 
it simple and see how close you can get
the<00:03:43.760> way<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:43.940> come<00:03:44.240> to<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.450> surface<00:03:44.870> without

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
the way to come to the surface without

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.400 
the way to come to the surface without
actually<00:03:46.040> touching<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:49.990> hope<00:03:50.990> you<00:03:51.110> enjoyed
