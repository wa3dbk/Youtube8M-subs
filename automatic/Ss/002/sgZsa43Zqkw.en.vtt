streamlined<00:00:23.339> like<00:00:23.669> I<00:00:23.789> said<00:00:24.050> kind<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> shell

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
streamlined like I said kind of shell

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.519 
streamlined like I said kind of shell
shape<00:00:25.859> really<00:00:26.759> contoured<00:00:27.419> to<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> leg<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.169> you

shape really contoured to the leg as you

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.499 
shape really contoured to the leg as you
can<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.800> these<00:00:28.919> waves<00:00:29.339> or<00:00:29.699> large<00:00:30.150> embossment

can see these waves or large embossment

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.389 
can see these waves or large embossment
sin<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> shin<00:00:31.199> shell<00:00:31.470> that's<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.340> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
sin the shin shell that's just going to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.390 
sin the shin shell that's just going to
add<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:32.940> more<00:00:33.420> rigidity<00:00:33.830> you<00:00:34.830> know<00:00:34.950> deflect

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
add some more rigidity you know deflect

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.510 
add some more rigidity you know deflect
pucks<00:00:35.700> sticks<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.380> then<00:00:37.710> at<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:37.980> very<00:00:38.100> bottom

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
pucks sticks and then at the very bottom

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.060 
pucks sticks and then at the very bottom
of<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.080> can<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.470> liner<00:00:40.680> kind<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of here as you can see the liner kind of

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.280 
of here as you can see the liner kind of
extends<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.000> protect<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.720> you<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.080> wearing

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
extends to protect if you like wearing

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.870 
extends to protect if you like wearing
your<00:00:43.500> shin<00:00:43.680> guards<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.160> over<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.580> skates

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
your shin guards like over your skates

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.550 
your shin guards like over your skates
then<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.540> is<00:00:45.630> definitely<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> protect

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
then this is definitely going to protect

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.530 
then this is definitely going to protect
you<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> nice<00:00:46.950> nice<00:00:47.340> feature<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.090> add<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
you a nice nice feature they add at the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.530 
you a nice nice feature they add at the
bottom<00:00:48.810> there<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.080> that<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.560> wrap<00:00:50.090> as<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.420> go

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
bottom there but that will wrap as we go

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.130 
bottom there but that will wrap as we go
into<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.820> kneecap<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.630> can<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.930> there's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
into the the kneecap you can see there's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
into the the kneecap you can see there's
also<00:00:55.290> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> embossment<00:00:55.950> here<00:00:56.430> also<00:00:56.760> again

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
also kind of embossment here also again

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.060 
also kind of embossment here also again
that's<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.810> add<00:00:57.990> more<00:00:58.410> rigidity<00:00:58.740> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that's going to add more rigidity the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
that's going to add more rigidity the
shin<00:00:59.340> shell<00:00:59.610> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.150> definitely<00:01:00.360> see<00:01:00.720> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
shin shell you can definitely see the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.870 
shin shell you can definitely see the
streamlined<00:01:01.410> design<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.920> well<00:01:01.950> throughout

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
streamlined design as well throughout

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.140 
streamlined design as well throughout
into<00:01:03.810> this<00:01:03.930> kneecap<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:04.920> bit<00:01:05.150> more

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
into this kneecap it's a little bit more

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.330 
into this kneecap it's a little bit more
streamlined<00:01:06.780> than<00:01:07.230> the<00:01:07.409> EQ<00:01:07.830> series<00:01:08.159> for

streamlined than the EQ series for
example<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:08.940> easton<00:01:09.300> so<00:01:09.930> yeah<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.500> that's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
example by easton so yeah that's that's

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.990 
example by easton so yeah that's that's
what<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.250> wanted<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.550> get<00:01:11.640> across<00:01:11.760> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
what they wanted to get across that

the top you might notice a lot of shin
guards<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.740> know<00:01:31.860> we'll<00:01:31.979> stop<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.430> here

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
guards you know we'll stop right here

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.100 
guards you know we'll stop right here
might<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.510> bit<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> extra

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
might just have a little bit of extra

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
might just have a little bit of extra
padding<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.620> they<00:01:34.979> took<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.190> step<00:01:35.460> further

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
padding but they took a step further

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
padding but they took a step further
included<00:01:36.330> some<00:01:36.540> high<00:01:36.720> density<00:01:37.200> foams<00:01:37.500> you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
included some high density foams you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.740 
included some high density foams you
know<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.580> covers<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:39.060> whole<00:01:39.090> knee<00:01:39.540> area

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
know so it covers the whole knee area

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
know so it covers the whole knee area
just<00:01:40.049> not<00:01:40.260> really<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> cap<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.460> also<00:01:41.580> got<00:01:41.790> some

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
just not really the cap we also got some

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.969 
just not really the cap we also got some
extended<00:01:42.510> joint<00:01:42.780> protection<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.920> is

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
extended joint protection and this is

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.469 
extended joint protection and this is
the<00:01:44.159> same<00:01:44.400> kind<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> high-density<00:01:45.060> foam

not heavy it's that EPP foam you'll see
on<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.530> whole<00:02:13.680> line<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.160> RS<00:02:14.550> along

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
on on the whole line of the RS along

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.230 
on on the whole line of the RS along
with

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
with

that that plastic cover so it it adds

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.270 
that that plastic cover so it it adds
probably<00:02:19.080> some<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.350> best<00:02:19.410> protection<00:02:20.040> as

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
probably some of the best protection as

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.830 
probably some of the best protection as
far<00:02:20.490> as<00:02:20.610> cap<00:02:20.850> protection<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.630> still

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
far as cap protection but it still

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.820 
far as cap protection but it still
remains<00:02:22.140> really<00:02:23.040> light<00:02:24.200> let<00:02:25.200> me<00:02:25.290> turn<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.530> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
remains really light let me turn it to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.600
