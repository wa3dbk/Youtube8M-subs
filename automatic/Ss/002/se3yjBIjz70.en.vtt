00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.500
 It has been a long and bloody year, 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 since the end of the Great War 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.600
 And although the Emperor claimed victory, 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600
 the peace for which so many heroes gave their lives, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.600
 has not yet settled in the whole kingdom. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.600
 Even without a leader, the Chaos Hordes 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.400
 continue to poison the northern Empire. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 Wild warriors attack caravans of merchants, 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 and plunder farms and isolated villages. 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.600
 The soldiers of the Emperor, tired of war 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 patrol the forests and hills, 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 always vigilant, against the bloodthirsty bands 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 who seek death and plunder 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.510
 With me, Sons of Sigmar! 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.510
 For the Emperor! 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.210
 Sigmar! 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.010
 There is no escape from Chaos. 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.010
 He marks us all.
