00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.320
 Hello friends today 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.440
 we will be talking about what is the 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.539
 clutch or clutch 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.150
 we will be talking about how is 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.699
 constituted how it works and some of 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.289
 your main faults close friends 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.720
 is constituted by what will come 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.860
 being the disc or pasta the dish 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.230
 oppressor and the bolster bearing 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.840
 the clutch is a part of what was to come 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.540
 being the powertrain and it's located 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.579
 between what is the engine and the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.039
 transmission or gearbox 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.109
 one of its functions is to transmit 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.629
 the proportional force that comes out of the 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.370
 motor towards the gearbox for 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.550
 that from there it is distributed to the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.550
 wheels 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.640
 how the club works crochet friends 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.700
 when we step on the pedal the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.059
 clutch pedal what happens 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.350
 there is that there is a decoupling between 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.090
 what would be the engine and the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.609
 transmission 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.890
 this friends how it happens is the way 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.799
 next at the moment we 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.969
 We are stepping on the clutch the bearing 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.179
 collar 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:26.090
 is pushing this part what 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:29.259
 it would come being the diaphragm is 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.500
 pushing it inwards so that this one 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:37.250
 make a kind of leverage and 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.930
 the disk is loose or this is what 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.370
 this means that at the moment in 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.070
 what is fitting them is open and this part that 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.910
 is spinning in a way let's say it's not 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.590
 that is loose or is spinning crazy 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.920
 when we release the pedal 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.680
 flors the clutch reengages that 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.410
 it means that the disc is oppressed 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.690
 between what is the oppressive plate and what 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.910
 what is the engine flywheel 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.400
 at that time when we have the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.010
 coupling the torsional force is 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.140
 transmitted to the transmission and of 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.320
 there, as I tell you, it will go towards the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.320
 wheels 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.620
 so good friends now let's see 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.500
 what are some of the main ones 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.030
 failures of what would be the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.280
 clutch 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.540
 one of the main faults friends is 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.280
 that these pastes wear out and you're 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.790
 things that are here come being like 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.000
 the material of the ballatas also this 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.830
 when this material wears 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.569
 what's going to happen here is that it's already going 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.230
 to skate or it's not going to be anymore 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.450
 say or be oppressed there is what 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.420
 is going to tend to be is that by not 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.060
 already exist these pastas this part of what 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.519
 which is the disc is going to be skating 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.310
 because because this material is the one 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.530
 there is a certain subjection between what 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.380
 that would be the oppressive plate and the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.890
 flyer when this material is already 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.459
 worn out is already what is going to tend to 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.980
 do is skate now be here friends 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.500
 and wear we can have a wear 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.050
 normal but we can also have a 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.180
 premature wear premature wear 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.280
 in which case we would be having this 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.340
 is when when we have a very bad 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.020
 bad driving habit this would be that 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.170
 let's bring the foot 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.270
 on the club pedal here what 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.130
 we would be doing is that the pressure does not 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.560
 be 100 percent, so be it 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.830
 semi open and what is going to be happening 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.290
 those who are in this piece is known 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.240
 is going to be skating and being 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.970
 skating what we're going to have there is a 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.860
 premature wear of pastas already 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.810
 better is this yes yes maybe if 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.150
 we have good habits and the car is going to 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.600
 last five years to the best standard is 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.540
 would last for about two years or 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.370
 better three but this and as I tell you 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.310
 It depends a lot on driving habits 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.770
 that we have among other faults friends 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.050
 we would have that out there we can have 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.340
 some damage with what is the bearing 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.239
 collar that is a very important piece 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.220
 because this is how I tell you 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.720
 the one that puts pressure on the envelope 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.760
 diaphragm so that for him the the 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.580
 disc or pasta 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.930
 be loose or free 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.550
 this as it is a bearing can reach 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.729
 have after some time already 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.699
 dryness or it can get to be shelled 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.280
 and if this piece is no longer working 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.409
 well we will have some functioning 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.620
 erratic in what would be the 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.620
 clutch 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:52.209
 another one of the friends faults is if we are going to 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:55.499
 have a malfunction in what is 

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:57.879
 the diaphragm there would be costing some 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:05:00.069
 work to speed changes 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.509
 is why because if this piece is not 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.789
 working well 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.639
 this will be causing problems for 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.669
 the so that the disk is free and not 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.159
 to be free the disc there we would be 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.860
 having problems so that for 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.020
 speeds can enter well 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.770
 well, good friends 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.949
 This would be living here so 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.830
 that is the clot his clutch and well then 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.610
 from me if it would be all thank you very much 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.610
 and until next time
