00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
now I'm going to show you how to to weed

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.230 
now I'm going to show you how to to weed
with<00:00:10.690> the<00:00:10.809> loose<00:00:10.990> a<00:00:11.170> and<00:00:11.469> I'm<00:00:12.309> going

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
with the loose a and I'm going

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.070 
with the loose a and I'm going
and<00:00:13.630> this<00:00:14.170> can<00:00:14.350> be<00:00:14.470> paired

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
and this can be paired

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.140 
and this can be paired
this<00:00:15.260> case<00:00:15.500> which<00:00:15.769> is<00:00:16.100> just<00:00:16.460> easier<00:00:16.850> to<00:00:16.970> show

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
this case which is just easier to show

you with you could use any sort of
natural<00:00:20.930> material<00:00:21.939> that<00:00:22.939> you<00:00:23.210> you<00:00:23.540> reverse

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
natural material that you you reverse

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.589 
natural material that you you reverse
wrap<00:00:24.230> or<00:00:24.830> otherwise<00:00:25.310> make<00:00:25.700> and<00:00:25.970> what<00:00:26.509> I'm

going to do is I'm going to insert it
through<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:29.330> hole<00:00:29.540> in<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.779> back<00:00:29.930> side<00:00:30.230> pull

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
through this hole in the back side pull

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.030 
through this hole in the back side pull
it<00:00:32.720> down<00:00:32.900> and<00:00:34.030> that<00:00:35.030> just<00:00:35.059> lets<00:00:35.420> me<00:00:35.510> hold<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.379> in

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
I did was create a figure eight and

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.180 
I did was create a figure eight and
that's<00:00:57.379> all<00:00:57.559> I'm<00:00:57.710> going<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:58.070> keep<00:00:58.250> doing<00:00:58.640> is

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
pull your bottom part and you just

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:35.430 
pull your bottom part and you just
repeat

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.940 

it's<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.130> pretty<00:02:36.520> simple<00:02:36.910> process<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.950> it

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
it's a pretty simple process and it

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.550 
it's a pretty simple process and it
looks<00:02:39.160> pretty<00:02:39.370> cool<00:02:39.580> when<00:02:39.820> you're<00:02:39.910> done

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
looks pretty cool when you're done

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.390 
looks pretty cool when you're done
it's<00:02:41.560> figure-eight<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:45.520> after<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.510> initial

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's figure-eight and after that initial

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.910 
it's figure-eight and after that initial
after<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.550> initial<00:02:48.850> portion<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.350> do<00:02:50.770> the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
after that initial portion or you do the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.380 
after that initial portion or you do the
two<00:02:51.100> figure<00:02:51.430> eights<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.760> pull<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.030> over<00:02:52.120> it

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
two figure eights and pull it over it

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.870 
two figure eights and pull it over it
gets<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.660> little<00:02:52.750> easier<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:54.340> pull<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.610> cord

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
gets a little easier to to pull the cord

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:11.760 
gets a little easier to to pull the cord
out<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.570> push<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.930> over<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.170> tops

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.660 

and<00:03:12.340> here<00:03:13.210> it<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.540> braiding<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:15.310> piece<00:03:15.520> of

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
and here it is braiding that piece of

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.860 
and here it is braiding that piece of
cord<00:03:15.910> there<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:17.020> squared<00:03:18.420> piece<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.630> braid

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
cord there and a squared piece of braid

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.720 
cord there and a squared piece of braid
there<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.620> that's<00:03:21.190> going<00:03:21.460> to<00:03:21.550> make<00:03:21.700> it

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
there and that's going to make it

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:31.220 
there and that's going to make it
stronger<00:03:22.270> than<00:03:25.710> what<00:03:26.710> it<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:26.950> by<00:03:27.130> itself<00:03:27.520> and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.250 

what<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.520> tightness<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.210> the<00:03:34.540> weave<00:03:34.900> is

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
what the the tightness of the weave is

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.500 
what the the tightness of the weave is
going<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.620> depend<00:03:35.770> on<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.160> material<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:37.150> use

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
going to depend on the material you use

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.210 
going to depend on the material you use
if<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.590> was<00:03:38.770> using<00:03:39.120> yarn<00:03:40.740> it<00:03:41.740> would<00:03:41.890> be<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> lot

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
if I was using yarn it would be a lot

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.910 
if I was using yarn it would be a lot
tighter<00:03:42.700> weave<00:03:43.620> then<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.920> paracord<00:03:45.460> is<00:03:45.610> and

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
tighter weave then this paracord is and

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.680 
tighter weave then this paracord is and
you'll<00:03:47.920> have<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.370> play<00:03:48.730> with<00:03:48.910> your<00:03:48.940> material

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
you'll have to play with your material

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.690 
you'll have to play with your material
to<00:03:50.200> see<00:03:51.360> how<00:03:52.360> tight<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.810> can<00:03:53.020> get<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.380> or<00:03:53.710> you

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
to see how tight you can get it or you

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.660 
to see how tight you can get it or you
know<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:55.450> make<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.900> way<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.110> want<00:03:56.500> but

I'll<00:04:00.670> just<00:04:00.730> do<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.570> couple<00:04:01.990> more<00:04:02.460> loops<00:04:03.460> here

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
I'll just do a couple more loops here

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
I'll just do a couple more loops here
just<00:04:04.210> to<00:04:04.480> keep<00:04:05.470> showing<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.690> then<00:04:07.690> I'll

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
just to keep showing you and then I'll

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:19.439 
just to keep showing you and then I'll
show<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:07.990> how<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.230> finish<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.220> off

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:34.149 

all<00:04:20.449> right<00:04:28.479> so<00:04:32.229> so<00:04:33.229> I've<00:04:33.379> got<00:04:33.590> knit<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:34.009> the

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:34.159 
all right so so I've got knit to the

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.450 
all right so so I've got knit to the
length<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.669> want<00:04:35.020> it's<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.110> nice<00:04:36.460> squared

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
length that I want it's a nice squared

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.010 
length that I want it's a nice squared
cord<00:04:37.909> there<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:39.229> to<00:04:39.289> take<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.830> off<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:41.020> and

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279 
rope pass it through both loops I'm

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:06.719 
rope pass it through both loops I'm
passing<00:04:58.849> it<00:04:58.969> through<00:04:59.270> both<00:04:59.810> loops<00:04:59.870> here<00:05:04.360> and

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
passing it through both loops here and

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.350 
passing it through both loops here and
pulling<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.939> through<00:05:07.969> and<00:05:08.360> giving<00:05:08.599> it<00:05:08.689> a<00:05:08.779> tug
