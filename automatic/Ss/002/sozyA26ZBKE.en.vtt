an<00:00:40.500> evolutionary<00:00:41.100> design<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.420> we've<00:00:42.570> talked

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
an evolutionary design and we've talked

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
an evolutionary design and we've talked
to<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> few<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> folks<00:00:43.620> behind<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> design

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to a few of the folks behind the design

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.069 
to a few of the folks behind the design
and<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.510> clear<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.899> they<00:00:45.989> were

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and and it's clear what they were

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.440 
and and it's clear what they were
thinking<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.410> had<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.680> deliver<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:48.090> car<00:00:48.329> is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
thinking they had to deliver this car is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
thinking they had to deliver this car is
going<00:00:48.629> global<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.530> around<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.890> world

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
going global it's going around the world

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
going global it's going around the world
and<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.340> wanted<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> deliver<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:52.050> Mustang

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
turbo four-cylinder available that will

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.380 
turbo four-cylinder available that will
get<00:01:33.900> better<00:01:34.020> fuel<00:01:34.290> economy<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.640> model

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
get better fuel economy and in a model

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
get better fuel economy and in a model
below<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> GT<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.500> forth<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
below the GT and so forth but at the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.819 
below the GT and so forth but at the
same<00:01:38.520> time<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.600> got<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> Mustang<00:01:40.290> pneus<00:01:40.560> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
same time it's got the Mustang pneus so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
same time it's got the Mustang pneus so
my<00:01:41.009> impression<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.299> hit<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
my impression is is they really hit that

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
my impression is is they really hit that
spot<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.259> really<00:01:43.530> looks<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.310> that's

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
spot it really looks like they do that's

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.310 
spot it really looks like they do that's
what<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.210> set<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.110> appear

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
what they set out to do it they appear

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
in some ways but it's still very much a

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.380 
in some ways but it's still very much a
Mustang<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> still<00:02:20.280> reads<00:02:20.489> as<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> Mustang<00:02:21.239> it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
Mustang it still reads as a Mustang it

Mustang it still reads as a Mustang it
still<00:02:21.629> has<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.110> impression<00:02:22.590> especially<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
it's actually all knew it started out as

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.750 
it's actually all knew it started out as
an<00:05:58.390> evolution<00:05:58.870> but<00:05:59.290> as<00:05:59.440> we<00:05:59.620> as<00:06:00.190> we<00:06:00.250> develop<00:06:00.520> the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
an evolution but as we as we develop the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.940 
an evolution but as we as we develop the
product<00:06:01.030> as<00:06:01.150> we've<00:06:01.270> matured<00:06:01.450> our<00:06:01.780> plans<00:06:02.050> it

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
product as we've matured our plans it

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.740 
product as we've matured our plans it
actually<00:06:03.130> became<00:06:03.550> an<00:06:03.700> all-new<00:06:04.180> so<00:06:04.420> it<00:06:04.600> is<00:06:04.720> a

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
actually became an all-new so it is a

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.630 
actually became an all-new so it is a
unique<00:06:05.140> platform<00:06:05.380> and<00:06:05.860> it's<00:06:06.190> all<00:06:06.340> new<00:06:06.490> for

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
unique platform and it's all new for

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.300 
unique platform and it's all new for
2015<00:06:07.230> is<00:06:08.230> this<00:06:08.440> going<00:06:08.620> to<00:06:08.680> stay<00:06:08.950> unique

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
2015 is this going to stay unique

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.740 
2015 is this going to stay unique
because<00:06:09.460> it<00:06:09.700> have<00:06:09.820> aspects<00:06:10.270> that<00:06:10.330> are<00:06:10.450> shared

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
because it have aspects that are shared

now we plan on this thing unique we did

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.220 
now we plan on this thing unique we did
study<00:06:19.000> putting<00:06:19.300> the<00:06:19.390> Mustang<00:06:19.720> on<00:06:19.870> one<00:06:20.080> of<00:06:20.170> our

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
study putting the Mustang on one of our

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.570 
study putting the Mustang on one of our
existing<00:06:20.650> platforms<00:06:21.100> that<00:06:21.130> we<00:06:21.250> used<00:06:21.400> globally

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
existing platforms that we used globally

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.670 
existing platforms that we used globally
the<00:06:22.540> compromises<00:06:23.110> would<00:06:23.230> have<00:06:23.320> been<00:06:23.410> too<00:06:23.530> much

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
the compromises would have been too much

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.990 
the compromises would have been too much

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
agreed that we needed to stay unique on

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.970 
agreed that we needed to stay unique on
this<00:06:28.120> platform<00:06:28.420> so<00:06:28.840> even<00:06:29.440> for<00:06:29.560> the<00:06:29.680> future<00:06:29.950> I

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
this platform so even for the future I

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.080 
this platform so even for the future I
see<00:06:30.040> this<00:06:30.250> as<00:06:30.310> being<00:06:30.430> unique

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
see this as being unique

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.939
