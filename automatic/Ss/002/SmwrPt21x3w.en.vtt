logs so with my hands I'm going to roll

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.230 
logs so with my hands I'm going to roll
out<00:00:21.240> lots<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.170> cylinder<00:00:22.650> shapes<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.910> just

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
keep on rolling out more cylinders with

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.009 
keep on rolling out more cylinders with
your<00:00:26.369> hands

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
your hands

your hands
this<00:00:28.019> one's<00:00:28.260> really<00:00:28.410> big<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.859> we'll<00:00:28.980> cut<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
this one's really big so we'll cut it

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.759 
this one's really big so we'll cut it
off<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> we'll<00:00:29.849> make<00:00:30.029> some<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.590> well<00:00:31.590> named

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
off and we'll make some more well named

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.010 
off and we'll make some more well named
to<00:00:31.980> me<00:00:32.130> 20<00:00:32.550> logs<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:33.120> about<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> same<00:00:33.719> size

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
to me 20 logs are about the same size

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.160 
to me 20 logs are about the same size
and<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.559> roughly<00:00:35.160> four<00:00:35.430> inches<00:00:36.170> carry

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and this is roughly four inches carry

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.830 
and this is roughly four inches carry
the<00:00:37.380> 20<00:00:37.649> loins<00:00:37.860> here's<00:00:38.250> 10<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.450> 10

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the 20 loins here's 10 here and then 10

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.740 
the 20 loins here's 10 here and then 10
here<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.320> also<00:00:40.920> molded<00:00:41.250> out<00:00:41.460> groups<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.450> two

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
here I also molded out groups of two

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.170 
here I also molded out groups of two
why's<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:44.190> smaller<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.640> smaller<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
why's that get smaller and smaller and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180 
why's that get smaller and smaller and
these<00:00:45.329> will<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.629> used<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> point<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
these will be used as a point of the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.630 
these will be used as a point of the
log-house<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:49.860> most<00:00:50.070> time-consuming<00:00:50.340> part

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
log-house the most time-consuming part

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
log-house the most time-consuming part
is<00:00:51.149> rolling<00:00:51.480> out<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> logs<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.590> fun

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
is rolling out the logs now for the fun

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
is rolling out the logs now for the fun
part<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.340> assembling<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.210> longhouse

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
part actually assembling the longhouse

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630 
part actually assembling the longhouse
what<00:00:55.440> I'm<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.420 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
stack<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> logs<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.570> groups<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.930> five<00:00:58.430> just

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
stack the logs in groups of five just

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.099 
stack the logs in groups of five just
push<00:00:59.640> each<00:00:59.879> log<00:01:00.120> together<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
push each log together to get them to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
push each log together to get them to
stick<00:01:01.940> we<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> walls

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
stick we now have one of the walls

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
stick we now have one of the walls
complete<00:01:04.409> I'll<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.979> lie<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.909> then

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
complete I'll just lie it down and then

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.500 
complete I'll just lie it down and then
we'll<00:01:06.210> build<00:01:06.360> another<00:01:06.540> wall<00:01:08.030> just<00:01:09.030> same<00:01:09.270> thing

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
we'll build another wall just same thing

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.030 
we'll build another wall just same thing
stack<00:01:09.840> five<00:01:10.170> lines<00:01:10.950> together<00:01:12.710> make<00:01:13.710> sure<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
stack five lines together make sure to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.770 
stack five lines together make sure to
push<00:01:14.220> them<00:01:14.369> tight<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.090> stick

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.889 

and<00:01:20.780> here's<00:01:21.049> our<00:01:21.200> second<00:01:21.530> wall<00:01:21.649> I<00:01:21.950> just

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
and here's our second wall I just

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.719 
and here's our second wall I just
finished<00:01:23.899> making<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.320> other<00:01:24.439> two<00:01:24.740> walls<00:01:24.979> and

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
finished making the other two walls and

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.399 
finished making the other two walls and
now<00:01:25.939> it's<00:01:26.090> time<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:26.479> connect<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.960> log<00:01:27.140> cabin

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
now it's time to connect the log cabin

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.459 
now it's time to connect the log cabin
walls<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.090> line<00:01:29.329> them<00:01:29.509> up<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:29.929> push<00:01:30.289> the

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
walls so just line them up and push the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.789 
walls so just line them up and push the
Plato<00:01:30.710> ends<00:01:30.950> together<00:01:32.380> see<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.439> actually

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
Plato ends together see it actually

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.490 
Plato ends together see it actually
holds<00:01:33.920> really<00:01:34.250> well<00:01:34.630> we'll<00:01:35.630> add<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.170> well

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
holds really well we'll add this well

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.090 
holds really well we'll add this well
here<00:01:37.039> just<00:01:42.399> squeeze<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.610> together<00:01:43.759> again

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
here just squeeze it together again

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.090 
here just squeeze it together again
and<00:01:47.090> then<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.110> fourth<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:48.680> will<00:01:48.890> help

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
and then the fourth of all will help

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.010 
and then the fourth of all will help
stabilize<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.940> whole<00:01:50.060> thing<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.990> just

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
stabilize the whole thing so just

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.110 
stabilize the whole thing so just
squeeze<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.620> together<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:52.010> both<00:01:52.159> sides<00:01:55.120> now

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
squeeze it together on both sides now

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.760 
squeeze it together on both sides now
they<00:01:56.270> have<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.479> base<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.960> log<00:01:57.170> cabin<00:01:57.200> built

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
they have a base of the log cabin built

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.460 
they have a base of the log cabin built
and<00:01:58.010> can<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:58.220> make<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.700> point<00:01:59.030> on<00:01:59.600> each<00:02:00.140> side

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
and can now make the point on each side

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.130 
and can now make the point on each side
so<00:02:01.159> just<00:02:01.490> start<00:02:01.760> stacking<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.479> smaller<00:02:02.840> logs

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
so just start stacking the smaller logs

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.469 
so just start stacking the smaller logs
that<00:02:03.410> we<00:02:03.530> mean<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:04.010> going<00:02:04.640> from<00:02:04.790> largest<00:02:05.180> to

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
that we mean just going from largest to

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.040 
that we mean just going from largest to
smallest

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.670

and<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:15.760> do<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.030> same<00:02:16.210> thing<00:02:16.270> on<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.690> other

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and then do the same thing on the other

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.230 
and then do the same thing on the other
side<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.500> put<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.130> plate<00:02:18.400> oak<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.060> inside

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
side I put a plate oak in on the inside

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.120 
side I put a plate oak in on the inside
just<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.780> hold<00:02:19.990> up<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.350> other<00:02:20.500> wall<00:02:20.860> before

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
just to hold up that other wall before

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.560 
just to hold up that other wall before
we<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.640> roof<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.940> don't<00:02:25.180> worry<00:02:25.330> we'll

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
we get the roof on and don't worry we'll

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.880 
we get the roof on and don't worry we'll
take<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.870> play-doh<00:02:26.080> can<00:02:26.440> out<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.770> there

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
take the play-doh can out of there

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.380 
take the play-doh can out of there
before<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:27.340> put<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.670> roof<00:02:27.820> on<00:02:30.120> okay<00:02:31.120> here's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
before we put the roof on okay here's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.940 
before we put the roof on okay here's
what<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:31.840> far<00:02:32.230> with<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> log<00:02:32.680> cabin

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
what we have so far with the log cabin

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.190 
what we have so far with the log cabin
we<00:02:33.250> have<00:02:33.430> all<00:02:33.640> four<00:02:34.000> walls<00:02:34.210> in<00:02:34.570> there<00:02:34.810> building

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
we have all four walls in there building

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.560 
we have all four walls in there building
up<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.590> we<00:02:35.740> can<00:02:35.890> put<00:02:36.070> on<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.220> slamming<00:02:36.700> roof<00:02:36.910> we

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
up so we can put on a slamming roof we

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.860 
up so we can put on a slamming roof we
also<00:02:37.720> need<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.110> add<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> door<00:02:38.620> -<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:40.630> door<00:02:40.840> is

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
also need to add a door - the door is

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.660 
also need to add a door - the door is
pretty<00:02:41.200> easy<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.710> roll<00:02:41.980> out<00:02:42.190> some<00:02:42.460> red

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
pretty easy just roll out some red

pretty easy just roll out some red
play-doh<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.230> we're<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.590> cut<00:02:44.860> out

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
play-doh and we're going to cut out

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
play-doh and we're going to cut out

and on the middle right of the rectangle

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.580 
and on the middle right of the rectangle
just<00:02:54.819> put<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> little<00:02:55.330> yellow<00:02:55.690> circle<00:02:56.290> for<00:02:56.500> the

just put a little yellow circle for the
doorknob<00:02:57.870> then<00:02:58.870> we'll<00:02:59.049> take<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.349> door<00:02:59.560> and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
doorknob then we'll take the door and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.080 
doorknob then we'll take the door and
we'll<00:02:59.769> just<00:02:59.980> add<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.580> front<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
we'll just add it to the front of the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.570 
we'll just add it to the front of the
log<00:03:01.269> cabin<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:02.019> would<00:03:02.709> like<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.069> make<00:03:03.220> windows

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
log cabin I would like to make windows

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.550 
log cabin I would like to make windows
for<00:03:03.849> this<00:03:03.940> cabin<00:03:04.299> by<00:03:04.480> cutting<00:03:04.840> holes<00:03:05.019> into<00:03:05.349> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
for this cabin by cutting holes into the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.860 
for this cabin by cutting holes into the
logs<00:03:05.799> but<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.970> don't<00:03:07.120> think<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:07.480> stable

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
logs but I just don't think it's stable

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.030 
logs but I just don't think it's stable
enough<00:03:08.080> so<00:03:08.140> we're<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.620> going<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:09.010> a

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
enough so we're just going to have a

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.869 
enough so we're just going to have a
door<00:03:10.230> already<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.470> last<00:03:11.620> step<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.310> making<00:03:12.790> a

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
door already the last step is making a

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.520 
door already the last step is making a
roof<00:03:13.090> just<00:03:13.510> roll<00:03:13.780> out<00:03:13.930> some<00:03:14.140> light<00:03:14.349> brown

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
roof just roll out some light brown

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.640 
roof just roll out some light brown
play-doh<00:03:15.209> then<00:03:16.209> cut<00:03:16.510> out<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.629> thin<00:03:16.989> rectangle

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
play-doh then cut out a thin rectangle

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.470 
play-doh then cut out a thin rectangle
and<00:03:18.250> we're<00:03:18.370> going<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.579> make<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.910> roof<00:03:19.090> in<00:03:19.299> two

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
and we're going to make the roof in two

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.630 
and we're going to make the roof in two
pieces<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:19.930> we'll<00:03:20.230> use<00:03:20.440> two<00:03:20.799> rectangles<00:03:21.400> the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
pieces so we'll use two rectangles the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.449 
pieces so we'll use two rectangles the
same<00:03:21.909> size<00:03:24.959> with<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.170> play-doh<00:03:26.379> roof<00:03:26.860> cut<00:03:27.280> out

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
same size with the play-doh roof cut out

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.150 
same size with the play-doh roof cut out
we<00:03:27.640> can<00:03:27.849> attach<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.569> log<00:03:28.720> cabin<00:03:29.160> be

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
we can attach it to the log cabin be

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.220 
we can attach it to the log cabin be
pretty<00:03:30.489> careful<00:03:30.819> we<00:03:31.239> just<00:03:31.450> want<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:31.690> attach<00:03:31.959> it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
pretty careful we just want to attach it

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.479 
pretty careful we just want to attach it
just<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:34.000> logs<00:03:34.510> on<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.109> side<00:03:35.379> just<00:03:36.280> push

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
just on the logs on the side just push

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.069 
just on the logs on the side just push
it<00:03:36.640> down<00:03:36.670> just<00:03:37.180> on<00:03:37.959> both<00:03:38.170> sides<00:03:39.750> then<00:03:40.750> we'll<00:03:40.959> do

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
it down just on both sides then we'll do

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.190 
it down just on both sides then we'll do
the<00:03:41.200> exact<00:03:41.530> same<00:03:41.560> thing<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.250> other<00:03:42.280> side

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
the exact same thing on the other side

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.280 
the exact same thing on the other side
and<00:03:44.200> wallah<00:03:45.160> our<00:03:45.700> play-doh<00:03:46.030> log<00:03:46.390> cabin<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.079> now

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
and wallah our play-doh log cabin is now

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.890 
and wallah our play-doh log cabin is now
complete<00:03:48.060> this<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.239> probably<00:03:49.510> one<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
complete this is probably one of the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.539 
complete this is probably one of the
harder<00:03:50.230> things<00:03:50.260> I've<00:03:50.769> made<00:03:51.010> out<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.310> play-doh

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
harder things I've made out of play-doh

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.949 
harder things I've made out of play-doh
just<00:03:51.879> because<00:03:52.060> there<00:03:52.239> are<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:52.510> many<00:03:52.629> pieces

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
just because there are so many pieces

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.259 
just because there are so many pieces
you<00:03:53.410> have<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.769> careful<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:55.030> walls

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
you have to be careful that the walls

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.330 
you have to be careful that the walls
don't<00:03:55.510> fall<00:03:55.780> in<00:03:55.959> or<00:03:56.109> anything<00:03:56.290> but<00:03:57.160> at<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
don't fall in or anything but at the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.099 
don't fall in or anything but at the
same<00:03:57.549> time<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:57.970> definitely<00:03:58.389> doable<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.019> you

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
same time it's definitely doable so you

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.759 
same time it's definitely doable so you
can<00:03:59.290> try<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.560> at<00:03:59.680> home<00:04:01.139> click<00:04:02.139> on<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.319> picture<00:04:02.560> to

can try it at home click on a picture to

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.500 
can try it at home click on a picture to
