00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.760
 but we are learning 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.030
 we're supposed to go 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.030
 trying to understand the walls this matter 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.339
 this idea was born 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.839
 To some extent 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.839
 something let's say they are west is 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.960
 Although it is harassed by the company, use is, let's say, all of them are all 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.980
 black this sixth the subject it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.509
 this means 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.810
 inside the box 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.340
 when we are learning then we are going 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.750
 understanding little bit locke 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.800
 I think that matter is 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800
 will descend 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.270
 well, there we go doping 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.070
 if we have a very good master roshi 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.020
 we have an energy focus 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.400
 previous knowledge 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.430
 as if they 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.180
 che filling his pictures 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.370
 we have been learning 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.070
 maxims 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.380
 I fluoro museums of what we have been and it is that we end up 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.450
 jesus solÃ­s 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.550
 in terms of knowledge and we fill part of it 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 we understand some parts 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.200
 and so 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.400
 when we disagree with many we have to go from one 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.470
 I had another 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.940
 one week to another 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.390
 covering different topics 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.390
 these topics are like slices of cheese 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.410
 some scd 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.780
 the knowledge without the entrepreneurs inside it from 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.780
 then hundreds of dead --results 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.020
 of our knowledge in this round of cheese 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 is going to go to present in the next 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 in the next and six points that when we get 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.790
 at a certain level of self with acknowledgments 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.960
 it's more what we do not know what will happen 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.420
 for the airplane on which they are based in many cases 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.730
 while balusters initiating more we understand 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.119
 what are we missing 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.989
 well lets see 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.749
 However 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.259
 in the case of football 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.259
 it's not a street without school 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.979
 we have to go forward because sophos are different 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.799
 table cloths 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.429
 of that subject then 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 continuing then they are staying at the end we understand 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.009
 I like to finish 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.009
 a lot of students 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.059
 I think there is one of the things he did to the 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.849
 design lover 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 is that to move from one level to another of a 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.909
 of a concept another you have to 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.009
 master the previous concept 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:59.299
 then 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.899
 you can stay there the time that 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.989
 that is necessary for what 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.989
 once you master it for recreation 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.369
 and then the next 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.689
 points to the next and so 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.249
 makes you reach dyn 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:15.849
 final point 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.329
 this new study 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.329
 then with this maybe you take a little more time 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.139
 but you will arrive with 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.559
 much more security 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.699
 this knowledge 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.269
 and you're not going to end up like that 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.329
 to finish them rather 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.439
 because because one of the 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.639
 most important things that happen to us internally when we are learning 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.859
 understanding 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.689
 is that I do not understand them more sure of ourselves simon feeling 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.029
 more and more happy 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.209
 we want to learn more and more 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.069
 instead if we continue or this structure of the Swiss cheese where 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.359
 we do not stop 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.439
 one does not have the teachers one is teaching 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:59.309
 Ana 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:03.339
 although the mastery in each step then they ran out they buy 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.909
 they will slice cheese slice where 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:07.409
 it is more poetic
