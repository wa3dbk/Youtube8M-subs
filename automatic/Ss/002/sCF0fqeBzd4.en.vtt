about<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.100> same<00:01:17.280> weight<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.729> mine<00:01:18.090> other<00:01:19.340> our

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
about the same weight as mine other our

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.999 
about the same weight as mine other our
tail<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:22.050> hard<00:01:22.259> tail<00:01:22.440> that<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.619> had<00:01:22.800> was<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
tail was the hard tail that I had was a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.950 
tail was the hard tail that I had was a
decent<00:01:23.190> bike<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.300> it<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.470> know

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
decent bike but it was not you know

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.890 
decent bike but it was not you know
high<00:01:26.530> end<00:01:26.740> bikes<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:28.150> so<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.510> weighed<00:01:28.720> in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
high end bikes and so it weighed in

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.090 
high end bikes and so it weighed in
about<00:01:29.110> 26<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:29.979> weighs<00:01:30.159> in<00:01:30.369> about<00:01:30.580> 26<00:01:31.000> pounds

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
about 26 this weighs in about 26 pounds

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.600 
about 26 this weighs in about 26 pounds
as<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.970> go<00:01:34.510> up<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:35.259> scale<00:01:35.439> in<00:01:35.920> price<00:01:36.189> on<00:01:36.460> this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
as you go up the scale in price on this

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.969 
as you go up the scale in price on this
obviously<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.270> weight<00:01:37.450> comes<00:01:37.689> down<00:01:37.780> but<00:01:38.259> one

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
obviously that weight comes down but one

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.910 
obviously that weight comes down but one
thing<00:01:39.159> that<00:01:39.189> I've<00:01:39.430> noticed<00:01:40.060> with<00:01:40.630> this

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
thing that I've noticed with this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.890 
thing that I've noticed with this
immediately<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:43.150> hard<00:01:43.420> tail<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.690> I<00:01:43.720> had

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
immediately so the hard tail that I had

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.010 
immediately so the hard tail that I had
was<00:01:44.020> approximately<00:01:44.740> 26<00:01:45.100> pounds<00:01:45.369> as<00:01:45.460> well<00:01:46.020> but

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
was approximately 26 pounds as well but

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.109 
was approximately 26 pounds as well but
this<00:01:47.259> just<00:01:47.680> seemed<00:01:47.950> as<00:01:48.220> soon<00:01:48.430> as<00:01:48.549> I<00:01:48.640> got<00:01:48.790> on<00:01:48.820> it

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
this just seemed as soon as I got on it

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.200 
this just seemed as soon as I got on it
to<00:01:49.299> be<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.450> much<00:01:49.690> faster<00:01:50.049> bike<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:52.180> I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
to be a much faster bike and so I

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.730 
to be a much faster bike and so I
started<00:01:52.450> paying<00:01:52.600> attention<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:53.259> where<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.619> was

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
started paying attention to where I was

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.020 
started paying attention to where I was
actually<00:01:54.130> thinking<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.610> I<00:01:54.670> was<00:01:54.789> gaining

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
actually thinking that I was gaining

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.090 
actually thinking that I was gaining
some<00:01:55.360> speed<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.140> kind<00:01:56.320> of<00:01:56.380> came<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.890> few

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
some speed and it kind of came in a few

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.490 
some speed and it kind of came in a few
different<00:01:57.190> areas<00:01:58.680> first<00:01:59.680> I<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:02.110> first<00:02:02.289> thing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
different areas first I the first thing

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.880 
different areas first I the first thing
I<00:02:02.560> figured<00:02:02.830> out<00:02:02.920> was<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.430> on<00:02:03.720> climbs<00:02:04.860> where<00:02:05.860> a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
I figured out was that on climbs where a

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.380 
I figured out was that on climbs where a
lot<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.280> my<00:02:07.560> friends<00:02:08.560> were

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
lot of my friends were

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.840 
lot of my friends were
picking<00:02:09.720> lines<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.560> avoided<00:02:11.400> roots<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
picking lines that avoided roots and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.020 
picking lines that avoided roots and
rocks<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.300> having<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.680> wind<00:02:14.490> up<00:02:14.819> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
rocks and having to kind of wind up a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.330 
rocks and having to kind of wind up a
hill<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.870> was<00:02:16.290> able<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.650> put<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.890> line<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.310> I

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
hill I was able to put the line that I

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.610 
hill I was able to put the line that I
wanted<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.850> ride<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.450> such<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> straight<00:02:19.410> line

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
wanted to ride in such a straight line

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.820 
wanted to ride in such a straight line
and<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.459> straight<00:02:20.790> up<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.060> hill<00:02:21.319> because<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
and go straight up the hill because the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.540 
and go straight up the hill because the
suspension<00:02:23.370> took<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.569> absorb<00:02:24.990> those<00:02:25.740> roots

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
suspension took and absorb those roots

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.840 
suspension took and absorb those roots
and<00:02:26.760> rocks<00:02:27.230> which<00:02:28.230> helped<00:02:28.740> me<00:02:28.890> as<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.730> was

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
and rocks which helped me as I was

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.920 
and rocks which helped me as I was
climbing<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.209> didn't<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.600> get<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
climbing I didn't have to get out of the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.730 
climbing I didn't have to get out of the
seat<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.260> much

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
seat as much

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.440 
seat as much
and<00:02:32.100> number<00:02:32.340> two<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.700> kept<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.030> rear<00:02:33.240> wheel

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
and number two it kept that rear wheel

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.930 
and number two it kept that rear wheel
on<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.959> ground<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:34.950> kept<00:02:35.250> contact<00:02:35.820> with

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
on the ground and so kept contact with

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.970 
on the ground and so kept contact with
the<00:02:36.180> ground<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.600> left<00:02:36.810> me<00:02:37.350> putting<00:02:37.800> more

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
the ground and left me putting more

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.100 
the ground and left me putting more
power<00:02:38.220> allowed<00:02:38.610> me<00:02:38.760> put<00:02:38.970> more<00:02:39.150> power<00:02:39.330> into

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.440 

the<00:02:43.470> second<00:02:43.800> thing<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.340> found<00:02:44.610> kind<00:02:45.390> of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the second thing that I found kind of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.610 
the second thing that I found kind of
the<00:02:45.540> same<00:02:46.040> concept<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.640> downhills<00:02:48.620> much

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the same concept but on downhills much

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.260 
the same concept but on downhills much
more<00:02:49.920> flexible<00:02:50.430> with<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> lines<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.150> I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
more flexible with the lines that I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.140 
more flexible with the lines that I
would

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
would

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.910 
would
not<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.780> say<00:02:52.959> that<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.140> don't<00:02:53.230> still<00:02:53.590> try<00:02:53.860> to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
not to say that I don't still try to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.449 
not to say that I don't still try to
avoid<00:02:54.190> some<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.489> larger<00:02:54.790> rocks<00:02:55.000> roots<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:56.459> it

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
avoid some a larger rocks roots but it

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.449 
avoid some a larger rocks roots but it
me<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.390> pick<00:02:58.750> good<00:02:59.050> lines<00:02:59.349> and<00:02:59.860> not<00:03:00.129> have<00:03:00.310> to

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
me to pick good lines and not have to

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.580 
me to pick good lines and not have to
worry<00:03:00.750> about<00:03:01.750> losing<00:03:01.989> control<00:03:03.720> bike<00:03:04.720> flies<00:03:05.319> up

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
worry about losing control bike flies up

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.820 
worry about losing control bike flies up
after<00:03:06.069> everybody<00:03:06.370> rock<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.420> bone

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
after everybody rock and bone

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.000 
after everybody rock and bone
finally<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.810> know<00:03:10.870> here's<00:03:11.140> where<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.710> think

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
finally you know here's where I think

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.830 
finally you know here's where I think
over<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.910> know<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.090> you're<00:03:13.240> riding<00:03:13.630> for<00:03:13.660> a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
over you know if you're riding for a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.510 
over you know if you're riding for a
long<00:03:13.900> period<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.380> time<00:03:14.560> or<00:03:14.890> if<00:03:14.980> you're<00:03:15.310> in

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
long period of time or if you're in

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.810 
long period of time or if you're in
Europe<00:03:15.670> if<00:03:16.000> you're<00:03:16.150> racing<00:03:17.700> because<00:03:18.700> you're

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
Europe if you're racing because you're

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.430 
Europe if you're racing because you're
not<00:03:18.940> getting<00:03:19.120> up<00:03:19.390> out<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.780> seat<00:03:19.990> so<00:03:20.230> much

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
not getting up out of the seat so much

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.550 
not getting up out of the seat so much
it<00:03:21.070> allows<00:03:21.490> you<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.760> retain<00:03:22.420> energy<00:03:22.930> and

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
it allows you to retain energy and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.130 
it allows you to retain energy and
you're<00:03:23.740> not<00:03:23.920> wasting<00:03:24.130> energy<00:03:24.870> getting<00:03:25.870> up<00:03:25.990> out

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
you're not wasting energy getting up out

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.540 
you're not wasting energy getting up out
of<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.290> saddle<00:03:26.500> getting<00:03:26.920> back<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.340> saddle

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
of the saddle getting back in the saddle

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.680 
of the saddle getting back in the saddle
getting<00:03:27.940> up<00:03:28.030> out<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.360> saddle

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
getting up out of the saddle

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.550 
getting up out of the saddle
having<00:03:29.500> your<00:03:29.620> upper<00:03:30.610> body<00:03:31.110> blowing<00:03:32.110> all<00:03:32.320> out

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
having your upper body blowing all out

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.260 
having your upper body blowing all out
because<00:03:32.740> you're<00:03:33.100> trying<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.610> get<00:03:33.730> around<00:03:33.850> ruts

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
because you're trying to get around ruts

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.100 
because you're trying to get around ruts
in<00:03:34.480> rocks

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
in rocks

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.960 
in rocks
from<00:03:36.290> an<00:03:36.380> endurance<00:03:36.740> standpoint<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.580> really

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
from an endurance standpoint it really

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.830 
from an endurance standpoint it really
allows<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.360> to<00:03:38.390> keep<00:03:38.600> energy

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
allows you to keep energy

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.570 
allows you to keep energy
so<00:03:40.350> those<00:03:40.770> are<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> couple<00:03:41.220> things<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.520> I

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
so those are the couple things that I

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.880 
so those are the couple things that I
really<00:03:41.850> found<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:43.230> be<00:03:43.380> most<00:03:43.740> beneficial

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
really found to be most beneficial

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.960 
really found to be most beneficial
without<00:03:44.550> about<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.120> bike<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> epic<00:03:47.550> comp

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
without about the bike so the epic comp

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.390 
without about the bike so the epic comp
in<00:03:48.240> particular<00:03:48.710> comes<00:03:49.710> with<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.920> 2<00:03:50.070> by<00:03:50.220> 10

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
in particular comes with a 2 by 10

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.730 
in particular comes with a 2 by 10
drivetrain<00:03:50.970> which<00:03:51.690> like<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> had

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
drivetrain which like that I had

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.730 
drivetrain which like that I had
previously<00:03:52.920> had<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> 3<00:03:53.640> by<00:03:53.760> 9<00:03:53.790> I've<00:03:54.780> found<00:03:55.560> to

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
previously had a 3 by 9 I've found to

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.080 
previously had a 3 by 9 I've found to
