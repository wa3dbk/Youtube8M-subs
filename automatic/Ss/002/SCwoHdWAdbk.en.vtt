the<00:01:38.610> crucial<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.120> it's<00:01:39.240> below<00:01:39.620> 2000

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
the crucial thing is it's below 2000

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.070 
the crucial thing is it's below 2000
yuan<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.700> that's<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> sort<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.810> most

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
yuan and that's the sort of the most

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.320 
yuan and that's the sort of the most
that<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.950> people<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.340> expected<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.820> pay<00:01:45.060> for

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
that that people are expected to pay for

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.290 
that that people are expected to pay for
for<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> relatively<00:01:46.770> fancy<00:01:47.340> Chinese<00:01:47.790> handset

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
for a relatively fancy Chinese handset

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.270 
for a relatively fancy Chinese handset
and<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:48.900> what<00:01:49.080> Xiaomi<00:01:49.650> is<00:01:49.740> doing<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.160> they're

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and so what Xiaomi is doing is they're

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.620 
and so what Xiaomi is doing is they're
actually<00:01:50.370> selling<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.910> handsets<00:01:51.270> pretty

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
actually selling the handsets pretty

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660 
actually selling the handsets pretty
much<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:51.960> cost<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.590> that's<00:01:53.010> why<00:01:53.160> their<00:01:53.370> model

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
much at cost and that's why their model

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.880 
much at cost and that's why their model
is<00:01:53.760> like<00:01:54.260> Amazon<00:01:55.260> so<00:01:55.410> if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> look<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:55.800> what

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
is like Amazon so if you look at what

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.649 
is like Amazon so if you look at what
Amazon<00:01:56.250> does<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> Kindle<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.210> sells<00:01:57.510> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
Amazon does with the Kindle it sells the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.540 
Amazon does with the Kindle it sells the
Kindle<00:01:58.020> e-reader<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> knockdown<00:01:58.830> price<00:01:59.220> and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
Kindle e-reader at a knockdown price and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.460 
Kindle e-reader at a knockdown price and
then<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.730> makes<00:01:59.880> its<00:02:00.090> money<00:02:00.300> on<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.840> ebooks

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
then it makes its money on the ebooks

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.370 
then it makes its money on the ebooks
that<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.800> buy<00:02:01.980> on<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.900> it's<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that you buy on it and so it's it's a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
that you buy on it and so it's it's a
similar<00:02:04.770> model<00:02:05.070> again<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.550> video<00:02:05.820> games

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
similar model again to the video games

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.270 
similar model again to the video games
industry<00:02:06.240> where<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.470> make<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> loss<00:02:08.039> even

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
industry where you you make a loss even

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.590 
industry where you you make a loss even
on<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.610> hardware<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> make<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> money

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
on the hardware and you make the money

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.820 
on the hardware and you make the money
back<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> software<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.530> that's<00:02:10.710> what

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
back on the software so that's what

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.590 
back on the software so that's what
Xiaomi<00:02:11.160> trying<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> do<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.790> try<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.000> introduce

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
Xiaomi trying to do is try to introduce

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.720 
Xiaomi trying to do is try to introduce
these<00:02:12.960> quite<00:02:13.470> high<00:02:13.680> spec<00:02:14.069> but<00:02:14.280> relatively

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
these quite high spec but relatively

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.080 
these quite high spec but relatively
cheap

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
cheap

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.850 
cheap
hand<00:02:15.330> sets<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.810> then<00:02:15.900> sell<00:02:16.110> services<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.830> top

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
hand sets and then sell services on top

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.940 
hand sets and then sell services on top
and<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:18.510> idea<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.349> they<00:02:19.470> monetize

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
and the idea then is that they monetize

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.800 
and the idea then is that they monetize
the<00:02:20.160> individual<00:02:20.550> customers<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.450> actual

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the individual customers not the actual

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
the individual customers not the actual
hardware<00:02:22.230> sales<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.400> course

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
hardware sales and this is of course

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.759 
hardware sales and this is of course
what<00:02:23.819> Internet<00:02:24.660> firms<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.379> what<00:02:25.530> Chinese

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
what Internet firms do it's what Chinese

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.860 
what Internet firms do it's what Chinese
internet<00:02:26.310> firms<00:02:26.519> do<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:26.879> $0.10<00:02:27.420> which<00:02:27.629> is<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
internet firms do so $0.10 which is the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.380 
internet firms do so $0.10 which is the
biggest<00:02:28.160> Chinese<00:02:29.160> internet<00:02:29.849> portal<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.300> a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
biggest Chinese internet portal it's a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.960 
biggest Chinese internet portal it's a
bit<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.690> Yahoo<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.319> might<00:02:31.500> say<00:02:31.739> they<00:02:32.730> sell

year and then if you look at what Google

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.390 
year and then if you look at what Google
and<00:02:42.720> Facebook<00:02:42.810> did<00:02:43.260> they<00:02:43.680> built<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.220> large

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
audience and then they figured out how

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.940 
audience and then they figured out how
to<00:02:45.840> make<00:02:46.049> money<00:02:46.200> from<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.590> that's<00:02:46.799> what

they're<00:02:58.500> making<00:02:58.769> Android<00:02:59.400> handsets<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
they're making Android handsets the

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.059 
they're making Android handsets the

the 5c which people were expecting to be

the<00:03:32.280> low-cost<00:03:32.609> iPhone<00:03:33.030> for<00:03:33.180> China<00:03:33.389> it's<00:03:33.690> not

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the low-cost iPhone for China it's not

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.180 
the low-cost iPhone for China it's not
terribly<00:03:34.260> low<00:03:34.410> cost<00:03:34.709> though<00:03:34.859> it's<00:03:35.010> going<00:03:35.130> to

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
terribly low cost though it's going to

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.879 
terribly low cost though it's going to
cost<00:03:35.340> 733<00:03:36.329> dollars<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.900> China<00:03:37.290> which<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.739> only

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
cost 733 dollars in China which is only

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.559 
cost 733 dollars in China which is only
about<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.099> hundred<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.519> fifty<00:03:38.730> dollars<00:03:39.060> less

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
about a hundred and fifty dollars less

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.900 
about a hundred and fifty dollars less
than<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.900> than<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.650> current<00:03:40.950> iPhone<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.579> so

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
than the than the current iPhone and so

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.030 
than the than the current iPhone and so
I<00:03:41.940> think<00:03:42.090> along<00:03:42.930> with<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.410> lot<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.650> other<00:03:43.799> people

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
I think along with a lot of other people

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.140 
I think along with a lot of other people
I'm<00:03:44.190> quite<00:03:44.370> surprised<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.880> they<00:03:44.970> haven't

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
I'm quite surprised that they haven't

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.240 
I'm quite surprised that they haven't
gone<00:03:45.329> for<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.599> for<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.349> lower<00:03:46.530> price<00:03:46.769> point<00:03:47.010> there

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
gone for a for a lower price point there

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.309 
gone for a for a lower price point there
but<00:03:47.639> apples<00:03:48.329> actually<00:03:48.599> just<00:03:48.840> been<00:03:48.959> overtaken

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
but apples actually just been overtaken

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.580 
but apples actually just been overtaken
by<00:03:49.530> Xiaomi<00:03:49.859> in<00:03:50.190> market<00:03:50.730> share<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.150> China<00:03:51.590> it's

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
by Xiaomi in market share in China it's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.259 
by Xiaomi in market share in China it's
quite<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.829> fragmented<00:03:53.130> market<00:03:53.669> so<00:03:53.880> shammies

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
quite a fragmented market so shammies

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.690 
quite a fragmented market so shammies
got<00:03:54.419> about<00:03:54.540> 5%<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.349> apples<00:03:55.739> got<00:03:55.859> 4.8<00:03:56.519> but

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
got about 5% and apples got 4.8 but

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.000 
got about 5% and apples got 4.8 but
clearly<00:03:57.299> Apple<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.959> paying<00:03:58.739> much<00:03:58.980> more

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
clearly Apple is paying much more

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.110 
clearly Apple is paying much more
attention<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.730> China

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
attention to China

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.750 
attention to China
they<00:04:00.750> did<00:04:01.169> of<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> symbol<00:04:01.889> taneous<00:04:02.310> product

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
they did of a symbol taneous product

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.550 
they did of a symbol taneous product
launch<00:04:02.970> for<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.299> new<00:04:03.450> iPhones<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:04.109> China<00:04:04.380> in

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
launch for the new iPhones in China in

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.009 
launch for the new iPhones in China in
Beijing<00:04:04.739> they<00:04:05.069> have<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> satellite<00:04:06.510> link<00:04:06.720> and

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
Beijing they have a satellite link and

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.140 
Beijing they have a satellite link and
they<00:04:07.859> haven't<00:04:08.340> bothered<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.700> do<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:09.000> before

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
they haven't bothered to do that before

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.759 
they haven't bothered to do that before
so<00:04:09.480> they're<00:04:09.599> clearly<00:04:09.750> taking<00:04:10.139> this<00:04:10.290> more

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
so they're clearly taking this more

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.770 
so they're clearly taking this more
seriously<00:04:10.829> but<00:04:11.609> they're<00:04:12.120> not<00:04:12.269> taking<00:04:12.569> it<00:04:12.630> so

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
seriously but they're not taking it so

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.030 
seriously but they're not taking it so
seriously<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:13.319> they<00:04:13.380> want<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.590> reduce<00:04:13.739> their

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
seriously that they want to reduce their

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.580 
seriously that they want to reduce their
margin<00:04:14.549> so<00:04:14.849> this<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.359> very<00:04:15.690> very<00:04:15.959> small<00:04:16.229> step

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
margin so this is a very very small step

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.379 
margin so this is a very very small step
by<00:04:16.769> Apple<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.099> make<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.370> slightly<00:04:17.880> cheaper

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
by Apple to make a slightly cheaper

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.640 
by Apple to make a slightly cheaper
phone<00:04:18.539> that<00:04:18.720> will<00:04:18.780> appeal<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.200> slightly

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
phone that will appeal to a slightly

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.039 
phone that will appeal to a slightly
bigger<00:04:20.010> audience<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.639> China<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.510> help<00:04:21.870> them

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
bigger audience in China and help them

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.779 
bigger audience in China and help them
fend<00:04:22.289> off<00:04:22.410> competition<00:04:22.680> from<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.370> likes<00:04:23.460> of
