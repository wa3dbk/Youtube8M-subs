 Hello, good people, I am now. 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:14.450
 make 1 battery end in a battery 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:17.029
 electronic an average of 305 life 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.950
 of driver directly to the line of 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.170
 entry of a cpu 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.050
 and I'm going to update it a little bit more and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.000
 then I'm going to apply a compressor 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.580
 to master it and I'm not going to do it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.760
 nothing else 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.070
 I do this as a sample of 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.489
 how useful it can be to record in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 at home and to play live too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.010
 because the electronic battery has a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.250
 output that can be connected to a 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 amplifier and this solves a lot the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.720
 theme of battery transport and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.030
 It also solves the issue of 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.470
 microphone battery often 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.690
 when we play live with 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.320
 a drummer is a problem of 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.020
 microphone so good without more happened to 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 touch something but what 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.810
 like to be useful 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.640
 the information what I'm going to expose and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.640
 well thank you very much for your attention
