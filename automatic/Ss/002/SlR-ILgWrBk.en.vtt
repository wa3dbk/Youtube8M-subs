00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 saltwater ocean hides in the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.770
 icy moon jupiter europe 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.090
 the thousand astronomers that brown and kevin have 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.550
 they identified a vast ocean of water 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.070
 salty under the layer of ice that protects 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.830
 the moon europe of jupiter and gushing 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.820
 towards the surface informed the nasa on 5 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.680
 March 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.039
 the finding is based on a study of 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.130
 images of the Galilean mission between 1989 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.199
 and 2003 the study revealed that there is a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.150
 chemical exchange between the ocean and the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.149
 surface and it was published in the magazine 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.980
 of astronomy brawn from the institute of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.350
 technology in california 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.450
 Pasadena stressed that if this bone does not 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 has energy this is important from 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.640
 the point of view of the search for life 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.739
 also the scientist clarified that it would be enough 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.590
 scrape the ice of europe a little 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 know what is in said ocean this covers 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.090
 almost the entire moon globe with a 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.730
 thickness of about 100 kilometers informs 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.469
 the nasa the infrared spectrometer of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.660
 the Galilean mission was not able to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 specify the materials present in the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 Europe's surface but now using 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.240
 the osiris telescopes and their 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.369
 brawn spectrometer 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.799
 they identified that the surface has 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.020
 magnesium sulfate salt a mineral 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.360
 called wasonite that could be formed by 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.880
 the oxidation of another verifiable mineral 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.250
 oceanic origin the scientists did 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.049
 also map the icecap 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.299
 water from the moon and they discovered 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.210
 significant areas with ice that is not 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.070
 of water the magnesium sulfate detected 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.200
 could also be generated by the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.320
 irradiation of sulfur expelled from the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.600
 jupiter's moon sister says the nasa to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.399
 In turn, the authors point out that there is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.190
 presence of magnesium chloride salt 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.740
 which would be coming from the ocean of 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.200
 Europe the chlorides such as chloride 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.420
 of sodium and potassium is expected to 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.369
 are on the surface of europe but in 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.409
 are not detectable because they are not 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.789
 they have clear characteristics of 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.190
 infrared spectrum 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.700
 instead magnesium sulfate is 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.780
 detectable point the authors for these 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.369
 characteristics 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
 brawn and his team believe that the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.659
 composition of the ocean of europe can 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.390
 resemble the salty sea of ​​the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.370
 earth if we have learned something about 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.780
 life on earth is that where there is 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.810
 liquid water by 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.790
 generates life said that he works in the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.819
 Jet Propulsion Laboratory of 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.680
 Of course, our sea is a 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.750
 nice and salty sea 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.700
 maybe the oceans next to europe is 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.970
 also a wonderful place for 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.970
 lifetime
