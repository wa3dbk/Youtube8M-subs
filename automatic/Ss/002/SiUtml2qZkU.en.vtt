hi<00:00:00.480> I'm<00:00:00.630> Jared<00:00:01.079> welcome<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.380> fun<00:00:01.500> science

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
hi I'm Jared welcome to fun science

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.490 
hi I'm Jared welcome to fun science
demos<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:03.030> big<00:00:03.210> idea<00:00:03.540> today<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:04.140> heat

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
demos the big idea today is that heat

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.309 
demos the big idea today is that heat
moves<00:00:05.040> matter<00:00:05.520> heat<00:00:06.330> moves<00:00:06.629> matter<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.140> this

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
moves matter heat moves matter in this

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.990 
moves matter heat moves matter in this
lamp<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.429> heat<00:00:09.240> moves<00:00:09.510> matter<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.679> earth<00:00:11.000> so

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
lamp and heat moves matter in earth so

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.910 
lamp and heat moves matter in earth so
let's<00:00:12.179> take<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> look<00:00:12.630> at<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.870> lamp<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.440> see

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
let's take a look at this lamp and see

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.420 
let's take a look at this lamp and see
heat<00:00:14.309> move<00:00:14.580> matter<00:00:15.289> you<00:00:16.289> can't<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> but

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
heat move matter you can't see it but

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.370 
heat move matter you can't see it but
there's<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> light<00:00:17.970> bulb<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.140> hot

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
there's a light bulb here and it's hot

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.769 
there's a light bulb here and it's hot
it<00:00:19.800> gives<00:00:20.070> off<00:00:20.250> lots<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.730> heat<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.240> heat

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it gives off lots of heat and that heat

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.929 
it gives off lots of heat and that heat
heats<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.769> purple<00:00:23.039> wax<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:23.850> it

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
heats up this purple wax you can see it

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.839 
heats up this purple wax you can see it
it<00:00:24.689> causes<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.619> rise<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> top<00:00:26.430> when

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it causes it to rise to the top when

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
it causes it to rise to the top when
that<00:00:27.000> wax<00:00:27.300> gets<00:00:27.630> hot<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.140> rises<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> top

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that wax gets hot it rises to the top

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.030 
that wax gets hot it rises to the top
and<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:30.480> some<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> wax<00:00:31.199> dropping

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and you can see some of the wax dropping

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.690 
and you can see some of the wax dropping
down<00:00:32.340> why<00:00:33.180> well<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.440> heated<00:00:34.920> wax<00:00:35.160> moves<00:00:35.520> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
down why well as the heated wax moves to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.180 
down why well as the heated wax moves to
the<00:00:35.820> top<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.510> hangs<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.200> there<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.649> it's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the top it just hangs out there and it's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
the top it just hangs out there and it's
cooling<00:00:38.460> off<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> cools<00:00:39.809> off<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
cooling off and when it cools off it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.920 
cooling off and when it cools off it
drops<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.700> drops<00:00:41.940> back<00:00:42.329> down<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
drops it drops back down and when it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660 
drops it drops back down and when it
drops<00:00:43.170> back<00:00:43.379> down<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> gets<00:00:43.920> heated<00:00:44.190> back<00:00:44.430> up

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
drops back down it gets heated back up

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.119 
drops back down it gets heated back up
and<00:00:44.850> moves<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.289> cools<00:00:46.440> off<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.920> moves

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and moves up and it cools off and moves

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.090 
and moves up and it cools off and moves
down<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.480> gets<00:00:48.930> heated<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.649> moves

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
down and it gets heated up and it moves

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
down and it gets heated up and it moves
up<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.059> cools<00:00:51.239> off<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> moves<00:00:52.050> down

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
up and it cools off and it moves down

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.490 
up and it cools off and it moves down
it's<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.010> cycle<00:00:53.750> it's<00:00:54.750> happening<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it's this cycle it's happening in the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.580 
it's this cycle it's happening in the
lamp<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:58.320> thing

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
lamp and what do you know the same thing

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.189 
lamp and what do you know the same thing
happens<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.219> our<00:00:59.579> earth<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.780> let's<00:01:00.960> take<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
happens in our earth so let's take a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
happens in our earth so let's take a
look<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.680> diagram<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
look at this diagram and see how the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
look at this diagram and see how the
earth<00:01:03.719> works<00:01:04.049> through<00:01:05.040> science<00:01:05.460> we've

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
earth works through science we've

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.100 
earth works through science we've
discovered<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.479> middle<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> earth

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
discovered that the middle of the earth

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.560 
discovered that the middle of the earth
is<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:08.189> hot<00:01:08.490> we've<00:01:09.360> also

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
is really really hot we've also

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660 
is really really hot we've also
discovered<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.770> outside<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> earth

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
discovered that the outside of the earth

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.570 
discovered that the outside of the earth
has<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.240> crust<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.799> moving<00:01:14.310> matter

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
has this crust and the moving matter

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.539 
has this crust and the moving matter
inside<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.570> earth<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.920> move<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
inside the earth can actually move the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.870 
inside the earth can actually move the
crust<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.990> heated<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.740> rises<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
crust as it's heated up it rises up to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.270 
crust as it's heated up it rises up to
the<00:01:20.970> crust<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.540> cools<00:01:22.140> off<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.799> comes<00:01:23.009> back

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the crust it cools off and comes back

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
the crust it cools off and comes back
down<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.390> lamp<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> wax<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
down just like this lamp the wax in this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.300 
down just like this lamp the wax in this
lamp<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.130> happening<00:01:26.939> inside<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.479> our<00:01:27.630> earth

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
lamp it's happening inside of our earth

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.859 
lamp it's happening inside of our earth
the<00:01:29.310> heat<00:01:29.610> from<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> middle<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.420> earth<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the heat from the middle of the earth is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.590 
the heat from the middle of the earth is
causing<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.829> matter<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.520> move<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
causing all this matter to move and that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
causing all this matter to move and that
makes<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> crust<00:01:34.229> move<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.100> let's<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
makes the crust move so let's take a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
makes the crust move so let's take a
look<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> crust<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.900> outside<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
look at that crust and the outside of

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.910 
look at that crust and the outside of
the<00:01:37.470> earth

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the earth

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.670 
the earth
these<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.759> continents<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:40.259> where<00:01:40.500> we

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
these are continents that's where we

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.359 
these are continents that's where we
live<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.579> blue<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.420> ocean<00:01:43.159> oceans<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
live the blue is the ocean oceans and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
live the blue is the ocean oceans and
continents<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:45.659> sit<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.020> top<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
continents actually sit on top of the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
continents actually sit on top of the
crust<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:47.850> these<00:01:47.939> lines<00:01:48.299> through

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
crust what are these lines through

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
crust what are these lines through
science<00:01:49.500> we've<00:01:49.680> discovered<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.939> crust

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
science we've discovered that the crust

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.380 
science we've discovered that the crust
is<00:01:51.509> actually<00:01:51.689> broken<00:01:52.530> into<00:01:52.740> plates<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.579> those

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
is actually broken into plates and those

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
is actually broken into plates and those
plates<00:01:54.720> move<00:01:55.670> he<00:01:56.670> moves<00:01:57.570> matter<00:01:58.189> let's<00:01:59.189> try

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
plates move he moves matter let's try

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.060 
plates move he moves matter let's try
and<00:01:59.640> show<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.909> how<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.329> works<00:02:00.920> we<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and show you how that works we have a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.170 
and show you how that works we have a
heat<00:02:02.340> source<00:02:02.579> here

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
heat source here

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380 
heat source here
we<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> heat<00:02:04.290> source<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
we have a heat source here we have a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.219 
we have a heat source here we have a
heat<00:02:06.689> source<00:02:06.990> here

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
heat source here

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.469 
heat source here
our<00:02:08.920> heat<00:02:09.190> source<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.940> middle<00:02:10.209> part<00:02:10.420> of

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
our heat source is the middle part of

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.360 
our heat source is the middle part of
the<00:02:10.599> earth<00:02:10.720> we<00:02:11.530> need<00:02:11.680> something<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.069> be<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
the earth we need something to be the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.220 
the earth we need something to be the
matter<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.269> heat<00:02:13.569> energy<00:02:13.599> can<00:02:14.200> move

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
matter that that heat energy can move

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.030 
matter that that heat energy can move
around<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.180> our<00:02:16.360> milk<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.900> now<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.709> need

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
around we have our milk and now we need

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.180 
around we have our milk and now we need
something<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.819> be<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.090> crust<00:02:19.390> for<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.470> we're

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
something to be the crust for that we're

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.300 
something to be the crust for that we're
using<00:02:21.400> chocolate<00:02:22.269> powder<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.830> here's<00:02:24.129> our

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
using chocolate powder so here's our

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.059 
using chocolate powder so here's our
setup<00:02:24.550> we<00:02:24.670> modeled<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.239> after<00:02:25.450> our<00:02:25.959> earth<00:02:26.170> we

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
setup we modeled it after our earth we

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.729 
setup we modeled it after our earth we
have<00:02:27.099> our<00:02:27.370> Center<00:02:28.120> hot<00:02:28.300> part<00:02:28.599> there's<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
have our Center hot part there's the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.309 
have our Center hot part there's the
heat<00:02:29.920> source<00:02:30.099> down<00:02:30.220> there<00:02:30.610> making<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.300> hot<00:02:31.510> we

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
heat source down there making it hot we

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.170 
heat source down there making it hot we
have<00:02:32.470> our<00:02:32.680> crust<00:02:33.010> which<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.430> can<00:02:33.610> see<00:02:33.849> on<00:02:34.030> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
have our crust which you can see on the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.930 
have our crust which you can see on the
top<00:02:34.390> it's<00:02:34.690> smooth<00:02:35.380> right<00:02:35.680> now<00:02:35.940> something

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
top it's smooth right now something

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.610 
top it's smooth right now something
should<00:02:37.180> happen<00:02:37.390> as<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.840> matter<00:02:38.080> which<00:02:38.470> you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
should happen as the matter which you

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.130 
should happen as the matter which you
can't<00:02:38.890> see<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.280> milk<00:02:39.519> starts<00:02:40.330> moving<00:02:40.810> inside

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
can't see the milk starts moving inside

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.729 
can't see the milk starts moving inside
from<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.590> heat<00:02:42.120> heat<00:02:43.120> heats<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.569> up<00:02:43.739> Rises

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
from the heat heat heats it up Rises

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.830 
from the heat heat heats it up Rises
cools<00:02:45.340> off<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.819> sinks<00:02:46.150> there's<00:02:46.390> movement

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
cools off and sinks there's movement

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.990 
cools off and sinks there's movement
happening<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.200> can't<00:02:47.410> see<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.769> yet<00:02:48.250> let's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
happening you can't see it yet let's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.880 
happening you can't see it yet let's
zoom<00:02:49.360> in<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:49.750> take<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.930> closer<00:02:50.260> look

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
zoom in and take a closer look

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.309 
zoom in and take a closer look
so<00:02:51.610> our<00:02:51.730> timer's<00:02:52.209> going<00:02:52.599> let's<00:02:52.750> take<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:52.989> look

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
so our timer's going let's take a look

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.930 
so our timer's going let's take a look
at<00:02:53.470> this<00:02:53.620> setup<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.160> see<00:02:54.400> what's<00:02:54.549> going<00:02:54.819> on

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
at this setup and see what's going on

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.050 
at this setup and see what's going on
here<00:02:55.410> inside<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.650> pot<00:02:56.890> we<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.430> our<00:02:57.610> liquid

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
here inside the pot we have our liquid

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.150 
here inside the pot we have our liquid
matter<00:02:58.299> much<00:02:58.840> like<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.230> earth<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.650> we're

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
matter much like the earth and we're

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.580 
matter much like the earth and we're
heating<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.790> liquid<00:03:01.269> matter<00:03:01.510> much<00:03:02.140> like<00:03:02.410> the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
heating that liquid matter much like the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.559 
heating that liquid matter much like the
earth<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.549> see<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.940> chocolate

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
earth and you can see that chocolate

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.770 
earth and you can see that chocolate
powder<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.079> top<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.560> our<00:03:06.040> crust<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:07.360> doesn't

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
powder on top is our crust it doesn't

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.569 
powder on top is our crust it doesn't
look<00:03:07.930> like<00:03:07.959> much<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.500> happening<00:03:08.739> but<00:03:09.430> there's

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
look like much is happening but there's

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.710 
look like much is happening but there's
a<00:03:09.640> lot<00:03:09.880> going<00:03:10.299> on

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
a lot going on

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.650 
a lot going on
underneath<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.500> crust<00:03:11.739> just<00:03:12.579> like<00:03:12.970> our<00:03:13.209> earth

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
underneath the crust just like our earth

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.080 
underneath the crust just like our earth
so<00:03:14.650> we're<00:03:14.829> going<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.069> zoom<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:15.639> and<00:03:15.850> take<00:03:16.060> a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
so we're going to zoom in and take a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.120 
so we're going to zoom in and take a
closer<00:03:16.480> look<00:03:16.660> but<00:03:17.500> what<00:03:17.680> should<00:03:17.859> you<00:03:18.010> be

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
closer look but what should you be

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.870 
closer look but what should you be
looking<00:03:18.459> for

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
looking for

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.900 
looking for
well<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.989> liquid<00:03:20.680> matter<00:03:20.920> under<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.670> crust

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
well that liquid matter under the crust

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.479 
well that liquid matter under the crust
is<00:03:22.180> moving<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:23.709> doesn't<00:03:24.160> look<00:03:24.310> like

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
is moving it doesn't look like

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.460 
is moving it doesn't look like
anything's<00:03:25.090> happening<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.810> crust<00:03:26.079> but<00:03:26.230> as

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
anything's happening to the crust but as

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.220 
anything's happening to the crust but as
the<00:03:26.709> liquid<00:03:27.130> matter<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.940> crust<00:03:28.209> moves<00:03:28.480> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
the liquid matter of the crust moves the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.319 
the liquid matter of the crust moves the
crust<00:03:29.590> will<00:03:30.100> start<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.549> move<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.000> you'll

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
crust will start to move and you'll

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.569 
crust will start to move and you'll
actually<00:03:31.510> see<00:03:31.930> tiny<00:03:32.260> cracks<00:03:32.709> form<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.340> those

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
actually see tiny cracks form and those

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.789 
actually see tiny cracks form and those
cracks<00:03:34.000> will<00:03:34.239> get<00:03:34.389> bigger<00:03:34.690> as<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.470> crust

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
cracks will get bigger as the crust

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.090 
cracks will get bigger as the crust
moves<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.600> we're<00:03:37.750> coming<00:03:38.019> up<00:03:38.109> on<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.350> 14

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
moves so we're coming up on the 14

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.220 
moves so we're coming up on the 14
minutes<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.730> now<00:03:39.880> we<00:03:39.940> can<00:03:40.329> see<00:03:40.540> our<00:03:40.810> crust

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
minutes and now we can see our crust

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.140 
minutes and now we can see our crust
starting<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.859> crack<00:03:42.160> why<00:03:42.549> is<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:42.760> happening

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
starting to crack why is that happening

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.330 
starting to crack why is that happening
well<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:43.930> liquid<00:03:44.410> matter<00:03:44.620> we<00:03:44.859> heated<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.220> up

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
well that liquid matter we heated it up

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.190 
well that liquid matter we heated it up
and<00:03:45.549> it's<00:03:45.670> starting<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.090> move<00:03:46.389> underneath<00:03:46.989> the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
and it's starting to move underneath the

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.940 
and it's starting to move underneath the
crust<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:48.940> can<00:03:49.120> see<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:49.540> crust<00:03:50.049> there

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
crust and you can see that crust there

called plate scientists call those
plates<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.170> they're<00:03:53.260> starting<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.620> move<00:03:53.889> look

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
plates and they're starting to move look

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.000 
plates and they're starting to move look

whew there's one forming right here now
we<00:04:35.650> have<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.010> crack<00:04:36.940> forming<00:04:37.450> here<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.500> crust

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
we have a crack forming here the crust

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.040 
we have a crack forming here the crust
is<00:04:39.130> breaking<00:04:39.729> in<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.940> plates<00:04:40.240> right<00:04:40.659> before

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
is breaking in the plates right before

our eyes

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.250 
our eyes
why<00:04:42.099> is<00:04:42.159> that<00:04:42.310> happening<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:43.390> liquid<00:04:43.960> matter

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
why is that happening the liquid matter

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.560 
why is that happening the liquid matter
underneath<00:04:45.099> the<00:04:45.400> crust<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.909> moving<00:04:46.300> now<00:04:46.510> we

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
underneath the crust is moving now we

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.839 
underneath the crust is moving now we
can<00:04:46.930> start<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.349> see<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:47.650> happen<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.430> can<00:04:48.610> see

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
can start to see it happen you can see

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.440 
can start to see it happen you can see
the<00:04:49.030> plate<00:04:49.270> movements<00:04:49.840> as<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:52.090> liquid

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
the plate movements as that liquid

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.140 
the plate movements as that liquid
matter<00:04:52.630> heats<00:04:53.050> up<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:54.280> crust<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.789> plates

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
matter heats up the crust the plates

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.540 
matter heats up the crust the plates
move<00:04:56.940> cracks<00:04:57.940> are<00:04:58.180> forming<00:04:59.190> we're<00:05:00.190> at<00:05:00.280> about

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
move cracks are forming we're at about

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.570 
move cracks are forming we're at about
15<00:05:01.270> minutes<00:05:01.719> in<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.200> now<00:05:02.860> we<00:05:02.919> can<00:05:03.219> see<00:05:03.430> our

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
15 minutes in and now we can see our

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.380 
15 minutes in and now we can see our
plates<00:05:04.030> really<00:05:04.930> forming<00:05:05.440> up<00:05:05.590> here

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
plates really forming up here

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.550 
plates really forming up here
beautifully<00:05:08.099> we<00:05:09.099> want<00:05:09.310> you<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.580> remember<00:05:10.560> that

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
beautifully we want you to remember that

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.670 
beautifully we want you to remember that
our<00:05:11.620> continents<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.520> oceans<00:05:13.320> actually<00:05:14.320> sit

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
our continents and oceans actually sit

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.810 
our continents and oceans actually sit
on<00:05:14.890> these<00:05:15.669> different<00:05:16.120> plates<00:05:17.640> I'm<00:05:18.640> not

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
on these different plates I'm not

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.180 
on these different plates I'm not
putting<00:05:19.120> them<00:05:19.210> in<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.450> right<00:05:19.570> order<00:05:19.630> but

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
putting them in the right order but

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.360 
putting them in the right order but
that's<00:05:21.190> alright<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.760> get<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:22.030> picture<00:05:23.370> each

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
that's alright you get the picture each

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.000 
that's alright you get the picture each
continent<00:05:25.030> an<00:05:25.210> ocean<00:05:25.659> sits<00:05:26.200> on<00:05:26.409> different

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
continent an ocean sits on different

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.680 
continent an ocean sits on different
plates<00:05:27.310> and<00:05:27.550> you<00:05:27.789> can<00:05:27.969> see<00:05:28.180> how<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.360> plates

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
plates and you can see how the plates

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.500 
plates and you can see how the plates
are<00:05:28.930> separate<00:05:29.469> by<00:05:30.010> the<00:05:30.070> cracks<00:05:30.580> what<00:05:31.240> causes

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
are separate by the cracks what causes

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.140 
are separate by the cracks what causes
it<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:32.500> moving<00:05:32.919> matter<00:05:33.130> underneath<00:05:33.909> the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
it the moving matter underneath the

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.120 
it the moving matter underneath the
crust<00:05:34.479> we<00:05:34.750> can't<00:05:35.020> see<00:05:35.320> it<00:05:35.500> but<00:05:35.770> through<00:05:35.979> this

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
crust we can't see it but through this

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.050 
crust we can't see it but through this
demonstration<00:05:36.390> now<00:05:37.390> we<00:05:37.450> can<00:05:38.070> it's<00:05:39.070> so<00:05:39.400> easy<00:05:39.849> to

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
demonstration now we can it's so easy to

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.060 
demonstration now we can it's so easy to
see<00:05:40.390> the<00:05:40.570> movement<00:05:40.870> of<00:05:41.229> the<00:05:41.349> crust<00:05:41.650> well

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
see the movement of the crust well

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.040 
see the movement of the crust well
scientists<00:05:42.640> call<00:05:42.940> that<00:05:43.180> movement<00:05:43.750> of<00:05:43.900> the

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
scientists call that movement of the

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.850 
scientists call that movement of the
Earth's<00:05:44.229> crust

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
Earth's crust

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.180 
Earth's crust
plate<00:05:45.310> tectonics<00:05:45.610> it's<00:05:46.360> a<00:05:46.690> big<00:05:46.930> word<00:05:47.140> but<00:05:47.800> so

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
plate tectonics it's a big word but so

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.279 
plate tectonics it's a big word but so
many<00:05:48.370> cool<00:05:48.669> things<00:05:48.729> happen<00:05:49.510> because<00:05:49.659> of<00:05:49.990> that

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
many cool things happen because of that

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.219 
many cool things happen because of that
word<00:05:50.530> because<00:05:51.460> the<00:05:51.729> crust<00:05:52.000> moves<00:05:52.450> and<00:05:52.750> those

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
word because the crust moves and those

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.399 
word because the crust moves and those
plates<00:05:53.620> move<00:05:53.979> we<00:05:54.610> have<00:05:54.760> earthquakes<00:05:55.140> we<00:05:56.140> have

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
plates move we have earthquakes we have

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.520 
plates move we have earthquakes we have
volcanoes<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:57.580> even<00:05:58.510> it<00:05:58.690> forms<00:05:59.289> new

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
volcanoes and even it forms new

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.709 
volcanoes and even it forms new
mountains<00:06:00.010> science<00:06:00.969> is<00:06:01.180> so<00:06:01.389> cool

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
mountains science is so cool

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.750 
mountains science is so cool
