00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.359
 77 is not very good 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:44.250
 I think he's good, the problem is 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:05:17.669
 capture card as the volume of the 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:05:20.190

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.349

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.550

 for you to notice a 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.729
 little difference 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:41.939
 okay so this is my personal headset 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.849
 how could you see the 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:47.249
 quality of both is almost the same 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.629
 only this one here he is really 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.969
 too much noise 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.859
 if I leave my akiko fan like 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.809
 tavanti was on if I let him 

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:57.959
 fully developed 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:59.249
 sound of the fan and this really 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:02.309
 I can not change 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:04.439

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:07.829

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.789
 It also changes some things but it is not 

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:11.369
 for both 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.959
