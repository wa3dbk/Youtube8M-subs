00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
but not quite new characters that you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
but not quite new characters that you
can<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.659> they<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.140> all<00:01:22.409> silhouetted

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
can see because they are all silhouetted

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.240 
can see because they are all silhouetted
as<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.630> from<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.960> picture<00:01:25.259> so

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
as you can see from this picture so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
as you can see from this picture so
we're<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.460> sure<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.330> friends<00:01:28.320> or

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
we're not sure if they are friends or

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.030 
we're not sure if they are friends or
foes<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:30.200> we're<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.710> wait<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
foes and we're going to have to wait and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.039 
foes and we're going to have to wait and
see<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.310> sleek<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.909> probably<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.780> good

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
see a sleek and probably have a good

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.649 
see a sleek and probably have a good
guess<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> obviously<00:01:36.479> you

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
guess if you want to and obviously you

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.600 
guess if you want to and obviously you
can<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.229> work<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.460> this

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
can kind of work out from this

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.010 
can kind of work out from this
silhouette<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.360> bit<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.840> they're

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
silhouette a little bit what they're

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.219 
silhouette a little bit what they're
going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> look<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:41.899> that's<00:01:42.899> pretty

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
going to look like and that's pretty

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.929 
going to look like and that's pretty
much<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.829> finally<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.520> thought<00:01:44.820> I'd

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
much it just finally I thought I'd

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.080 
much it just finally I thought I'd
mention<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.780> game<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.040> coming<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.970> the
