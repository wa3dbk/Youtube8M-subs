iphone or if you're used to any of those
sorts<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.140> commands<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.489> here<00:02:26.700> we<00:02:26.730> are<00:02:26.910> at<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
sorts of commands so here we are at the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.390 
sorts of commands so here we are at the
lock<00:02:27.239> screen<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:27.660> could<00:02:27.810> slide<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.280> if<00:02:29.280> we

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
lock screen we could slide this if we

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.110 
lock screen we could slide this if we
want<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> switch<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:33.590> silent<00:02:34.819> now<00:02:35.819> once<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
want to switch to silent now once it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.030 
want to switch to silent now once it
actually<00:02:36.150> gets<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> lock<00:02:36.959> screen<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.440> sort

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
actually gets to the lock screen it sort

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040 
actually gets to the lock screen it sort
of<00:02:38.069> takes<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.459> little<00:02:38.580> bit<00:02:38.730> before<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.269> up<00:02:39.420> wakes

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
of takes a little bit before it up wakes

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.630 
of takes a little bit before it up wakes
up<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> speak<00:02:41.220> so

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.250 

so<00:02:48.240> we're<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.569> try<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.780> again<00:02:48.900> just

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so we're going to try it again just

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.880 
so we're going to try it again just
slide<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.710> left

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.929 

so<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.800> can<00:04:58.919> see<00:04:59.099> that<00:04:59.129> it's<00:04:59.430> trying<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.819> load

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
so you can see that it's trying to load

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.149 
so you can see that it's trying to load
google<00:05:00.240> com<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.430> it's<00:05:02.430> slowly<00:05:03.270> getting<00:05:03.539> there

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
google com and it's slowly getting there

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.209 
google com and it's slowly getting there
and<00:05:05.159> there<00:05:05.400> we<00:05:05.520> go<00:05:05.550> we<00:05:05.939> are<00:05:06.090> at<00:05:06.300> google<00:05:06.750> com<00:05:07.219> and

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
and there we go we are at google com and

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.189 
and there we go we are at google com and
let<00:05:08.819> me<00:05:08.879> go<00:05:09.000> ahead<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.180> tap<00:05:09.389> on<00:05:09.509> the<00:05:09.569> news<00:05:09.840> just

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
let me go ahead and tap on the news just

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:20.360 
let me go ahead and tap on the news just
to<00:05:11.389> load<00:05:12.389> another<00:05:12.659> page

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.310 

and<00:05:20.970> there<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:21.300> go<00:05:21.419> so<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.780> internet<00:05:22.139> works

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
and there you go so the internet works

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.350 
and there you go so the internet works
via<00:05:22.650> Wi-Fi<00:05:22.949> it<00:05:23.220> still<00:05:23.550> doesn't<00:05:23.850> work<00:05:23.880> over

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
via Wi-Fi it still doesn't work over

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.950 
via Wi-Fi it still doesn't work over
cellular<00:05:24.960> data<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:26.449> not<00:05:27.449> too<00:05:27.570> big<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:27.870> deal

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
cellular data so not too big of a deal

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.890 
cellular data so not too big of a deal
but<00:05:28.340> overall<00:05:29.340> 2.2<00:05:30.090> is<00:05:30.210> a<00:05:30.240> big<00:05:30.750> improvement

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
but overall 2.2 is a big improvement

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.360 
but overall 2.2 is a big improvement
over<00:05:31.320> 1.6<00:05:33.860> there's<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:34.889> lot<00:05:34.919> of<00:05:35.070> cool<00:05:35.340> things

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
over 1.6 there's a lot of cool things

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.100 
over 1.6 there's a lot of cool things
about<00:05:35.669> it<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:35.940> I<00:05:36.030> like<00:05:36.270> like<00:05:36.510> some<00:05:36.960> of<00:05:37.020> the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
about it that I like like some of the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.469 
about it that I like like some of the
animations<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:37.889> stuff<00:05:38.100> it's<00:05:38.790> rather<00:05:38.970> slow<00:05:39.330> on

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
animations and stuff it's rather slow on

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.030 
animations and stuff it's rather slow on
the<00:05:39.570> phone<00:05:39.780> but<00:05:40.020> if<00:05:40.169> you're<00:05:40.350> on<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:40.530> faster

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
the phone but if you're on a faster

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.590 
the phone but if you're on a faster
device<00:05:41.280> like<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.729> Nexus<00:05:42.270> One<00:05:42.449> it<00:05:42.570> would

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
device like the Nexus One it would

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.350 
device like the Nexus One it would
probably<00:05:42.870> be<00:05:43.229> perfectly<00:05:43.680> smooth<00:05:44.040> so<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.639> like

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
probably be perfectly smooth so I like

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.300 
probably be perfectly smooth so I like
the<00:05:45.389> animation<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:46.050> lot<00:05:46.260> i'm<00:05:47.010> just<00:05:47.100> going<00:05:47.250> to

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
the animation a lot i'm just going to

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.879 
the animation a lot i'm just going to
force<00:05:47.669> quite<00:05:47.970> out<00:05:48.120> of<00:05:50.180> whatever<00:05:51.180> this<00:05:51.449> is<00:05:52.340> I

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
force quite out of whatever this is I

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.840 
force quite out of whatever this is I
don't<00:05:55.889> really<00:05:56.010> know<00:05:56.190> what's<00:05:56.370> happening<00:05:56.820> right

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
don't really know what's happening right

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.580 
don't really know what's happening right
now<00:05:57.000> but

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.260

the<00:06:39.290> iphone<00:06:39.410> 2g<00:06:39.770> am<00:06:40.160> on<00:06:40.370> android<00:06:40.910> 2.2<00:06:41.360> i'm

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
the iphone 2g am on android 2.2 i'm

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.890 
the iphone 2g am on android 2.2 i'm
using<00:06:42.310> dd's<00:06:43.310> colonel<00:06:44.680> and<00:06:46.210> yeah<00:06:47.210> overall

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
using dd's colonel and yeah overall

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.930 
using dd's colonel and yeah overall
everything<00:06:48.140> seems<00:06:48.560> ok<00:06:49.250> it's<00:06:49.550> a<00:06:49.610> little<00:06:49.850> bit

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
everything seems ok it's a little bit

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.570 
everything seems ok it's a little bit
smoother<00:06:50.330> and<00:06:50.540> or<00:06:51.200> not<00:06:51.860> swear<00:06:52.100> it's<00:06:52.310> a<00:06:52.370> little

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
smoother and or not swear it's a little

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.540 
smoother and or not swear it's a little
bit<00:06:52.669> slower<00:06:53.060> than<00:06:53.930> 1.6<00:06:54.830> was<00:06:55.070> on<00:06:55.400> my<00:06:55.910> iphone<00:06:56.300> 2g

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
bit slower than 1.6 was on my iphone 2g

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.490 
bit slower than 1.6 was on my iphone 2g
but<00:06:58.550> it's<00:06:59.240> a<00:06:59.270> lot<00:06:59.419> cooler<00:06:59.630> because<00:06:59.990> you<00:07:00.410> know

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
but it's a lot cooler because you know

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.320 
but it's a lot cooler because you know
you<00:07:00.590> have<00:07:00.770> your<00:07:00.800> video<00:07:01.160> video<00:07:01.669> wallpapers
