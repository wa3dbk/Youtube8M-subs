team<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.030> well<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.869> celtics

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
team have well I think the celtics

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
team have well I think the celtics
literally<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.189> 10<00:01:08.430> deep<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> i<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.210> that
