gonna show you how to convert female
wheels<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.420> male<00:00:12.719> fitment<00:00:13.290> as<00:00:13.410> many<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.889> you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
wheels to male fitment as many of you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.340 
wheels to male fitment as many of you
will<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.340> aware<00:00:14.429> Tamiya<00:00:15.089> kits<00:00:15.420> generally<00:00:16.139> have

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
will be aware Tamiya kits generally have

will be aware Tamiya kits generally have
male<00:00:16.770> type<00:00:17.100> fitment<00:00:17.640> whereas<00:00:18.000> many<00:00:18.180> other

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
male type fitment whereas many other

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.660 
male type fitment whereas many other
makers<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:18.960> female<00:00:19.439> fitment<00:00:19.890> wheels<00:00:20.100> let's

makers use female fitment wheels let's
take<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> look<00:00:21.000> at<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> bits<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.720> pieces<00:00:21.810> you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
take a look at the bits and pieces you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.220 
take a look at the bits and pieces you
will<00:00:22.680> need<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.250> pair<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.699> side<00:00:24.180> cutters<00:00:24.539> some

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
will need a pair of side cutters some

of<00:00:36.210> converting<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> wheel<00:00:36.989> itself<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
of converting the wheel itself is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.549 
of converting the wheel itself is
extremely<00:00:38.070> easy<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:39.180> does<00:00:39.540> however<00:00:39.780> cause<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
extremely easy it does however cause a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.650 
extremely easy it does however cause a
few<00:00:40.950> problems<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.399> assembly<00:00:41.940> later<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.420> in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
few problems with assembly later on in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.990 
few problems with assembly later on in
the<00:00:42.960> build<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.290> Tammi<00:00:43.620> kits<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.100> example<00:00:44.610> so

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the build with Tammi kits for example so

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.639 
the build with Tammi kits for example so
mock-ups<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.050> chassis<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> body

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
mock-ups of the chassis and body

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.380 
mock-ups of the chassis and body
together<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.460> suspension<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.210> place

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
together with the suspension in place

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.029 
together with the suspension in place
are<00:00:48.690> needed<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.230> I'll<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.649> issue<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
are needed but I'll get to that issue a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.740 
are needed but I'll get to that issue a
little<00:00:50.309> bit<00:00:50.399> later<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.180> let's<00:00:51.360> start<00:00:51.600> by

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
little bit later on so let's start by

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680 
little bit later on so let's start by
converting<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.680> wheels<00:00:52.980> first<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> side

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
converting the wheels first use the side

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.569 
converting the wheels first use the side
cutter<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.199> snip<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.649> small<00:00:55.980> piece<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.399> rod

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
cutter to snip a small piece of the rod

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
cutter to snip a small piece of the rod
off<00:00:56.760> remember<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.660> better<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
off remember it's better to have a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
off remember it's better to have a
little<00:00:58.500> bit<00:00:58.590> too<00:00:58.800> much<00:00:58.980> than<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.250> enough<00:00:59.399> as

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
little bit too much than not enough as

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790 
little bit too much than not enough as
you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.059> easily<00:01:00.390> trim<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> end<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> suit<00:01:01.559> your

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you can easily trim the end to suit your

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
you can easily trim the end to suit your
needs<00:01:02.039> later<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.940> grab<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.390> file<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
needs later on then grab your file and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.810 
needs later on then grab your file and
create<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> tapered<00:01:04.799> edge<00:01:04.979> at<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.519> end<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
create a tapered edge at one end of the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.670 
create a tapered edge at one end of the
rod<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.540> don't<00:01:06.689> need<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> remove<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.290> lot<00:01:07.470> but

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
rod you don't need to remove a lot but

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
rod you don't need to remove a lot but
just<00:01:07.710> enough<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.369> able<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.640> securely<00:01:09.150> place

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
just enough to be able to securely place

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
just enough to be able to securely place
the<00:01:09.750> rod<00:01:09.930> inside<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> poly<00:01:10.770> cap<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> that's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the rod inside the poly cap and that's

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 
the rod inside the poly cap and that's
it<00:01:11.820> how<00:01:12.240> easy<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.140> well<00:01:13.860> very<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.340> when

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it how easy was that well very but when

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.980 
it how easy was that well very but when
it<00:01:14.549> comes<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.939> using<00:01:15.210> these<00:01:15.540> newly<00:01:15.840> converted

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it comes to using these newly converted

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.590 
it comes to using these newly converted
wheels<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> Tamia<00:01:17.100> kit<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.970> run<00:01:18.390> into

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
wheels on a Tamia kit you can run into

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.880 
wheels on a Tamia kit you can run into
some<00:01:18.869> problems<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.320> fitment

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
some problems with fitment

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
some problems with fitment
notice<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.580> how<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.820> wheels<00:01:21.060> now<00:01:21.360> stick<00:01:21.689> out

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
notice here how the wheels now stick out

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.080 
notice here how the wheels now stick out
too<00:01:22.049> far<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> brakes<00:01:23.729> have

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
too far this is because the brakes have

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
too far this is because the brakes have
the<00:01:24.330> hub<00:01:24.540> area<00:01:24.840> molded<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:25.950> forcing

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the hub area molded in and are forcing

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
the hub area molded in and are forcing
the<00:01:26.490> wheel<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.880> whereas<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.540> Oshima<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the wheel out whereas I Oshima and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.230 
the wheel out whereas I Oshima and
fujimi<00:01:28.530> kits<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.890> example<00:01:29.310> mostly<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
fujimi kits for example mostly have the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
fujimi kits for example mostly have the
opposite<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> recess<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> wheel<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
opposite with a recess for the wheel to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910 
opposite with a recess for the wheel to
sit<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.299> every<00:01:33.720> kit<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.259> different<00:01:34.799> but

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
sit in now every kit is different but

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.380 
sit in now every kit is different but
the<00:01:35.040> process<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.759> same

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the process is the same

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.960 
the process is the same
the<00:01:36.930> idea<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> replicate<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> brakes<00:01:38.460> from

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the idea is to replicate the brakes from

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.210 
the idea is to replicate the brakes from
those<00:01:39.180> kits<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.810> decrease<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> poke<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
those kits and decrease the poke that
