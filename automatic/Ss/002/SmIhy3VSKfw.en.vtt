00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
in it and somehow it made more

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.240 
in it and somehow it made more
entertaining<00:03:32.510> than<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.930> comic<00:03:33.680> counterpart

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
entertaining than the comic counterpart

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.890

of Civil War which to me was just

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:49.059 
of Civil War which to me was just
unnecessarily<00:03:36.680> boring

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.520
