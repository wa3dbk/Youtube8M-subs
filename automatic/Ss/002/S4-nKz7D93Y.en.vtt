risky<00:02:14.129> but<00:02:14.400> hopefully<00:02:14.940> he<00:02:15.269> can<00:02:15.390> sell<00:02:15.690> for<00:02:15.720> I

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
risky but hopefully he can sell for I

risky but hopefully he can sell for I
think<00:02:16.170> 95k<00:02:16.890> wheel<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.160> try<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.370> put<00:02:17.489> him<00:02:17.580> off

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
think 95k wheel and try and put him off

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.400 
think 95k wheel and try and put him off
for<00:02:17.910> again<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:18.720> really<00:02:18.959> risky<00:02:19.230> especially

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
for again that's really risky especially

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.440 
for again that's really risky especially
because<00:02:19.769> he's<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> striking<00:02:20.400> clear<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> CM<00:02:21.150> so

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
because he's a striking clear to a CM so

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.210 
because he's a striking clear to a CM so
this<00:02:21.870> could<00:02:22.019> go<00:02:22.200> wrong<00:02:22.379> but<00:02:22.590> hopefully<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.099> can

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
this could go wrong but hopefully we can

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.559 
this could go wrong but hopefully we can
get<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.459> profit<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:23.940> him<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.239> he<00:02:24.300> does<00:02:24.450> look

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
get that profit of him and he does look

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.509 
get that profit of him and he does look
at<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> really<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.230> good<00:02:25.410> player<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.099> next

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
at a really really good player and next

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.300 
at a really really good player and next
by<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.910> really<00:02:27.360> good<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.720> Johnson<00:02:28.349> 406

having a bidding war for about ten

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.670 
having a bidding war for about ten
minutes<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.730> from<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.330> 85.5<00:02:33.989> k<00:02:34.319> mark<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.620> he

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
minutes on from the 85.5 k mark and he

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.729

eventually left me alone 106 k and that

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.830 
eventually left me alone 106 k and that
means<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:37.980> can<00:02:38.099> try<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.400> sell<00:02:38.580> him<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.879> 135

right<00:02:57.720> probably<00:02:57.989> not<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:59.069> i<00:02:59.160> think<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.370> one

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
right probably not but i think this one

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.030 
right probably not but i think this one
was<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.700> centre-forward<00:03:00.239> yes<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.200> was<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.890> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
was a centre-forward yes it was and it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.080 
was a centre-forward yes it was and it
because<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.400> picked<00:03:02.579> him<00:03:02.610> for<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.879> price

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
because we picked him for that price

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.490
