00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.260 

it's<00:04:27.240> somewhat<00:04:27.570> better<00:04:27.780> expanded<00:04:28.560> marketing

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
it's somewhat better expanded marketing

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.220 
it's somewhat better expanded marketing
you<00:04:30.270> could<00:04:30.450> hook<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.660> up<00:04:30.900> in<00:04:31.050> your<00:04:31.170> car

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
you could hook it up in your car

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:41.590 
you could hook it up in your car
something<00:04:34.490> explain<00:04:35.490> later

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:57.050 

don't<00:04:42.600> stop<00:04:42.930> fingers<00:04:43.320> on<00:04:43.500> there<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:55.880> go<00:04:56.880> so

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
don't stop fingers on there I go so

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.450 
don't stop fingers on there I go so
basically<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:58.560> is<00:04:58.620> how<00:04:58.770> would<00:04:58.950> you<00:04:59.070> connect

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
basically this is how would you connect

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.750 
basically this is how would you connect
your<00:04:59.670> ps3<00:04:59.970> controller<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:01.830> your<00:05:01.980> tablet<00:05:02.430> and
