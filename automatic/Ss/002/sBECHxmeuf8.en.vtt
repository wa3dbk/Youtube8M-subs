00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello friends and also go central did more 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.210
 a video with his paris garden series 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.769
 Just the cid I joined the game already 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.929
 decided to record this video for you 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 and look at the guys I was attacked one 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.310
 time while I was away while not 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.529
 I was in the game and attacking one here and I 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.410
 won my defense won the opponent 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.150
 who tried to attack me defeat my 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.130
 Fortress, let's see how it goes here. 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.720
 When we attack you will see 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.949
 Look at my destroyed things but 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.380
 they recover 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.120
 right after I come in and of course it's that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 In this video I'll show you how 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.450
 it was this attack of my opponent that I 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.850
 I'll see first hand with you too. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.890
 because this notification only appears on the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.469
 first time you enter the game logo 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 after being attacked so I have not yet seen 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.360
 How was this attack of my 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.190
 opponent here with my love my castle 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.570
 It's like a fortress you can see that I 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.699
 I have already improved my things a lot 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.070
 are improving this wall here that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.289
 moment even I'm just getting better 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.670
 this little bit because I do not have the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.799
 enough stone to be improving 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 everything then slowly I am improving and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.000
 How is that wall going? 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.549
 central here is improved more than 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.650
 those of the open country and of course the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.080
 The place I most want to protect is 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.330
 my fortress there in the background comes 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.790
 My resources are and people will 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.880
 crave so much they will want there it is stealing 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.220
 But let's go then see the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.140
 replay of my defense coming into 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.840
 action here shows everything that guy used 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.090
 heck he used a lot of troops a hero 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.009
 here was not able to collect many 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.860
 resources I can do a rematch 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.340
 Look, just go there and attack him but I will too. 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.799
 I can here watch this battle 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 that he did against my defense is the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.060
 player, blah, blah, blah, blah, babe, you can not 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.229
 see right this huge numbering right 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.180
 Come on then put it here for us. 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.340
 see the reflection was seven minutes ago 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.630
 that he even attacked me in truth 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.189
 I went to get into the game the game me 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.170
 He notified you are being attacked in 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.119
 Wait for a few minutes to 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.950
 Can you come in again? Let's see how. 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.710
 Is he with us? Let's go. 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.299
 analyze how my defense reacted and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.100
 started attacking where he looks only 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.600
 started attacking there 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.010
 an expensive idea because if not attack these 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.870
 things here he will not get much 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.180
 feature you all saw here did not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.070
 much recourse is because this 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.990
 here are just things to build 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.360
 troops such things will not pay 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.460
 so much for him not 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.780
 he came to attack me here O will also not 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.360
 to advance so much because I have so much 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.160
 defense we now that he splintered 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.630
 here in this fire trap including 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.550
 I showed in the previous videos to 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.910
 You look only has an effect camera that 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.040
 it causes in these leftist traps 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.100
 With these weapons time this gun 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.960
 does not do as much damage as she has 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.120
 contacts of the most expensive soldiers 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.070
 When they pass by, do they? 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.110
 do not resist and end up dying 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.040
 Look, my defense is nice now. 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.540
 it's good 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.430
 destroyed the dilma in those lines 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.260
 torriba list but beauty now has this 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.390
 thing that does not catapult it to defend 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.810
 while they are distracted is 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.850
 generating more soldiers there in my 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.470
 business that forgot the name of what is more 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.570
 Look, they just discovered more beauty. 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.940
 the guy has already spent several troops 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.210
 he could comment that 9,000 of food 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.830
 15 thousand of wood and 300 only of stone of 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.180
 me because I always with little stone 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.130
 so he could not steal a lot 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.430
 I really do, and I think if he 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.310
 beat me, it's line 34, damn it 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.740
 would he really win all this? 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.720
 34 or is it from this that 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.490
 It was looking the other way. 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.200
 Look, there are only a few things about him and 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.880
 He got lost, he looks only he lost. 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.170
 crown five crowns that I finished 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.390
 winning as you have seen as soon as I 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.370
 I went below shows all 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.810
 units that he used the quantity 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.350
 of troops he used to attack me 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.990
 also 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.940
 he managed to make 39% did enough 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.950
 arrived close to 50 nÃ© 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.600
 How do you know if he wants 50% of it? 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.190
 already with the battle wins too 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.960
 or if he destroy my fortress 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.930
 then first I showed it to 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.090
 You my defense won, guys. 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.920
 So much happier even when I 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.560
 I enter the game and I see that my defense 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.450
 won generated me profits, because when 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.150
 the defense wins and the raise there my 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.160
 reputation with those crowns that I go 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.230
 winning by reminding the video again 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.920
 I remember you if you play it seems 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.920
 I'm cid 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.510
 add mercenaries alliance here 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.669
 in searching alliances type that 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.739
 mercenaries and it's only you enter a 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.250
 open alliance're you may be seeing 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.260
 match replays 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.270
 I do my brother's uncle philips aek 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.710
 there's another friend of mine here including 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.440
 people are very close to each other. 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.000
 number of crowns nelton in last 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.890
 because we stand there playing and such 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.900
 ends up losing some color or because 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.500
 can not beat someone else then 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.720
 changing our position there in the placement 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.700
 of the alliance most sought by the alliance 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.260
 mercenaries and adds for you to play 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.310
 with us 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.050
 You can have a look here. 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.700
 how does such an empire and 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.440
 Well, I'm going to stay here for her. 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.180

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.870
 I remembered one more thing that I 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.250
 I built here I got a stable 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.620
 people look cool 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.750
 now I can take the knights there to the 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.850
 battle here also build a castle 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.370
 from falling into the source it is being 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.750
 built will still take 14 hours more 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.450
 I builded then I'll have some 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.580
 special units that are going to be very 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.870
 tops you will see soon after I 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.640
 I built here I intend to bring a 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.930
 video for you to see the units that 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.979
 I 'll come because my brother has already 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.290
 built it here 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.690
 he showed in his place will have some 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.910
 troops very but very fucking same 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.370
 stepping into battle and looking at 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.810
 I moved a little too right layout of 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.790
 my strength as a whole is everything 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.860
 a little more concentrated but still 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.750
 I intend to make adjustments in the future to 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.460
 further improve my defense because 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.080
 I told you before, if you liked the video that 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.610
