00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:11.389

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.389

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.180
 the past 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.180
 look at them tgv 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.530
 no one vows you to death 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.530
 Yup

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.480
 no 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.930
 Now 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.050
 today I think so this is it 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.650
 a friendly that sees it so far was 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.210
 We have heard that we are giving the field 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.940
 he says that this seems to me anyway 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.900
 important if not only now tells us 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.140
 what happens is a dream to start 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.660
 well ok it's not important if I did n't know 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.090
 of that story among the strange foo 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.580
 defender in the I knew it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.380
 of the peppe interview I am free is 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.970
 however great respect in the field between 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.900
 you know very well your friends sit 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:35.500
 because prison friends 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:37.570
 teaching will be something else but come on 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.150
 here allies I saw from behind is not one 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.150
 beautiful joke a story goes up 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.170
 then football too 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.420
 you feel it's the umpteenth battle you've won 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.390
 a war this year no 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.070
 according to me with the group in this 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.170
 team with the ministries we work with 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.729
 we always had it well and work hard 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.930
 still this is a battle we must 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.060
 win after I was never 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.440
 I left the first game immediately , I hope so 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.929
 he even had to get to the final 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.860
 we are these companions' goals 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.319
