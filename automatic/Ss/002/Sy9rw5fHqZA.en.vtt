about<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.880> couple<00:00:12.030> hours<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> other<00:00:12.660> day<00:00:13.969> and

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
about a couple hours the other day and

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.140 
about a couple hours the other day and
thought<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.630> rear<00:00:16.080> brakes<00:00:16.410> eased<00:00:16.890> up<00:00:17.150> but

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
thought the rear brakes eased up but

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.500 
thought the rear brakes eased up but
they<00:00:18.840> did<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:22.789> then<00:00:23.789> they<00:00:23.910> got<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> lot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> pad

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
they did not then they got a lot of pad

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.689 
they did not then they got a lot of pad
left<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:25.019> because<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> rear<00:00:26.189> wheel<00:00:26.430> just

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
left on because the rear wheel just

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.250 
left on because the rear wheel just
seized<00:00:27.029> up<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.680> wouldn't<00:00:28.680> go<00:00:28.769> nowhere<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
seized up and wouldn't go nowhere so I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
seized up and wouldn't go nowhere so I
took<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.619> off<00:00:31.769> check<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> brakes<00:00:32.520> brakes<00:00:32.880> were

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
took it off check the brakes brakes were

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:44.680 
took it off check the brakes brakes were
fine<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.440> oh<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.540> ball<00:00:42.809> bearing<00:00:43.260> went<00:00:43.500> out

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
fine and oh the ball bearing went out

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.869 
fine and oh the ball bearing went out
completely<00:00:49.399> it's<00:00:50.399> supposed<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:50.820> like

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
completely it's supposed to look like

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.479 
completely it's supposed to look like
this<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.170> was<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.530> other<00:00:52.710> side

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.470 

it<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> little<00:00:56.789> rough<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:59.149> should<00:01:00.149> put<00:01:00.329> new

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it was a little rough but should put new

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.100 
it was a little rough but should put new
ones<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.299> gonna<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.659> all<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.900> crap

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
cleaned out in here I got a bearing from

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
cleaned out in here I got a bearing from
a<00:01:12.060> weed<00:01:12.240> whacker<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.619> gonna<00:01:13.710> pack<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
a weed whacker I'm just gonna pack it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.870 
a weed whacker I'm just gonna pack it
with<00:01:14.250> grease

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
with grease

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.170 
with grease
throw<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:19.880> yeah<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:20.970> pretty

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
throw it in there yeah that's pretty

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
throw it in there yeah that's pretty
much<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> only<00:01:21.570> bearing<00:01:22.200> 1/2

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
much the only bearing 1/2

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.210 
much the only bearing 1/2
I<00:01:22.950> could<00:01:23.700> probably<00:01:23.790> order<00:01:24.240> some<00:01:25.040> they'll<00:01:26.040> just

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
I could probably order some they'll just

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
I could probably order some they'll just
repack<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.939> grease<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.590> call<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.740> done

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
repack it with grease and call it done

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.240 
repack it with grease and call it done
for<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> while

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.030 

Wow<00:01:37.190> that's<00:01:38.190> terrible

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
Wow that's terrible

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.120 
Wow that's terrible
actually<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:42.320> think<00:01:43.320> they're<00:01:43.590> supposed<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.010> be

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
actually I think they're supposed to be

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:55.760 
actually I think they're supposed to be
bearings<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.910> inside<00:01:45.660> of<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:45.840> -<00:01:48.560> maybe

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:06.200 

no<00:01:56.400> I<00:01:58.070> wouldn't<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.189> so<00:02:04.759> see<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.939> can't

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
no I wouldn't think so see if I can't

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.789 
no I wouldn't think so see if I can't
get<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.479> out<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.689> there<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.080> I'll<00:02:07.590> show<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
get that out of there and I'll show you

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.279 
get that out of there and I'll show you
a<00:02:07.920> little<00:02:08.009> bit<00:02:08.160> more<00:02:08.310> Oh<00:02:08.599> guys<00:02:09.599> they<00:02:10.259> really

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
a little bit more Oh guys they really

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.059 
a little bit more Oh guys they really
don't<00:02:10.800> look<00:02:10.979> good<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> chopper<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:16.069> is

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
don't look good for the chopper that is

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:27.170 
don't look good for the chopper that is
just<00:02:17.459> pretty<00:02:17.819> ate<00:02:18.120> up<00:02:25.340> then<00:02:26.340> what<00:02:26.519> happened<00:02:27.060> as

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
just pretty ate up then what happened as

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.650 
just pretty ate up then what happened as
those<00:02:27.330> bowls<00:02:28.069> went<00:02:29.069> down<00:02:29.250> inside<00:02:29.700> here<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
those bowls went down inside here and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.720 
those bowls went down inside here and
was<00:02:30.780> riding<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.819> against<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:37.400> piece<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.549> pipe

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
was riding up against the piece of pipe

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.449 
was riding up against the piece of pipe
here<00:02:39.200> that's<00:02:40.200> putting<00:02:40.560> grooves<00:02:40.920> into<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:43.459> this

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
here that's putting grooves into it this

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.030 
here that's putting grooves into it this
isn't<00:02:44.760> supposed<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.060> go<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.769> middle

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
isn't supposed to go on in the middle

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.100 
isn't supposed to go on in the middle
here<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.250> act<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> spacer<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.870> could

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
here and act as a spacer so I could

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.009 
here and act as a spacer so I could
probably<00:02:49.290> use<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.540> here's<00:02:51.540> what's<00:02:51.780> left

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
probably use that but here's what's left

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.600 
probably use that but here's what's left
of<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.230> bearing<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:58.769> think<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.190> fits<00:02:59.459> in

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
of the bearing and I think this fits in

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.860 
of the bearing and I think this fits in
there<00:02:59.790> somewhere<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.910> all<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> little<00:03:03.450> balls

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
there somewhere and all the little balls

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.530 
there somewhere and all the little balls
that<00:03:04.230> came<00:03:05.040> out<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.519> there's<00:03:06.299> something

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
that came out of it there's something

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.770 
that came out of it there's something
flying<00:03:07.519> it's<00:03:08.519> two<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.910> them<00:03:11.510> metal<00:03:12.510> shavings

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
flying it's two of them metal shavings

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.960 
flying it's two of them metal shavings
that<00:03:13.109> I<00:03:13.340> poured<00:03:14.340> out<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.640> there<00:03:14.760> -<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:20.760> just

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
that I poured out of there - that just

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:31.790 
that I poured out of there - that just
blows

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.180 

so<00:03:32.910> what<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.000> want<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.240> do<00:03:34.420> is<00:03:34.830> probably<00:03:35.830> get

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
so what I want to do is probably get

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.240 
so what I want to do is probably get
some<00:03:36.340> new<00:03:36.459> bearings<00:03:37.470> well<00:03:38.470> I've<00:03:38.709> decided<00:03:38.860> just

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
some new bearings well I've decided just

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.570 
some new bearings well I've decided just
to<00:03:39.520> go<00:03:40.420> ahead<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.750> get<00:03:40.900> brand<00:03:41.170> new<00:03:41.319> bearings

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:53.970 

so<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.840> way<00:03:53.020> I<00:03:53.050> won't<00:03:53.260> ever<00:03:53.410> happen<00:03:53.650> in<00:03:53.890> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
so this way I won't ever happen in the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.759 
so this way I won't ever happen in the
future<00:03:55.350> when<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.380> dad<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.620> used<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:59.430> 3/4<00:04:00.430> socket

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
this part right here and that little

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.020

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
spacer in there actually

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.750 
spacer in there actually
contacts<00:04:43.840> this<00:04:43.960> piece<00:04:44.560> right<00:04:45.010> here<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:45.580> the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
contacts this piece right here not the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.950 
contacts this piece right here not the
outer<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.360> this<00:04:46.510> piece<00:04:46.750> right<00:04:47.050> here<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:48.960> when

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
outer but this piece right here so when

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.880 
outer but this piece right here so when
you<00:04:50.020> put<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.260> bolt<00:04:50.440> through<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:50.710> like

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
you put the bolt through it like

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
you put the bolt through it like
perfectly<00:04:51.280> sinners<00:04:51.789> it<00:04:55.350> so<00:04:56.350> maybe<00:04:57.160> hopefully

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
perfectly sinners it so maybe hopefully

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.050 
perfectly sinners it so maybe hopefully
it<00:04:58.210> won't<00:04:58.300> wear<00:04:59.020> down<00:04:59.229> that<00:04:59.500> bearing<00:05:00.060> because

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
it won't wear down that bearing because

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.880 
it won't wear down that bearing because
of<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.360> is<00:05:01.600> all<00:05:02.169> screwed<00:05:02.650> up<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:05.200> maybe<00:05:05.710> it's

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
of this is all screwed up so maybe it's

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.140 
of this is all screwed up so maybe it's
supposed<00:05:06.130> to<00:05:06.190> be<00:05:06.340> like<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:06.669> I<00:05:06.729> have<00:05:06.970> no<00:05:07.120> idea

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
supposed to be like that I have no idea

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.630 
supposed to be like that I have no idea
