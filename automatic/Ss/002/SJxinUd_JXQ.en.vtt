00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
so go take a look at that one if you

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.619 
so go take a look at that one if you
haven't<00:00:37.920> seen<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.210> kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.239> goes<00:00:39.390> over<00:00:39.510> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
haven't seen it kind of goes over that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720 
haven't seen it kind of goes over that
so<00:00:40.410> today<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:40.890> making<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.190> headboard<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730

so today we're making the headboard and
then<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:41.969> part<00:00:42.180> three<00:00:42.540> you'll<00:00:42.719> probably

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
then in part three you'll probably

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.450 
then in part three you'll probably
assembly<00:00:43.440> put<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.739> together<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.219> put<00:00:44.370> in

the room so that way you guys can see it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.900 
the room so that way you guys can see it
so<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> headboard<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.489> kind<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
so for the headboard I kind of got a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.139 
so for the headboard I kind of got a
plan<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:48.660> head<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.140> we'll<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:49.440> over<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
plan in my head and we'll go over that

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.189 
plan in my head and we'll go over that
should<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.210> pretty<00:00:51.420> straightforward<00:00:51.750> pretty

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
should be pretty straightforward pretty

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
should be pretty straightforward pretty
simple<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.879> were<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
simple I think if I were to do on a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.590 
simple I think if I were to do on a
scale<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> five<00:00:55.940> one<00:00:56.940> being<00:00:57.149> easy<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
scale of one to five one being easy and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
scale of one to five one being easy and
five<00:00:57.809> being<00:00:58.170> difficult<00:00:58.579> I'm<00:00:59.579> gonna<00:00:59.760> give<00:00:59.879> this

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
five being difficult I'm gonna give this

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.959 
five being difficult I'm gonna give this
one<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> three<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> half<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.609> I'll<00:01:02.730> show<00:01:02.940> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
one a three and a half and I'll show you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.719 
one a three and a half and I'll show you
why<00:01:03.239> later<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.750> we're<00:01:04.140> gonna<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> little

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
why later on we're gonna do a little

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
why later on we're gonna do a little
trickery<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.060> cutting<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.110> pieces<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.710> wood

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
trickery and cutting some pieces of wood

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.320 
trickery and cutting some pieces of wood
I'll<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.790> kind<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> give<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> little

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
I'll just kind of give it a little

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.469 
I'll just kind of give it a little
design<00:01:09.900> now<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.920> we'll<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.159> over<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.000> now

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
design now so we'll go over that so now

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.760 
design now so we'll go over that so now
let's<00:01:12.750> go<00:01:12.900> over<00:01:13.080> our<00:01:13.110> tool<00:01:13.439> list

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.830 

all<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.009> tool<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.790> part<00:01:18.150> wise<00:01:18.299> was<00:01:18.600> kind

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
all right so tool and part wise was kind

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.450 
all right so tool and part wise was kind
of<00:01:18.900> pretty<00:01:19.229> much<00:01:19.350> basic<00:01:19.740> stuff<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.310> used

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
of pretty much basic stuff that we used

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
of pretty much basic stuff that we used
in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> first<00:01:20.909> video<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.600> everything<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.470> see

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
in the first video I everything you see

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.060 
in the first video I everything you see
behind<00:01:22.860> me<00:01:23.930> wood<00:01:24.930> wise<00:01:25.170> you'll<00:01:25.590> need<00:01:25.830> two

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
behind me wood wise you'll need two

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.460 
behind me wood wise you'll need two
eight<00:01:26.880> foot<00:01:27.270> long<00:01:27.299> two<00:01:27.780> by<00:01:27.900> fours<00:01:28.170> these<00:01:28.350> are

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
eight foot long two by fours these are

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.039 
eight foot long two by fours these are
the<00:01:28.590> kiln<00:01:28.860> dried<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.400> well<00:01:29.670> I've<00:01:30.600> already<00:01:30.840> cut

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the kiln dried as well I've already cut

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.170 
the kiln dried as well I've already cut
and<00:01:31.229> put<00:01:31.560> those<00:01:31.740> sanded<00:01:32.579> those<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:32.880> clean

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and put those sanded those down clean

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450 
and put those sanded those down clean
them<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.020> I'll<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.439> over<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> sizes<00:01:35.220> later

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
them up and I'll go over the sizes later

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.539 
them up and I'll go over the sizes later
on<00:01:35.900> we<00:01:36.900> also<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.409> using<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> quarter<00:01:38.369> inch

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
on we also will be using a quarter inch

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.640 
on we also will be using a quarter inch
piece<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> MDF<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:40.079> I'll<00:01:40.229> show<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
piece of MDF and I'll show you that

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.030 
piece of MDF and I'll show you that
later<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.340> well<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.020> think<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.890> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
later on as well I think that is it if I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.469 
later on as well I think that is it if I
come<00:01:44.250> across<00:01:44.340> anything<00:01:44.820> I'll<00:01:45.119> let<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.329> guys

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
come across anything I'll let you guys

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.350 
come across anything I'll let you guys
know<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.430> should<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.850> squared

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
know but I think we should be squared

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
of did a little test one and it was just

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.260 
of did a little test one and it was just
gonna<00:05:02.410> take<00:05:02.650> too<00:05:02.800> much<00:05:02.949> time<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.639> I'm<00:05:03.820> gonna

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
brick effect and I just cut a bunch of

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.520 
brick effect and I just cut a bunch of
pieces<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.970> kind<00:05:13.150> of<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:14.110> sit<00:05:14.229> in<00:05:14.320> there
