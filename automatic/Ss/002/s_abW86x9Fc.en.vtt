the wet handling circuit it's much more
difficult<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.809> call<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.500> sometimes<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.160> find

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
difficult to call so sometimes you find

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.729 
difficult to call so sometimes you find

about<00:01:07.900> power

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
about power

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.530 
about power
there's<00:01:08.890> really<00:01:09.040> only<00:01:09.130> one<00:01:09.310> straight<00:01:09.970> and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
there's really only one straight and

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.630 
there's really only one straight and
even<00:01:10.630> that's<00:01:10.930> not<00:01:11.080> too<00:01:11.320> long<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:12.190> most<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.550> the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
even that's not too long and most of the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.190 
even that's not too long and most of the
speed<00:01:13.330> levels<00:01:13.600> are<00:01:13.690> pretty<00:01:13.780> consistent

you're<00:01:14.860> just<00:01:15.010> going<00:01:15.190> from<00:01:15.310> one<00:01:15.520> corner

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
you're just going from one corner

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.120 
you're just going from one corner
straight<00:01:16.450> into<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.750> next<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.770> something<00:01:18.100> like

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
straight into the next so something like

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.969 
straight into the next so something like
this<00:01:18.400> now<00:01:18.820> db10<00:01:19.540> just<00:01:20.050> really<00:01:20.530> get<00:01:20.650> a<00:01:20.680> chance

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
this now db10 just really get a chance

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.090 
this now db10 just really get a chance
to<00:01:21.190> stretch<00:01:21.729> its<00:01:21.940> legs<00:01:22.440> so<00:01:23.440> we're<00:01:23.590> coming<00:01:23.830> onto

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
to stretch its legs so we're coming onto

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.820 
to stretch its legs so we're coming onto
the<00:01:24.190> main<00:01:24.430> straight<00:01:24.460> now<00:01:25.170> third<00:01:26.170> gear<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:26.710> the

that's<00:01:30.260> 80<00:01:33.010> 1995<00:01:34.010> before<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.700> braces<00:01:36.310> now

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
that's 80 1995 before the braces now

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.460 
that's 80 1995 before the braces now
this<00:01:37.670> isn't<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:38.000> very<00:01:38.120> smooth<00:01:38.510> perfect<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.260> get

patch of a standing water which makes it
a<00:01:42.050> really<00:01:42.260> good<00:01:42.590> test<00:01:42.860> for<00:01:43.610> how<00:01:43.730> a<00:01:43.760> car<00:01:44.060> is

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
a really good test for how a car is

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.030 
a really good test for how a car is
going<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.360> perform<00:01:44.660> out<00:01:44.930> there<00:01:45.230> in<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.830> real

can<00:01:52.040> struggle<00:01:52.450> when<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.540> get<00:01:53.720> standing<00:01:54.140> water

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
can struggle when you get standing water

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.340 
can struggle when you get standing water
especially<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.460> braking<00:01:55.820> area

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.990 
it looks deceptively easy but it's
actually<00:02:11.930> off<00:02:12.050> camber<00:02:12.530> from<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.860> apex<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:13.940> you

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
actually off camber from the apex so you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.160 
actually off camber from the apex so you
go<00:02:14.209> into<00:02:14.360> hot<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.959> mean<00:02:15.320> all<00:02:15.800> sorts<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.310> trouble

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
so how come this 15 there's a bounce

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.830 
well ready sound of the circuit really
because<00:03:34.730> we<00:03:34.849> said<00:03:35.090> this<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.390> not<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.569> power

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
just comes out of the fact that in wet
