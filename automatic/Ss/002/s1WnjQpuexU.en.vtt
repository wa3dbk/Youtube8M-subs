00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.670 

hello<00:00:14.520> children<00:00:15.180> here<00:00:15.600> from<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> CeCe<00:00:16.290> here

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
hello children here from the CeCe here

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
hello children here from the CeCe here
today<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> tell<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.490> about<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.849> differences

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
today to tell you about the differences

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.260 
today to tell you about the differences
between<00:00:18.410> 32-bit<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.560> 64-bit<00:00:20.029> this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.150> my

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
between 32-bit and 64-bit this is my

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.089 
between 32-bit and 64-bit this is my
third<00:00:21.540> video<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.259> subject<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.950> other

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
third video on this subject the other

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.889 
third video on this subject the other
two<00:00:23.340> were<00:00:23.460> pretty<00:00:23.670> successful<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.689> thought

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:24.899 
two were pretty successful but I thought

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.330 
two were pretty successful but I thought
a<00:00:24.960> third<00:00:25.230> revision<00:00:25.470> would<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.829> nice<00:00:26.040> to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
a third revision would be nice to

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.830 
a third revision would be nice to
provide<00:00:26.610> some<00:00:26.820> more<00:00:26.849> information<00:00:27.149> and<00:00:27.599> answer

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
provide some more information and answer

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.780 
provide some more information and answer
some<00:00:27.989> more<00:00:28.050> questions<00:00:28.279> because<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.430> have<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.579> lot

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
some more questions because I have a lot

16 exabytes now Ram is important because

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380 
16 exabytes now Ram is important because
it<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.860> send<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.220> receive<00:01:53.250> data<00:01:53.760> faster<00:01:54.240> than

a 64-bit processor and a 64-bit
operating<00:02:45.340> system<00:02:46.230> we'll<00:02:47.230> get<00:02:47.350> more<00:02:47.500> into

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
operating system we'll get more into

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.480 
operating system we'll get more into
that<00:02:47.710> in<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.920> bit<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.990> speed<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.680> important<00:02:51.190> with

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
that in a bit so speed is important with

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.180 
that in a bit so speed is important with
64-bit<00:02:52.110> helping<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.380> computer<00:02:53.710> run<00:02:53.860> faster

64-bit helping the computer run faster

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.590 
64-bit helping the computer run faster
with<00:02:54.280> more<00:02:54.490> RAM<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.820> important<00:02:55.210> too<00:02:55.330> but<00:02:55.510> it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
with more RAM is important too but it

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.140 
with more RAM is important too but it
can<00:02:55.660> also<00:02:55.900> do<00:02:56.230> computation<00:02:57.220> up<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.670> two<00:02:57.880> times

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
can also do computation up to two times

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.290 
can also do computation up to two times
as<00:02:58.390> fast<00:02:58.590> compared<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.650> 32-bit<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.910> that's<00:03:01.090> why

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
as fast compared to 32-bit so that's why

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.060 
as fast compared to 32-bit so that's why
apps<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.140> Final<00:03:02.440> Cut<00:03:02.530> Pro<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.980> Adobe

Premiere Pro big video editors when they

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.680 
Premiere Pro big video editors when they
move<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.160> 64-bit<00:03:06.790> which<00:03:07.090> they<00:03:07.240> already<00:03:07.360> have

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
move to 64-bit which they already have

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.900 
move to 64-bit which they already have
it's<00:03:07.990> really<00:03:08.290> nice<00:03:08.500> because<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:09.040> can<00:03:09.070> work

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
it's really nice because you can work

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.430 
it's really nice because you can work
with<00:03:10.090> larger<00:03:10.420> projects<00:03:10.960> you<00:03:11.080> can<00:03:11.110> render

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
with larger projects you can render

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.950 
with larger projects you can render
things<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.830> lot<00:03:11.980> faster<00:03:12.490> that<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.240> why<00:03:13.360> 64-bit

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
things a lot faster that is why 64-bit

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.300 
things a lot faster that is why 64-bit
is<00:03:14.050> really<00:03:14.290> nice<00:03:14.470> for<00:03:15.070> bigger<00:03:15.250> applications

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
is really nice for bigger applications

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.400 
is really nice for bigger applications
now<00:03:18.310> with<00:03:18.520> 32-bit<00:03:19.060> there<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.630> actually<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.110> way

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
now with 32-bit there is actually a way

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.920 
now with 32-bit there is actually a way
you<00:03:20.470> can<00:03:20.830> get<00:03:21.070> more<00:03:21.490> ram<00:03:22.000> registered<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
you can get more ram registered in the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.410 
you can get more ram registered in the
system<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.770> can<00:03:23.800> have<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.190> 32-bit<00:03:24.820> processor

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
system you can have a 32-bit processor

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.390 
system you can have a 32-bit processor
but<00:03:26.050> if<00:03:26.140> you're<00:03:26.260> 32-bit<00:03:26.770> processor<00:03:27.250> has

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
but if you're 32-bit processor has

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.920 
but if you're 32-bit processor has
something<00:03:27.730> called<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:28.150> physical<00:03:28.720> address

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
something called a physical address

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.590 
something called a physical address
extension<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.010> eliminate<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.640> 3.25

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
extension you can eliminate that 3.25

extension you can eliminate that 3.25
gigabyte<00:03:32.170> ram<00:03:32.830> cap<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:34.090> you'll<00:03:34.300> still<00:03:34.480> only

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
have 32 bit speed but you can actually

ones<00:03:46.270> here<00:03:46.660> if<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:47.140> see<00:03:47.350> something<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.680> says

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
ones here if you see something that says

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.820 
ones here if you see something that says
x86<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.940> refers<00:03:49.270> to<00:03:49.480> 32-bit<00:03:50.020> instructions

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
x86 that refers to 32-bit instructions

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.750 
x86 that refers to 32-bit instructions
if<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.730> see<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.000> say<00:03:52.290> x86<00:03:53.290> -<00:03:53.620> 64<00:03:54.220> that

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
if you see it say x86 - 64 that

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.910 
if you see it say x86 - 64 that
typically<00:03:55.209> refers<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.540> 64-bit<00:03:56.230> instructions

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
typically refers to 64-bit instructions

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.440 
typically refers to 64-bit instructions
and<00:03:57.130> if<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:57.910> see<00:03:58.120> AMD<00:03:58.690> 64<00:03:59.200> or<00:03:59.739> Intel<00:04:00.220> 64<00:04:00.610> that

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
and if you see AMD 64 or Intel 64 that

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.690 
and if you see AMD 64 or Intel 64 that
refers<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.900> 64-bit<00:04:02.440> specifically<00:04:03.280> with<00:04:03.489> those

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
refers to 64-bit specifically with those

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.030 
refers to 64-bit specifically with those
CPUs<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:04.870> if<00:04:05.020> you're<00:04:05.170> wondering<00:04:05.560> if<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.800> have

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
CPUs so if you're wondering if you have

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.160 
CPUs so if you're wondering if you have
a<00:04:06.070> 64-bit<00:04:06.760> processor<00:04:06.820> just<00:04:07.750> look<00:04:07.900> up<00:04:08.020> your

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
a 64-bit processor just look up your

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.470 
a 64-bit processor just look up your
processor<00:04:08.620> type<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.160> it'll<00:04:09.940> either<00:04:10.060> tell<00:04:10.360> you

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
processor type and it'll either tell you

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.720 
processor type and it'll either tell you
directly<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:11.080> it's<00:04:11.200> 32-bit<00:04:11.739> or<00:04:11.860> 64-bit<00:04:11.890> or

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
directly that it's 32-bit or 64-bit or

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.880 
directly that it's 32-bit or 64-bit or
it<00:04:13.090> will<00:04:13.209> say<00:04:13.390> something<00:04:13.750> like<00:04:13.870> this<00:04:14.110> for

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
it will say something like this for

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.490 
it will say something like this for
example<00:04:14.950> if<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.520> says<00:04:15.730> AMD<00:04:16.150> 64<00:04:16.359> you're<00:04:17.260> good<00:04:17.410> to

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
example if it says AMD 64 you're good to

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.740 
example if it says AMD 64 you're good to
go<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:17.830> have<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:17.980> 64-bit<00:04:18.489> processor<00:04:18.609> so<00:04:19.600> if<00:04:19.690> you

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
go you have a 64-bit processor so if you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.060 
go you have a 64-bit processor so if you
got<00:04:19.840> an<00:04:19.989> older<00:04:20.200> computer<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.650> you're<00:04:20.739> not<00:04:20.890> too

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
got an older computer and you're not too

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.940 
got an older computer and you're not too
sure<00:04:21.180> just<00:04:22.180> keep<00:04:22.360> an<00:04:22.480> eye<00:04:22.600> out<00:04:22.630> for<00:04:23.020> words<00:04:23.830> like

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
sure just keep an eye out for words like

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.110 
sure just keep an eye out for words like
these<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.580> then<00:04:25.390> you'll<00:04:25.540> know<00:04:25.750> what<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.530> is

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
these and then you'll know what it is

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.190 
these and then you'll know what it is
another<00:04:28.120> example<00:04:28.690> if<00:04:28.780> you're<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.930> Mac<00:04:29.169> user

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
another example if you're a Mac user

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.529 
another example if you're a Mac user
it's<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:30.220> little<00:04:30.490> bit<00:04:30.610> easier<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:31.060> tell<00:04:31.270> if<00:04:31.300> you

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
it's a little bit easier to tell if you

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.540 
it's a little bit easier to tell if you
have<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.720> 64-bit<00:04:32.229> computer<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.130> believe

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
have a 64-bit computer because I believe

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.510 
have a 64-bit computer because I believe
most<00:04:33.940> machine

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
most machine

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.300 
most machine
after<00:04:34.819> 2006<00:04:35.509> for<00:04:35.660> 64-bit<00:04:36.379> but<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.009> can<00:04:37.129> still

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
after 2006 for 64-bit but you can still

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.180 
after 2006 for 64-bit but you can still
check<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.940> processor<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:38.720> see<00:04:39.259> so<00:04:39.770> any<00:04:39.949> Mac

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
check the processor and see so any Mac

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.480 
check the processor and see so any Mac
with<00:04:40.340> an<00:04:40.460> Intel<00:04:40.789> Core<00:04:41.060> 2<00:04:41.090> Duo<00:04:41.300> or<00:04:41.810> higher<00:04:42.110> is

the<00:05:33.860> two<00:05:34.039> big<00:05:34.430> things<00:05:34.699> are<00:05:35.030> virtually

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
the two big things are virtually

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.300 
the two big things are virtually
unlimited<00:05:35.930> RAM<00:05:36.349> support<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.069> you<00:05:37.129> get<00:05:37.250> to

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
unlimited RAM support so you get to

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.740 
unlimited RAM support so you get to
shove<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.639> bunch<00:05:37.789> of<00:05:37.940> RAM<00:05:38.090> in<00:05:38.240> your<00:05:38.270> system<00:05:38.719> but

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
shove a bunch of RAM in your system but

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.420 
shove a bunch of RAM in your system but
remember<00:05:39.199> not<00:05:39.380> all<00:05:39.500> systems<00:05:39.740> can<00:05:40.099> support

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
remember not all systems can support

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.550 
remember not all systems can support
that<00:05:41.000> much<00:05:41.180> ram<00:05:41.389> obviously<00:05:41.930> some<00:05:42.199> can't<00:05:42.409> even

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
that much ram obviously some can't even

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.309 
that much ram obviously some can't even
support<00:05:42.949> a<00:05:43.099> mere<00:05:43.759> 16<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.750> depends<00:05:45.110> on<00:05:45.169> your

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
support a mere 16 it depends on your

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.080 
support a mere 16 it depends on your
motherboard<00:05:45.680> as<00:05:45.979> well<00:05:46.190> because<00:05:46.669> some<00:05:46.880> older

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
motherboard as well because some older

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.850 
motherboard as well because some older
computers<00:05:47.539> that<00:05:47.659> are<00:05:47.719> 64-bit<00:05:48.530> may<00:05:48.710> only

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
computers that are 64-bit may only

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.249 
computers that are 64-bit may only
support<00:05:49.310> four<00:05:49.550> gigs<00:05:49.789> of<00:05:49.909> RAM<00:05:50.029> some<00:05:50.750> like<00:05:51.050> my

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
support four gigs of RAM some like my

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.709 
support four gigs of RAM some like my
computer<00:05:51.620> may<00:05:51.949> only<00:05:52.130> support<00:05:52.520> 16<00:05:53.000> and<00:05:53.240> 16<00:05:53.599> is<00:05:53.659> a

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
computer may only support 16 and 16 is a

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.390 
computer may only support 16 and 16 is a
lot<00:05:53.930> don't<00:05:54.229> get<00:05:54.349> me<00:05:54.440> wrong<00:05:54.469> but<00:05:55.159> make<00:05:55.370> sure

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
lot don't get me wrong but make sure

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.980 
lot don't get me wrong but make sure
your<00:05:55.729> motherboard<00:05:56.060> can<00:05:56.330> actually<00:05:56.659> hold<00:05:56.900> that

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
your motherboard can actually hold that

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.719 
your motherboard can actually hold that
much<00:05:57.229> RAM<00:05:57.529> so<00:05:58.130> there's<00:05:58.310> a<00:05:58.370> couple<00:05:58.520> more

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
much RAM so there's a couple more

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.969 
much RAM so there's a couple more
factors<00:05:59.120> to<00:05:59.240> consider<00:05:59.330> so<00:06:00.229> that's<00:06:00.409> one<00:06:00.680> pro

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
factors to consider so that's one pro

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.459 
factors to consider so that's one pro
and<00:06:01.219> the<00:06:01.580> other<00:06:01.729> big<00:06:02.000> Pro<00:06:02.300> here<00:06:02.630> is<00:06:02.779> faster

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469 
and the other big Pro here is faster

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.100 
and the other big Pro here is faster
computation<00:06:03.979> so<00:06:04.729> overall<00:06:05.060> it<00:06:05.539> just<00:06:05.750> makes

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
computation so overall it just makes

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.260 
computation so overall it just makes
things<00:06:06.289> faster<00:06:06.560> by<00:06:07.219> allowing<00:06:07.610> more<00:06:07.729> RAM<00:06:08.000> and

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
things faster by allowing more RAM and

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.589 
things faster by allowing more RAM and
faster<00:06:08.750> computation<00:06:10.000> so<00:06:11.000> next<00:06:11.270> time<00:06:11.419> you're

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
faster computation so next time you're

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.820 
faster computation so next time you're
wondering<00:06:11.930> what's<00:06:12.110> the<00:06:12.229> difference<00:06:12.529> between

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
wondering what's the difference between

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.409 
wondering what's the difference between
these<00:06:12.919> two<00:06:13.159> you<00:06:13.639> now<00:06:13.759> know<00:06:13.969> those<00:06:14.150> pretty

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
these two you now know those pretty

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.820 
these two you now know those pretty
basic<00:06:14.630> differences<00:06:15.289> and<00:06:15.500> you<00:06:15.560> know<00:06:15.680> the

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
basic differences and you know the

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.029 
basic differences and you know the
advantages<00:06:16.460> about<00:06:17.210> 64-bit<00:06:18.199> and<00:06:18.440> how<00:06:18.620> it<00:06:18.889> is

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
advantages about 64-bit and how it is

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.820 
advantages about 64-bit and how it is
better<00:06:19.520> than<00:06:20.000> 32-bit<00:06:20.750> when<00:06:21.169> it<00:06:21.259> comes<00:06:21.469> to

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
better than 32-bit when it comes to

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.159 
better than 32-bit when it comes to
speed<00:06:22.190> I<00:06:22.370> hope<00:06:23.090> you<00:06:23.210> enjoyed<00:06:23.509> this<00:06:23.690> I<00:06:23.870> hope<00:06:24.020> you

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
speed I hope you enjoyed this I hope you

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.330 
speed I hope you enjoyed this I hope you
