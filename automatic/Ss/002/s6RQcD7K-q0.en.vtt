00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
sense and it was in the middle of the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.139 
sense and it was in the middle of the
night<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.219> don't<00:00:47.460> know<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.879> was<00:00:48.000> like

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
night so I don't know if it was like

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.299 
night so I don't know if it was like
they<00:00:48.329> were<00:00:48.360> doing<00:00:48.539> some<00:00:48.780> sort<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> update<00:00:49.309> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
their main service and figured it would

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.520

be<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.200> cheap<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.830> know<00:02:06.370> like<00:02:06.700> buying<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.540> car

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
be so cheap you know like buying a car

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.300 
be so cheap you know like buying a car
for<00:02:08.200> example<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.800> wouldn't<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
for example you wouldn't have the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.100 
for example you wouldn't have the
sunroof<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:10.000> leather<00:02:10.210> seats<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.780> heated

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
sunroof the leather seats the heated

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.930 
sunroof the leather seats the heated
seats<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:12.810> AC<00:02:13.830> even<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.280> know<00:02:15.400> stuff<00:02:15.820> like

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
seats the AC even you know stuff like

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.180 
seats the AC even you know stuff like
that<00:02:16.060> those<00:02:16.540> are<00:02:16.690> all<00:02:16.780> options<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.950> maybe

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
that those are all options and maybe

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.460 
that those are all options and maybe
that's<00:02:18.459> how<00:02:18.720> freedompop<00:02:19.720> strips<00:02:20.110> down<00:02:20.260> their

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
that's how freedompop strips down their

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.230 
that's how freedompop strips down their
service<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.190> way<00:02:21.340> they<00:02:21.580> can<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.150> be

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
service that way they can get it to be

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.190 
service that way they can get it to be
so<00:02:22.420> cheap<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.810> don't<00:02:22.990> know<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.959> I'm<00:02:26.050> going<00:02:26.170> to

rid of a lot of the native google
related<00:03:03.959> apps<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.680> load<00:03:07.950> what<00:03:08.250> you

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
want to use so if you like google maps

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.670 
want to use so if you like google maps
for<00:03:10.440> example<00:03:11.660> you're<00:03:12.660> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> go<00:03:13.050> download

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
for example you're going to go download

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.670 
for example you're going to go download
that<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.970> wasn't<00:03:15.360> on<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.840> phone<00:03:16.050> they<00:03:16.410> pulled

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that it wasn't on the phone they pulled

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.280 
that it wasn't on the phone they pulled
it<00:03:16.800> off<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.819> i<00:03:17.849> used<00:03:18.150> nav<00:03:18.420> me<00:03:18.690> which<00:03:18.959> was<00:03:19.140> really

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
it off so i used nav me which was really

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.930 
it off so i used nav me which was really
cool<00:03:19.590> because<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:20.250> was<00:03:20.340> my<00:03:20.370> preferred<00:03:20.790> one

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
cool because that was my preferred one

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.780 
cool because that was my preferred one
anyway<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:22.290> was<00:03:22.410> really<00:03:22.680> annoying<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.610> just

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
anyway it was really annoying it's just

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.530 
anyway it was really annoying it's just
taught<00:03:23.940> me<00:03:24.090> their<00:03:24.239> safety<00:03:24.569> kit

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.890 

so<00:03:29.579> now<00:03:30.579> if<00:03:30.939> I<00:03:31.060> click<00:03:31.120> on<00:03:31.420> something<00:03:31.659> that

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
so now if I click on something that

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.240 
so now if I click on something that
would<00:03:32.049> would<00:03:32.379> have<00:03:32.439> taken<00:03:32.620> me<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:32.950> google<00:03:33.219> maps

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
would would have taken me to google maps

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.339 
would would have taken me to google maps
before<00:03:33.719> and<00:03:34.719> then<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.900> would<00:03:35.079> have<00:03:35.170> had<00:03:35.260> to

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
before and then I would have had to

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.770 
before and then I would have had to
punch<00:03:35.590> out<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:35.890> go<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.010> NAV<00:03:36.280> me<00:03:36.519> now<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.750> just

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
punch out and go to NAV me now it just

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.530 
punch out and go to NAV me now it just
loads<00:03:38.079> up<00:03:38.290> mapping<00:03:38.680> wrecked<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.670> what's<00:03:40.299> great

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
loads up mapping wrecked so what's great

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.190 
loads up mapping wrecked so what's great
is<00:03:40.719> they<00:03:41.170> didn't<00:03:41.439> try<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.709> make<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.069> like<00:03:42.459> a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
is they didn't try to make it like a

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.569 
is they didn't try to make it like a
serve<00:03:44.200> everybody<00:03:44.590> with<00:03:44.980> all<00:03:45.159> kinds<00:03:45.519> of

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
serve everybody with all kinds of

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.059 
serve everybody with all kinds of
 for<00:03:46.209> software<00:03:46.900> stuff<00:03:47.170> they<00:03:47.799> pulled

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
 for software stuff they pulled

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.949 
 for software stuff they pulled
everything<00:03:48.400> off<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.180> was<00:03:49.329> stripped<00:03:49.720> clean

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
everything off so it was stripped clean

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.979 
everything off so it was stripped clean
and<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.769> had<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.310> basic<00:03:51.819> stuff<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.689> there<00:03:52.840> you

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
and it had the basic stuff on there you

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.410 
and it had the basic stuff on there you
have<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.349> think<00:03:53.379> that<00:03:54.099> they<00:03:54.189> give<00:03:54.340> dropbox<00:03:54.939> and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
have I think that they give dropbox and

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.990 
have I think that they give dropbox and
a<00:03:55.799> handful<00:03:56.799> of<00:03:56.859> other<00:03:57.099> stuff<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.790> then

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
a handful of other stuff and then

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.039 
a handful of other stuff and then
anything<00:03:58.359> else<00:03:58.629> you<00:03:58.840> load<00:03:59.049> is<00:03:59.230> on<00:03:59.260> you<00:03:59.970> which

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
anything else you load is on you which

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.839 
anything else you load is on you which
that's<00:04:02.049> great<00:04:02.590> because<00:04:02.889> now<00:04:03.069> i<00:04:03.220> only<00:04:03.489> have<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
that's great because now i only have the

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.059 
that's great because now i only have the
stuff<00:04:04.060> i<00:04:04.209> want<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.599> on<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.739> part<00:04:06.010> is

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
really nice as far as the coverage map I

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.099 
really nice as far as the coverage map I
have<00:04:11.919> yet<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.280> drop<00:04:12.909> service<00:04:13.450> other<00:04:13.810> than<00:04:14.049> that

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
have yet to drop service other than that

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.050 
have yet to drop service other than that
three<00:04:14.530> or<00:04:14.620> four<00:04:14.799> hour<00:04:14.919> period<00:04:15.040> where<00:04:15.579> it<00:04:15.909> was

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
three or four hour period where it was

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.220 
three or four hour period where it was
just<00:04:16.389> arbitrarily<00:04:17.049> rejecting<00:04:17.799> calls

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.420

mountains east of gold bar today and I'm
going<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.330> see<00:04:26.480> how<00:04:26.600> far<00:04:26.630> out<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.260> coverage

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
going to see how far out the coverage

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.800 
going to see how far out the coverage
map<00:04:27.590> goes<00:04:28.070> I've<00:04:28.880> taken<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.210> out<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.450> tinkham

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
map goes I've taken it out to tinkham

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.420 
map goes I've taken it out to tinkham
road<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.500> still<00:04:30.710> covers<00:04:30.860> there<00:04:31.160> but<00:04:31.340> I'd

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
road and it still covers there but I'd

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.800 
road and it still covers there but I'd
like<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.610> do<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.880> proper<00:04:32.390> road<00:04:32.750> trip<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:35.360> see

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
like to do a proper road trip and see

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.930 
like to do a proper road trip and see
what<00:04:36.020> kind<00:04:36.230> of<00:04:36.260> coverage<00:04:36.440> map<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.400> has<00:04:37.610> along

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
what kind of coverage map it has along

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.660 
what kind of coverage map it has along
the<00:04:38.090> highway<00:04:38.570> now<00:04:39.160> if<00:04:40.160> you're<00:04:40.370> using<00:04:41.260> nav<00:04:42.260> me

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
the highway now if you're using nav me

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.570 
the highway now if you're using nav me
you<00:04:43.670> know<00:04:43.790> obviously<00:04:44.150> need<00:04:45.580> connectivity

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
you know obviously need connectivity

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.680 
you know obviously need connectivity
with<00:04:46.850> cell<00:04:47.390> phone<00:04:47.600> towers<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.890> could<00:04:49.010> just

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
with cell phone towers you could just

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.180 
with cell phone towers you could just
it's<00:04:50.690> only<00:04:50.960> connecting<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.740> GPS

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
it's only connecting to the GPS

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.220 
it's only connecting to the GPS
satellite<00:04:52.670> so<00:04:53.000> as<00:04:53.570> long<00:04:53.720> as<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:53.990> have<00:04:54.200> your

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
satellite so as long as you have your

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.910 
satellite so as long as you have your

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
Maps pre-loaded it doesn't matter but

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.860 
Maps pre-loaded it doesn't matter but
I've<00:04:58.040> talked<00:04:58.580> about<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:59.000> before<00:04:59.120> it's<00:04:59.570> I've

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
I've talked about that before it's I've

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.500 
I've talked about that before it's I've
done<00:05:00.770> reviews<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.250> it<00:05:01.310> cold<00:05:01.580> he<00:05:02.150> used<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.450> be

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
done reviews of it cold he used to be

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.540 
done reviews of it cold he used to be
called<00:05:02.720> free<00:05:03.050> nav<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.590> then<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:03.800> was<00:05:03.920> NAB<00:05:04.070> USA

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
called free nav and then it was NAB USA

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.340 
called free nav and then it was NAB USA
now<00:05:04.850> it's<00:05:05.000> nav<00:05:05.210> me<00:05:05.420> mi<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:05.960> i<00:05:07.450> would<00:05:08.450> if<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:08.990> do

now it's nav me mi I i would if you do
go<00:05:09.590> with<00:05:09.800> freedompop<00:05:10.430> i<00:05:10.730> would<00:05:11.270> definitely

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
go with freedompop i would definitely

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.950 
go with freedompop i would definitely
suggest<00:05:12.140> getting<00:05:12.650> nav<00:05:13.070> me<00:05:13.340> instead<00:05:13.940> of<00:05:14.000> google

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
suggest getting nav me instead of google

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.870 
suggest getting nav me instead of google
maps<00:05:15.350> because<00:05:16.000> it<00:05:18.040> doesn't<00:05:19.040> need<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.580> data

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
maps because it doesn't need a data

maps because it doesn't need a data
connection<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:21.020> do<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.160> stuff

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
connection to do it stuff

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.820 
connection to do it stuff
it<00:05:24.610> just<00:05:24.820> uses<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.300> gps<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.620> only

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
it just uses the gps so you the only

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.680 
it just uses the gps so you the only
time<00:05:27.040> you'll<00:05:27.220> lose<00:05:27.460> signal<00:05:27.820> with<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.510> if

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
time you'll lose signal with it is if

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.600 
time you'll lose signal with it is if
it's<00:05:28.840> super<00:05:29.260> cloudy<00:05:29.470> or<00:05:29.770> stormy<00:05:30.160> or<00:05:30.250> something

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
it's super cloudy or stormy or something

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.870 
it's super cloudy or stormy or something
and<00:05:30.760> that's<00:05:30.940> just<00:05:31.180> that's<00:05:32.580> how<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.730> is<00:05:33.850> with

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
and that's just that's how it is with

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.050 
and that's just that's how it is with
GPS<00:05:34.570> any<00:05:34.810> with<00:05:35.050> any<00:05:35.230> other<00:05:35.380> GPS<00:05:35.830> device<00:05:36.100> so<00:05:36.370> um

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
GPS any with any other GPS device so um

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.100 
GPS any with any other GPS device so um
I<00:05:38.820> think<00:05:39.820> that's<00:05:39.970> it<00:05:40.180> as<00:05:40.450> far<00:05:40.480> as<00:05:40.780> my<00:05:40.930> first

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
I think that's it as far as my first

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.240 
I think that's it as far as my first
update<00:05:41.410> as<00:05:41.770> far<00:05:42.340> as<00:05:42.460> like<00:05:42.670> freedompop<00:05:43.210> goes

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
update as far as like freedompop goes

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.770 
update as far as like freedompop goes
I'll<00:05:45.250> keep<00:05:45.430> using<00:05:45.730> it<00:05:46.030> I<00:05:46.270> don't<00:05:46.510> plan<00:05:46.720> to

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
I'll keep using it I don't plan to

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.180 
I'll keep using it I don't plan to
update<00:05:46.990> like<00:05:47.320> every<00:05:47.590> week<00:05:47.740> because<00:05:47.980> that'll

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
update like every week because that'll

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.070 
update like every week because that'll
be<00:05:48.280> super<00:05:48.580> boring<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:49.120> just<00:05:49.660> wanted<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:49.930> give<00:05:50.050> a
