wearing the cowboy boots under is that
you<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.480> get<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.930> basically<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.649> like

a<00:00:43.829> heel<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.460> think<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.030> slightly<00:00:45.300> more

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
a heel I think it's a slightly more

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
a heel I think it's a slightly more
casual<00:00:46.140> looking<00:00:46.500> at<00:00:46.680> maybe<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> cowboy

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
