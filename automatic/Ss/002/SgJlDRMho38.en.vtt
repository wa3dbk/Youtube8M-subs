00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
in every color of the rainbow we could

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.229 
in every color of the rainbow we could
do<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> couple<00:00:47.579> days<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
do that and then in a couple days and it

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.430 
do that and then in a couple days and it
would<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.390> no<00:00:48.510> big<00:00:48.660> deal<00:00:48.809> how<00:00:49.140> does<00:00:49.260> somebody

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
would be no big deal how does somebody

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.369 
would be no big deal how does somebody
