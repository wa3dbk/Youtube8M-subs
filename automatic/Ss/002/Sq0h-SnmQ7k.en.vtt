00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
of these videos which is what I wonder

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.060 
of these videos which is what I wonder
at<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> end<00:02:12.299> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> day<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.840> want<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.799> render

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
at the end of the day and want to render

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.470 
at the end of the day and want to render
it<00:02:14.310> through<00:02:14.580> fraps<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.060> everything<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.450> just

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
it through fraps and everything it just

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.300 
it through fraps and everything it just
takes<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.930> huge<00:02:16.350> amount<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.769> time<00:02:16.920> which<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
takes a huge amount of time which is a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:28.130 
takes a huge amount of time which is a
bit<00:02:17.489> annoying

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.700 

but<00:02:28.770> yeah<00:02:29.040> my<00:02:30.050> things<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.140> think<00:02:31.380> about<00:02:31.470> it

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710
