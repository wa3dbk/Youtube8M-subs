conventional USB connection and that the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.450 
conventional USB connection and that the
other<00:00:33.630> will<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.290> micro<00:00:34.680> USB<00:00:34.710> 3

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
other will have the micro USB 3

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.450 
other will have the micro USB 3
connection<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.829> standard<00:00:38.280> sort

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
connection so one is the standard sort

connection so one is the standard sort
of<00:00:38.489> micro<00:00:38.940> USB<00:00:39.420> configuration<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.649> might

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
of micro USB configuration as you might

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
of micro USB configuration as you might
just<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.879> shot<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.629> we've<00:00:42.840> got<00:00:42.960> the

just see here in shot and we've got the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.229 
just see here in shot and we've got the
other<00:00:43.230> piece<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.890> extends<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.789> give

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
other piece here that extends to give

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.600 
other piece here that extends to give
this<00:00:45.480> same<00:00:46.170> configuration<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> bottom

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
this same configuration is on the bottom

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.020 
this same configuration is on the bottom
of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> device

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of the device

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.200 
of the device
now<00:00:48.989> when<00:00:49.170> connecting<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> cable<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.940> need<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
now when connecting the cable we need to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.350 
now when connecting the cable we need to
have<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.629> flatter<00:00:52.020> edge<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.980> bottom<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
have the flatter edge on the bottom the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
have the flatter edge on the bottom the
angular<00:00:54.809> edges<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> top<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.579> need<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
angular edges are on the top we need to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
angular edges are on the top we need to
line<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> Galaxy<00:00:58.320> Note<00:00:58.500> 3<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
line it up with the Galaxy Note 3 and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.400 
line it up with the Galaxy Note 3 and
push<00:00:59.609> firmly<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.600> straight<00:01:00.930> line<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
push firmly in in a straight line to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.640 
push firmly in in a straight line to
connect<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> actual<00:01:02.160> cable<00:01:03.170> most<00:01:04.170> likely<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
connect the actual cable most likely the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
connect the actual cable most likely the
okay<00:01:04.949> we'll<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> Samson<00:01:05.880> logo<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
okay we'll have the Samson logo on the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
okay we'll have the Samson logo on the
top<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.710> other<00:01:07.740> end<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> USB<00:01:08.520> cable

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
top of it the other end of the USB cable

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760 
top of it the other end of the USB cable
can<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.659> connected<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> main<00:01:10.439> sort

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
can then be connected to the main sort

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.760 
can then be connected to the main sort
of<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> computer<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:12.270> remove<00:01:12.630> simply<00:01:13.530> pull

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
of a computer to remove simply pull

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.550 
of a computer to remove simply pull
firmly<00:01:14.130> away<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> straight<00:01:15.840> line<00:01:15.869> like

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
firmly away and in a straight line like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.359 
firmly away and in a straight line like
so<00:01:17.210> now<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> more<00:01:18.689> conventional<00:01:19.159> cable<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
so now a more conventional cable is the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.350 
so now a more conventional cable is the
micro<00:01:21.060> USB<00:01:21.090> cable<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.170> shown<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:24.119> still

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
micro USB cable as shown here we still

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.420 
micro USB cable as shown here we still
have<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.810> standard<00:01:25.259> USB<00:01:25.530> connection<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.220> one

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
have a standard USB connection at one

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.730 
have a standard USB connection at one
end<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> micro<00:01:27.659> USB<00:01:27.689> connection<00:01:28.530> at<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
end but a micro USB connection at the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460 
end but a micro USB connection at the
other<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.579> Galaxy<00:01:30.060> Note<00:01:30.240> 3<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.750> still<00:01:31.140> use

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
other the Galaxy Note 3 can still use

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.770 
other the Galaxy Note 3 can still use
this<00:01:31.770> conventional<00:01:32.400> connection<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.540> just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
this conventional connection it just

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780 
this conventional connection it just
means<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.140> data<00:01:34.470> transfer<00:01:35.130> speeds<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.759> not

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
means that data transfer speeds are not

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.300 
means that data transfer speeds are not
quite<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.360> quick<00:01:36.540> when<00:01:36.900> using<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.470> USB<00:01:37.979> cable

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
quite as quick when using a USB cable

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.330 
quite as quick when using a USB cable
like<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.810> shown<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> same
