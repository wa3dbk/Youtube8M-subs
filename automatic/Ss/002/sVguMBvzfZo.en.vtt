00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.600
 oscar magi distance today with the call of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.139
 ovid and we would like to go over three today 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.380
 typical sports injuries are talking right now 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.880
 Regarding the fuel where is please 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.500
 osteopath knows her very well 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.119
 and definitely in the three lot 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.269
 better than me and therefore some tips 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 here today, too, of him the upper hand 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.810
 a lot of people too 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.460
 sports injuries probably too 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.740
 some a bit younger on 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.640
 are what typical complaints 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.649
 occur 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.649
 in terms of weight training, above all 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.219
 teenagers or many who start to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.800
 train the overestimate yourself 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.719
 just so in the beginning that is 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.520
 really makes a lot of weight on it 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.309
 and of course I have so many 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 people in my practice then to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.110
 Example of elbe and problems filed 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 shoulder problems and comes very well 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.859
 often before and of course also has 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.410
 so that's what it has 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.800
 lumbar spine ready 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.800
 has are 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.619
 there is a missing one 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.840
 advice or just yourself at all 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.580
 more weight what much right or 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.920
 wrong after execution gets if you 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.450
 all together that teenagers over 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.729
 mother come easy i want 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.090
 force has accepted when the growth 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.890
 Europe would be warned in the context 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.350
 yes, that's one 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.039
 combination of bavaria and all 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.899
 components personal data box 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.759
 of course, that's how you get them 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.050
 how much weight of one 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.670
 training session to others 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.920
 can increase your workout with a lot 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.950
 Of course that's the muscles 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.140
 comment on the muscular 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.479
 the muscle is still the same from 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.860
 or the exercise is still 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.490
 just shit out 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.560
 but still he can in the next 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 training unit equal to ten kilos 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.140
 pack more 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.270
 because the nervous system is better 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.539
 but the passive ones interact 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.310
 structure bender cartilage under walter the 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.939
 I could not do it so fast 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.619
 to adjust 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.989
 ok that is development of 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.880
 nervous system what controls the muscles 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.410
 the muscles fit very fast 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.750
 However, it develops more clearly 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.790
 that people trust in the mirror 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.829
 already see the success and think okay 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.810
 One is certainly auctions but one 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.280
 Of course you can look in the cards 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.319
 make the length 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.090
 the ribbons that's probably that 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.160
 biggest problem taken by people 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.680
 development are yes and then it is 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.319
 of course, depending on which exercises 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.720
 Of course, anyone can go on board 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.490
 joint busy his new device can 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.180
 affected but as I said already 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.680
 Common joints shoulder problems 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.810
 accordingly also soon 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.700
 It is typical for teenagers, for example 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.620
 at poe or shrek banks press 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.480
 if you make that clear goal in the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.160
 shoulder feel everything what you can 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.410
 what do you want to do that nice 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.239
 leave perhaps is so that for the first time 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 and what do because on shoulder 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.810
 problems with the tournament that you can 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.630
 make that you have to go back 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.010
 or an occurrence is important 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.709
 of course, first of all a decent one 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.560
 well mobilized tomorrow that the joint 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.970
 no matter who is prepared 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.620
 The joint then holds such a two sentences 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.450
 burden did not stop it 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.130
 be carried out with maximum possible 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.900
 because the teenagers at home completely 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.170
 important that you do not equal full 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.880
 pipe 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.520
 So do not run any 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.280
 a weight but I would say yes 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.500
 maximum is 15 repetitions 50 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.720
 So do not repeat to maximum only 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.460
 for two and probably the 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.990
 shoulder red tower train that 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.140
 many first names are meanwhile typical 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.290
 rather, only the 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.670
 simply pushes movement that one becomes 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.100
 So anyway channel is in 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.260
 swimming pool living unit something of the 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.210
 spanier against kloten so to speak 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.430
 that is exactly the change that has 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.910
 if the muscle up there just too strong 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.090
 is this can be now that my as 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.910
 said and muscular dysbalances the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.140
 head on the head once too high than that 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.190
 which is pulled up and thereby 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.160
 clubs in the student to speak 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.650
 takes place and this game scene and 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.430
 the horsewoman had floored currently can 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.980
 first down 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.450
 ok but if the fault is broken then 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.400
 to be able to regulate itself in a directed manner 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.020
 if there the right decision then 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.150
 It can take a long time already 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.260
 It's better to start with a bit at the beginning 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.690
 be careful 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.650
 you actually have more of the training and 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.730
 longer fun without pain 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.010
 adolescent cockiness the field only one 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.180
 a bit back for a few more 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.340
 patient machine are younger already 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.720
 or is it more so you say 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:55.040
 Over 40 people stood by my patients 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.900
 It can be said is pretty much any age 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.080
 So even teenagers consume with 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.060
 Many athletes are right this day 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.860
 cared for 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.410
 Of course, many have the problems 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.450
 but this is due to the sport 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.400
 Not that it's for the sport 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.280
 is bad or that force on 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.470
 Everybody gets halfway to each 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.380
 a wrong execution and to 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.390
 others stop that the dishes 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.170
 be formed 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.520
 not one 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.080
 performance level that would be appropriate 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.180
 problems for the young ones 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.680
 one too that ego think my 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.060
 colleague creates more weight then has to 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.460
 I also somehow on the 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.340
 the fastest possible way of packing it 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.930
 therefore establish for me and stronger 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.750
 be and I think it's problems too 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.490
 have game has been looking forward to 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.490
 have granted a little insight 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.420
 so what is this medical page about 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.620
 approach will listen to him so in our 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.210
 channel as capital 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.850
 Look because I'm linked exactly 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.490
 now her so over him is running a team 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.300
 Go on the velo and then you click outside 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.490
 especially if we maybe already 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.290
 has problems or want to know how 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.500
 you maybe such injuries 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.380
 Preventing what you say more often than channel 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.360
 on my run on my channel yes 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.850
 actually also receives fitness tips 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.070
 also in the direction of therapy so to 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.570
 For example, I now have a total of five 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.660
 then I count videos on the subject 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:23.800
 now videos are barely made 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:30.630
 on the subject of contract curiosity to appearance 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.630
 case and so on there is a lot 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:38.020
 typical so I get something 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.000
 I can do it I have the ski stand 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.550
 my heart says have bedside tilt 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.150
 and it's all falling topics and ask 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.010
 he 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.200
 just can answer a lot better than 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.550
 i just in the medical 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.470
 health- wide and for such 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.810
 ask him over there find the 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.220
 many people are in the right direction and he 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.940
 is for it stored for now we come 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.760
 at the end 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:07.660
 Thanks for that we have to tell it 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:15.270
 have and as I said channel past the 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:20.860
