Hello, I'm Gigi, I'm 21 years old and I study fashion communication

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.840
You can follow me on Instagram as @gigi_vives, on my blog and now on my YouTube channel

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:36.080
I started with Instagram 2 years ago and I realized that I was reaching people in a very personal way

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.360
They wanted to know more an more about me. I've always followed YouTube channels, so I thought it was a good idea to start one

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.640
There is where Ithink I connect the most with people, upload things they ask me to and I think they can get to know me better than with simple pictures

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.040
I was born in Barcelona but I live in Sant Cugat. My mother is Danish but we've lived here my whole life

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.880
and Barcelona, as a city, is a place that I love and I think is so easy to find something to do, a cool place to stay...

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.440
You always have something to do in Barcelona

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:36.480
About my favorite areas, I would choose Born. And also, and because I studied at Gracia, is a neighboorhood I love and that is full of special places

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.720
And for shopping, lunch... areas like Paseo de Gracia and even the beach are great

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.080
My favorite magazine is the english Vogue. I think it's the most complete one, they do the coolest editorials and visually is great

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.000
And then there's another one I love. I think it's not very famous. It's called 'Company' and I only find it at the airport

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.440
It's super tiny but it's very cool

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:23.680
My favorite movie is... I don't like the translation they made in Spanish. But the original title is 'The perks of being a wallflower'

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.640
It's a movie I love and recommend. Ithink it's a movie some people didn't want to watch because of its title

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:38.000
but it's great. The soundtrack, the characters are great. And the story is a bit drama, but very good. I even bought it on DVD, so I love it.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.600
My favorite book... I think I don't have any. It's been a long time since I read but now I want to do it more

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.240
My mum has always teach me about buying books, reading them... and now I'm reading the one by Lena Dunham, the creator of 'Girls'

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.360
and I t hink it looks great. I've read 20 pages but for now I love it.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.760
And then I love 'Confessions of a Shopaholic'. Iwould read it again.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.787
And 'Eat, pray', love'. I loved that too.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.640
On my free time and on the weekends, what I love is to have time for myself. I love to be alone at home and do my things

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.440
Maybe on Fridays or Saturdays I meet my friends for a coffee, but Ilove to spend Sundays at home.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.960
Watch a movie, a tv show.. Or spend time with my computer. Watching blogs...And pictures, and pin things at Pinterest

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.320
But yes, I love to be by myself. I'm very independent on that sense .

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.815
And I think I use weekends for that.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.520
I first knew about Double Agent because the shop they had at Sant Cugat

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.200
I had a friend working there and it was a shop that called my attention

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.680
And then I noticed that they had started doing things on Instagram...

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.680
They contacted me, and I have a very good relationship with them. I love to work with them.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.880
I think they connect with their followers and fans in such a good way. That's why I think they work so well.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.520
About the clothes, I love their jackets. This is the last one I bought, but I also have a very cool one in green...

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.200
And of course the t-shirts, the blouses...The materials they use are super soft and comfortable

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.200
I think that is what I love the most about this brand
