00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.870 
tools needed um I would highly highly
highly<00:00:30.000> recommend<00:00:30.660> real<00:00:30.840> rebind<00:00:31.260> Phenix<00:00:31.880> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
highly recommend real rebind Phenix the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.420 
highly recommend real rebind Phenix the
reason<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.570> being<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.950> can

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
reason for that being is that you can

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880 
reason for that being is that you can
just<00:00:35.640> hold<00:00:35.850> down<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> button<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> will<00:00:37.710> keep

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just hold down a button and it will keep

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.250 
just hold down a button and it will keep
reeling<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:39.090> real<00:00:39.329> rebind<00:00:39.750> if

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
reeling for you with real rebind if

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.369 
reeling for you with real rebind if
you're<00:00:40.469> using<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.920> scroll<00:00:41.280> wheel<00:00:41.460> um<00:00:42.379> you're

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you're using a scroll wheel um you're

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.590 
you're using a scroll wheel um you're
gonna<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.860> keep<00:00:44.129> scrolling<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.420> keep

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
gonna have to keep scrolling in to keep

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.549 
gonna have to keep scrolling in to keep
your<00:00:45.750> character<00:00:46.050> reeling

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
your character reeling

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.190 
your character reeling
so<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.760> would<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so it's just I would not do that if I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.670 
so it's just I would not do that if I
were<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.350> um<00:00:49.789> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.469> probably

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
were you um you can it will probably

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.869 
were you um you can it will probably
still<00:00:53.129> work<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:54.120> there's<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> link<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.500> mod

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
still work but there's a link to a mod

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.520 
still work but there's a link to a mod
made<00:00:56.879> by<00:00:57.000> my<00:00:57.149> friend<00:00:57.300> Cyrus<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.050> the

description not only does it have a real

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
description not only does it have a real
rebind<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> also<00:01:01.710> has<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> speedo<00:01:02.640> meter

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

and that's what I'm going to be using

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.910 
and that's what I'm going to be using

Thank You Cyrus that's really helpful
for<00:01:15.810> me<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.580> concept<00:01:18.170> concept<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> human

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
for me so the concept concept the human

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
for me so the concept concept the human
flow<00:01:19.650> works<00:01:19.920> around<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.000> are

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
flow works around is that you are

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
flow works around is that you are
constantly<00:01:21.840> reeling<00:01:22.290> into<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.770> hook<00:01:22.950> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
constantly reeling into your hook that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160 
constantly reeling into your hook that
is<00:01:23.549> connected<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> other<00:01:24.270> player<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
is connected to the other player you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.050 
is connected to the other player you
can't<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:25.680> run<00:01:26.040> into<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> other<00:01:26.549> player

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
can't actually run into the other player

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870 
can't actually run into the other player
so<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.810> reel<00:01:28.380> through<00:01:28.799> him<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> then

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
so you just reel through him and then

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.760 
so you just reel through him and then
you<00:01:30.479> reel<00:01:30.689> again<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.259> real<00:01:31.409> zoo<00:01:31.530> back

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you reel again and it real zoo back

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.569 
you reel again and it real zoo back
through<00:01:31.979> them<00:01:32.070> again<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.400> you're<00:01:32.520> just

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
through them again so you're just

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.280 
through them again so you're just
constantly<00:01:32.939> flailing<00:01:33.600> around<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> air

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
constantly flailing around in the air

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.890 
constantly flailing around in the air
for<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.340> happen<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.939> need<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
for this to happen you need to get a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.380 
for this to happen you need to get a
little<00:01:37.049> speed<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.210> can

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
little speed going so that you can

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
little speed going so that you can
continue<00:01:40.140> reeling<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> ever

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
continue reeling because if you ever

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
continue reeling because if you ever
tried<00:01:41.759> reeling<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.509> no<00:01:42.689> speed<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.290> doesn't

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
tried reeling with no speed it doesn't

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.649 
tried reeling with no speed it doesn't
work<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.820> recommend<00:01:45.240> getting<00:01:45.390> like

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
work so I would recommend getting like

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.399 
work so I would recommend getting like
about<00:01:46.009> about<00:01:47.009> 1.5<00:01:47.790> K<00:01:48.090> speeds<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.720> use<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.170> kind

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
about about 1.5 K speeds I use that kind

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.240 
about about 1.5 K speeds I use that kind
of<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.680> like

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
of as like

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.050 
of as like
as<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.850> measure<00:01:51.180> um<00:01:52.100> once<00:01:53.100> you're<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.370> 1.5<00:01:53.850> K

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
as a measure um once you're at 1.5 K

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.490 
as a measure um once you're at 1.5 K
speeds<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.870> kind<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.080> hold<00:01:55.230> down

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
speeds you can just kind of hold down

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.080 
speeds you can just kind of hold down
that<00:01:55.530> button<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.580> should<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.970> be

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that button and you should just be

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.010 
that button and you should just be
flailing<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.760> now<00:02:00.120> that<00:02:00.510> you're<00:02:00.690> flailing

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
flailing and now that you're flailing

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.990 
flailing and now that you're flailing
the<00:02:01.560> only<00:02:01.890> thing<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.220> left<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.850> do

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the only thing that's left for you to do

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.570 
the only thing that's left for you to do
is<00:02:03.210> attack<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.200> prep<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.070> we're<00:02:05.220> gonna<00:02:05.310> go

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
is attack and prep so now we're gonna go

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.310 
is attack and prep so now we're gonna go
over<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.970> role<00:02:06.120> of<00:02:06.240> good<00:02:06.360> driver<00:02:06.720> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
over to the role of good driver the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.440 
over to the role of good driver the
driver<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.860> basically<00:02:08.340> gonna<00:02:08.490> be<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
driver is basically gonna be the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.080 
driver is basically gonna be the
decision<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.770> person<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.490> decides<00:02:11.790> if

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
decision like the person that decides if

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.880 
decision like the person that decides if
you're<00:02:12.240> gonna<00:02:12.330> land<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.870> or<00:02:13.050> not<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.770> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you're gonna land this or not if you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.250 
you're gonna land this or not if you
have<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.100> good<00:02:14.310> driver<00:02:14.670> Oh<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.840> sleighs<00:02:16.230> Oh

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
have a good driver Oh like sleighs Oh

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.880 
have a good driver Oh like sleighs Oh
like<00:02:16.950> he's<00:02:17.340> probably<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.970> best<00:02:18.680> you're<00:02:19.680> gonna

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
like he's probably the best you're gonna

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.970 
like he's probably the best you're gonna
land<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.400> way<00:02:20.850> more<00:02:21.120> often<00:02:21.650> first<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.830> all

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
land this way more often first of all

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.920 
land this way more often first of all
the<00:02:23.310> driver<00:02:23.550> should<00:02:23.760> look<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.239> bigger<00:02:24.450> Titans

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the driver should look for bigger Titans

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.380 
the driver should look for bigger Titans
bigger<00:02:25.650> hitbox<00:02:26.070> equals<00:02:26.610> higher<00:02:26.970> chance<00:02:27.270> of

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
bigger hitbox equals higher chance of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.960 
bigger hitbox equals higher chance of
landing<00:02:27.739> always<00:02:28.739> use<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.190> most<00:02:29.340> open<00:02:29.730> space

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
landing always use the most open space

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.900 
landing always use the most open space

in diameter around your character that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.229 
in diameter around your character that
will<00:02:36.540> pop<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> touches<00:02:37.470> anything<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.910> only

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
will pop if it touches anything the only

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.760 
will pop if it touches anything the only

time you should get closer than that 20
meters<00:02:41.070> as<00:02:41.550> when<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.880> Titan<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.420> facing<00:02:42.840> away

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
meters as when the Titan is facing away

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.479 
meters as when the Titan is facing away
and<00:02:43.380> your<00:02:44.010> passenger<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.640> at<00:02:44.820> desired<00:02:45.150> speed

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
and your passenger is at desired speed

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.830 
and your passenger is at desired speed
if<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.550> can<00:02:47.790> do<00:02:47.880> these<00:02:48.060> things<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.690> your

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
if you can do these things then your

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.360 
if you can do these things then your
passenger<00:02:49.200> has<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> really<00:02:49.770> good<00:02:49.890> chance<00:02:50.160> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
passenger has a really good chance of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.440 
passenger has a really good chance of
landing<00:02:50.489> some<00:02:50.790> really<00:02:51.090> big<00:02:51.300> huge<00:02:51.510> flails<00:02:51.930> um

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450

I<00:02:59.519> feel<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.850> lock-on<00:03:00.299> helps<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.870> little<00:03:01.049> bit

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
I feel like lock-on helps a little bit

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.890 
I feel like lock-on helps a little bit
and<00:03:01.500> also<00:03:02.430> swimming<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.360> direction<00:03:03.690> of

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and also swimming in the direction of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.990 
and also swimming in the direction of
the<00:03:04.019> Titan<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.709> you're<00:03:04.860> passing<00:03:05.370> by<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.549> Titan

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the Titan if you're passing by a Titan

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.229 
the Titan if you're passing by a Titan
sideways<00:03:06.480> um<00:03:07.170> if<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:08.010> can<00:03:08.160> hold<00:03:08.400> over<00:03:08.940> it'll

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
sideways um if you can hold over it'll

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.600 
sideways um if you can hold over it'll
actually<00:03:09.390> change<00:03:09.570> your<00:03:09.840> swing<00:03:10.170> direction<00:03:10.620> so

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
actually change your swing direction so

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.320 
actually change your swing direction so
those<00:03:12.000> two<00:03:12.180> things<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.750> find<00:03:13.410> like<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.030> use

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
those every time I do human flail just

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.039 
those every time I do human flail just
because<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.850> feel<00:03:18.000> like<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.239> gives<00:03:18.330> me<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> little
