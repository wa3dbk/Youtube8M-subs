pheromone in the box and that box tends

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.910 
pheromone in the box and that box tends
to<00:00:30.630> mark<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.669> subject<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:34.110> bees<00:00:34.320> will<00:00:34.590> find

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
America at one point in Mexico we caught

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.050 
America at one point in Mexico we caught
over<00:01:59.810> 2000<00:02:00.590> swarms<00:02:00.979> using<00:02:01.399> these<00:02:01.549> types<00:02:01.850> of

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
over 2000 swarms using these types of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.899 
over 2000 swarms using these types of
boxes<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:03.200> others<00:02:03.560> but<00:02:04.219> all<00:02:04.399> equipped<00:02:04.759> with

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
boxes and others but all equipped with

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.520

an as an off era Mon that would help the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.789 
an as an off era Mon that would help the
bees<00:02:06.709> find<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.130> box<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.909> then<00:02:08.090> colonize<00:02:08.599> them

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.289 

as<00:02:12.799> you<00:02:12.920> can<00:02:12.980> see<00:02:13.250> when<00:02:13.489> you're<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.849> swarm

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
as you can see when you're with a swarm

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.199 
as you can see when you're with a swarm
or<00:02:14.569> you're<00:02:14.750> working<00:02:15.079> with<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> swarm<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.680> this

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
or you're working with a swarm like this

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.180 
or you're working with a swarm like this
the<00:02:17.209> bees<00:02:17.450> have<00:02:17.870> are<00:02:18.319> totally<00:02:18.650> preoccupied

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
the bees have are totally preoccupied

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.610 
the bees have are totally preoccupied
they're<00:02:20.150> not<00:02:20.299> interested<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:20.900> stinging<00:02:21.349> they

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
they're not interested in stinging they

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.729 
they're not interested in stinging they
have<00:02:21.799> one<00:02:22.599> goal<00:02:23.599> in<00:02:23.840> mind<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.349> is<00:02:24.440> to

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
have one goal in mind and that is to

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.710 
have one goal in mind and that is to
move<00:02:24.860> into<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.220> new<00:02:25.310> house<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.000> these<00:02:26.299> bees<00:02:26.540> are

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
move into a new house so these bees are

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.300 
move into a new house so these bees are
not<00:02:26.900> particularly<00:02:27.349> defensive<00:02:27.980> under<00:02:28.190> these

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
not particularly defensive under these

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.880 
not particularly defensive under these
conditions<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:30.049> can<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.500> reach<00:02:30.709> in

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
conditions and you can just reach in

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.319 
conditions and you can just reach in
there<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.099> get<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.400> handful<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.790> bees<00:02:32.000> if<00:02:32.209> you

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
there and get a handful of bees if you

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.680 
there and get a handful of bees if you
need<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.690> move<00:02:33.650> around<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.940> way<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.420> see<00:02:35.660> a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
need to move around that way we see a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.319 
need to move around that way we see a
lot<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:35.959> bees<00:02:36.260> clustered<00:02:36.890> up<00:02:37.190> above<00:02:37.519> above

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
lot of bees clustered up above above

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.780 
lot of bees clustered up above above
here<00:02:38.739> there<00:02:39.739> are<00:02:39.829> so<00:02:39.950> many<00:02:40.040> bees<00:02:40.310> there<00:02:40.609> that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
here there are so many bees there that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.280 
here there are so many bees there that
they<00:02:40.940> haven't<00:02:41.120> all<00:02:41.389> been<00:02:41.420> able<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.930> get<00:02:42.079> in<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
they haven't all been able to get in the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.590 
they haven't all been able to get in the
entrance<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:43.459> we<00:02:43.670> wanted<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.000> we<00:02:44.120> could<00:02:44.299> just

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
entrance if we wanted to we could just

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.849 
entrance if we wanted to we could just
reach<00:02:44.780> up<00:02:44.989> there<00:02:45.139> and<00:02:45.200> get<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.410> handful<00:02:45.829> of

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
reach up there and get a handful of

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.910 
reach up there and get a handful of
those<00:02:46.040> bees<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.790> they<00:02:47.420> would<00:02:47.600> not<00:02:47.750> pay<00:02:48.739> much

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
those bees and they would not pay much

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.110 
those bees and they would not pay much
attention<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.370> us<00:02:49.489> because<00:02:49.910> they're<00:02:50.090> not

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
attention to us because they're not

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.789 
attention to us because they're not
really<00:02:50.420> focused<00:02:50.900> on<00:02:50.989> defending<00:02:51.350> anything

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
really focused on defending anything

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.009 
really focused on defending anything
right<00:02:51.950> now<00:02:52.010> their<00:02:52.370> scent<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.269> establishing<00:02:53.840> a

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
right now their scent on establishing a

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:01.720 
right now their scent on establishing a
new<00:02:54.139> house

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.509 

I<00:03:01.819> like<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.569> way<00:03:02.659> they're<00:03:02.810> running<00:03:03.080> in<00:03:03.200> there

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
I like the way they're running in there

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.600 
I like the way they're running in there
that's<00:03:04.519> really<00:03:04.760> burnin<00:03:05.090> ft<00:03:06.280> put<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.310> screen

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
that's really burnin ft put a screen

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.550 
that's really burnin ft put a screen
over<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.909> entrance<00:03:08.180> here<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.629> keep<00:03:08.810> larger

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
over the entrance here to keep larger

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.410 
over the entrance here to keep larger
animals<00:03:09.950> out<00:03:10.629> particularly<00:03:11.629> mice<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:13.420> the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
animals out particularly mice but the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.020 
animals out particularly mice but the
bees<00:03:14.659> don't<00:03:14.989> have<00:03:15.470> any<00:03:16.340> difficulty<00:03:16.849> getting

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
bees don't have any difficulty getting

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.430 
bees don't have any difficulty getting
through<00:03:17.269> that<00:03:17.390> screen

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.200 

all<00:03:24.950> right<00:03:25.130> stay<00:03:25.370> tuned<00:03:25.580> folks<00:03:25.820> we'll

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
all right stay tuned folks we'll

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.700 
all right stay tuned folks we'll
probably<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:26.660> another<00:03:26.870> be<00:03:27.110> adventure<00:03:27.530> here

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
probably have another be adventure here

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.550 
probably have another be adventure here
once<00:03:27.950> in<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.340> while
