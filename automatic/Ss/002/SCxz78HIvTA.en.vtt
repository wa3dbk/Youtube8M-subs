 last month that I did

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.730

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.580

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.250

 I hope you will be interested so April 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.210
 wonderful month of April 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.239
 very busy in our family because u 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.579
 us birthdays for both daughters and so 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.579
 same birthday of my husband therefore 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.289
 very very warm and tender to 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.150
 this month because so much 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.430
 holidays and so knitted before me 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.479
 managed to tie well let's start with that sweater 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 which we do not 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 I am very pleased with this work 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.820
 stunning sweater turned out he well 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.470
 it means you see yourself and fall 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.479
 turns blue such a gradient effect 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.340
 although the gradient principle is difficult 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.579
 name because the transition is enough 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.680
 bright it that is very visible that is by 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.920
 I see him more than just striped 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.720
 than gradient 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.470
 Well, since it is associated with one hundred percent 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 cotton thread pleasant enough to knit 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.630
 easy this is some english brand 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 honestly I do not remember the name 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.270
 I knit in one thread and here here 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.700
 it means blue color and just was it 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.619
 an ash tree let it be done like this 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.170
 melange I did not do anything aircraft 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.580
 gradient and goes just blue 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.530
 knitted it all on circular needles 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.869
 without a seam that I really like 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.660
 very fond of knitting without seams in my opinion 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.260
 just general 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.060
 ingenious invention in food 1 and sleeves 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.040
 no seam is not on the sides 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.410
 everything is connected by one everything is connected to 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.319
 circular needles 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.200
 raglan and in general without a single seam 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:35.160
 just just nice mega pretty so 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.900
 he looks with a very cool shine 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.989
 The second thing I have connected which is 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.560
 me with myself these are such children 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.549
 booties it was an order from a girl from 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:53.290
 Estonia I brought these four pairs not 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:57.459
 it turned out one blue so I already 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.880
 here the ribbons are uniquely blue ones 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.670
 white lights are pink and still need to be tied 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.980
 one more blue so famous 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.609
 booties online and no boots very 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:18.860
 cool I already tied them out on the desk 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:22.780
 maybe ten more 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.640
 at the beginning of the month I tied the kit before 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.040
 cardigan cap 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.870
 and socks for one charity 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.020
 organizations that we have in 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.000
 Ireland found groups by chance on 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:41.950
 facebook they collect girls 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.870
 needlewomen and those either knit or sew 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.150
 plaids here are cardigans hats for 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.670
 we have premature babies in the crust 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.260
 hospital for premature babies and lures 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.430
 mean for them knits like 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.130
 such a small charity 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.100
 organization and I also have a desire 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.810
 something to bind and i wrote these to a woman 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.060
 which as a group leads 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.150
 and she said that it is now necessary needed 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.260
 christening kits which are held 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.940
 right there in the hospital to the local chapel 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.459
 christians for these little kids 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.410
 and I connected it with me and a lot 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.359
 enough time it took a couple of weeks 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.169
 probably knit but not very active 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.680
 insofar as 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.540
 April was such a busy month and I 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.050
 tied up sent now will show you 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.050
 photograph 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:42.500
 here I am further linked 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.690
 more precisely knitted blue baby sweater 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.759
 I already showed it to you in one of 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.530
 previous videos but i have there 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.870
 run out of threads here these same 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.090
 the blue threads ended sent was 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.680
 then they appeared again in the store and I 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.889
 could this sweater tie me 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.360
 had to tie up and part of the sleeve 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.340
 who knit it on circular needles 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.340
 show you the photo now 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:18.050
 and also there was another big project yet 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.810
 one sweater this sweater is just mine 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.100
 the headache was terrific 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.200
 just cotton silk is very cool on 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.120
 nice knitting touch 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.370
 In general, the story is such that knitted sweater 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.390
 already almost to the very end that 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.390
 went photos from instagram 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.640

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:55.270

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:59.080
