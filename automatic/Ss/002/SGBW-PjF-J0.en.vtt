00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.320
 johnny vip kraftliner server 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.549
 region 2.0 and I came here to bring 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 you a macro or is called harvesting 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.789
 beetle and today is taught to you 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.430
 there is how to do it is very simple 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.519
 Good, I'll leave the link in the description of the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.130
 video of the post in the car teaching here 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.500
 do in the forum and I'm bringing 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.790
 You video for you to understand a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.420
 a little better 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 the macro credits goes all the way to him 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.920
 which is the macro of version 1.7 point 2 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.579
 well come on first you have to create 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 your plantation of size you define the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.070
 premium size to my planting here 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.260
 is 60 by 60 the maximum allowed are 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.520
 six floors and if you create a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.070
 planting 100 per hundred you need 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.510
 need that is twice as Baux 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.920
 so I bomb a funk floor 60 by 60 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.909
 which is the default is 24 bahls so would have 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.810
 that you have 48 but you will have to after that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.290
 you complete these 24 chests and vk more 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.049
 24/11 change home good soon as people 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.009
 get there bets and have created this 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.329
 plantation in the size you 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.210
 to prefer 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.860
 you have created the floors that are up to 6 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.390
 You go there and create the 24 bahls. 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.229
 chooses a corner with can be any 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.799
 place 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.159
 Well, you have to create the chests in that 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.950
 structure this way here 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.810
 after and have done all this you go there 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.220
 in the corner of this proof of his plantation 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.990
 can be any corner 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.460
 You go here to edit your home page. 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:08.440
 fungus f 1 f 1 first floor after being 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:12.160
 done that you go there in your chest where 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.300
 stay your chests here 24 chests you go 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.710
 here and in the middle practically in the middle 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.930
 pointing to the left 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:25.170
 up there you go from the bar seti home 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.200
 congo bahls 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.690
 after this effect you go there in the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.940
 forum on the post that I'll leave the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.970
 link in the description and we'll get this 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.430
 code here a 7.2 point 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.690
 Let's get this code here done. 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.380
 by the mix 23 bettors will copy this 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.310
 code 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:53.310
 you will need to have a lot of macro 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:57.160
 gained options controls macros is times 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.720
 choose one of the f8 key goal already pointed out 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.290
 there I already did 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.510
 after choosing this key you see here 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:10.000
 and reap the makro saved 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.780
 get out of there and back your game after it 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.750
 You will already be the monkey. 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.390
 Good look here to show you how 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.090
 It works, all my books are 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.560
 practically crowded 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.660
 I left the first goal empty for 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.640
 show he glances he plants he 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.130
 automatically places you in the neighborhood 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.450
 you do not want to do virtually anything 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.220
 good start macro with the f8 button 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.060
 continue where you were when you hung up 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.799
 well I do not even know marco yet it's not 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.910
 amount of floor and only has one floor 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:54.519
 who is always walking and 60% now wait 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:58.239
 it will give romy t sector that was fungus f 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.690
 1 will begin to welcome and plant the 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.690
 funds 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.239
 When you saw how I left my neighborhood, I 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.060
 I know my make up full then he 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.290
 there is no way he can harvest more fungi 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.290
 so it will deposit in the chest 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.600
 automatically make us do nothing it goes 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.460
 leave a little fungus paki on the 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.760
 inventory and for being able to plant now 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.800
 yes you will welcome and plant the 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.200
 store and paste plant reap what you sow 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.350
 reap 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.820
 He's going to do it there, do not worry. 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.639
 that he will not brake when he 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.820
 arrives at the end it will come to stay 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.820
 looking 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.529
 good you can use any kind of 

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:50.539
 equipment to receive the bottom is 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:53.539
 using a fortune 3 pick 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:56.240
 you can use ax preference 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:00.580
 ax pick so he turned it goes 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.580
 reaping and very simple swamp 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.420
 and to pause if you want to pause the 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.490
 your machine and then continue 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:16.450
 part p good and did not come to equip ae 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.610
 stopped it he was he created a 7 home the 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.100
 that automatic planting stopped 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.870
 to continue hold p for three 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.660
 seconds to times do not push you have 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.000
 To insure she created a home for 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.500
 at the time you return pl will give 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.940
 a new name I'm going to a place 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.940
 here is a neighborhood or a place for him 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:44.550
 well here is to my house everything 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.550
 castelÃ£o and that now will chase the p 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.680
 the returned crop does not move the mouse 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.190
 or wait three seconds 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.160
 Then he came back from where he started a lot. 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.760
 simple to minimize the game is 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.640
 That 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.720
 and if you want to do something else squeeze out 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.770
 and tab 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.440
 he goes there then you get out 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.490
 play and drop it there planting and 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.170
 reaping for you 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.560
 this is not illegal because it is a machine 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.720
 so you can do other things 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.220
 so this is a tutorial explaining a 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.240
 little better 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.320
 if you understood not comment 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.390
 waiting why does it work best? 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.580
 this collection of the beetle so much fungus 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.470
 He picks up the funghi keeper in the trunk. 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:35.780
 if you have a 100 per 100 plantation 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:38.300
 It's up to you to speak is that the 48 chests and 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.790
 after voting for the 24 flights and where the 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.070
 other 24 chest and gives the same seti home 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.870
 pointing to the left and here it is 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:52.550
 explaining him explaining by the post 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:56.060
 right conditioning and that's it guys 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:59.180
 galera was worth the power to a like in the video 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.550
