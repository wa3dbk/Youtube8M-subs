00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.940
 the conduct of human beings when they transgress the law 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.630
 initially the cases of minors and adults 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.950
 they only have criminal behavior traits that is our specialty testament 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.300
 having still more 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.850
 telephones the author although it is patent although these appear on the screen 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.700
 tiago gomes tote 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.290
 you need your series 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.190
 do not hesitate to call 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.420
 doctor eritrea 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.900
 They have changed many things in dry box 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.820
 previously as the family were constituted and informed 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.810
 for dads and moms and their children 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.980
 now connected as migration issue 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.640
 the family 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.640
 goals of the eagles changed 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.680
 pull apart 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.620
 and you can 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.200
 and all this is changing a truth concept 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.450
 Yes it is 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.770
 what is the concept currently 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.350
 of the family good the family denounced universal social 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.410
 it always existed throughout history 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.700
 this need for attention to the family in the 1st 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.260
 do not really believe human being participates 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.780
 but it seems constitution always needs a man and a woman 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.539
 when they commit themselves to train in building a life project 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 based on love the affection that is one of the first 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.470
 mistakes that commit couple zetas 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.759
 because according to needs 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.350
 commitment with decision and strength 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.450
 then regardless of the decision they have to make 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 this consists of a family demand permanent delivery 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.140
 the name of the woman but that's not all 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.760
 this concept has allowed anthropologically to be considered the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.029
 family currently 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.040
 as a sociocultural psychological co-pilot 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:14.859
 biological 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.480
 where usually the purpose of detecting in contact 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.509
 with society and if you change agreement no longer 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:26.479
 to the number of members because you were dad or mom their children 5 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.909
 now the family veneer 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.150
 children grandparents children uncles lijo institutions 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:40.269
 but the importance of this structure lies in the interaction 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.579
 there is not in the number of members and not how they relate to each other 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.079
 as well as allow its function and structure 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.059
 sound between the sanction with bonding affective bonds 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.649
 inbreeding 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.319
 Whoever is all that 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.479
 formed by 15 way hours 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.479
 the needs according to the needs of its members 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.129
 while forgiveness percent 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.489
 on the cards 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.959
 that's why they are socio-economic cultural factors 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.619
 the to the members of a family when narrowing or by ties of 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:16.269
 Union 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.529
 although there are not and does not have consanguineous links like uncles 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.659
 igor godfathers institution in force 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.359
 josé has made unions as grandparents who stay with their grandchildren 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.749
 relatives with their economy 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.589
 if what the children do is in the interaction not the five what is 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.839
 can form him 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.869
 That is why it is so true that the family as an institution 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.839
 the institution must be organized organized 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.429
 and be hierarchical 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.859
 I'll throw that means there has to be authority 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.680
 currently the wall that inc 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.860
 what family expresses at the same level of the boys not that milestone for the sector 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.549
 retailer 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.019
 the day I'm going to take the air I take so many bed friends with me first 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.349
 then the PSOE is an error because 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.369
 Asians there must be an order 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.469
 this order allow there to be patterns of behavior 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.709
 that there are regulations of the Cerati family who makes the 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.519
 with parents with the referents to be but success do not arise 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.319
 high-profile cases stood out 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.139
 three times stellar 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.509
 the author has always believed 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.849
 that she important 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.289
 is based on the children this is true 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.590
 sometimes we commit 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.639
 d is worrying to disappear in the contest that is an error because 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.580
 the importance to the family lies in all its members not 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.170
 as I said before 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.320
 the family is one or the other of its members and not members 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.060
 the parents mothers children in case there are extended families as grandparents 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.939
 nephews cousins 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:47.789
 are all members that should grow as a result of this from the children not 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.039
 additionally the mother especially involved 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.849
 she believes insufficient 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:53.759
 if she 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.479
 she can sacrifice all kinds of relationships so that her children 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.349
 stay by your father's side 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.029
 she does not feel good as a woman, she can hardly 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.099
 i in project happiness gijón 2 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.580
 many mothers assert 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.469
 that the fire remains in this place can remain because it affected 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.839
 valencia cf 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:17.649
 the nation's expertise depends on the happiness of the mother the officer for 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.900
 nothing 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.500
 if the mother is happy in that environment or if you do not have to congratulate them and do not give 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.490
 account 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.669
 Felicia can perceive her mother 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.559
 but if the boy of a constructive environment 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.970
 sometimes I'm happy not only getxo that 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.249
 that brings old age and injury the indifference 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:37.719
 We sincerely believe that violence is a bucket 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.080
 but also the silence the indifference 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.129
 the lack of love left three types of violence 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.889
 the family is very important that all members grow up to peace 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.319
 fathers and mothers 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.319
 sotelo salgado 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 so that the couple 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.440
 - there is an excellent family violence indec as violent act stand out from a 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.509
 adult to another adult of a few last minutes 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.629
 initially the first causes of this park spain level of the 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:17.789
 communication

 failure level of the festivity of the process of adaptation within your mind 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:23.360
 the family nucleus 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.330
 the communication 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.809
 the gesture to haiti 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:30.219

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:33.800
 in the affectivity communication with the holiday so mobility 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.439
 the process of adaptation will be answered as a safe man and woman 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.099
 type of these projects is not met and normally 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.199
 they start to see what kind of 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.270
 of rose and rib between you have a lot to do with the way of being of each one 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:50.049
 the personal conflict takes it here they come together 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:54.289
 according to this time a Bosnian conflict in particular of hunger 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.629
 couple conflicts we always go after that facility for 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:58.979
 solve them 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.919
 what happens is how he took it as a human being not 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.289
 in it there may be forces in the gulf tactics 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.399
 that can allow them to develop a project such as the ability to 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:10.999
 listening comprehension 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.159
 we must respect 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.110
 but also and as a human being I can see strength 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.129
 tactical homies that allow us to be quiet my own criteria 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:22.050
 I deny and had to close 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.490
 it does not allow me to understand the other and the first way 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.259
 it's about imposing 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:29.779
 thousand criteria through violence 

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:31.509
 through crime 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:34.589
 from indifference through physical attack not 

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:37.919
 although warehouse violence has only by physical attack in the 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.169
 verbal attack 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:42.389
 in psychological attack including sexual assault 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.479
 to the woman and also from the woman to the man
