in<00:01:52.780> this<00:01:52.960> case<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:56.650> design<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.460> blade<00:01:57.580> I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
in this case the design of the blade I

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.580 
in this case the design of the blade I
like<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.720> lot<00:01:59.460> it's<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.870> variation<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.350> bowie

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
like a lot it's a variation of a bowie

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.469 
like a lot it's a variation of a bowie
design<00:02:03.220> was<00:02:03.600> long<00:02:04.600> false<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.380> Trinette<00:02:06.479> it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
design was long false a Trinette it

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.560 
design was long false a Trinette it
looks<00:02:07.690> similar<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.470> soaked<00:02:08.800> knives<00:02:09.570> but

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
looks similar to the soaked knives but

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.560 
looks similar to the soaked knives but
this<00:02:11.110> design<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.890> not<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.580> convention<00:02:13.300> and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
this design is not a so convention and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.490 
this design is not a so convention and
it's<00:02:13.750> not<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.020> magnum<00:02:14.530> intervention<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.970> is

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
it's not a magnum intervention this is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.699 
it's not a magnum intervention this is
often<00:02:17.500> used<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.400> design<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.470> modern<00:02:20.470> bowie

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
often used to design on modern bowie

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.600 
often used to design on modern bowie
knives<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.989> this<00:02:23.140> design<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.709> lot<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.459> has<00:02:24.580> a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
knives I like this design a lot it has a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.100 
knives I like this design a lot it has a
hollow<00:02:24.910> grind<00:02:26.730> 3.8<00:02:27.730> five<00:02:28.180> millimeter<00:02:28.750> plate

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
hollow grind 3.8 five millimeter plate

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.949 
hollow grind 3.8 five millimeter plate
thickness<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.700> full<00:02:31.030> tang<00:02:31.390> but<00:02:31.780> it's

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
thickness it is not full tang but it's

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.960 
thickness it is not full tang but it's
full<00:02:32.440> hilt<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:32.950> guess<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.580> called

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
full hilt I guess it's called

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.410 
full hilt I guess it's called
is<00:02:34.330> he<00:02:34.510> here<00:02:35.310> yeah<00:02:36.310> not<00:02:36.700> full<00:02:36.910> tang<00:02:37.120> but<00:02:37.330> it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
is he here yeah not full tang but it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.810 
is he here yeah not full tang but it
goes<00:02:37.660> through<00:02:38.100> through<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.160> whole<00:02:39.400> handle

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
goes through through the whole handle

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.509 
goes through through the whole handle
and<00:02:40.000> ends<00:02:40.390> here<00:02:41.519> yeah<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:44.130> here<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.310> blade

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
and ends here yeah so here the blade

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.240 
and ends here yeah so here the blade
then<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.000> will<00:02:46.239> become<00:02:46.690> thinner<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.860> goes

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
then it will become thinner and goes

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.350 
then it will become thinner and goes
through<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:49.019> ants<00:02:50.019> here<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:51.000> guess<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
through and ants here I guess the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.630 
through and ants here I guess the
English<00:02:52.720> term<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.110> full<00:02:53.350> hilt<00:02:53.620> are<00:02:54.280> not<00:02:54.430> pretty

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640
