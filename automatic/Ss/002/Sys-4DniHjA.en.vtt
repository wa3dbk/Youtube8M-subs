so we've already we're just going to cut

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.539 
so we've already we're just going to cut
that<00:01:54.240> right<00:01:54.600> out<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> first

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
pops off their tops off there we're

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.109 
pops off their tops off there we're
almost<00:02:03.659> done<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.229> put<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> H<00:02:05.000> with<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
removal or my Keith I come apart in

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.850 
removal or my Keith I come apart in
little<00:02:08.280> pieces<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.729> parts<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.440> make<00:02:10.619> sure<00:02:10.649> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
little pieces and parts so make sure you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.860 
little pieces and parts so make sure you
get<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.129> all<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.430> they

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
get them all as they

he's hit hard try not to damage any time

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.839 
he's hit hard try not to damage any time
we<00:02:18.409> might<00:02:18.590> have<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.769> few<00:02:19.099> screws<00:02:19.400> back<00:02:19.640> there

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
we might have a few screws back there

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.550 
we might have a few screws back there
actually<00:02:20.209> we<00:02:20.330> do<00:02:20.480> we're<00:02:21.170> gonna<00:02:21.260> have<00:02:21.379> to<00:02:21.470> get

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
actually we do we're gonna have to get

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.110 
actually we do we're gonna have to get
this<00:02:21.830> part<00:02:22.129> of<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.250> piece<00:02:22.489> there<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.790> go<00:02:22.909> there

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
this part of a piece there we go there

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.170 
this part of a piece there we go there
we<00:02:23.150> go<00:02:23.239> there<00:02:23.390> we<00:02:24.379> go<00:02:24.500> there<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:24.980> go<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.909> what

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
we go there we go there we go so what

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.820 
we go there we go there we go so what
this<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.810> we'll<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.260> do<00:02:27.409> this<00:02:27.590> in

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
this is and we'll have to do this in

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.280 
this is and we'll have to do this in
Reverse<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:29.030> we'll<00:02:29.180> have<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.450> reinstall<00:02:30.019> these

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
Reverse so we'll have to reinstall these

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.860 
Reverse so we'll have to reinstall these
rubber<00:02:30.590> pieces<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:32.180> we're<00:02:32.329> also<00:02:32.480> going<00:02:32.810> to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
rubber pieces and we're also going to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.280 
rubber pieces and we're also going to
have<00:02:33.079> to<00:02:33.349> reinstall<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.579> tile<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.989> on<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
have to reinstall the tile this on the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.990 
have to reinstall the tile this on the
tile<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.829> so<00:02:36.980> they're<00:02:37.190> screws<00:02:37.549> holding<00:02:37.849> this

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
tile and so they're screws holding this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.699 
tile and so they're screws holding this
side<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:39.019> side<00:02:39.079> and<00:02:39.409> that's<00:02:39.470> what

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
side and that side and that's what

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.229 
side and that side and that's what
creates<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:40.129> support<00:02:40.459> structure<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.970> doesn't

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
creates a support structure so doesn't

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.210 
creates a support structure so doesn't
collapse<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.720> on<00:02:41.810> itself<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.799> we'll<00:02:42.920> pull<00:02:43.099> them

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
collapse in on itself so we'll pull them

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.490 
collapse in on itself so we'll pull them
all<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.519> apart<00:02:43.879> we'll<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:44.959> don't<00:02:45.079> do<00:02:45.290> that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
all that apart we'll just don't do that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.920 
all that apart we'll just don't do that
real<00:02:45.739> quick<00:02:45.769> so<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.910> best<00:02:47.090> way<00:02:47.359> you<00:02:47.420> know<00:02:47.720> once

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
real quick so the best way you know once

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.960 
real quick so the best way you know once
you<00:02:48.049> take<00:02:48.260> off<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.709> railing<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.430> supported

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
you take off the railing that supported

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.640 
you take off the railing that supported
the<00:02:50.060> old<00:02:50.180> door<00:02:50.390> what<00:02:51.079> you'll<00:02:51.200> find<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.620> that

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the old door what you'll find is that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.440 
the old door what you'll find is that
there's<00:02:52.010> going<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.250> be<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.400> trail<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.790> silicone

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
there's going to be a trail of silicone

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.449 
there's going to be a trail of silicone
going<00:02:53.780> up<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.049> down<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.379> tile<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:55.099> best<00:02:55.310> way

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
going up and down the tile the best way

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.589 
going up and down the tile the best way
to<00:02:55.519> remove<00:02:55.760> that's<00:02:56.000> just<00:02:56.299> with<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> simple

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
to remove that's just with a simple

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.899 
to remove that's just with a simple
razor<00:02:57.200> blade<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.829> just<00:02:58.040> peels<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.459> right<00:02:58.700> off

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
razor blade it just peels it right off

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.630 
razor blade it just peels it right off
look<00:02:59.150> at<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.450> way<00:03:00.109> that<00:03:00.409> right<00:03:00.650> there<00:03:00.920> so

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
look at that way that right there so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.039 
look at that way that right there so
that<00:03:01.670> peels<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.150> right<00:03:02.329> off<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.750> makes<00:03:02.900> it

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
that peels it right off and makes it

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:15.700 
that peels it right off and makes it
nice

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.160 

so<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:17.090> first<00:03:17.210> two<00:03:17.390> steps<00:03:17.570> are<00:03:17.780> measured<00:03:18.080> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
so the first two steps are measured the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.650 
so the first two steps are measured the
bottom<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.640> then<00:03:19.640> we'll<00:03:19.790> cut<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.060> plate<00:03:20.450> they

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
bottom and then we'll cut the plate they

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.880 
bottom and then we'll cut the plate they
give<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.930> plate<00:03:21.200> that's<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.530> little<00:03:21.770> bit

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
give you a plate that's a little bit

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.130 
give you a plate that's a little bit
longer<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.220> bottom<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.760> bottom<00:03:23.150> plate<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.960> we'll

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
longer a bottom a bottom plate and we'll

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.330 
longer a bottom a bottom plate and we'll
measure<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.530> top<00:03:24.740> the<00:03:24.950> reason<00:03:25.190> you'll

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
measure the top the reason you'll

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.310 
measure the top the reason you'll
measure<00:03:25.520> on<00:03:25.760> both<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.870> how<00:03:26.990> much<00:03:27.110> does<00:03:27.290> that

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
measure on both it is how much does that

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.830 
measure on both it is how much does that
one<00:03:27.530> down<00:03:27.650> there<00:03:27.800> 40<00:03:28.220> right<00:03:28.460> on<00:03:28.580> 40<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.570> one's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
one down there 40 right on 40 this one's

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.140 
one down there 40 right on 40 this one's
already<00:03:30.170> an<00:03:30.500> edwardian<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.130> fat<00:03:31.340> quarter<00:03:31.790> 40

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
already an edwardian a fat quarter 40

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.930 
already an edwardian a fat quarter 40
and<00:03:32.270> a<00:03:32.390> fat<00:03:32.570> quarter<00:03:32.960> up<00:03:33.110> here<00:03:33.460> so<00:03:34.460> that<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> lot

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
and a fat quarter up here so that a lot
