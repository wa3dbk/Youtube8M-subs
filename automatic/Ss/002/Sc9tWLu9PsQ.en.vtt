00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
gonna be in silhouette cuz it'll be

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.169 
gonna be in silhouette cuz it'll be
easier<00:00:19.169> to<00:00:19.230> capture<00:00:19.529> his<00:00:19.890> shape<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.999> there's

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
about to land so his legs are out and

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.809 
about to land so his legs are out and
eagles<00:01:48.209> have<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.689> feathers<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.289> their<00:01:49.439> legs

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
about to land so and that's how I draw a

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.549 
about to land so and that's how I draw a
flying<00:02:16.350> eagle<00:02:16.620> step<00:02:17.160> by<00:02:17.310> step
