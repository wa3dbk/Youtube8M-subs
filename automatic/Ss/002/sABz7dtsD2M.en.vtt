00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
to the computer how we doing I think

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.470 
to the computer how we doing I think
we're<00:00:05.009> going<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.190> need<00:00:05.339> some<00:00:05.400> tall<00:00:05.850> cabinets

we're going to need some tall cabinets

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.900 
we're going to need some tall cabinets
along<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.960> large<00:00:07.589> wall<00:00:07.890> we<00:00:08.309> got<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> lot<00:00:08.880> of

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
along that large wall we got a lot of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.820 
along that large wall we got a lot of
stuff<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.389> need<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> store<00:00:09.870> away<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.679> are<00:00:10.769> you

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
stuff we need to store away what are you

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.020 
stuff we need to store away what are you
thinking<00:00:11.070> about<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> north<00:00:11.639> wall<00:00:11.820> over

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030

thinking about for the north wall over
here<00:00:12.090> well<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.750> think<00:00:12.929> some<00:00:13.080> low<00:00:13.259> cabinets

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
here well I think some low cabinets

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.079 
here well I think some low cabinets
would<00:00:13.889> be<00:00:14.009> great<00:00:14.250> because<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.820> can<00:00:14.940> have

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
would be great because then we can have

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.109 
would be great because then we can have
some<00:00:15.240> more<00:00:15.450> drawer<00:00:16.260> storage<00:00:16.560> sure<00:00:17.190> well<00:00:18.000> we're

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
some more drawer storage sure well we're

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.580 
some more drawer storage sure well we're
almost<00:00:18.270> done<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> design<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.320> Brian<00:00:19.500> why

from the bottom of the cabinet yeah then
we<00:02:34.040> took<00:02:34.190> some<00:02:34.340> scrap<00:02:34.670> wood<00:02:34.700> longer<00:02:35.570> than<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
we took some scrap wood longer than the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.479 
we took some scrap wood longer than the
measurement<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.860> couple<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.160> pieces<00:02:37.310> of

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
measurement and a couple of pieces of

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.190 
measurement and a couple of pieces of
scrap<00:02:37.820> trim<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.480> have<00:02:38.630> lens

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
scrap trim that we have lens

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.460 
scrap trim that we have lens
that<00:02:39.379> will<00:02:39.500> use<00:02:39.709> four<00:02:39.950> stops<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.989> added<00:02:42.379> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
that will use four stops we added the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.080 
that will use four stops we added the
stops<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.860> both<00:02:43.160> sides<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.670> template

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
stops to both sides of the template

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.960 
stops to both sides of the template
these<00:02:45.080> stops<00:02:45.440> will<00:02:45.709> ensure<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.400> alignment<00:02:46.910> of

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
these stops will ensure the alignment of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.970 
these stops will ensure the alignment of
the<00:02:47.030> handles<00:02:47.480> by<00:02:47.989> referencing<00:02:48.560> off<00:02:48.769> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the handles by referencing off the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.940 
the handles by referencing off the
bottom<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.489> door<00:02:50.349> then<00:02:51.349> we<00:02:51.470> transferred

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
bottom of the door then we transferred

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.920 
bottom of the door then we transferred
our<00:02:52.040> measurements<00:02:52.580> using<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.300> stops<00:02:53.569> as<00:02:53.810> our

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
our measurements using the stops as our

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.140 
our measurements using the stops as our

Therese<00:03:05.599> now<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.870> we've<00:03:05.959> got<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.170> template

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
Therese now that we've got the template

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.410 
Therese now that we've got the template
built<00:03:06.739> let<00:03:06.860> me<00:03:06.920> show<00:03:07.069> you<00:03:07.099> how<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.400> works<00:03:07.549> what

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
built let me show you how it works what

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.940 
built let me show you how it works what
I<00:03:08.480> do<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.840> rest<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> stop<00:03:09.470> against<00:03:09.830> the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
I do is I rest the stop against the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.370 
I do is I rest the stop against the
bottom<00:03:10.129> of<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.370> door<00:03:10.900> let<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.049> right<00:03:12.260> up

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
bottom of the door let this right up

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.339 
bottom of the door let this right up
against<00:03:12.769> little<00:03:13.459> metal<00:03:13.670> trim<00:03:13.940> here<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:15.140> use<00:03:15.319> a

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
against little metal trim here and use a

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.949 
against little metal trim here and use a
clamp<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.739> hold<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.069> place<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.670> now<00:03:17.569> we

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
clamp to hold it in place and now we

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.240 
clamp to hold it in place and now we
could<00:03:18.079> just<00:03:18.200> feel<00:03:18.380> straight<00:03:18.709> into<00:03:18.920> these<00:03:19.040> two

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
could just feel straight into these two

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.190 
could just feel straight into these two
holes<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.880> should<00:03:20.030> be<00:03:20.150> exact<00:03:20.569> for<00:03:20.690> the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
holes and that should be exact for the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.460 
holes and that should be exact for the
fit<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:21.440> our<00:03:21.650> handles<00:03:22.030> okay<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:24.019> template

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
fit of our handles okay the template

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.440 
fit of our handles okay the template
made<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.799> repetitive<00:03:25.280> task<00:03:25.549> go<00:03:25.760> quickly<00:03:26.060> and

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
made the repetitive task go quickly and

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.670 
made the repetitive task go quickly and
all<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.140> handles<00:03:27.530> were<00:03:27.680> perfectly<00:03:28.160> aligned
