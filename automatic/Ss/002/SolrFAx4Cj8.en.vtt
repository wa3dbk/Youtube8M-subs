battery applications because there

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850 
battery applications because there
really<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> lot<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.710> you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
really are a lot out there is that you

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.569 
really are a lot out there is that you
have<00:00:50.070> no<00:00:50.399> way<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> set<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.860> alarm<00:00:53.309> for

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
anything other than a hundred percent so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
anything other than a hundred percent so
you<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.940> enough<00:00:57.149> time<00:00:57.329> to

you probably don't need an alarm because

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
you probably don't need an alarm because

overnight the last thing I want is an

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
overnight the last thing I want is an
alarm<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.510> off<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.710> know<00:01:10.830> 3:00<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
alarm going off at you know 3:00 in the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.800 
alarm going off at you know 3:00 in the
morning<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.850> whatever<00:01:11.939> letting<00:01:12.450> me<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.570> my

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
morning or whatever letting me know my

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.399 
morning or whatever letting me know my
battery's<00:01:13.200> charged<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:15.869> has<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> ability

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
battery's charged so it has the ability

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.770 
battery's charged so it has the ability
here<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.549> scroller<00:01:17.970> over<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> side

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
here with this scroller over on the side

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.850 
here with this scroller over on the side
to<00:01:19.110> set<00:01:19.320> 50%<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.900> full<00:01:21.900> power<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.380> hundred

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to set 50% to full power a hundred

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.780 
to set 50% to full power a hundred
percent<00:01:23.040> battery<00:01:23.820> life<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.280> alarm<00:01:26.580> will

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
percent battery life so the alarm will

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.690 
percent battery life so the alarm will
go<00:01:26.820> off<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.540> point<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.280> works<00:01:29.490> out

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
go off at that point and so it works out

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.359 
go off at that point and so it works out
pretty<00:01:29.820> neat<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.390> let's<00:01:30.659> set<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.200> 50%<00:01:31.710> here

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
pretty neat so let's set it at 50% here

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.180 
pretty neat so let's set it at 50% here
and<00:01:33.799> charge<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.070> phone

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.670 

so<00:01:41.190> because<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.150> at<00:01:42.300> 50%<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.080> alarms<00:01:43.440> going

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so because it's at 50% the alarms going

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.610 
so because it's at 50% the alarms going
off<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.800> can<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.190> unplug<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.270> phone<00:01:48.620> and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
off so I can now unplug the phone and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.820 
off so I can now unplug the phone and
we're<00:01:50.040> good<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> go<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.700> 50%<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.410> now<00:01:52.530> set

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
we're good to go at 50% so I can now set

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.540 
we're good to go at 50% so I can now set
it<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> 60%<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.120> wanted<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.870> let<00:01:55.650> let<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
it to 60% if I wanted to and let let it

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.500 
it to 60% if I wanted to and let let it
charge<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> 60%<00:01:57.900> mark<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:59.430> look<00:02:00.330> at

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
charge to the 60% mark so let's look at

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.900 
charge to the 60% mark so let's look at
the<00:02:00.630> different<00:02:00.990> sounds<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.580> shake

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
the different sounds we get if you shake

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.940 
the different sounds we get if you shake
the<00:02:03.120> phone<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:04.080> can<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.440> two<00:02:04.590> different

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the phone you can get two different

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.389 
the phone you can get two different
sounds<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.580> thing<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> think<00:02:07.220> should<00:02:08.220> be

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
sounds one thing that I think should be

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.950 
sounds one thing that I think should be
done<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.179> should<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.390> something

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
done is that there should be something

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.840 
done is that there should be something
that<00:02:10.110> tells<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.709> how<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.730> these

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
that tells you how to get to these

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.850 
that tells you how to get to these
sounds<00:02:12.330> because<00:02:12.630> there's<00:02:12.840> nothing<00:02:13.110> there's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
sounds because there's nothing there's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.740 
sounds because there's nothing there's
no<00:02:14.040> help<00:02:14.310> menu<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:14.730> anything<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.240> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
no help menu or anything like that so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.310 
no help menu or anything like that so
we've<00:02:15.900> got<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> beep<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:21.300> dog<00:02:21.510> bark<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.230> two

we've got a beep and a dog bark so two

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.010 
we've got a beep and a dog bark so two
simple<00:02:22.800> sounds<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.250> choose<00:02:23.280> from<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.840> also

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
simple sounds to choose from we can also

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.080 
simple sounds to choose from we can also
turn<00:02:25.410> off<00:02:25.470> our<00:02:25.860> alert<00:02:26.130> levels<00:02:26.520> if<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:26.850> don't

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
turn off our alert levels if we don't

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.740 
turn off our alert levels if we don't
want<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.540> alert<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.620> come<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:28.980> at<00:02:29.130> all<00:02:29.280> so

want that alert to come on at all so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.330 
want that alert to come on at all so
plugging<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.990> into<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.230> charger<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:31.980> see

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
plugging it into the charger you can see

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.930 
plugging it into the charger you can see
that<00:02:32.550> we've<00:02:32.670> got<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:34.260> phone<00:02:34.470> charging<00:02:35.100> it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
that we've got the phone charging it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.470 
that we've got the phone charging it
gives<00:02:36.120> us<00:02:36.330> an<00:02:36.480> estimated<00:02:37.850> standby<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.120> charge

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
gives us an estimated standby and charge

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.080 
gives us an estimated standby and charge
to<00:02:39.540> 100%<00:02:40.080> time<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.920> we<00:02:41.010> get<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.910> an

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
to 100% time that we get here it's an

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.140 
to 100% time that we get here it's an
estimate<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.709> also<00:02:44.010> tap<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> battery

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
estimate you can also tap on the battery

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.699 
estimate you can also tap on the battery
to<00:02:45.390> get<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.570> different<00:02:45.930> color<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:46.590> you'd

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
to get a different color so if you'd

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.640 
to get a different color so if you'd
rather<00:02:46.890> have<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> blue<00:02:48.260> scrolling<00:02:49.260> battery

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
rather have a blue scrolling battery

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.890 
rather have a blue scrolling battery
light<00:02:49.920> or<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.280> green<00:02:50.850> one<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.420> choose<00:02:51.630> that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
light or a green one you can choose that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.500 
light or a green one you can choose that
but<00:02:52.890> overall<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.610> app<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:54.000> really<00:02:54.030> good

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
but overall this app is really good

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.150 
but overall this app is really good
because<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.140> ability<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.680> set<00:02:56.010> that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
because of that ability to set that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.340 
because of that ability to set that
alarm<00:02:56.489> in<00:02:56.760> those<00:02:57.239> different<00:02:57.660> intervals<00:02:58.110> that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
alarm in those different intervals that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.780 
alarm in those different intervals that
50<00:02:58.890> 60<00:02:59.430> 70<00:02:59.910> -<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> hundred<00:03:01.380> percent<00:03:01.890> for

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
50 60 70 - up to a hundred percent for

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.030 
50 60 70 - up to a hundred percent for
those<00:03:02.910> alarms<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:03.570> off<00:03:03.720> that's<00:03:04.080> good<00:03:04.709> for

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
those alarms to go off that's good for

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.970 
those alarms to go off that's good for
those<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.370> us<00:03:05.489> who<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:06.269> trying<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.950> know

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
those of us who are trying to you know

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.800 
those of us who are trying to you know
get<00:03:08.250> as<00:03:08.400> much<00:03:08.549> battery<00:03:09.000> time<00:03:09.299> we<00:03:09.420> want<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.690> know

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
get as much battery time we want to know

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.210 
get as much battery time we want to know
when<00:03:10.049> our<00:03:10.080> battery<00:03:10.500> is<00:03:10.530> going<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.769> be<00:03:10.860> charged

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
when our battery is going to be charged

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.370 
when our battery is going to be charged
to<00:03:11.340> say<00:03:12.000> sixty<00:03:12.480> percent<00:03:12.690> because<00:03:13.080> we<00:03:13.200> know

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
to say sixty percent because we know

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.690 
to say sixty percent because we know
that<00:03:13.620> will<00:03:13.709> probably<00:03:14.130> get<00:03:14.250> us<00:03:14.400> through<00:03:14.580> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
that will probably get us through the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.940 
that will probably get us through the
rest<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> day<00:03:15.330> we<00:03:15.930> don't<00:03:16.080> have<00:03:16.290> time<00:03:16.560> for<00:03:16.620> a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
rest of the day we don't have time for a

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.640 
rest of the day we don't have time for a
hundred<00:03:17.489> percent<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:18.810> set<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.170> alarm<00:03:19.470> at

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
hundred percent so we set the alarm at

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.259 
hundred percent so we set the alarm at
sixty<00:03:19.980> percent<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.519> then<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.760> lets<00:03:20.910> us<00:03:21.090> know

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
sixty percent and then it lets us know

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.870 
sixty percent and then it lets us know
when<00:03:21.510> we're<00:03:21.660> ready<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.959> go<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.400> really<00:03:23.700> like

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
when we're ready to go so I really like

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.120 
when we're ready to go so I really like
