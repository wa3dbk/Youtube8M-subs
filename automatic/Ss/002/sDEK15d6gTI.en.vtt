00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.610
 in this video we are going to solve a 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.529
 system problem diedrick or a 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.579
 Galician selectivity problem of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.070
 2008 in which we are asked to locate the 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:16.920
 intersection between the p plane and another 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.590
 plane containing the line r and the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.660
 point to as we see we have a plane p 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.280
 which we want to determine the 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.440
 intersection that would have with the plane 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.529
 that would contain both point a and 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.840
 straight r the first thing is going to be determine 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.820
 What is the plane containing both 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.340
 the line as point a with respect to the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.980
 straight we would already have two traces almost 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.250
 determined that would be enough 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 interest since both traces would be 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 in the traces of the plane 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.160
 after practicing and now draw horizontal 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.720
 vertical trace of the line that will be in 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.200
 the vertical trace of the plane that we are 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.570
 Searching and horizontal trace of the line 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.410
 that would be in the horizontal trace of 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.630
 plane below to determine that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.520
 What we will do will be to pass a 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.290
 line through point a and point for 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.260
 any of the line that line too 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.380
 it would be in the plane that we are looking for 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.050
 For example, this line would be useful for 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.479
 find this point on the line by which 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.240
 pass the line that we have drawn from the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.840
 point to let's mark lines of 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.840
 reference 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.300
 and we will have that point on the line by the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.970
 what happens that line that we have drawn 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.850
 and we see that we have a horizontal trace 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.700
 of this new line that we have gone through 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.620
 point a and for a point on the line r 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.650
 let's mark reference lines 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.190
 also for that horizontal trace and already 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.680
 we have two points two drawn two 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.970
 lines that would be in plane two 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.980
 points that would be in the trace 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.980
 horizontal of the plane that we want 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.310
 draw so just by passing a 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.160
 straight by both traces we will obtain the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.320
 trace of the plane that we want to draw there 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.630
 would be that first trace the trace 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.300
 Horizontal plane and since 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.920
 we have vertical trace and the point of 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.410
 intersection between the vertical trace and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.540
 horizontal we can also determine the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.490
 vertical trace that would be the two traces 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.700
 of the plane that we are looking for we are going to 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.490
 q call 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.890
 now we have 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.890
 the vertical trace of the plane 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.290
 the trace 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.290
 horizontal 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.790
 once we have already determined the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.270
 plane that contains the line r and al 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.390
 point to 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.590
 we still need to determine the intersection 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.080
 between both planes for this we have the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.550
 two crossing points of the traces both 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.190
 of crossing points of the stripes 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.990
 verticals such as the crossing point of 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.640
 horizontal trace everything will turn out 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.680
 easy enough we just have to 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.700
 mark reference lines to find 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.190
 both projections of the trace 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.590
 it's a basic intersection problem 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.480
 without any complexity we have located 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.239
 the vertical trace in the projection 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.340
 horizontal now we will do the same with the 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.470
 horizontal trace and we will find your 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.860
 vertical forecast we have already the point 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.349
 of crossing vertical traces in their 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.680
 two vertical and horizontal precisions and 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.690
 the crossing point of the traces 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.030
 horizontal in their horizontal projection 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.950
 and vertical so that the intersection 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.410
 we can draw it would be this 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.019
 that would be the intersection in the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.470
 vertical projection and this would be the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.190
 intersection in the horizontal projection 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.190
 I'm going to name 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.150
 horizontal projection of the intersection 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.900
 projection 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.010
 vertical 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.930
 today we have 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.930
 we can with a thicker line 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.380
 as I have commented 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.990
 it's a selectivity problem of the year 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.560
 2008 of galicia tests and if not 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.959
 I'm wrong has a rating of three 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.870
 points and a point for plotting the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.240
 auxiliary straight one point for the plane 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.630
 that contains the line and the point ay 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.230
 a final point to find the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.620
 intersection 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.190
 well this is all we see in the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.190
 next video
