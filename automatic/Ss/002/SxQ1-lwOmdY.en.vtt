improved is that they this device have
the<00:00:45.560> same<00:00:45.800> efficacy<00:00:46.100> is<00:00:46.490> the<00:00:46.610> leading<00:00:46.910> drug<00:00:47.240> in

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
the same efficacy is the leading drug in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.780 
the same efficacy is the leading drug in
the<00:00:47.570> market<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.110> it<00:00:48.650> eliminates<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.490> serious
