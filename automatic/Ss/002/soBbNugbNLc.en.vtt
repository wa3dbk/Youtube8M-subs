was<00:01:56.509> probably<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.630> first<00:01:57.899> part<00:01:58.170> movie<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:59.100> was

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
was probably a first part movie it was

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.840 
was probably a first part movie it was
um<00:01:59.520> it<00:02:00.000> was<00:02:00.960> booked<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.380> which<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.799> water<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.610> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
um it was booked one which is water so I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940 
um it was booked one which is water so I
did<00:02:03.360> not<00:02:03.509> know<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.680> a

watch<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.370> cartoon<00:03:00.730> because<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.300> have<00:03:02.260> them

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
watch the cartoon because I have them

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.910 
watch the cartoon because I have them
all<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.830> hard<00:03:03.100> drive<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.850> purchased<00:03:04.920> so

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
all on a hard drive so I purchased so

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.460 
all on a hard drive so I purchased so
yeah<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.489> was<00:03:06.610> really<00:03:06.850> really<00:03:07.060> good<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:08.260> it

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
yeah it was really really good so it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.250 
yeah it was really really good so it
pretty<00:03:08.650> much<00:03:08.739> ends<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:10.000> water<00:03:10.420> chapter<00:03:10.989> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
pretty much ends the water chapter and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.650 
pretty much ends the water chapter and
I'm<00:03:11.920> just<00:03:12.610> anticipating<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.480> earth

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
I'm just anticipating like the earth

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.840 
I'm just anticipating like the earth
chapter<00:03:14.140> next<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:15.130> um<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.700> was<00:03:15.820> really

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
chapter next it's um it was really

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.229 
chapter next it's um it was really
really<00:03:16.720> well<00:03:17.470> done<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:18.070> did<00:03:18.730> bring<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:19.000> friend

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
really well done I did bring a friend

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.660 
really well done I did bring a friend
however<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:20.010> was<00:03:21.010> not<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.190> fan<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.489> the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
however that was not a fan of the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.120 
however that was not a fan of the
cartoon<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.510> he<00:03:22.780> was<00:03:22.930> he<00:03:23.410> said<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.709> movie<00:03:23.950> was

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
cartoon and he was he said the movie was

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.830 
cartoon and he was he said the movie was
mediocre<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:25.060> that's<00:03:25.239> because<00:03:25.420> there<00:03:25.720> was

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
mediocre and that's because there was

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.410 
mediocre and that's because there was
enough<00:03:26.110> action<00:03:26.620> he<00:03:27.519> just<00:03:27.700> wanted<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.060> go<00:03:28.209> for

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
enough action he just wanted to go for

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.039 
enough action he just wanted to go for
the<00:03:28.450> visual<00:03:28.810> effects<00:03:29.340> but<00:03:30.340> maybe<00:03:30.549> if<00:03:30.730> they<00:03:30.910> do

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
the visual effects but maybe if they do

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.750 
the visual effects but maybe if they do
well<00:03:32.049> with<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.410> numbers<00:03:32.799> after<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.519> first

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
well with the numbers after this first

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.340 
well with the numbers after this first
movie<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.299> they'll<00:03:34.690> have<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> bigger<00:03:35.110> budget

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
movie that they'll have a bigger budget

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.440 
movie that they'll have a bigger budget
for<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.709> second<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.160> third<00:03:36.220> because<00:03:36.640> it

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
for the second and third because it

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.350 
for the second and third because it
really<00:03:37.810> did<00:03:38.110> lack<00:03:38.350> with<00:03:38.920> action<00:03:39.430> but<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.030> think
