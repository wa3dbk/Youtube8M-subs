00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.290 
perfect strike for Jeff guard yeah he
might<00:02:49.770> have<00:02:49.950> moved<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.670> pinch<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
might have moved in just a pinch but the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.290 
might have moved in just a pinch but the
main<00:02:51.510> thing<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.780> he<00:02:51.960> got<00:02:52.110> firm<00:02:52.440> with<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.860> one

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
main thing is he got firm with this one

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.850 
main thing is he got firm with this one
would<00:02:54.300> not<00:02:54.540> allow<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.990> ball<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.350> go<00:02:55.650> high<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
would not allow the ball to go high and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.480 
would not allow the ball to go high and
it<00:02:56.160> just<00:02:56.340> stops<00:02:56.610> hot<00:02:56.850> flush<00:02:57.980> one<00:02:58.980> more<00:02:59.220> will

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
it just stops hot flush one more will

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.070 
it just stops hot flush one more will
really<00:02:59.910> put<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.210> hurt<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.510> Dave<00:03:00.750> beyond

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
really put the hurt on Dave beyond

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.480 
really put the hurt on Dave beyond
remaining<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.860> loft<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.280> put<00:03:02.400> on

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
remaining is that the loft you put on

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.920 
remaining is that the loft you put on
the<00:03:02.550> ball<00:03:02.700> ratty<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.240> help<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.540> loft

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
the ball ratty to that help that loft

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.810 
the ball ratty to that help that loft
and<00:03:04.200> speed<00:03:04.530> keeps<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> ball<00:03:05.070> online<00:03:05.220> can't

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
and speed keeps the ball online can't

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.130 
and speed keeps the ball online can't
hook<00:03:05.970> fits<00:03:06.240> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.450> air<00:03:06.600> when<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.840> throw<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
hook fits in the air when you throw it

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.980 
hook fits in the air when you throw it
faster<00:03:07.590> go<00:03:07.740> straighter

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
faster go straighter

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.040 
faster go straighter
that's<00:03:10.620> what<00:03:10.770> he<00:03:10.830> needs<00:03:11.390> for<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> victory<00:03:12.750> to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
that's what he needs for a victory to
