00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
because it looked bland at first glance

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.600

but the more you look the more you see I

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.550 
but the more you look the more you see I
was<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.179> little<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.479> worried<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:27.899> I<00:01:27.929> saw<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
was a little bit worried when I saw this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
was a little bit worried when I saw this
in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.740> flesh<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.220> it'd<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.429> too<00:01:29.610> small<00:01:29.940> but

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
in the flesh that it'd be too small but

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.999 
in the flesh that it'd be too small but
it<00:01:30.569> works<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.960> me<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.289> think<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it works for me and I think on the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.830 
it works for me and I think on the
outside<00:01:32.399> its<00:01:32.970> aggressive<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
outside its aggressive if I think a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
outside its aggressive if I think a
jugular<00:01:34.110> should<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.530> aggressive<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.670> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
jugular should be aggressive and I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.749 
jugular should be aggressive and I
really<00:01:36.209> really<00:01:36.539> like<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.899> design<00:01:37.759> features

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
really really like the design features

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.919 
really really like the design features
that<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.000> built<00:01:39.209> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.539> like<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
that they built in the like the

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.870 
that they built in the like the
signature<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> phonic<00:01:41.640> poles

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
I think it works really well and and it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.919

very press call it is very nice it's
very<00:02:25.709> elegant<00:02:25.860> insight<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:27.269> does<00:02:27.450> does<00:02:27.870> feel<00:02:28.140> a

very elegant insight it does does feel a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.729

little bit smaller than I'd expected

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.790 
little bit smaller than I'd expected
perhaps<00:02:31.739> that's<00:02:32.159> the<00:02:32.629> effect<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.319> doors

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
perhaps that's the effect of the doors

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.270 
perhaps that's the effect of the doors
as<00:02:34.980> they<00:02:35.069> come<00:02:35.280> up<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.670> curve<00:02:35.909> in

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
as they come up in the curve in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.670 
as they come up in the curve in
it<00:02:36.459> makes<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.910> feel<00:02:37.090> quite<00:02:37.420> cocooned<00:02:37.810> it's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
it makes it feel quite cocooned it's

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.930 
it makes it feel quite cocooned it's
quite<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.860> nice<00:02:38.980> list<00:02:39.220> we<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:39.459> take<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> little

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
quite a nice list we just take a little

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.210 
quite a nice list we just take a little
bit<00:02:40.030> getting<00:02:40.240> used<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.600> I'm<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.590> little<00:02:41.830> over

6<00:02:42.459> foot<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.090> I'm<00:02:43.450> bit<00:02:43.750> concerned<00:02:44.230> about<00:02:44.319> being

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
6 foot so I'm bit concerned about being

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
roofline coming in around about my

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.930 
roofline coming in around about my
eyebrow<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.590> if<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.740> was<00:02:47.860> looking<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.130> my<00:02:48.310> left

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
eyebrow so if I was looking to my left

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.120 
eyebrow so if I was looking to my left
visibility<00:02:49.750> was<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.140> little<00:02:50.440> bit<00:02:50.590> cramped<00:02:50.980> or

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
visibility was a little bit cramped or

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:59.160 
visibility was a little bit cramped or
it<00:02:51.430> felt<00:02:51.700> cramped<00:02:52.000> for<00:02:52.360> headspace<00:02:57.870> I'm<00:02:58.870> coming

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
it felt cramped for headspace I'm coming

it felt cramped for headspace I'm coming
out<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.410> toupee<00:02:59.770> I<00:03:00.040> need<00:03:00.700> five<00:03:01.000> seats<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:01.930> I'm

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
out of a toupee I need five seats so I'm

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.540 
out of a toupee I need five seats so I'm
quite<00:03:02.200> happy<00:03:02.260> with<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.770> fifth<00:03:02.950> seat<00:03:03.130> being<00:03:03.400> a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
quite happy with the fifth seat being a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.760 
quite happy with the fifth seat being a
little<00:03:03.760> bit<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.390> compromise<00:03:04.690> for<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.200> my

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
little bit of a compromise for the my

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.070 
little bit of a compromise for the my
occasional<00:03:06.010> fifth<00:03:06.730> passenger<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.630> think

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
occasional fifth passenger so I think

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.110 
occasional fifth passenger so I think
space<00:03:08.290> wise<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:08.769> acceptable<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.700> felt

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
space wise it's acceptable I felt

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.310 
space wise it's acceptable I felt
comfortable<00:03:10.269> in<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.750> back<00:03:10.870> we<00:03:11.080> would<00:03:11.200> like<00:03:11.290> to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
comfortable in the back we would like to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.810 
comfortable in the back we would like to
go<00:03:11.500> forever<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.100> but<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.310> think<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.580> works

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
go forever in it but I think it works

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.720 
go forever in it but I think it works
fine<00:03:13.150> it's<00:03:14.140> quite<00:03:14.350> small<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.310> back<00:03:15.459> and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
fine it's quite small in the back and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.270 
fine it's quite small in the back and
it's<00:03:16.330> relatively<00:03:16.959> narrow<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.890> there's<00:03:18.130> three

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's relatively narrow so there's three

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.729 
it's relatively narrow so there's three
people<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> back<00:03:18.790> they'd<00:03:19.090> be<00:03:19.209> fairly

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
people in the back they'd be fairly

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.210 
people in the back they'd be fairly
squeezed<00:03:20.739> in

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
squeezed in

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.890 
squeezed in
I<00:03:21.250> thought<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:21.940> boot<00:03:22.150> might<00:03:22.360> be<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:22.660> bigger

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
I thought the boot might be a bit bigger

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.110 
I thought the boot might be a bit bigger
I<00:03:23.290> thought<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.160> car<00:03:24.400> might<00:03:24.580> be<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> little<00:03:24.970> bit

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
I thought the car might be a little bit

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.100 
I thought the car might be a little bit
wider<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:26.590> without<00:03:26.950> question<00:03:27.550> there

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
wider but without question there

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.140 
wider but without question there
compromises<00:03:29.110> I'd<00:03:29.230> make<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.739> because<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.940> has

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
compromises I'd make and because it has

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.370 
compromises I'd make and because it has
got<00:03:31.300> that<00:03:31.420> youthful<00:03:31.750> look<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:32.019> has<00:03:32.140> got<00:03:32.290> that

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
got that youthful look it has got that

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.320 
got that youthful look it has got that
sporty<00:03:32.800> look<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.580> I<00:03:33.670> don't<00:03:33.730> want<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.090> lose

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
sporty look and and I don't want to lose

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.930

in<00:05:26.160> this<00:05:26.250> zero<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.580> sixty<00:05:26.910> but<00:05:27.690> you<00:05:27.930> know<00:05:28.050> the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
in this zero to sixty but you know the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.290 
in this zero to sixty but you know the
the<00:05:28.800> knock-on<00:05:29.250> effect<00:05:29.610> is<00:05:29.730> if<00:05:29.850> I<00:05:29.940> can<00:05:30.120> lower<00:05:30.240> my

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
the knock-on effect is if I can lower my

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.140 
the knock-on effect is if I can lower my
tax<00:05:30.600> bill<00:05:30.810> rate<00:05:31.730> but<00:05:32.730> I<00:05:32.760> think<00:05:33.000> they've<00:05:33.090> got

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
tax bill rate but I think they've got

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.080 
tax bill rate but I think they've got
the<00:05:33.300> engines<00:05:33.570> engines<00:05:34.350> right<00:05:34.530> from<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.280> from

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
an attractive base price but by the time

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.350

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
of the standard list price so it looks

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.990 
of the standard list price so it looks

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
evening the entry level for the jaggis

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.680 
evening the entry level for the jaggis
is<00:06:13.740> good<00:06:14.010> but<00:06:14.670> I'd<00:06:14.760> like<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:15.060> see<00:06:15.240> what<00:06:15.450> comes

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
is good but I'd like to see what comes

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.630 
is good but I'd like to see what comes
as<00:06:15.900> standard<00:06:15.990> in<00:06:16.410> some<00:06:16.710> of<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.950> higher<00:06:17.610> level

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
as standard in some of the higher level

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.210 
as standard in some of the higher level
more<00:06:18.120> sporty<00:06:18.600> models<00:06:19.020> to<00:06:19.290> know<00:06:19.650> where<00:06:20.160> the

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
more sporty models to know where the

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.590 
more sporty models to know where the
price<00:06:20.430> point<00:06:20.670> comes<00:06:20.910> but<00:06:21.120> it<00:06:21.210> looks<00:06:21.390> as<00:06:21.480> if

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
price point comes but it looks as if

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.630 
price point comes but it looks as if
they're<00:06:21.810> competitively<00:06:22.440> priced<00:06:22.650> financially

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
they're competitively priced financially

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.070 
they're competitively priced financially
I<00:06:23.700> think<00:06:23.850> it<00:06:23.910> works<00:06:24.060> very<00:06:24.210> well<00:06:24.330> I<00:06:24.720> think<00:06:24.870> it's

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
I think it works very well I think it's

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.840 
I think it works very well I think it's
on<00:06:25.170> the<00:06:25.200> cheaper<00:06:25.740> range<00:06:25.950> there's<00:06:26.280> a<00:06:26.400> 3-series

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
on the cheaper range there's a 3-series

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.710 
on the cheaper range there's a 3-series
and<00:06:27.120> the<00:06:27.180> aiport

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
and the aiport

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.510 
and the aiport
spectrum<00:06:28.470> I<00:06:28.530> think<00:06:28.710> it<00:06:28.770> gives<00:06:28.890> better

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
spectrum I think it gives better

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.790 
spectrum I think it gives better
equipment<00:06:29.850> packages<00:06:30.620> looking<00:06:31.620> on<00:06:31.710> the
