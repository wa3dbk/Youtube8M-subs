00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.560 
pricey I must say I don't think I can I
would<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.459> able<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.670> buy<00:03:26.820> more<00:03:26.970> than<00:03:27.030> two<00:03:27.329> tubes

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
would be able to buy more than two tubes

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.500 
would be able to buy more than two tubes
because<00:03:28.290> they<00:03:28.500> are<00:03:28.650> NIT<00:03:28.980> mingott<00:03:29.489> or<00:03:29.700> 99<00:03:30.239> I

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
because they are NIT mingott or 99 I

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
because they are NIT mingott or 99 I
think<00:03:30.540> they're<00:03:30.959> not<00:03:31.230> eating<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.920> each<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.640> um

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
think they're not eating it each and um

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.699 
think they're not eating it each and um
however<00:03:35.150> they've<00:03:36.150> not<00:03:36.450> only<00:03:36.840> our<00:03:37.049> lip<00:03:37.320> product

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
however they've not only our lip product

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.009 
however they've not only our lip product
they'll<00:03:37.890> eat<00:03:38.220> their<00:03:38.700> lip<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.150> cheek<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.930> if

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
they'll eat their lip and cheek so if

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.620 
they'll eat their lip and cheek so if
you<00:03:40.109> divide<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.680> 90<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.130> 45<00:03:41.640> 45<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.359> not

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
you divide that 90 is 45 45 so it's not

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.599 
you divide that 90 is 45 45 so it's not
as<00:03:42.810> expensive<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.920> show<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.160> more<00:03:44.370> so

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
as expensive and it's show you more so

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.819 
as expensive and it's show you more so
it's<00:03:44.760> quality<00:03:45.150> product<00:03:45.510> right<00:03:45.600> there<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.019> if

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
it's quality product right there and if

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.710 
it's quality product right there and if
you<00:03:46.950> guys<00:03:47.100> are<00:03:47.430> if<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.060> guys<00:03:48.180> work<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.569> an
