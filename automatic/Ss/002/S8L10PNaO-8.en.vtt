okay to make it more palatable for
Americans<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:23.100> also<00:00:23.640> involves<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.300> following

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.260 

okay<00:00:35.530> so<00:00:35.590> every<00:00:36.070> time<00:00:36.100> you<00:00:36.489> ride<00:00:36.700> it<00:00:36.910> they<00:00:37.059> show

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
okay so every time you ride it they show
