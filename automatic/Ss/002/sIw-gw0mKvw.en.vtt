00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 direction japan to talk about a 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.660
 new phenomenon beneath the beagle heads 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.340
 explain me that's fine 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.389
 filthy fashion that makes a lot of talking 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.340
 on the Web 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 the principle is to inject water 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.650
 salty and when under the skin of the forehead and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.690
 magically a bagel appears your 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.279
 face a form of bagel anyway 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.720
 it's not very aesthetic, not very 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.730
 ragoÃ»tant either you rope but 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.740
 the Japanese love it for example not 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.240
 what's the point of being pretty? 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.949
 see a little decoration hang on 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.720
 keep children away from sensitive souls 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.460
 people allergic to bagel them 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.579
 images are it must be recognized enough 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.640
 unsustainable at thibaut will weigh at the outset 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.800
 it's just a small sting a little 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 tingling of nothing at all that last 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.460
 finally two hours and that's all 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.840
 likewise 400 milliliters 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.579
 we made excuses without something 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.610
 run on my forehead there is some 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.780
 something that flows to 7 inside in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.300
 does yes indeed I feel it a little bit of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.520
 patience and a final boost in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.550
 right in the middle of the front and that's the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.550
 result 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.290
 Too cute a good luggage in butter I 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.960
 am impressed geiler dimension 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.940
 wealth you do not understand the interest 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.490
 we do not either but the photographer 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.490
 inventor of the concept goodbye 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.730
 that's what I like the most when I 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.200
 take this kind of pictures it's 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.200
 the amazement of people discovering their 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.930
 an astonishment that will not last longer 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.880
 16 hours since the body absorbs 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.880
 finally this salt water and everything 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.400
 returns to the normal Japanese phenomenon 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.550
 observed so far not head 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.280
 bagel in France but who knows it is enough 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.490
 of one or two precursors already everything 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.490
 find 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.360
 whereas thank Thibault star 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.370
 trek of the 70s captain kirk macha 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.200
 salord not strike neurons number is 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.619
 now and that just water and that 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.119
 go away sap a priori yes we never 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.810
 tried to show us the aftereffects the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.570
 next week 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.020
 nice as subject to 11.5 very debrief 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.020
 appetizing
