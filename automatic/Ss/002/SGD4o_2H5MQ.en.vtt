00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.360 

my<00:00:00.299> practice<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.870> exclusively<00:00:01.800> shoulder<00:00:02.250> and

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
my practice is exclusively shoulder and

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.940 
my practice is exclusively shoulder and
elbow<00:00:02.460> surgery<00:00:02.850> so<00:00:03.629> most<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.259> my<00:00:04.319> patients

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
elbow surgery so most of my patients

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.249 
elbow surgery so most of my patients
that<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.100> see<00:00:05.190> have<00:00:06.060> challenging<00:00:06.839> problems

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
that I see have challenging problems

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.820 
that I see have challenging problems
like<00:00:07.529> severe<00:00:08.010> arthritis<00:00:09.530> rotator<00:00:10.530> cuff

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
like severe arthritis rotator cuff

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.910 
like severe arthritis rotator cuff
disease<00:00:11.309> or<00:00:11.580> rotator<00:00:12.000> cuff<00:00:12.269> tears<00:00:12.679> and<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.769> lot

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
disease or rotator cuff tears and a lot

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.589 
disease or rotator cuff tears and a lot
of<00:00:13.950> fractures<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> shoulder<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
of fractures about the shoulder and

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.150 
of fractures about the shoulder and
elbow<00:00:15.690> I'd<00:00:15.929> say<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.260> encompasses<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.859> way

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
elbow I'd say that encompasses a way

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.310 
elbow I'd say that encompasses a way
that<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.550> vast<00:00:17.940> majority<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.840> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that the vast majority of what I do and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.759 
that the vast majority of what I do and
so<00:00:19.859> as<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.580> someone<00:00:21.210> who<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.900> community<00:00:22.140> looks

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
so as as someone who the community looks

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.700 
so as as someone who the community looks
to<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:23.430> complicated<00:00:24.390> challenging<00:00:25.260> problems

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
to for complicated challenging problems

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.769 
to for complicated challenging problems
I'm<00:00:25.859> often<00:00:26.400> faced<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:27.029> some<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> most

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
I'm often faced with some of the most

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.109 
I'm often faced with some of the most
challenging<00:00:28.279> forms<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.939> those

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
challenging forms of all of those

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
challenging forms of all of those
fractures<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.140> nobody<00:00:31.470> else<00:00:31.619> thinks<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
fractures that nobody else thinks that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
fractures that nobody else thinks that
they<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.340> handle<00:00:32.880> shoulder<00:00:33.840> arthritis<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
they can handle shoulder arthritis that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.900 
they can handle shoulder arthritis that
has<00:00:34.649> been<00:00:34.800> present<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.430> many<00:00:35.520> years<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
has been present for so many years that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
see if I can fix him the clearest

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.270 
see if I can fix him the clearest
example<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.379> patient<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:46.950> would<00:00:47.250> be

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
example of a patient like that would be

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459 
example of a patient like that would be
a<00:00:47.399> patient<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.360> rotator<00:00:48.960> cuff<00:00:49.260> tear

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a patient with with rotator cuff tear

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
a patient with with rotator cuff tear
arthropathy<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.730> basically<00:00:50.969> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
arthropathy and what that basically is

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
arthropathy and what that basically is
someone<00:00:51.660> who's<00:00:51.870> had<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> rotator<00:00:52.590> cuff<00:00:52.680> tear

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
someone who's had a rotator cuff tear

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610 
someone who's had a rotator cuff tear
that<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.460> had<00:00:53.730> years<00:00:54.210> ago<00:00:54.539> never<00:00:55.199> had<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that they had years ago never had it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.130 
that they had years ago never had it
treated<00:00:56.010> live<00:00:56.370> life<00:00:56.699> through<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.329> gets<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
treated live life through it and gets it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
treated live life through it and gets it
gets<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.559> severe<00:00:59.160> over<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> years<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.480> they

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
gets so severe over the years but they

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
gets so severe over the years but they
physically<00:01:01.289> can't<00:01:01.590> lift<00:01:01.770> their<00:01:01.949> arm<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.280> they

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
physically can't lift their arm up they

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
physically can't lift their arm up they
have<00:01:03.000> severe<00:01:03.329> arthritis<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> rotator

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
have severe arthritis and the rotator

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
have severe arthritis and the rotator
cuff<00:01:04.650> tear<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.280> far<00:01:05.549> torn<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.000> no<00:01:06.180> longer

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
cuff tear is so far torn it's no longer

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.109 
cuff tear is so far torn it's no longer
even<00:01:06.659> repairable<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.310> four<00:01:08.700> years<00:01:08.939> we

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
even repairable and for four years we

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.179 
even repairable and for four years we
didn't<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> solution<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> they

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
didn't have a solution for that and they

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.160 
didn't have a solution for that and they
would<00:01:11.340> see<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.820> patients<00:01:12.299> would<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.630> doctors

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
would see the patients would see doctors

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.289 
would see the patients would see doctors
and<00:01:13.200> doctors<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:13.950> say<00:01:13.979> listen<00:01:14.280> I'm<00:01:14.640> sorry

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and doctors would say listen I'm sorry

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.880 
and doctors would say listen I'm sorry
you're<00:01:15.540> hurting<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.020> you're<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.470> pain<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you're hurting I know you're in pain I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.960 
you're hurting I know you're in pain I
know<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> can't<00:01:17.310> lift<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.640> arm<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
know you can't lift your arm up you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
know you can't lift your arm up you
can't<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.390> dressed<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.439> can't<00:01:19.860> help<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
can't get dressed but I can't help you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.999 
can't get dressed but I can't help you
and<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.330> has<00:01:21.930> changed<00:01:22.470> dramatically

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and and that has changed dramatically

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.190 
and and that has changed dramatically
since<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.820> invent<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.659> reverse<00:01:25.020> shoulder

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
since the invent of the reverse shoulder

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.450 
since the invent of the reverse shoulder
replacement<00:01:25.860> which<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.100> certainly<00:01:26.400> something

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
replacement which is certainly something

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.679 
replacement which is certainly something
that<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.439> sort<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.560> strong<00:01:29.040> handle<00:01:29.490> on

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
that I have sort of a strong handle on

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.510 
that I have sort of a strong handle on
it's<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> research<00:01:31.170> interest<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.799> mine<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's a research interest of mine it is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.030 
it's a research interest of mine it is
an<00:01:32.670> area<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.299> helped<00:01:33.780> develop<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.920> an

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
an area that I helped develop on an

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.140 
an area that I helped develop on an
industry<00:01:35.310> level<00:01:35.579> where<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:35.939> actually

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
industry level where I'm actually

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.600 
industry level where I'm actually
developing<00:01:36.840> new<00:01:37.110> implants<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.040> new<00:01:38.159> shoulder

developing new implants and new shoulder
replacement<00:01:39.119> devices<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.439> teach<00:01:40.650> around

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
replacement devices and I teach around

the<00:01:40.979> country<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.850> something<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the country on it it's something that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.649 
the country on it it's something that
has<00:01:42.840> dramatically<00:01:43.829> changed<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> can

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
has dramatically changed what I can

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.870 
has dramatically changed what I can
offer<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.960> particular<00:01:46.530> patient<00:01:47.159> the

offer that particular patient the

offer that particular patient the
reverse<00:01:48.180> shoulder<00:01:48.570> replacement<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
reverse shoulder replacement it the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.910 
reverse shoulder replacement it the
basic<00:01:50.490> concept<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> normal<00:01:52.680> shoulder

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
basic concept is for a normal shoulder

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.730 
basic concept is for a normal shoulder
to<00:01:53.310> work<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.329> muscle<00:01:54.570> balance<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
to work it's a muscle balance the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.990 
to work it's a muscle balance the
shoulder<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.219> much<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> golf<00:01:56.939> ball

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
shoulder is much like a golf ball

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.209 
shoulder is much like a golf ball
sitting<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> tee<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.860> relies<00:01:59.159> on

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
sitting on a tee and it really relies on

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
sitting on a tee and it really relies on
the<00:01:59.520> muscles<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> keep<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.450> ball<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the muscles to keep that ball there and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.980 
the muscles to keep that ball there and
if<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> rotator<00:02:02.430> cuff<00:02:02.670> muscles<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.299> gone<00:02:03.659> or

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
if the rotator cuff muscles are gone or

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.319 
if the rotator cuff muscles are gone or
they're<00:02:04.259> disturbed<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.640> ball<00:02:06.060> can

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
they're disturbed then that ball can

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.359 
they're disturbed then that ball can
fall<00:02:06.630> off<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.899> tee<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> shoulder<00:02:07.799> loses<00:02:08.190> its

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
fall off the tee the shoulder loses its

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.339 
fall off the tee the shoulder loses its
stability<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.509> can't<00:02:09.720> stay<00:02:09.959> centered

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
stability because it can't stay centered

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.619 
stability because it can't stay centered
the<00:02:11.099> deltoid<00:02:11.640> muscle<00:02:12.030> which<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> outer

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
the deltoid muscle which is the outer

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.760 
the deltoid muscle which is the outer
muscle<00:02:13.200> does<00:02:13.379> most

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
muscle does most

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.560 
muscle does most
the<00:02:13.980> powering<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.520> what<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.820> do<00:02:14.970> was<00:02:15.210> shoulder

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
the powering of what we do was shoulder

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.720 
the powering of what we do was shoulder
function<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.440> helps<00:02:16.650> us<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.830> lift<00:02:17.100> arm<00:02:17.370> and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
function it helps us to lift arm and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.400 
function it helps us to lift arm and
what<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.300> reverse<00:02:18.600> shoulder<00:02:18.780> replacement

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
what the reverse shoulder replacement

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.800 
what the reverse shoulder replacement
does<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.280> flips<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.940> ball<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> socket

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
does is it flips the ball in the socket

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.080 
does is it flips the ball in the socket
and<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.770> actually<00:02:22.950> happens<00:02:23.490> is<00:02:23.640> when<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
and what actually happens is when the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.900 
and what actually happens is when the
deltoid<00:02:24.570> muscle<00:02:24.930> contracts<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.820> socket<00:02:26.820> is

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
deltoid muscle contracts the socket is

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.610 
deltoid muscle contracts the socket is
pushed<00:02:27.270> up<00:02:27.450> against<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.870> ball<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.260> rotates

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
pushed up against the ball and rotates

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.280 
pushed up against the ball and rotates
around<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.070> ball<00:02:29.280> no<00:02:30.000> longer<00:02:30.480> requiring<00:02:31.020> a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
around the ball no longer requiring a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.280 
around the ball no longer requiring a
rotator<00:02:31.710> cuff<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:32.100> function<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.540> shoulder

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
rotator cuff to function so the shoulder

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.170 
rotator cuff to function so the shoulder
can<00:02:34.440> power<00:02:34.680> itself<00:02:35.070> without<00:02:35.370> ever<00:02:35.640> needing<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
can power itself without ever needing a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.020 
can power itself without ever needing a
rotator<00:02:36.540> cuff<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:38.400> actually<00:02:38.790> allows

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
rotator cuff and that actually allows

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.300 
rotator cuff and that actually allows
people<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.390> use<00:02:39.480> their<00:02:40.260> arm<00:02:40.470> functionally

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
people to use their arm functionally

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.040 
people to use their arm functionally
above<00:02:41.550> their<00:02:41.730> shoulder<00:02:42.090> level<00:02:42.270> without<00:02:42.900> ever

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
above their shoulder level without ever

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.810 
above their shoulder level without ever
having<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.680> know<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.860> rotator<00:02:44.370> cuffs<00:02:44.580> torn

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
having a you know the rotator cuffs torn

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.280 
having a you know the rotator cuffs torn
it<00:02:44.910> doesn't<00:02:45.120> really<00:02:45.240> matter<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:46.110> can

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it doesn't really matter you can

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.050 
it doesn't really matter you can
actually<00:02:46.440> regain<00:02:46.920> function<00:02:47.190> without<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.850> so

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
actually regain function without that so

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.060 
actually regain function without that so
that's<00:02:48.240> been<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:48.990> it's<00:02:49.260> remarkable<00:02:49.470> in

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
that's been a it's it's remarkable in

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.860 
that's been a it's it's remarkable in
concept<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.880> any<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.080> mechanical<00:02:53.600> sort<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.690> a

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
major advance in mechanics to understand

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.520 
major advance in mechanics to understand
just<00:02:57.270> how<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.420> would<00:02:57.630> work<00:02:57.810> how<00:02:58.020> if<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.290> just

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
just how that would work how if you just

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.440 
just how that would work how if you just
flipped<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.370> ball<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> socket<00:03:00.150> how<00:03:00.270> now

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
flipped the ball in the socket how now

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.520 
flipped the ball in the socket how now
all<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.690> sudden<00:03:00.720> your<00:03:00.990> shoulder<00:03:01.260> will<00:03:01.380> work

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
all of a sudden your shoulder will work

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.500 
all of a sudden your shoulder will work
but<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.160> certainly<00:03:02.580> not<00:03:02.760> for<00:03:02.940> everyone

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
but it's certainly not for everyone

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.930 
but it's certainly not for everyone
in<00:03:03.690> fact<00:03:04.170> if<00:03:04.350> any<00:03:04.890> day<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.640> could<00:03:05.820> do<00:03:05.910> a

in fact if any day if I could do a

in fact if any day if I could do a
standard<00:03:06.600> regular<00:03:07.170> shoulder<00:03:07.440> replacement

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
standard regular shoulder replacement

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.610 
standard regular shoulder replacement
and<00:03:08.250> replace<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.150> ball<00:03:09.630> with<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> ball<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.380> a

and replace a ball with the ball and a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.930 
and replace a ball with the ball and a
socket<00:03:10.830> with<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> socket<00:03:11.400> I'd<00:03:11.550> always<00:03:11.700> rather

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
socket with a socket I'd always rather

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.660 
socket with a socket I'd always rather
do<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.170> only<00:03:13.380> times<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:14.010> would<00:03:14.280> think<00:03:14.550> of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
do that the only times I would think of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.370 
do that the only times I would think of
using<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.090> reverse<00:03:15.450> shoulder<00:03:15.660> replacement

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
using the reverse shoulder replacement

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.830 
using the reverse shoulder replacement
when<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> normal<00:03:17.820> normal<00:03:18.510> shoulder

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
when a normal normal shoulder

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.020 
when a normal normal shoulder
replacement<00:03:19.320> just<00:03:19.620> won't<00:03:19.800> be<00:03:19.920> successful<00:03:20.160> so

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
replacement just won't be successful so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.790 
replacement just won't be successful so
those<00:03:21.390> cases<00:03:21.810> are<00:03:21.930> really<00:03:22.110> when<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.440> rotator

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
those cases are really when the rotator

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.740 
those cases are really when the rotator
cuff<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.220> missing<00:03:23.670> or<00:03:23.850> there's<00:03:24.510> such
