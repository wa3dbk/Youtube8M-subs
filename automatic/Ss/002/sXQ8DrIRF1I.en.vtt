00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.270 
takes 45 to 60 minutes to install the
software<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.420> depends<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.170> your

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
software but it really depends on your

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.100 
software but it really depends on your
processor<00:01:38.280> i<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> macbook<00:01:39.390> aluminum

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
processor i have the macbook aluminum

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.859 
processor i have the macbook aluminum
not<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> pro<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.030> before<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
not the pro the one before that and it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.569 
not the pro the one before that and it
took<00:01:43.049> about<00:01:43.170> an<00:01:43.380> hour<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.829> six<00:01:44.100> minutes<00:01:44.430> but

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
took about an hour and six minutes but

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.359 
took about an hour and six minutes but
then<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.820> said<00:01:45.030> 50<00:01:45.720> minutes<00:01:45.990> 49<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.619> really

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
then it said 50 minutes 49 and really

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.999 
then it said 50 minutes 49 and really
roughly<00:01:47.759> finished<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.149> 50<00:01:48.509> minutes<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.290> i<00:01:49.680> have

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
roughly finished in 50 minutes so i have

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.469 
roughly finished in 50 minutes so i have
four<00:01:50.250> gigabytes<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.759> ram<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> really

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
four gigabytes of ram so that really

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
four gigabytes of ram so that really

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.199 
want to buy snow leopard but I don't
know<00:03:05.390> why<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.720> wouldn't<00:03:06.080> want<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.380> do<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.530> um

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
know why you wouldn't want to do that um

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.660 
know why you wouldn't want to do that um
so<00:03:08.209> anyway<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.780> also<00:03:09.410> get<00:03:09.650> seven<00:03:10.190> gigs<00:03:10.459> of

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
so anyway you also get seven gigs of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.449 
so anyway you also get seven gigs of
space<00:03:10.760> back<00:03:11.209> now<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:12.290> don't<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:12.800> my<00:03:12.980> istat

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
space back now I don't have my istat

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.850 
space back now I don't have my istat
menus<00:03:13.489> here<00:03:14.000> but<00:03:14.239> i<00:03:14.270> believe<00:03:14.420> i<00:03:14.959> got<00:03:15.050> seven<00:03:15.739> to

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
menus here but i believe i got seven to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.699 
menus here but i believe i got seven to
eight<00:03:16.010> gigabytes<00:03:16.520> back<00:03:16.820> people<00:03:17.780> got<00:03:17.989> like<00:03:18.230> 20

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
eight gigabytes back people got like 20

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.180 
eight gigabytes back people got like 20
to<00:03:18.920> 25<00:03:19.459> gigs<00:03:19.850> 30<00:03:20.299> gigs<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:20.900> many<00:03:21.260> different

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
to 25 gigs 30 gigs so many different

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.520 
to 25 gigs 30 gigs so many different
things<00:03:22.850> there<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.540> think<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.230> wasn't

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
things there and I think that it wasn't

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.190 
things there and I think that it wasn't
really<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.580> was<00:03:25.790> really<00:03:26.060> an<00:03:26.150> estimate<00:03:26.690> more

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
really of it was really an estimate more

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.090 
really of it was really an estimate more
than<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:28.480> for<00:03:29.480> sure<00:03:29.690> thing<00:03:29.720> about<00:03:30.260> losing<00:03:30.769> space

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
than a for sure thing about losing space

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.310 
than a for sure thing about losing space
I'm<00:03:31.370> at<00:03:31.850> getting<00:03:32.120> space<00:03:32.330> back<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:32.630> mean<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.170> that

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
I'm at getting space back I mean so that

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.130 
I'm at getting space back I mean so that
was<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.500> pretty<00:03:33.650> good<00:03:33.769> thing<00:03:34.130> um<00:03:34.780> also<00:03:35.780> let<00:03:36.110> me

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
screen flow and I don't know why it

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.080 
screen flow and I don't know why it
wasn't<00:03:42.620> updated<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.190> actually<00:03:43.370> updated<00:03:44.000> my

document<00:04:07.430> in<00:04:07.579> leopard<00:04:08.180> that<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.780> had<00:04:08.930> in<00:04:09.049> the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
document in leopard that you had in the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.530 
document in leopard that you had in the
past<00:04:09.290> because<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:10.910> had<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.269> do<00:04:11.390> that

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
past because that that I had to do that

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.360 
past because that that I had to do that
in<00:04:11.630> my<00:04:11.690> past<00:04:11.930> two<00:04:12.079> videos<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:12.650> that's<00:04:13.190> why<00:04:13.340> I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
in my past two videos so that's why I

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.240 
in my past two videos so that's why I
was<00:04:13.579> kind<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.790> messed<00:04:14.000> up<00:04:14.150> in<00:04:14.269> taking<00:04:14.570> me<00:04:14.660> along

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
also the boot up time is faster in soon

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.890

on my flip ultra and i'm going to show

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.689 
on my flip ultra and i'm going to show
you<00:04:28.889> the<00:04:29.280> restart<00:04:29.849> x<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.629> booting<00:04:31.020> and

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
you the restart x the booting and

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.129 
you the restart x the booting and
starting<00:04:32.699> up<00:04:32.879> of<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.330> mac<00:04:33.509> on<00:04:33.780> snow<00:04:34.110> leopard

starting up of the mac on snow leopard
it<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.919> faster<00:04:35.520> then<00:04:36.090> it<00:04:36.780> was<00:04:36.930> on<00:04:37.110> leverage<00:04:37.409> so

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
it is faster then it was on leverage so
