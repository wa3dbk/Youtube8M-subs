00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.730
 I welcome all dear subscribers 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.710
 Channel visitors with whether you have a new nefesty 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.809
 release draft drags on today 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.570
 open spaces of the site cheat master I found for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.760
 You need a fairly essential clio 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.949
 skype well, literally for everyone who wanted 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.699
 would farm a few dollars on 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.289
 the atlantic in general this is here a miner you 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.849
 probably know quite a lot of bots 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.000
 miners if watched my past 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.420
 releases the same year misha on the same botox 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.100
 It was but each has its own peculiarities in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.399
 each his so let's say some 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.309
 problems here personally this bot is written 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.860
 cool as an elephant script writer 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.050
 the moment he is one of the best and you 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.239
 ask what is its difference let's 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.090
 let's go first so you need 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.829
 prescribe common in this way 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 we learn all the commands for up to and from 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.510
 China, the last three teams 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.609
 I do not advise to use prescribing 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.979
 the last command you immediately burn here 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.530
 In this panel do not expect that you have 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.240
 administrators and you most likely immediately 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.240
 will give a ban so and tips and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.979
 enjoy the first team and 2 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.830
 respectively turn on the shutdown of the bot 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.540
 how does it start work for you first thing 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 need to decide where you are going to work 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.040
 it could be like this here and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 underground work in principle does not have 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.049
 no value if that for the underground 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.479
 work will give you a plus let's 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.320
 consider first here and so in advance 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.570
 spelled command loaf and close the chat 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.550
 come and wait for our bot night 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560
 when 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.110
 dude worth vani um u and now 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.180
 prescribe team Plato inscription chat 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.100
 tells us that she creaked 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.760
 launched now we just need to wait and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.160
 see how it works well and I think 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.540
 just drop it stand for a while 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.540
 we'll see which one will equal 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.020
 to disable our bot we need 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
 register the command of board of register 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.040
 her and 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.459
 to print and tells us that cleo 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.590
 the script is disabled and now we are waiting when 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.100
 dude let him work get a cart and 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.100
 just go and publish by hand I can 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.920
 just break in general without a difference 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.319
 it is clear that getting here this 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.120
 ore so 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.650
 mining this ore on the surface will 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.930
 a little more pale 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.510
 because well , after all the others here 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.120
 players and you can just burn a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.480
 so no go away tide damn and 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.180
 miners in short will have to jump because 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.920
 that i don't want to wait but somehow year 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.170
 will be more useless if we are 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.380
 work bottom so now we will continue 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.500
 already in this dungeon and so friends i'm 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.120
 principle got to this point more 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.220
 and elevator more more elevator and 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.650
 we will not use well and now 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.510
 again we need to pick a point in 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.519
 difference from bot misha we can 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.890
 choose a position where we will work 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.959
 the default of the year is Misha on we become 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.420
 this is where the work begins 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.790
 but here we can choose any point 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.910
 let's say this one in the corner and so come 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.560
 here we register the team of the year for now 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.140
 dude is in animation and that's running 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.329
 while he is working I will say something like 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.630
 say about this top, in contrast cool 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.239
 script from bot mesh it is 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.220
 is that there is much more delay and 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.109
 it means that you simply 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.600
 don't get ivan when will lag 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.190
 server when it starts there and other 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.170
 what the fuck is happening to you 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.319
 literally every day 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.360
 therefore, it is more stable and more accurate 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.849
 so if you can put it in general again 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.950
 let's see who works now 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.819
 fast forward look banned 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.819
 me or everything will be fine 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:26.229
 and so guys i think this will be 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:27.129
 enough already for 3 2 minutes we 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.759
 have earned 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:33.460
 Well, almost 700 or 800 Wirth stop 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.849
 bot and wait until he finalizes the last 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.569
 party 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:41.110
 but accordingly move away from here so 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:43.860
 a little distance like this 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.349
 let's test the last one 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.539
 last team for today this team 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.279
 slash dp which allows you to take 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.689
 wages well let's check how 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.360
 it firstly works and really 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:58.330
 Is it pale because this account is 1 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.919
 lvl he neither you nor how much you feel sorry just 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.270
 dummy prescribe flash zip 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.009
 and what happens is what happens 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.529
 we are teleported here on this pickup 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:12.849
 finish working day oh god 1365 wear 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.580
 Quite a lot more accurate dollars on 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.520
 couch dollar but just gorgeous 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.330
 it seems like a really good script 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.099
 took care 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.919
 once again a separate thank you scripter 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.839
 who made it like it smartly and 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.270
 on this i think it's worth completing 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:31.629
 farm and loot while it works 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.479
 admins do not firing necessarily go to 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.750

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.939
 description come and download with you 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.830
