00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.450 

it<00:05:07.430> is<00:05:07.820> pretty<00:05:08.240> much<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.449> same<00:05:08.810> as<00:05:10.660> that<00:05:11.660> tree

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
it is pretty much the same as that tree

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.170 
it is pretty much the same as that tree
pretty<00:05:13.460> much<00:05:13.789> and<00:05:14.349> I<00:05:15.349> also<00:05:15.470> made<00:05:15.740> this<00:05:15.949> I<00:05:16.310> have

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
pretty much and I also made this I have

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.450 
pretty much and I also made this I have
no<00:05:17.419> clue<00:05:17.630> what<00:05:17.780> it<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:18.020> I<00:05:18.199> was<00:05:18.830> thinking<00:05:19.220> of

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
no clue what it is I was thinking of

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.760 
no clue what it is I was thinking of
making<00:05:19.639> a<00:05:19.849> tree<00:05:20.090> afterwards<00:05:20.539> but<00:05:20.780> yeah<00:05:21.440> so

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
making a tree afterwards but yeah so

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.960 
making a tree afterwards but yeah so
then<00:05:22.130> I<00:05:22.159> made<00:05:22.370> that<00:05:22.720> see<00:05:23.720> ya<00:05:23.870> Lego<00:05:24.380> makes<00:05:25.220> it's

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
then I made that see ya Lego makes it's

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.089 
then I made that see ya Lego makes it's
really<00:05:26.360> hard<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.630> see<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:27.289> black<00:05:27.500> Lego<00:05:27.919> though

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
really hard to see the black Lego though

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.290 
really hard to see the black Lego though
but<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.760> works<00:05:30.340> like<00:05:31.340> here<00:05:31.639> let<00:05:31.849> me<00:05:31.940> grab<00:05:32.120> some

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
but it works like here let me grab some

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.100 
but it works like here let me grab some
wool<00:05:34.900> compared<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:36.080> piece<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.470> yellow<00:05:36.800> wool<00:05:38.110> two

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
wool compared a piece of yellow wool two

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:47.660 
wool compared a piece of yellow wool two
piece<00:05:39.710> of<00:05:39.889> yellow<00:05:40.400> Lego<00:05:44.440> um<00:05:45.440> I<00:05:46.400> wish<00:05:46.970> the

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
piece of yellow Lego um I wish the

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.730 
piece of yellow Lego um I wish the
textures<00:05:48.450> were<00:05:48.660> different<00:05:49.020> like<00:05:49.230> different

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
textures were different like different

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.900 
textures were different like different
colors<00:05:50.070> though<00:05:50.340> so<00:05:51.120> yeah<00:05:51.330> that<00:05:51.780> and<00:05:52.140> that

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
colors though so yeah that and that

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.400 
colors though so yeah that and that
that's<00:05:53.910> a<00:05:54.090> lot<00:05:54.300> stronger<00:05:54.660> of<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:54.990> color<00:05:55.200> than

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
that's a lot stronger of a color than

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.980 
that's a lot stronger of a color than
that<00:05:55.650> this<00:05:56.580> way<00:05:56.820> you'd<00:05:57.330> have<00:05:57.600> more<00:05:57.810> variety

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
that this way you'd have more variety

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.400 
that this way you'd have more variety
and<00:05:58.500> pixel<00:05:58.890> art<00:05:59.040> and<00:05:59.280> everything<00:06:00.140> this<00:06:01.140> will

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
and pixel art and everything this will

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.590 
and pixel art and everything this will
way<00:06:02.400> if<00:06:02.700> you<00:06:02.820> wanted<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.210> make<00:06:03.360> like<00:06:03.570> a

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
way if you wanted to make like a

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.480 
way if you wanted to make like a
Charmander<00:06:04.260> you'd<00:06:04.410> be<00:06:04.560> able<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.770> get<00:06:05.310> the

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
Charmander you'd be able to get the

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:13.550 
Charmander you'd be able to get the
color<00:06:05.760> spot-on<00:06:09.380> also<00:06:10.730> there<00:06:11.730> are<00:06:11.760> bottoms<00:06:12.560> to

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
color spot-on also there are bottoms to

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.360 
color spot-on also there are bottoms to
the<00:06:13.710> LEGO<00:06:13.920> pieces<00:06:14.070> so<00:06:14.700> yeah<00:06:15.650> that<00:06:16.650> is<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:17.040> Lego

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
the LEGO pieces so yeah that is the Lego

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.250 
the LEGO pieces so yeah that is the Lego
mod<00:06:17.990> pretty<00:06:18.990> cool<00:06:19.370> to<00:06:20.370> me<00:06:20.400> and<00:06:21.140> it<00:06:22.140> will

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
mod pretty cool to me and it will

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.960 
mod pretty cool to me and it will
probably<00:06:22.500> be<00:06:22.650> helpful<00:06:22.830> for<00:06:23.100> all<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.580> pixel

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
probably be helpful for all the pixel

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.500 
probably be helpful for all the pixel
art<00:06:24.120> people<00:06:24.860> that<00:06:25.860> don't<00:06:26.280> want<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.760> use<00:06:27.030> the

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
art people that don't want to use the

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:37.490 
art people that don't want to use the
printer<00:06:27.900> block<00:06:28.110> mod<00:06:28.350> so<00:06:29.190> yeah<00:06:34.490> yasya
