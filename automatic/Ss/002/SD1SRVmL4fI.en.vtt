I<00:00:00.530> want<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.589> do<00:00:01.740> review<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.370> mooncake<00:00:02.909> mold

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
I want to do review this mooncake mold

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.340 
I want to do review this mooncake mold
that<00:00:03.360> I<00:00:03.389> got<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:04.410> one<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.180> 50<00:00:06.180> grams<00:00:06.480> so

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
that I got and this one is a 50 grams so

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.839 
that I got and this one is a 50 grams so
you'll<00:00:07.740> see<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.309> different<00:00:08.670> type<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
you'll see the different type of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.310 
you'll see the different type of
patterns<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.880> let<00:00:11.880> me<00:00:12.030> go<00:00:12.420> up<00:00:12.630> close<00:00:12.990> and

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
patterns here and let me go up close and

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.880 
patterns here and let me go up close and
show<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.830> patterns<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.700> pairs<00:00:15.619> so<00:00:16.619> these

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
show you the patterns in pairs so these

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.700 
show you the patterns in pairs so these
are<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.340> two<00:00:17.550> patterns<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:19.470> will

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
are the two patterns and this will

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.529 
are the two patterns and this will
particular<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.369> came<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.119> six<00:00:21.689> patterns<00:00:23.539> so

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
particular one came in six patterns so

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.650 
particular one came in six patterns so
there's<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.170> two<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.029> here's<00:00:27.029> another<00:00:27.180> two

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
there's the two and here's another two

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.429 
there's the two and here's another two
and<00:00:28.130> this<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> got<00:00:29.670> from<00:00:29.699> ebay<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.869> about

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and this one I got from ebay for about

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.400 
and this one I got from ebay for about
four<00:00:32.279> dollars<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.940> four<00:00:33.840> dollars<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.320> fifty

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
four dollars for four dollars and fifty

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.170 
four dollars for four dollars and fifty
cents<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:35.309> shipping<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:37.700> this<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:38.910> again

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
cents with shipping and this one again

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.660 
cents with shipping and this one again
is<00:00:39.329> 50<00:00:39.719> grams<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.320> let<00:00:40.410> me<00:00:40.530> show<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
is 50 grams and let me show you the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.729 
is 50 grams and let me show you the
actual<00:00:42.059> size<00:00:42.950> comparison<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> ruler<00:00:44.489> here

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
actual size comparison with a ruler here

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.420 
actual size comparison with a ruler here
so<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.489> patterns<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.280> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so these are the patterns and this is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
so these are the patterns and this is
the<00:00:50.579> mold<00:00:50.850> itself<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:56.149> it's<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.690> very

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the mold itself and it's it's a very

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.380 
the mold itself and it's it's a very
simple<00:00:58.320> design<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> plastic<00:00:59.789> itself<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
simple design now the plastic itself is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.130 
simple design now the plastic itself is
fairly<00:01:00.629> thick<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.930> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
fairly thick so you can see here this is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.600 
fairly thick so you can see here this is
how<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.470> looks<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:06.270> width<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:07.280> about<00:01:08.280> two

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
how it looks and the width is about two

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.910 
how it looks and the width is about two
inches

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
inches

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.530 
inches
slightly<00:01:10.920> less<00:01:11.400> than<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:11.850> inches<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
slightly less than two inches here and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:22.219 
slightly less than two inches here and
the<00:01:15.540> height<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:19.250> roughly<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.490> much<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> let

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the height is roughly that much so let

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.800 
the height is roughly that much so let
me<00:01:22.290> show<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.500> how<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:23.880> put<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
me show you how it's actually put in and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.929 
me show you how it's actually put in and
how<00:01:25.439> smoothly<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.479> can<00:01:27.479> put<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> let<00:01:29.909> me

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
how smoothly you can put it in so let me

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.850 
how smoothly you can put it in so let me
align<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.659> correctly<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.320> want

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
align this correctly so I want to I want

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.889 
align this correctly so I want to I want
to<00:01:37.979> put<00:01:38.189> these<00:01:38.430> two<00:01:39.650> tabs<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> openings<00:01:42.390> so

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to put these two tabs in the openings so

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.399 
to put these two tabs in the openings so
I<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.619> line<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.079> it's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
I have to line it like this so that it's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530 
I have to line it like this so that it's
viewable<00:01:46.890> through<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> openings<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.420> I'm

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
viewable through the openings so I'm

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:58.050 
viewable through the openings so I'm
going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> slip<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.560> this

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.070 

I'm<00:01:59.060> going<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.300> push<00:01:59.510> it<00:01:59.540> all<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.840> way<00:01:59.960> down

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
I'm going to push it all the way down

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.610 
I'm going to push it all the way down
and<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:04.040> could<00:02:04.250> see<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:06.170> it's<00:02:06.350> slightly

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
and you could see that it's slightly

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.300 
and you could see that it's slightly
aligned<00:02:07.070> I<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.580> have<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.910> adjust<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.510> here

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
aligned I just have to adjust it here

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.000 
aligned I just have to adjust it here
push<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.490> all<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.790> way<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.620> look<00:02:12.620> at<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.890> other

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
push it all the way in look at the other

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:23.440 
push it all the way in look at the other
side<00:02:13.310> also<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:16.360> then<00:02:17.360> simply<00:02:17.950> twist<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:23.390> you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
side also and then simply twist so you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.670 
side also and then simply twist so you
see<00:02:23.630> now<00:02:23.780> it's<00:02:23.960> locked<00:02:24.230> in

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
see now it's locked in

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.780 
see now it's locked in
after<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.160> twisted<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:27.160> it's<00:02:28.160> locked<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.640> on

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
after I twisted it it's locked in on

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.650 
after I twisted it it's locked in on
both<00:02:28.970> sides

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
both sides

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.420 
both sides
and<00:02:31.270> now<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.300> could<00:02:32.630> simply<00:02:33.140> push<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.190> one

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
and now I could simply push now this one

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.040 
and now I could simply push now this one
is<00:02:37.580> what<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.030> smallest<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.840> that's

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
is what the smallest one that's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.010 
is what the smallest one that's
available<00:02:39.320> this<00:02:40.100> one<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:41.180> so-called<00:02:41.390> 50

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
available this one is the so-called 50

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.940 
available this one is the so-called 50
grams<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.950> got<00:02:43.250> from<00:02:43.430> eBay<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.470> that's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
grams that I got from eBay and that's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.640 
grams that I got from eBay and that's
really<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.750> that's<00:02:51.050> about

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
really it that's the that that's about
