00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
germination I get a little bit bigger

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.249 
germination I get a little bit bigger
I'm<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> put<00:01:54.450> them<00:01:54.539> into<00:01:54.689> individual

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

I'm going to put them into individual
parts<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:55.920> grow<00:01:56.189> them<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.609> bit<00:01:56.880> before<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829
