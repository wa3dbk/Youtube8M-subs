00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
on the thread just go ahead and tie a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.340 
on the thread just go ahead and tie a
basic<00:00:33.600> knot<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:36.210> secure<00:00:36.239> these<00:00:36.750> four<00:00:37.079> beads

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
basic knot to secure these four beads

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.139 
basic knot to secure these four beads
you<00:00:37.559> want<00:00:37.590> them<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> stay<00:00:38.250> where<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.610> are<00:00:38.820> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
you want them to stay where they are so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.670 
you want them to stay where they are so
that<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.540> work<00:00:39.719> off<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.260> pattern

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
that you can work off of this pattern

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.010 
that you can work off of this pattern
now<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:43.800> you'll<00:00:43.920> notice<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.399> beads<00:00:44.579> lay

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
now if you'll notice the beads lay

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.440 
now if you'll notice the beads lay
basically<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.260> square<00:00:46.910> we<00:00:47.910> need<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> work

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
basically in a square we need to work

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.160 
basically in a square we need to work
our<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.320> other<00:00:49.410> side<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.039> square

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
our way to the other side of this square

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.510 
our way to the other side of this square
so<00:00:52.170> we're<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> run<00:00:53.070> our<00:00:53.250> needle

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
so we're just going to run our needle

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.330 
so we're just going to run our needle
and<00:00:53.610> thread<00:00:54.140> through<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.500> these<00:00:55.680> beads

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.310 

this<00:00:59.340> will<00:00:59.550> set<00:00:59.760> us<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.120> working<00:01:00.629> along<00:01:01.079> in

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
this will set us up for working along in

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.939 
this will set us up for working along in
the<00:01:01.440> basic<00:01:01.770> stitch<00:01:02.930> now<00:01:03.930> since<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.350> your

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the basic stitch now since you have your

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.219 
the basic stitch now since you have your
fourth<00:01:05.220> feed<00:01:05.489> already<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.869> pattern

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
fourth feed already on in this pattern

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.140 
fourth feed already on in this pattern
you're<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> ahead<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.000> add

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you're just going to go ahead and add

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
you're just going to go ahead and add
three<00:01:09.600> more<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:12.950> then<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> pass

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
three more and then you're going to pass

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.620 
three more and then you're going to pass
your<00:01:14.970> needle<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.360> thread<00:01:16.580> through<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.909> one

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
your needle and thread through that one

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
your needle and thread through that one
bead<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:23.780> when<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> pull<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.380> forming<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
bead and when you pull this up forming a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.510 
bead and when you pull this up forming a
loop<00:01:26.340> you'll<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.689> your<00:01:27.869> other<00:01:28.049> square

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
loop you'll see that your other square

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.520 
loop you'll see that your other square
is<00:01:30.409> attached<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> first<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:33.470> now<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
is attached to the first one now to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.450 
is attached to the first one now to
continue<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> pattern<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:37.500> need<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.950> go

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
continue the pattern on you need to go

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.039 
continue the pattern on you need to go
ahead<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.790> pass<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.270> needle<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.750> thread

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
ahead and pass that needle and thread

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
ahead and pass that needle and thread
through<00:01:40.530> two<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:40.890> beads<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:43.970> as<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.149> can

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
through two more beads and as you can

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.370 
through two more beads and as you can
see<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:47.430> forms<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> square<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:51.380> you'll

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
see this now forms the square and you'll

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 
see this now forms the square and you'll
just<00:01:52.560> continue<00:01:52.680> working<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.610> same<00:01:54.000> basic

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
just continue working in that same basic

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.100 
just continue working in that same basic
way<00:01:55.369> once<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.549> reach<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.030> length<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
way once you reach the length of a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
way once you reach the length of a
bracelet<00:01:58.680> or<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> necklace<00:01:58.950> whichever<00:01:59.670> you've

bracelet or a necklace whichever you've

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.990 
bracelet or a necklace whichever you've
decided<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.420> make<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.920> also<00:02:02.130> add<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
decided to make you can also add a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.630 
decided to make you can also add a
second<00:02:03.390> row<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.890> you'll<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.280> work<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
second row so you'll just work that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.930 
second row so you'll just work that
second<00:02:06.090> row<00:02:06.210> back<00:02:06.540> along<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.979> first<00:02:08.489> row<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
second row back along the first row that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.809 
second row back along the first row that
you<00:02:09.060> started<00:02:10.220> after<00:02:11.220> you've<00:02:11.489> learned<00:02:11.670> this

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
you started after you've learned this

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.870 
you started after you've learned this
basic<00:02:12.270> stitch

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
basic stitch

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.420 
basic stitch
then<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:14.380> can<00:02:14.560> embellish<00:02:14.860> them<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.340> the
