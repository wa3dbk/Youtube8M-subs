00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.699
 very good all new video a new 

00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:07.569
 video that good that many of you will already have 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:10.599
 read over there about the spin-off of 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:15.450
 Harry Potter agreed that 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:19.840
 it will be a trilogy the story against 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.050
 well it will not be 70 years worth 70 of 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:29.620
 the events that there was harry potter of 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:34.510
 before 70 and good agreement which still 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:37.300
 is looking is if the trilogy is 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.380
 will base on the animal book 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.650
 fantastic and where to find them is worth 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:50.790
 a book that he did 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:53.250
 a magician called new man there a 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.100
 name a little ugly and good is us 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.710
 looking at whether the whole theology will be based on 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 this little book a book that consists 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.520
 a few pages if I'm not wrong 80 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.070
 to 90 little ones then the fear that gives 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.860
 is to make a trilogy with a book of 80 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.440
 pages so you can fall short 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.290
 then what is being whispered by 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.510
 there is that trilogy every movie 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.610
 be a different book than the first 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.100
 book be fantastic animals and where 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.320
 find them and the second and the third 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.350
 Maybe maybe he's out there saying 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.170
 what could be the care book 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.450
 through the times and the other book of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.100
 the tales of beedle the bard 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.830
 they are things that are said but in principle 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.040
 what yes yes yes 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.530
 it is known that the book of animals 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.060
 fantastic and where to find them 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.250
 will draw from this book but the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.329
 Miss Rowling is writing 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.729
 now the script about this book the 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.140
 first first film of the trilogy 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.820
 and we'll see what will happen with the second 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.310
 and third part is worth not knowing 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.610
 nothing for that reason that 's why 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.000
 out there saying that it's already going to be that 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.190
 out other two books that also that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.620
 they are also from the magician this news scan 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.100
 under is worth this magic here they name 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.580
 as magical logo worth 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.460
 well this man out of the books 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.460
 he was a magician and wrote books of the 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.040
 animals and two others looked after him and that of 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.860
 the tales of beedle the bard then 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.390
 Well we'll be talking about that but 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.630
 good to know that the spin-off is already 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.920
 in progress triology 70 years before 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.010
 would happen from harry potter those and cameos 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.100
 cameos of actors that we had seen in 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.480
 the saga of harry potter 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.810
 are canceled at 80% but there is good 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.910
 point that maybe albus dumbledore 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.520
 is out there be there because he 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.230
 I sign the books of this wizard worth of 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.900
 level scan under and his signature in the book 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.750
 supposedly and maybe yes that we see the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.630
 love albus dumbledore this is the way 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.300
 which is could it appear 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.040
 of the rest harry potter hermione ron and 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.010
 all the christs of the meadow these 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.470
 they will work out because 70 years before 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.360
 as they are not invincible I doubt that 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.660
 existed at that time so nothing 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.610
 guys we hold on tight that another comes 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.800
 another saga of harry potter with jk rowling 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.680
 jk rowling and warner bros and nothing else 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.680
 guys, hello and we put in goodbye videos
