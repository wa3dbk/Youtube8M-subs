00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.960 
pretty disappointed at this cute Millia
usually<00:00:19.859> has<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.189> good<00:00:20.310> products<00:00:20.789> but

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
usually has really good products but

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.519 
usually has really good products but
it's<00:00:21.119> fun<00:00:21.240> really<00:00:21.449> didn't<00:00:21.750> quite<00:00:22.140> hit<00:00:22.320> it

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it's fun really didn't quite hit it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.040 
it's fun really didn't quite hit it
I<00:00:22.680> probably<00:00:23.369> hoping<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> version<00:00:24.750> T

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I probably hoping for the version T

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.390 
I probably hoping for the version T
which<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.380> know<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.680> already<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.039> works<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
which I know is already in the works to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.269 
which I know is already in the works to
be<00:00:26.460> better<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:27.230> sorry<00:00:28.230> I'm<00:00:28.410> an<00:00:28.560> Q<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.039> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
be better I'm sorry I'm an Q but I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.700 
be better I'm sorry I'm an Q but I
definitely<00:00:29.760> compared<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.929> new<00:00:31.230> shank<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
definitely compared it to a new shank to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
definitely compared it to a new shank to
Cuba<00:00:32.099> as<00:00:32.189> I've<00:00:32.550> tried<00:00:32.759> those<00:00:32.940> before<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
Cuba as I've tried those before and

despite the fact that I won't get too

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.110 
despite the fact that I won't get too
much<00:00:57.739> I'm<00:00:58.739> sure<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> there's<00:00:59.520> some<00:00:59.609> odds<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
much I'm sure that there's some odds and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420 
much I'm sure that there's some odds and
spring<00:01:00.530> adjustments<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.829> thou<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
spring adjustments you can do thou a to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.850 
spring adjustments you can do thou a to
make<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.670> better<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.090> I'll<00:01:03.750> leave<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.140> some

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
make it better but I'll leave it to some

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.550 
make it better but I'll leave it to some
younger<00:01:05.309> keepers<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> figure<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.210> out

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
younger keepers to figure that out

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.440 
younger keepers to figure that out
for<00:01:07.560> specifics<00:01:08.130> who<00:01:08.790> turns<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.270> really

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
for specifics who turns out really

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
for specifics who turns out really
smoothly<00:01:09.950> all<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> layers<00:01:11.310> they<00:01:11.760> turn

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
smoothly all the layers they turn

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.780 
smoothly all the layers they turn
smoothly<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.500> feels<00:01:13.680> very<00:01:13.770> nice<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.640> only

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
smoothly and it feels very nice the only

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
smoothly and it feels very nice the only
problem<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> team<00:01:15.600> feels<00:01:15.900> loose<00:01:16.350> in

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
problem is that the team feels loose in

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
problem is that the team feels loose in
general<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.159> try<00:01:17.610> tightening<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.270> bit

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
general I try tightening a little bit

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
general I try tightening a little bit
but<00:01:18.900> unfortunately<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.799> made<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> too<00:01:20.310> tight

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
but unfortunately it made it too tight

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.820 
but unfortunately it made it too tight
to<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.240> function<00:01:21.450> too<00:01:21.750> well<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.770> kind

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to really function too well so it's kind

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
to really function too well so it's kind

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
of tend to catch themselves which can

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
of tend to catch themselves which can
lead<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> trouble<00:01:28.020> lock<00:01:28.320> ups<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:28.799> small<00:01:29.189> lock

ups<00:01:29.610> there<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:31.020> too<00:01:31.229> many<00:01:31.380> issues

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
ups there are really are too many issues

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.940 
ups there are really are too many issues
with<00:01:31.710> popping<00:01:32.070> those<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.520> nice<00:01:32.930> for

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
with popping those that's nice for

with popping those that's nice for
