yes<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.160> wanted<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> find<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.579> things<00:00:44.879> like

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
yes I wanted to find out things like

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.930 
yes I wanted to find out things like
what<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.620> worldwide<00:00:47.039> community<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
what is the worldwide community of

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.860 
what is the worldwide community of
fly-fishing<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.719> how<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> similar<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
fly-fishing like how is it similar and

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.389 
fly-fishing like how is it similar and
where<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> contrasts<00:00:52.829> obviously

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
where are the contrasts obviously

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.040 
where are the contrasts obviously
between<00:00:53.550> Bahamas<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.420> Iceland<00:00:54.809> you're<00:00:54.930> going

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
between Bahamas and Iceland you're going

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.479 
between Bahamas and Iceland you're going
to<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> contrasts<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.309> more

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to see a lot of contrasts but more

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
to see a lot of contrasts but more
importantly<00:00:56.969> how<00:00:57.360> are<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> same<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
importantly how are they the same and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.510 
importantly how are they the same and
what<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.129> cool<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:01.079> put

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
what was cool is you can really put

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.830 
what was cool is you can really put
traveling<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.609> those<00:01:02.760> three<00:01:03.030> places<00:01:03.239> into<00:01:03.600> an

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
traveling to those three places into an

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
traveling to those three places into an
environmental<00:01:04.320> context<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.790> something

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
environmental context that's something

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.820 
environmental context that's something
that<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> found<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.900> similar<00:01:07.229> between<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that I found so similar between the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.740 
that I found so similar between the
three<00:01:08.070> guides<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.060> three<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> them

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
three guides that all three of them

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.240 
three guides that all three of them
cared<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> environment

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
cared so much for the environment

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.039 
cared so much for the environment
because<00:01:11.490> their<00:01:11.670> livelihood<00:01:12.270> depended<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
because their livelihood depended on it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.570 
because their livelihood depended on it
they<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.439> three<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.310> different

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
they all have three very different

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.580 
they all have three very different
relationships<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.600> their<00:01:15.750> environment<00:01:16.290> but

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
relationships with their environment but

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.830 
relationships with their environment but
really<00:01:17.250> they<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> same<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.600> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
really they all want the same thing so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.770 
really they all want the same thing so
it's<00:01:19.140> an<00:01:19.259> interesting<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:19.830> microcosm<00:01:20.640> for

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
it's an interesting little microcosm for

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's an interesting little microcosm for
the<00:01:21.780> fly-fishing<00:01:22.229> community<00:01:22.830> everyone<00:01:23.430> we

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the fly-fishing community everyone we

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.060 
the fly-fishing community everyone we
are<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.750> stand<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> strong<00:01:25.590> community

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
are we stand as a strong community

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
are we stand as a strong community
whether<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.850> Bahamas<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.659> whether
