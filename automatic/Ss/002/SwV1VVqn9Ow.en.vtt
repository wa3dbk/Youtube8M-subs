00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.380
hello friends, today is

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.809
February 8, I was

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.909
doing the grocery shopping and
I found this

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.099
this ginger root

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.119
that

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.440
It is sprouted, here you can see

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.000
the sprout

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.259
here... here ...

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.810
here I have a pot

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.070
having more or less a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.270
20 inches in diameter

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.230
they are two parts of the substrate that can be
vermicompost or may be

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.180
vermicompost and peat

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.030
and here we are going to put

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.100
one part of

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.280
perlite

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.010
so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.110
that

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.490
so that the soil is not compacted

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.680
ginger

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.240
is a plant which I imagined that was

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.980
suit for tropical climates

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.130
and it never occurred to me it would
grow but hey I saw that

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.140
it people grow it in spain

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.840
here

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.730
in colder climates such as Argentina
it is also planted so

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.370
eeee

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.270
why not

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.570
I can have my little plant

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.240
later I was told that, yesterday

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.370
I found out, my aunt has ginger in her
backyard

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.890
she told me that it is not a very pretty plant

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.000
the flower is very good , which is very
perfume , like a

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.170
like a lily, she told me

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.900
eeeee

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.470
and

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.480
and that is grows very well and healthy

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.620
I read that it is a plant that needs
shadow so

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.800
that is great because is not very common to have
plants for shade

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.710
put more perlite

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.120
eeee and later

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.510
is what I read is that in winter

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.000
it can , the plant can

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.430
leaves can get dried

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.130
and that's when

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.579
when you harvest

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.079
but my aunt told me that she never
saw the leaves get dried

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.609
so well, everyone will have to do his own experience

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.249
I put a little more ...

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:25.859
well now the most important part of the
Planting

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.359
Firt I tide this up

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.189
now

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.329
ginger root must be put horizontally

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.289
and with the sprouts facing up

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.859
here I have

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.319
I have eyes facing everywhere but well...
this is the cutest of all, I'll leave it

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.999
facing up

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:53.769
you have to place it to be , this is
very important

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.449
half outside

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:02.699
and half in

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.559
so, is is ,

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.609
supposedly

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.329
a little more centered

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.049
this is the correct way

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.479
to plant a ginger root

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.829
if

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.439
if the video was interesting to you

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.909
you can put like and
share it

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.799
and if it is the first video of
my channel that you are watching, well, you can see others

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.899
and you can subscribe

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:41.249
and I promise that if the ginger grows I will
be

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.989
uploading more videos

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.039
well

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.889
bye, hugs for all of you
