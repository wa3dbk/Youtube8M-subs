00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
in their castle there I think it's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.680 
in their castle there I think it's
arendelle<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.879> called<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.450> think

the<00:00:51.750> big<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:52.770> log

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950

bricks

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.450 
bricks
I<00:00:53.670> ordered<00:00:54.150> 2600<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> them<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.530> pull<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.220> roof

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
I ordered 2600 of them to pull this roof

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
I ordered 2600 of them to pull this roof
off<00:00:56.640> which<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.870> definitely<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.590> most<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.949> any

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
off which is definitely the most of any

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.010 
off which is definitely the most of any
one<00:00:59.280> piece<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> think<00:00:59.760> I've<00:01:00.059> purchased<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
one piece I think I've purchased at a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
one piece I think I've purchased at a
time<00:01:01.290> but<00:01:01.650> I<00:01:01.860> really<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:02.730> texture<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.360> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
time but I really like the texture and I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.850 
time but I really like the texture and I
think<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.780> paid<00:01:03.930> off<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.320> end

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
think it paid off in the end

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.070 
think it paid off in the end
her<00:01:05.369> dress<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.670> pretty<00:01:06.119> easy<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.840> was

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
her dress was pretty easy that was

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.100 
her dress was pretty easy that was
pretty<00:01:07.680> basic<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.270> building<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> head<00:01:09.600> I'm

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
pretty basic but building the head I'm

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.510 
pretty basic but building the head I'm
still<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.440> completely<00:01:10.860> happy<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.460> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
still not completely happy with it I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580 
still not completely happy with it I
ended<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.850> using<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> googly<00:01:12.720> Mixel<00:01:13.110> eyes<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
ended up using the googly Mixel eyes and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.180 
ended up using the googly Mixel eyes and
I<00:01:13.979> still<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.660> overly<00:01:16.619> cartoony

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
I still it's a little overly cartoony

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.660 
I still it's a little overly cartoony
perhaps<00:01:17.960> but<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> character<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.280> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
perhaps but with the character I was I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
perhaps but with the character I was I
was<00:01:21.090> happy<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.450> how<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> hair<00:01:21.840> came

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
was happy with how the hair came

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.160 
was happy with how the hair came
together<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.440> ended<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.770> using<00:01:23.300> it's<00:01:24.300> chicken

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
together I ended up using it's chicken

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.889 
together I ended up using it's chicken
chicken<00:01:25.979> legs<00:01:26.190> crescents<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.780> Oh

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
sticker connections just because there

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.870 
sticker connections just because there
were<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.890> wasn't<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.280> any<00:01:38.549> other<00:01:38.700> way

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
were there wasn't really any other way

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.430 
were there wasn't really any other way
to<00:01:38.940> do<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> scale<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.960> working<00:01:40.290> in

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
to do it at the scale I was working in

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.950 
to do it at the scale I was working in
but<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:41.940> one<00:01:42.090> thing<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.330> guess<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.630> would<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
but that was one thing I guess I would I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.930 
but that was one thing I guess I would I
was<00:01:43.170> pretty<00:01:43.409> pleased<00:01:43.650> with<00:01:43.830> how<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.979> figure

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
was pretty pleased with how the figure

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.450 
was pretty pleased with how the figure
came<00:01:45.150> together<00:01:45.330> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> end<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:47.100> rest<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
came together in the end the rest of the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.280 
came together in the end the rest of the
build<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.820> fairly<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.630> mean<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.140> not

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
build was fairly I mean it's not

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.630 
build was fairly I mean it's not
extremely<00:01:50.070> complex

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
extremely complex

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
extremely complex
I<00:01:50.760> planned<00:01:51.299> most<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.930> my<00:01:52.080> head

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
I planned most of it out in my head

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
I planned most of it out in my head
which<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:52.920> usually<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.030> one

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
which I don't usually do but this one

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.490 
which I don't usually do but this one
was<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.689> okay<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.049> how<00:01:55.229> I'll<00:01:55.350> do

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
was just like okay I know how I'll do

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.410 
was just like okay I know how I'll do
that<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> ordered<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> pieces<00:01:56.970> then<00:01:57.299> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that and ordered all the pieces then it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
that and ordered all the pieces then it
came<00:01:57.570> together

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
came together

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.579
