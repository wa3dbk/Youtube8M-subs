that way anyway so I'm just going to go
ahead<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> use<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> regular<00:01:03.559> 9-inch<00:01:04.559> round

inch<00:01:09.990> pan<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:11.369> work<00:01:11.520> just

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
inch pan that you have would work just

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
inch pan that you have would work just
fine<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:11.970> I've<00:01:12.330> sprayed<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> our

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
fine and I've sprayed this so that our

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.830 
fine and I've sprayed this so that our
cake<00:01:14.310> won't<00:01:14.549> stick<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> want<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> get

about<00:01:16.020> half<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:16.350> batter<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.460> pan<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
about half my batter into that pan so I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.910 
about half my batter into that pan so I
usually<00:01:18.990> kind<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.200> draw<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> line<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
usually kind of draw a line in the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.200 
usually kind of draw a line in the
middle<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.090> I'm

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
middle just so that I can see what I'm

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
middle just so that I can see what I'm
shooting<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.860> about<00:01:23.100> what

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
shooting for here so that's about what

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.890 
shooting for here so that's about what
half<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> batter<00:01:23.880> looks<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:24.780> I'm

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
half the batter looks like and then I'm

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.819 
half the batter looks like and then I'm
just<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> scoop<00:01:26.040> some<00:01:26.280> into<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
just going to scoop some into here and I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.210 
just going to scoop some into here and I
am<00:01:29.250> betting<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.850> fat<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.570> half<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.100> I'll

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
am betting the fat is half and then I'll

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.590 
am betting the fat is half and then I'll
just<00:01:32.430> spread<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.240> bit<00:01:33.390> with

I'm<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> use<00:01:42.540> my<00:01:42.689> hands<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.140> this

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
I'm going to use my hands for this

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.800 
I'm going to use my hands for this
because<00:01:44.430> our<00:01:44.670> mixture<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.060> kind<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.420> crumbly

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
because our mixture is kind of crumbly

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.660 
because our mixture is kind of crumbly
so<00:01:46.799> again<00:01:47.009> I'm<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> kind<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so again I'm just going to kind of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
so again I'm just going to kind of
divide<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.299> half<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
divide that in half so I know what I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.910 
divide that in half so I know what I
made<00:01:49.560> before<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.500> I'm<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.740> going

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
made before here and then I'm just going

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.499 
made before here and then I'm just going
to<00:01:53.009> take<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.250> cinnamon<00:01:53.790> sugar<00:01:54.000> mixture<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to take that cinnamon sugar mixture and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:03.090 
to take that cinnamon sugar mixture and
crumble<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.079> right<00:01:55.380> over<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> top

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.380 

so<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.190> can<00:02:04.310> see<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:04.670> kind<00:02:04.820> of<00:02:04.850> chunky<00:02:05.060> in

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
so you can see it's kind of chunky in

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.109 
so you can see it's kind of chunky in
there<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.710> that's<00:02:06.920> okay<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.550> doesn't<00:02:07.880> have<00:02:08.030> to

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
there and that's okay it doesn't have to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.900 
there and that's okay it doesn't have to
be<00:02:08.240> perfect

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.280 

I'll<00:02:13.910> just<00:02:14.090> get<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.300> nice<00:02:14.510> layer<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.170> in

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
I'll just get a nice layer of it in

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.330 
I'll just get a nice layer of it in
there<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.450> then<00:02:18.290> I'm<00:02:18.620> gonna<00:02:18.800> put<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.070> rest<00:02:19.250> of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
there and then I'm gonna put the rest of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.910 
there and then I'm gonna put the rest of
my<00:02:19.460> batter<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> top<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.530> I'm<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.830> gonna

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.620

scoop<00:02:25.340> out<00:02:25.490> all<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.940> rest<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.300> bag<00:02:26.450> of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
scoop out all the rest of the bag of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.450 
scoop out all the rest of the bag of
that<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.620> I'll<00:02:27.740> kind<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.070> spread<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.950 
that I have and I'll kind of spread that
over<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.060> top<00:02:29.270> here<00:02:29.980> as<00:02:31.300> best<00:02:32.300> as<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.630> can<00:02:32.690> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.660 
over the top here as best as I can and
then<00:02:33.260> I'll<00:02:33.440> finish<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.920> out<00:02:34.010> with<00:02:34.510> my<00:02:35.510> spatula

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.880 

here<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.760> go<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:42.350> now<00:02:42.440> I'm<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.710> going<00:02:42.830> to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
to the edges and I might have a little

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.520 
to the edges and I might have a little
bit<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.360> cinnamon<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.840> sugar<00:02:48.140> peeking

you can kind of just wiggle your spatula
back<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.490> forth<00:02:55.730> that's<00:02:56.630> an<00:02:56.810> easy<00:02:56.990> way<00:02:57.170> to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
back and forth that's an easy way to

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.720 
back and forth that's an easy way to
kind<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.530> move<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.830> batter<00:02:58.070> around<00:02:58.520> so<00:02:58.700> that
