00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
does not go in the motor this one

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.850 
does not go in the motor this one
actually<00:01:29.250> goes<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> arms<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.530> bottom

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
actually goes on the arms of the bottom

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.140 
actually goes on the arms of the bottom
of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> Phantom<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> we'll<00:01:32.670> show<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.909> where

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
of the Phantom and we'll show you where

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.600 
of the Phantom and we'll show you where
that<00:01:33.329> goes<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.079> minute<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.560> next<00:01:35.490> one

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that goes in just a minute the next one

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.870 
that goes in just a minute the next one
in<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> lineup<00:01:37.220> if<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.400> measure<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
in the lineup if you measure the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.510 
in the lineup if you measure the
threading<00:01:39.360> down<00:01:39.829> it'll<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.220> about<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
threading down it'll be right about a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.990 
threading down it'll be right about a
quarter<00:01:41.880> inch<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.720> bolt<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.670> is

the landing gear now there's eight of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.350 
the landing gear now there's eight of
these<00:02:26.790> total<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.530> landing<00:02:28.860> gear<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.879> just

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
these total on the landing gear so just

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.080 
these total on the landing gear so just
a<00:02:30.480> typical<00:02:31.250> Phillips<00:02:32.250> head<00:02:32.430> screwdriver<00:02:32.970> you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
a typical Phillips head screwdriver you

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.710 
a typical Phillips head screwdriver you
can<00:02:33.180> take<00:02:33.420> those<00:02:33.569> off<00:02:35.360> now<00:02:36.360> we'll<00:02:36.510> show<00:02:36.540> you

can take those off now we'll show you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.819 
can take those off now we'll show you
where<00:02:36.989> each<00:02:37.319> one<00:02:38.010> goes<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.319> first<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.709> we

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
where each one goes so the first one we

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.309 
where each one goes so the first one we
talked<00:02:41.069> about<00:02:41.299> was<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.329> screw<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.930> goes<00:02:43.079> on

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
talked about was the screw that goes on

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.220 
talked about was the screw that goes on
the<00:02:43.439> end<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.950> arm<00:02:44.159> and<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.720> goes<00:02:45.900> right

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the end of the arm and that goes right

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.839 
the end of the arm and that goes right
inside<00:02:46.440> here<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.420> screws<00:02:49.019> down<00:02:52.609> and<00:02:53.609> you<00:02:53.700> want

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
inside here and screws down and you want

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.330 
inside here and screws down and you want
to<00:02:53.909> put<00:02:54.090> one<00:02:54.359> of<00:02:54.480> those<00:02:54.659> on<00:02:54.989> each<00:02:55.470> arm

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.970 

the<00:02:59.340> next<00:02:59.609> screw<00:03:02.930> with<00:03:03.930> allen<00:03:04.349> heads<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:04.799> them

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
the next screw with allen heads on them

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.300 
the next screw with allen heads on them
so<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.879> there<00:03:06.090> are<00:03:06.150> two<00:03:06.269> different<00:03:06.629> links

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
so and there are two different links

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.740 
so and there are two different links
it's<00:03:08.310> very<00:03:08.519> easy<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.970> get<00:03:09.060> these<00:03:09.239> two<00:03:09.480> messed

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
it's very easy to get these two messed

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.149 
it's very easy to get these two messed
up<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.159> longer<00:03:11.579> one<00:03:11.780> goes<00:03:12.780> into<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.889> motor

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
up so the longer one goes into the motor

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:21.710 
up so the longer one goes into the motor
mount<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:16.940> you'll<00:03:17.940> screw<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.389> down<00:03:20.720> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
mount and you'll screw that down the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.610 
mount and you'll screw that down the
shorter<00:03:22.199> one<00:03:23.449> goes<00:03:24.449> into<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.019> body<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
shorter one goes into the body of the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.800 
shorter one goes into the body of the
Phantom<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.359> we'll<00:03:27.359> show<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.599> that<00:03:27.720> next<00:03:29.810> so

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
Phantom and we'll show you that next so

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.449 
Phantom and we'll show you that next so
we<00:03:30.900> were<00:03:31.019> talking<00:03:31.199> about<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.799> body<00:03:32.010> screws

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
we were talking about the body screws

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.589 
we were talking about the body screws
the<00:03:33.150> body<00:03:33.359> screws<00:03:33.980> go<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.269> three<00:03:36.269> different

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
the body screws go in three different

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.849 
the body screws go in three different
locations<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.440> arm

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
locations on the arm

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.990 
locations on the arm
they<00:03:38.549> got<00:03:38.730> one<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.530> one<00:03:40.530> here<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.129> one<00:03:41.280> here

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
they got one here one here and one here

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.869 
they got one here one here and one here
and<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.569> long<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.019> deeper<00:03:43.410> hole<00:03:43.879> one

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
and the long and the deeper hole one

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.750 
and the long and the deeper hole one
here<00:03:45.209> one<00:03:45.419> here<00:03:45.449> one<00:03:46.349> here<00:03:46.379> and<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.370> same<00:03:47.579> on

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
here one here one here and the same on

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.869 
here one here one here and the same on
the<00:03:47.849> other<00:03:48.000> two<00:03:48.239> arms<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.650> when<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.430> go<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.609> put

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
the other two arms so when you go to put

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.900 
the other two arms so when you go to put
back<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.829> allen<00:03:52.829> bolt<00:03:53.129> remember<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.669> this

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
back this allen bolt remember that this

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.240 
back this allen bolt remember that this
is<00:03:54.120> going<00:03:54.359> to<00:03:54.419> be<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.780> shorter<00:03:55.169> one<00:03:55.349> of<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
is going to be the shorter one of the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.759 
is going to be the shorter one of the
two<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.750> we'll<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.049> go<00:04:04.199> ahead<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.470> put<00:04:04.620> that

two and we'll just go ahead and put that
one<00:04:04.889> back<00:04:04.919> in

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
one back in

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.820 
one back in
okay<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.130> last<00:04:08.370> but<00:04:08.850> not<00:04:08.880> least<00:04:09.300> is<00:04:09.830> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
landing gear Phillips head screw there's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.930 
landing gear Phillips head screw there's
two<00:04:16.890> on<00:04:17.070> each<00:04:17.310> arm

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
two on each arm

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.080 
two on each arm
of<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.300> landing<00:04:18.630> gear<00:04:20.150> this<00:04:21.150> goes<00:04:21.420> on<00:04:21.630> there

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
of the landing gear this goes on there

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.950 
of the landing gear this goes on there
and<00:04:24.090> then<00:04:24.870> we<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:24.960> tighten<00:04:25.290> that<00:04:25.500> back<00:04:25.710> down

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960
