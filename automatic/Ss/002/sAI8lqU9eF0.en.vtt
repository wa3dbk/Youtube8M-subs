00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.769
 OK 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:14.139

 video tutorial and as promised 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.700
 debt in a few previous videos I said that 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.680
 would go up the tutorial how to do 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.869
 you can put your name of your character and 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.189
 all in the sky of minecraft your own 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.710
 texture pack or in a couple of 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.199
 different textures that you have is not 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.269
 very easy and I will show you how to do it 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.680
 first the first thing that they are going to do is 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.420
 that are going to download the file that 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.430
 I will leave in the description that goes to 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.979
 contain that it will contain this 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.710
 file that says cloud 1 that has this 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.210
 then it has an image we are going to 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.170
 extract so that they look at what is 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.059
 it is a simple image we see it and if it 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.040
 they fix is ​​like some very realistic clouds 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.960
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.400
 edit in photoshop in any version 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.369
 that you have, we are not going to edit 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.979
 just let's just let's open it 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.150
 open it let's see everything I have 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:09.570
 here 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:12.180
 is here here we open this quickly 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.960
 and there he is going to put it to this one says 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.610
 indexed what we have to put is 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:22.060
 image mode and color rgb since what 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.490
 let's have color rgb we can start 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.740
 edit our image what we are going to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.870
 to do is to open another image again 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.690
 where we have our here our skin 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.610
 sorry ok I have here are you 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.740
 clear that they will have an image 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.840
 so that as long as they want 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.340
 can make it a page that is nova 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.830
 skin I'll leave the link also in 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.869
 the description or they can also do it 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.350
 in cinema 4d if they have this program what 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.830
 they can do 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.050
 there are some videos before or after 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.119
 this business there are previous videos in 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.800
 where I have how to make a corner in 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.750
 3-d in that program so if you want 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.660
 go to see it you can do it here 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.790
 then we are going to open this and since we 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.300
 open this because we will put who we 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.790
 says image and where it says size of 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.100
 image and then then we can put 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.630
 a small image for example I do not know 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.390
 about 500 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.920
 let's see if the 500 goes well to see 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.330
 if here is exactly 500 ok already 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.130
 we can stop here we grab the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.460
 move tool and simply 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.230
 we move from here to here and then 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.880
 that we have it here we can arm it in 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.790
 any part to me I always like 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.730
 how to see her here I do not know why and then 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.310
 Now, what we are going to do is easily 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.950
 add a text then we do more or 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.110
 less something like around here and I do not know we can 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.640
 put your name logically or if 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.160
 they want some other text so they can 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.460
 put I'm going to put my name we're going 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.800
 to put samurai pride we want to have 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.020
 samurai 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.230
 what is the error is that it is very large 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.800
 the letter would be to have hundreds effects 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.650
 almost and weekly ok since we have 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.480
 our text well done we can here in 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.060
 where is the text layer 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.530
 we give it where it says to master text 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.120
 we give you here where the text is placed 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.190
 we give you right click and it says drag 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.440
 text since this reusable we give two 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.390
 click here where those little squares are 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.960
 we give two clicks and this appears 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.420
 window 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.660
 and look closely at the text we can go 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.530
 activating this we can go activating this 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.960
 is all this the stroke is very 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.440
 well we can make it have more stroke 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.200
 well and then we can put men 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.480
 interior glow to see when with 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.820
 the glow and its precision of 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.040
 gradients you should put playing with this 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.770
 how many times do you want for example 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.470
 we put this look like it 's like 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.740
 would look and then then once done 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.050
 This is because we have our name 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.240
 written in the sky fucking what 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.670
 we already have all this because 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.520
 logically we save it we can save 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.290
 how this is very important where 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.000
 says in photoshop format not the biggest 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.330
 saves in photoshop but they are going to 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.910
 put in png ok format since you have a 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.430
 png format save it and put it cloud 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.000
 1 very important that they do not change the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.010
 first name 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.750
 ok because we're not going to change the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.120
 name because basically if we eat a 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.859
 man the minecraft gives us an error like this 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.230
 that we have to save it and then 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.030
 says the file already exists you want 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.400
 replace what we are going to put him 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.700
 because since we have it we put it ok 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.370
 and automatically we will be saved 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.620
 Once this is done we will see and see for 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.560
 see how the picture ended and here as 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.110
 come and my character is there and the name ok 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.660
 what are we going to do, let's go to our 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.060
 minecraft point folder here now point 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.930
 minecraft and then we go where it says 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.550
 resources packs we got there in the text 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.680
 I want to I'll put my 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.710
 bear what I have we put it in everything 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.190
 says assets where minecraft says and in 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.730
 where it says more to cher we put there and 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.919
 where it says sky and from there to word 0 and 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.440
 where cloud 1 says we're going to see it 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.990
 let's see preview and here as 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.730
 is what the pack would have by default 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.980
 of textures that you downloaded 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.570
 previously because to do this it 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.800
 they need my textures pack that 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.150
 true also leave them in the 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.070
 description 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.630
 everything related to my part and 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.450
 textures because I for that textures 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.320
 because there is a part of structures that 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.540
 they have it as I will tell you this property 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.030
 of having the sky so realistic he does not 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.340
 has a Nestor so I would recommend them 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.200
 to make and use basic and pack 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.780
 textures so that they do not have any type 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.010
 of error ok then what we would do 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.960
 would do this we give you here where 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.850
 says copy or cut like you 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.100
 want and we give right click and you 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.600
 we paste ok then says fate has 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.670
 come to fear Cloud 1 file 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.620
 we have to replace the file 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.360
 then since we replaced it once 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.960
 we give you preview to go back to 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.120
 see it and as you see, this has already changed 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.890
 what is changed then we can open 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.510
 the minecraft ok i'm going to make a little 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.700
 cut in what opens the minecraft and 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.310
 others so now the return 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.950
 ok and now yes since we are here in the 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.260
 minecraft the only thing we're going to see is 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.410
 this beautiful realistic sky that looks 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.540
 our sun also realistic and then 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.750
 then here is the surprise since 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.730
 is done this chan chan chan is already 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.290

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.530
