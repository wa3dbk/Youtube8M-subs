00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
take a lot of time but that could be

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.360 
take a lot of time but that could be
something<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.230> add<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.590> week<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.250> know

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.800 
that I think that go down really well
and<00:03:34.620> hopefully<00:03:35.010> all<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.180> effort<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.570> put<00:03:36.630> into

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and hopefully all the effort I put into

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.530 
and hopefully all the effort I put into
it<00:03:37.020> will<00:03:37.230> sure<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.830> was<00:03:38.130> also<00:03:38.280> thinking<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
it will sure I was also thinking of a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.510 
it will sure I was also thinking of a
lot<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.320> people<00:03:40.560> want<00:03:41.360> reaction<00:03:42.360> videos<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:43.520> did

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
lot of people want reaction videos I did

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.430 
lot of people want reaction videos I did
I<00:03:44.550> never<00:03:44.820> really<00:03:45.120> recorded<00:03:45.660> voice<00:03:45.870> for<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.290> lot

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
I never really recorded voice for a lot

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.980 
I never really recorded voice for a lot
of<00:03:46.530> my<00:03:46.680> Clips<00:03:47.040> only<00:03:47.970> recently<00:03:48.360> ever<00:03:48.570> started

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
of my Clips only recently ever started

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.430 
of my Clips only recently ever started
recording<00:03:49.230> voice<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.220> I'd<00:03:50.700> have<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.300> look<00:03:51.720> back

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
recording voice so I'd have to look back

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.700 
recording voice so I'd have to look back
on<00:03:52.500> older<00:03:52.980> clips<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.610> all<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.000> cards<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.710> try

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
on older clips on all the cards and try

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.230 
on older clips on all the cards and try
and<00:03:55.770> find<00:03:56.040> somewhere<00:03:56.580> I<00:03:56.640> actually<00:03:56.940> get<00:03:57.180> a

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
and find somewhere I actually get a

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.170 
and find somewhere I actually get a
reaction<00:03:57.830> because<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.890> do<00:03:58.950> play<00:03:59.250> alone<00:03:59.490> well<00:04:00.150> a

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
reaction because I do play alone well a

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.080 
reaction because I do play alone well a
lot<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.660> time<00:04:00.870> when<00:04:01.050> I've<00:04:01.170> hit<00:04:01.320> big<00:04:01.500> clips

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
lot of the time when I've hit big clips

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.430 
lot of the time when I've hit big clips
or<00:04:03.090> sometimes<00:04:03.600> it's<00:04:03.690> just<00:04:03.780> with<00:04:04.050> one<00:04:04.200> or<00:04:04.320> two

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
or sometimes it's just with one or two

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.840 
or sometimes it's just with one or two
people<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.920> never<00:04:05.100> really<00:04:05.220> play<00:04:05.490> in<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.670> big

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
because that could be another video so i

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.790 
because that could be another video so i
think<00:04:20.850> i'm<00:04:21.180> planning<00:04:21.600> well<00:04:22.290> last<00:04:22.470> time<00:04:22.620> i<00:04:22.680> did

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
think i'm planning well last time i did

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.210 
think i'm planning well last time i did
for<00:04:23.160> videos<00:04:23.520> this

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
for videos this

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.840 
for videos this
maybe<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.880> could<00:04:25.180> do<00:04:25.590> five<00:04:26.590> or<00:04:26.620> more<00:04:27.160> depends

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
maybe I could do five or more depends

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.990 
maybe I could do five or more depends
how<00:04:28.090> how<00:04:28.450> many<00:04:28.690> good<00:04:28.870> ideas<00:04:28.900> i<00:04:29.320> get<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:30.730> right

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
how how many good ideas i get so right

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.020 
how how many good ideas i get so right
there<00:04:31.380> if<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.650> go<00:04:32.830> ahead<00:04:33.070> with<00:04:33.220> those<00:04:33.400> that's

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
there if I go ahead with those that's

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.150 
there if I go ahead with those that's
three<00:04:34.450> so<00:04:34.900> I've<00:04:35.050> already<00:04:35.230> got<00:04:35.440> one<00:04:35.620> solid<00:04:36.010> one

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
three so I've already got one solid one

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.830 
three so I've already got one solid one
which<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.490> montage<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:36.940> reaction<00:04:37.540> video

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
which is a montage the reaction video

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.230 
which is a montage the reaction video
won't<00:04:38.080> take<00:04:38.470> much<00:04:38.710> effort<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.460> put<00:04:40.120> together

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
won't take much effort to put together

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.980 
won't take much effort to put together
so<00:04:40.870> i<00:04:41.140> could<00:04:41.440> probably<00:04:41.650> do<00:04:41.830> that<00:04:41.890> anyway<00:04:42.430> and

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
so i could probably do that anyway and

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.150 
so i could probably do that anyway and
the<00:04:43.990> cyber<00:04:44.230> tips<00:04:44.440> video<00:04:44.680> is<00:04:44.800> going<00:04:44.920> to<00:04:45.010> take<00:04:45.130> a
