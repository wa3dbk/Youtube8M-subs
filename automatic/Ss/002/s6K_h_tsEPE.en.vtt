00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.330
 the personal beauty and junior wilson 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.850
 electrical and informatics 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.890
 today we are going to measure color temperature 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.570
 and rocks a dream with a processor 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.949
 four-minute intel 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.630
 first we will measure the temperature 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.269
 with him 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.449
 factory original and then let's 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:33.290
 to test this course is a little 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.240
 cooler master that is the 612 rapper say 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.190
 on some specialized sites that arrive 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.050
 temperature up to 20 degrees 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.300
 best processor and then we 'll go 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.700
 voting proves this too this size 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.160
 really makes the difference 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.820
 heavy and take the staff it almost a 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.610
 kilo 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.560
 so let's see the proof of fire after the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.750
 people come back with the results too 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:01:00.260
 come out next video is to show you 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.480
 what we'll use to attest to 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.890
 temperature of the processor is personal 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.439
 we'll still use 64 simply 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.590
 to measure temperature ne 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.049
 and to make the same processor bath 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.350
 We're going to the beach and 95 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.210
 this version in km 95 and 64 bits we 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.670
 we are using windows 8 64 bit is 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.590
 the June motherboard will get you 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.229
 now that the test advantage 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.569
 we have a quad core processor 2 that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.369
 95 50 more because we have one 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.280
 processor for a faster processor. 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.780
 that consumes a lot and dissipates a lot 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.240
 heat, huh? 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.999
 so it's good the advantage of it that people 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.139
 will be able to see if the rider really 612 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:52.939
 shots 20 degrees as promised even 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:56.179
 So let's leave ten minutes. 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.389
 the km 95 running for it to reach 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.340
 temperature and then we 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:03.229
 returns to a temperature that 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.909
 We are arrived 42 minutes 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.909
 also personal 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.200
 Hey guys, 10 minutes ago surprise 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.240
 running today will get you to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.130
 little stock temperature has arrived and now 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.620
 We'll do the reverse. 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.300
 We are going to change the stock cooler through 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.150
 ray for 612 leave another ten minutes in the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.050
 bath and then we come back to show 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.570
 for you 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.030
 and at the end of this video I'll leave a 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.400
 graph to make it easier to read 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:49.950
 temperatures is a person back now 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.950
 with piper 612 cooler already installed 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.880
 you can not tell if it 's a motherboard with 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.459
 cooler is a club with a motherboard so 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.239
 great that it is today I assert to 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.970
 Do you have the temperature in Aragon and from here? 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.820
 ten minutes after the crime 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.540
 we like the final temperatures 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.360
 thanks guys 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.290
 after ten minutes of the trading session, 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.000
 already concluded and harper 612 you can see 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.739
 the result the temperature is going to pick up 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.580
 You never dropped 20 as promised. 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.430
 but is floating around 17 18 and 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.320
 give a fuck 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.820
 It is really very good very 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.310
 rather than stock 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.660
 although he is great he is very 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.730
 pretty 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.670
 who has a case with a lid 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.549
 acrylic will be able to choose whether wedge 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.959
 modifies very cool 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.620
 so this is personal, I hope you have 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.989
 liked if they liked a like iron 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.910
 item that helps a lot in publicizing the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.900
 channel 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.900
 Thanks guys until the next
