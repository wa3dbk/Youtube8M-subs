00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
tell it how to behave so I think it's

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.899 
tell it how to behave so I think it's
really<00:01:36.720> limiting<00:01:37.170> i<00:01:37.380> developed<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.459> powered

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
really limiting i developed a powered

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.840 
really limiting i developed a powered
prosthesis<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.750> uses<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.950> apts<00:01:41.340> muscle

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
prosthesis that uses the apts muscle

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
prosthesis that uses the apts muscle
activation<00:01:42.060> signal<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.929> their<00:01:43.110> residual

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
activation signal and their residual

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
activation signal and their residual
muscle<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.250> control<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.789> mechanics<00:01:45.209> of<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
muscle to control the mechanics of the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.830 
muscle to control the mechanics of the
foot<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.039> means<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.450> apt

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
foot so this means that when the apt

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.139 
foot so this means that when the apt
thinks<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.649> contracting<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.189> muscle<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
thinks about contracting the muscle that

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.319 
thinks about contracting the muscle that
signal<00:01:51.780> from<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> muscle<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:53.009> sent<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
signal from the muscle is sent to the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.139 
signal from the muscle is sent to the
controller<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> foot<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:56.640> leg<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.969> have

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
controller for the foot the leg I have

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.289 
controller for the foot the leg I have
right<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.689> there's<00:01:58.439> not<00:01:58.920> much<00:01:59.250> pushback<00:01:59.670> or

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
right now there's not much pushback or

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.529 
right now there's not much pushback or
control<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> prosthesis<00:02:02.909> she<00:02:03.299> has

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
control so with the prosthesis she has

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.959 
control so with the prosthesis she has
I'm<00:02:03.899> controlling<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:04.920> an<00:02:05.429> amputee<00:02:05.670> that's

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
I'm controlling it as an amputee that's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.580 
I'm controlling it as an amputee that's

really important to be able to have

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.690 
really important to be able to have

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
this prosthesis that it can almost take

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.560 
this prosthesis that it can almost take
an<00:02:54.650> amputee<00:02:55.040> back<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.760> what<00:02:56.090> they<00:02:56.209> would<00:02:56.360> say

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
an amputee back to what they would say

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.050 
an amputee back to what they would say
was<00:02:56.750> normal<00:02:57.170> for<00:02:57.200> them<00:02:57.620> they<00:02:58.489> think<00:02:58.820> about

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
was normal for them they think about

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.020 
was normal for them they think about
doing<00:02:59.300> something<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.959> happens<00:03:00.520> when<00:03:01.520> the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
doing something and it happens when the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.210 
doing something and it happens when the
amputees<00:03:02.540> use<00:03:02.959> these<00:03:03.230> devices<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:04.070> are

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
amputees use these devices that are

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.949 
amputees use these devices that are
actually<00:03:04.520> in<00:03:04.790> control<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.209> their<00:03:05.450> own<00:03:05.480> muscles

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
actually in control of their own muscles

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.530 
actually in control of their own muscles
they<00:03:06.560> get<00:03:06.800> very<00:03:07.010> strong<00:03:07.459> emotional<00:03:08.000> responses

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
they get very strong emotional responses

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
they get very strong emotional responses
because<00:03:08.630> they<00:03:08.780> feel<00:03:09.020> like<00:03:09.050> it's<00:03:09.350> their<00:03:09.500> own

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
because they feel like it's their own

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.210 
because they feel like it's their own
leg<00:03:09.950> what<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:10.910> provided<00:03:11.270> me<00:03:11.630> emotionally<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.440> a

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
leg what is provided me emotionally is a

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.910 
leg what is provided me emotionally is a
sense<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:14.030> pride<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.930> know<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.080> lost<00:03:15.410> my<00:03:15.680> leg

sense of pride you know I lost my leg
and<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.610> part<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.090> me<00:03:17.150> has<00:03:17.360> been<00:03:17.600> lost<00:03:17.959> since<00:03:18.140> I

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
and so part of me has been lost since I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.440 
and so part of me has been lost since I
had<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.709> amputation<00:03:19.340> but<00:03:20.120> now<00:03:20.209> there's

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
had the amputation but now there's

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.940 
had the amputation but now there's
almost<00:03:20.600> like<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.900> sense<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.410> putting<00:03:21.830> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
almost like a sense of putting the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.800 
almost like a sense of putting the
pieces<00:03:22.160> kind<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.610> back<00:03:22.790> together<00:03:23.150> the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
pieces kind of back together the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.150 
pieces kind of back together the
emotional<00:03:24.380> pieces<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.370> valuable
