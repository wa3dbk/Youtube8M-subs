you<00:01:20.159> may<00:01:20.340> end<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> larger<00:01:21.509> diameter

you may end up with a larger diameter
compared<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> stocks<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.450> already

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

these<00:01:31.049> goose<00:01:31.320> bumps<00:01:31.680> ended<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.070> being<00:01:32.340> just

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
these goose bumps ended up being just

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.670 
these goose bumps ended up being just
five<00:01:32.909> millimeters<00:01:33.509> larger<00:01:33.930> than<00:01:34.079> stock<00:01:34.409> so

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
five millimeters larger than stock so

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.140 
five millimeters larger than stock so
they<00:01:34.710> worked<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.189> fine<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.119> other

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
they worked out just fine the other

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
they worked out just fine the other
thing<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.659> look<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.799> extra

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
thing to look out for is that with extra

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
thing to look out for is that with extra
width<00:01:38.549> comes<00:01:39.000> extra<00:01:39.509> leverage<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
width comes extra leverage on the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
width comes extra leverage on the
suspension<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.130> means<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.909> you're

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
suspension and that means that if you're

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 
suspension and that means that if you're

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
that you have right now with your shock

springs<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.649> oil<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.369> may<00:01:47.610> need<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
springs in your oil you may need to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
springs in your oil you may need to
thicken<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.750> little<00:01:48.780> bit<00:01:49.439> once<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.130> put

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
thicken up a little bit once you put

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
thicken up a little bit once you put
these<00:01:50.460> wheels<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.360> extra<00:01:51.659> width<00:01:51.810> just

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
these wheels on the extra width just

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
these wheels on the extra width just
gives<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.470> softer<00:01:52.979> effective<00:01:53.640> dampening<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
gives you softer effective dampening and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
gives you softer effective dampening and
spring<00:01:55.020> rates<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.520> wanted

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
spring rates so that's that just wanted

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.160 
spring rates so that's that just wanted
to<00:01:56.820> show<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.000> these<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.570> said<00:01:57.750> I'd<00:01:57.930> never

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
