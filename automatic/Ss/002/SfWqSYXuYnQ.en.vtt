a next logical step well initially when

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.920 
a next logical step well initially when
I<00:00:25.300> got<00:00:25.510> it

ground clearance is an issue we bash
them<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:28.150> little<00:00:28.359> bit<00:00:28.510> hard<00:00:28.720> I<00:00:28.840> like<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.170> short

they're<00:00:32.080> used<00:00:32.320> on<00:00:32.770> a<00:00:32.829> track<00:00:33.190> you<00:00:33.550> know<00:00:33.820> but

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149

fan off you know break some piece of
electronics<00:01:11.860> or<00:01:12.220> something<00:01:12.670> that's<00:01:12.880> very

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
electronics or something that's very

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.240 
electronics or something that's very
valuable<00:01:13.510> it's<00:01:14.290> every<00:01:14.619> single<00:01:14.740> time<00:01:15.010> it's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
valuable it's every single time it's

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.719 
valuable it's every single time it's
something<00:01:15.490> like<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.840> I<00:01:17.490> run<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.610> ball

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
something like that so I run the ball

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.420 
something like that so I run the ball
you<00:01:18.850> have<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.600> put<00:01:19.930> my<00:01:20.350> old<00:01:20.710> tires<00:01:21.009> off<00:01:21.250> my

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
you have to so I put my old tires off my

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.630 
you have to so I put my old tires off my
peed<00:01:21.700> on<00:01:21.880> here<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.619> I<00:01:23.650> got<00:01:23.890> trenchers<00:01:24.280> on<00:01:24.430> there

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
peed on here so I got trenchers on there

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640 
peed on here so I got trenchers on there
now<00:01:24.790> and<00:01:25.119> I<00:01:25.420> love<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.840> runs<00:01:25.990> though<00:01:26.229> awesome

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
now and I love it it runs though awesome

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.010 
now and I love it it runs though awesome
so<00:01:27.610> what<00:01:27.790> was<00:01:27.909> my<00:01:28.060> solution<00:01:28.509> well<00:01:28.659> I<00:01:28.689> didn't

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
so what was my solution well I didn't

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.300 
so what was my solution well I didn't
want<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.229> cut<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.500> body<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.890> lot<00:01:30.040> of<00:01:30.159> guys

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
want to cut the body you lot of guys

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.980 
want to cut the body you lot of guys
will<00:01:30.549> they'll<00:01:30.820> just<00:01:30.970> hack<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.540> wheel<00:01:31.689> wells

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
will they'll just hack the wheel wells

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.560 
will they'll just hack the wheel wells
off<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.579> then<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.820> gives<00:01:33.939> you<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.210> clearance

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
off and then it gives you the clearance

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.560 
off and then it gives you the clearance
you<00:01:34.659> need<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:36.430> wanna<00:01:36.549> do<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.790> so<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.450> was

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
you need I don't wanna do that so it was

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.420 
you need I don't wanna do that so it was
the<00:01:37.659> solution<00:01:38.110> was<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.470> lift<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.829> body<00:01:39.009> way<00:01:39.250> up

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
the solution was to lift the body way up

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.719 
the solution was to lift the body way up
essentially<00:01:40.420> this<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.540> how<00:01:40.689> it<00:01:40.840> looks<00:01:41.729> right

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
essentially this is how it looks right

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.789 
essentially this is how it looks right
here<00:01:42.790> just<00:01:43.270> one<00:01:43.479> sec<00:01:43.720> I'll<00:01:43.899> take<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.380> stand

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
here just one sec I'll take the stand

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.210 
here just one sec I'll take the stand
off<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.220> show<00:01:45.399> you<00:01:45.460> how<00:01:46.299> it<00:01:46.470> works<00:01:49.950> okay<00:01:50.950> so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
off and show you how it works okay so

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.179 
off and show you how it works okay so
there<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:52.259> kind<00:01:53.259> of<00:01:53.290> like<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.560> Stampede

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
there it is kind of like the Stampede

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.330 
there it is kind of like the Stampede
stock<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:56.140> know<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:56.350> can<00:01:56.560> see<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:56.860> chassis

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
stock you know you can see this chassis

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.950 
stock you know you can see this chassis
a<00:01:57.369> little<00:01:57.610> bit<00:01:57.759> but<00:01:58.090> I<00:01:58.270> don't<00:01:58.600> think<00:01:58.780> that's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
a little bit but I don't think that's

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.510 
a little bit but I don't think that's
the<00:01:59.110> end<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.409> world<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.920> would<00:02:00.070> rather<00:02:00.100> do

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
the end of the world I would rather do

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.490 
the end of the world I would rather do

it<00:04:10.350> runs<00:04:10.500> up<00:04:10.710> to<00:04:10.830> five<00:04:11.070> s<00:04:11.280> but<00:04:11.580> i<00:04:11.610> wouldn't<00:04:12.000> put

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
it runs up to five s but i wouldn't put

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.170 
it runs up to five s but i wouldn't put
it<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.270> high<00:04:12.540> i'd<00:04:12.780> only<00:04:13.020> keep<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.320> on<00:04:13.410> four

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
it that high i'd only keep it on four

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.039 
it that high i'd only keep it on four
but<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.300> will<00:04:15.420> be<00:04:15.510> able<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.690> handle<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
but it will be able to handle the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.120 
but it will be able to handle the
voltages<00:04:16.620> anyway<00:04:17.160> um<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:18.680> there<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:19.950> it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
voltages anyway um so there you have it

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.099 
voltages anyway um so there you have it

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
which will probably be happening here

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.290 
which will probably be happening here
very<00:04:44.760> soon<00:04:44.940> but<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.150> just<00:04:45.300> want<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.570> show<00:04:45.750> you

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.940 
very soon but I just want to show you
all<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.480> need<00:04:48.600> is<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.780> proline<00:04:49.170> body<00:04:49.440> mount<00:04:49.680> set

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
all you need is a proline body mount set

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.840 
all you need is a proline body mount set
so<00:04:50.100> that's<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.430> right<00:04:50.580> there

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
so that's it right there

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.840 
so that's it right there
right<00:04:51.450> this<00:04:51.720> front<00:04:51.960> stood<00:04:52.200> right<00:04:52.380> up<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:53.550> back

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
right this front stood right up the back

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.730 
right this front stood right up the back
is<00:04:54.330> stood<00:04:54.780> way<00:04:54.900> down<00:04:55.080> because<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.350> allows<00:04:55.530> you

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
is stood way down because it allows you

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.230 
is stood way down because it allows you
to<00:04:55.830> actually<00:04:55.919> put<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.310> rally<00:04:56.520> body<00:04:56.850> on<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.180> you

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
to actually put the rally body on to you

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.300 
to actually put the rally body on to you
so<00:04:57.600> you<00:04:57.690> can<00:04:57.840> stand<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.500> back<00:04:58.680> up<00:04:58.890> way<00:04:59.040> further

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
so you can stand the back up way further

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.950 
so you can stand the back up way further
as<00:04:59.730> you<00:04:59.940> know<00:05:00.060> they<00:05:00.240> need<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.450> be<00:05:00.660> for<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
as you know they need to be for the

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.409 
as you know they need to be for the
rallies<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:02.160> you<00:05:02.250> got<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.520> sloping<00:05:03.330> body<00:05:05.419> but

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
rallies so you got that sloping body but

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.730 
rallies so you got that sloping body but
yeah<00:05:06.510> you<00:05:06.570> can<00:05:06.810> run<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.020> cut<00:05:07.230> you<00:05:07.320> can<00:05:07.440> cover<00:05:07.650> it

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
yeah you can run a cut you can cover it

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.080 
yeah you can run a cut you can cover it
over<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.070> rally<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.790> just<00:05:08.970> need<00:05:09.060> the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
over the rally you just need the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.210 
over the rally you just need the
different<00:05:09.480> front<00:05:09.720> bumper<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:10.560> think<00:05:11.130> the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
different front bumper and I think the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.740 
different front bumper and I think the
front<00:05:11.490> suspension<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.090> a<00:05:12.150> little<00:05:12.360> different

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
front suspension is a little different

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.930 
front suspension is a little different
for<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.500> conversion<00:05:13.860> but<00:05:14.160> not<00:05:14.430> too<00:05:14.640> intense

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
for the conversion but not too intense

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.940 
for the conversion but not too intense
so<00:05:15.810> specially<00:05:16.140> you<00:05:16.230> have<00:05:16.350> three<00:05:16.590> trucks<00:05:16.830> in

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
so specially you have three trucks in

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.920 
so specially you have three trucks in
one<00:05:17.130> you<00:05:17.640> can<00:05:17.669> have<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.090> rally<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.630> can<00:05:18.750> have

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
one you can have the rally you can have

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.970 
one you can have the rally you can have
the<00:05:20.600> slash<00:05:21.600> short<00:05:22.110> course<00:05:22.350> with<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.680> smaller

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
the slash short course with the smaller

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.430 
the slash short course with the smaller
tires<00:05:23.280> or<00:05:23.880> you<00:05:24.419> can<00:05:24.540> put<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.840> slash<00:05:25.050> monster

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
tires or you can put the slash monster

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.840 
tires or you can put the slash monster
truck<00:05:25.650> which<00:05:25.830> is<00:05:25.860> essentially<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> stampede

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
truck which is essentially a stampede

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.460 
truck which is essentially a stampede
just<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.120> little<00:05:27.270> longer<00:05:27.450> it<00:05:27.720> actually<00:05:28.050> handles

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
just a little longer it actually handles

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.710 
just a little longer it actually handles
a<00:05:28.680> little<00:05:29.280> better<00:05:29.550> it's<00:05:29.760> not<00:05:29.790> quite<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:32.720> like

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
a little better it's not quite so like

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.710 
a little better it's not quite so like
it's<00:05:34.460> doesn't<00:05:35.460> wheelie<00:05:35.850> so<00:05:36.180> much<00:05:36.360> all<00:05:36.630> the

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
it's doesn't wheelie so much all the

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.210 
it's doesn't wheelie so much all the
time<00:05:36.900> it's<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.169> little<00:05:37.380> more<00:05:37.530> stable<00:05:37.740> it's

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
time it's a little more stable it's

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.270 
time it's a little more stable it's
having<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.669> length<00:05:38.940> 3<00:05:39.380> so<00:05:40.380> that's<00:05:40.890> it<00:05:41.100> one

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
having that length 3 so that's it one

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.700 
having that length 3 so that's it one
part<00:05:41.520> number<00:05:41.790> proline<00:05:42.360> I'll<00:05:42.990> put<00:05:43.200> the<00:05:43.350> part

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710
