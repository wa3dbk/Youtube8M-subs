salty so hopefully that would help out
our<00:01:58.860> defense<00:01:59.579> but<00:01:59.939> Moya<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.899> kept<00:02:01.259> taking

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
opportunities to score and I had to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.660 
opportunities to score and I had to
change<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.119> formation<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> 4<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.740> 3<00:02:07.770> 1<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
change the formation to a 4 to 3 1 and I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.479 
change the formation to a 4 to 3 1 and I
took<00:02:08.729> calc<00:02:09.090> ok<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.599> put<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.200> an<00:02:10.709> old<00:02:10.979> Garcia

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
took calc ok and put in an old Garcia

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.950 
took calc ok and put in an old Garcia
but<00:02:12.180> F

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
but F

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.740 
but F
that<00:02:13.200> they<00:02:13.770> get<00:02:14.100> another<00:02:14.610> opportunity<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.660> I

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that they get another opportunity and I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.850 
that they get another opportunity and I
thought<00:02:15.990> they<00:02:16.140> were<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.440> score<00:02:16.680> this

them<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.590> get<00:04:07.770> booked<00:04:08.100> but<00:04:08.670> this<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:09.150> how<00:04:09.300> we're

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
them to get booked but this is how we're

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.270 
them to get booked but this is how we're
doing<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.080> league<00:04:10.260> table<00:04:10.470> now<00:04:10.800> we<00:04:10.860> are<00:04:11.160> in

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
doing in the league table now we are in

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.390 
doing in the league table now we are in
first<00:04:11.580> place<00:04:11.700> but<00:04:12.570> guess<00:04:12.810> what<00:04:13.400> Barcelona

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
first place but guess what Barcelona

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.820 
first place but guess what Barcelona
still<00:04:14.700> have<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.090> play<00:04:15.300> another<00:04:15.810> game<00:04:16.170> so<00:04:16.739> we

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
still have to play another game so we

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.650 
still have to play another game so we
have<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.070> wait<00:04:17.100> for<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.489> result<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.210> we<00:04:18.540> will

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
have to wait for the result and we will

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.860 
have to wait for the result and we will
see<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:18.989> for<00:04:19.290> on<00:04:19.410> top<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.890> league<00:04:20.100> by<00:04:20.310> then

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
see it for on top of the league by then

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.570 
see it for on top of the league by then
we<00:04:21.290> were<00:04:21.350> going<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.590> have<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.799> champions<00:04:22.460> league

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
we were going to have a champions league

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.850 
we were going to have a champions league
game<00:04:22.820> versus<00:04:23.240> Roma<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:24.169> think<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:24.590> was

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
game versus Roma and I think this was

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.830 
game versus Roma and I think this was
like<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.100> week<00:04:25.430> later<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:26.030> we<00:04:26.240> had<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.570> lot<00:04:26.810> of

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
like a week later so we had a lot of

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.689 
like a week later so we had a lot of
time<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.290> rest<00:04:27.470> our<00:04:27.590> players<00:04:27.949> and<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:28.550> was

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
time to rest our players and this was

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:29.980 
time to rest our players and this was
going<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.910> be<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.030> very<00:04:29.479> important<00:04:29.960> game

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
going to be a very important game

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.469 
going to be a very important game
because<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.979> last<00:04:31.220> time<00:04:31.400> we<00:04:31.520> faced<00:04:31.729> Roma<00:04:32.210> we

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
because the last time we faced Roma we

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.469 
because the last time we faced Roma we
drew<00:04:32.810> vs<00:04:33.199> um<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.620> both<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.400> us<00:04:34.699> are<00:04:34.910> tied<00:04:35.449> for

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
drew vs um and both of us are tied for

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.480 
drew vs um and both of us are tied for
first<00:04:36.110> place<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.650> think<00:04:36.860> we<00:04:36.949> do<00:04:37.070> have<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.250> better

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
first place I think we do have a better

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.400 
first place I think we do have a better
goal<00:04:37.760> difference<00:04:37.790> but<00:04:38.360> either<00:04:38.810> way<00:04:39.169> we're

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
goal difference but either way we're

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.050 
goal difference but either way we're
tied<00:04:39.620> with<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.949> same<00:04:40.160> amount<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.580> points<00:04:40.790> now

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
tied with the same amount of points now

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.909 
tied with the same amount of points now

Leverkusen<00:07:14.580> once<00:07:15.180> again<00:07:15.570> so<00:07:15.870> hopefully<00:07:16.770> we<00:07:16.920> do

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
Leverkusen once again so hopefully we do

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.950 
Leverkusen once again so hopefully we do
win<00:07:17.370> our<00:07:17.520> next<00:07:17.670> matches<00:07:17.970> but<00:07:18.600> the<00:07:18.720> good<00:07:18.900> thing

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
win our next matches but the good thing

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.470 
win our next matches but the good thing
is<00:07:19.200> that<00:07:19.260> we<00:07:19.530> haven't<00:07:19.770> lost<00:07:19.950> a<00:07:20.190> game<00:07:20.220> yet<00:07:20.460> so<00:07:21.030> we

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:21.480 
is that we haven't lost a game yet so we

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.750 
is that we haven't lost a game yet so we
have<00:07:21.690> that<00:07:21.900> advantage<00:07:22.050> to<00:07:22.680> our<00:07:22.800> side<00:07:23.130> and<00:07:23.370> our

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.760 
have that advantage to our side and our

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.580 
have that advantage to our side and our
goal<00:07:23.790> difference<00:07:24.360> is<00:07:24.600> only<00:07:24.780> positive<00:07:25.380> so

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
goal difference is only positive so

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.740 
goal difference is only positive so
