all<00:00:23.939> right<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.510> catskill<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
all right so we have the catskill in the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
all right so we have the catskill in the
front<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:27.410> external<00:00:28.410> Narus<00:00:29.220> or<00:00:29.460> Narus<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
front the external Narus or Narus is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.240 
front the external Narus or Narus is
there<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.590> orbit<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.910> place<00:00:33.270> where<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
there the orbit is the place where the I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.020 
there the orbit is the place where the I
am<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.980> temporal<00:00:38.640> fossa

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
am and then you have the temporal fossa

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.340 
am and then you have the temporal fossa
is<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> temporal<00:00:40.079> bone

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
is on the temporal bone

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010 
is on the temporal bone
right<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.420> groove<00:00:42.629> where<00:00:42.840> some

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
right here just a groove where some

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.979 
right here just a groove where some
muscles<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.550> zygomatic<00:00:45.210> arch<00:00:47.989> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
muscles go the zygomatic arch the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.600 
muscles go the zygomatic arch the
external<00:00:49.590> auditory<00:00:50.070> meatus<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> ear<00:00:51.360> hole

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
external auditory meatus is the ear hole

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.250 
external auditory meatus is the ear hole
the<00:00:53.610> framin<00:00:54.210> magnum<00:00:56.090> is<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> spinal

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the framin magnum is where the spinal

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.060 
the framin magnum is where the spinal
cord<00:00:58.440> comes<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:59.329> the<00:01:00.329> KO<00:01:00.809> na<00:01:01.050> are<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
cord comes out the KO na are the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.349 
cord comes out the KO na are the
internal<00:01:02.640> mares

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
internal mares

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.370 
internal mares
so<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.930> hole<00:01:04.790> that's<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.450> inside<00:01:08.119> of

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
so it's this hole that's the inside of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.789 
so it's this hole that's the inside of
the<00:01:10.380> nasal<00:01:10.619> passage<00:01:12.409> then<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the nasal passage then you have the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.690 
the nasal passage then you have the
tympanic<00:01:14.369> boules

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.240 

the<00:01:20.240> nasal<00:01:21.020> bone<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:26.270> frontal<00:01:26.690> bone

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
the nasal bone and the frontal bone

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.359 
the nasal bone and the frontal bone
there's<00:01:28.250> two<00:01:28.460> of<00:01:28.550> those<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.979> then<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.100> post

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
there's two of those and then the post

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.760 
there's two of those and then the post
orbital<00:01:31.670> process<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.869> behind<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.380> orbit

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
orbital process so behind the orbit

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.249 
orbital process so behind the orbit
these<00:01:34.010> are<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.430> post<00:01:34.700> orbital<00:01:36.160> processes

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
these are the post orbital processes

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.859 
these are the post orbital processes
when<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:39.350> have<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.619> parietal<00:01:40.130> bone<00:01:40.540> are<00:01:41.540> idle

right there and the Boehmer is this bone

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.600 
right there and the Boehmer is this bone
it's<00:03:19.230> actually<00:03:19.620> missing<00:03:19.890> on<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.160> one<00:03:20.370> but

it's up in the nasal canal

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.900 
it's up in the nasal canal
then<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.440> turbinate<00:03:25.950> bombs<00:03:26.220> which<00:03:26.730> are

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
then you have turbinate bombs which are

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.270 
then you have turbinate bombs which are
actually<00:03:27.270> up<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.990> canal<00:03:28.290> as<00:03:28.530> well<00:03:29.990> and<00:03:31.280> the

malleus incus and stapes and then that

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:32.000 
malleus incus and stapes and then that
is<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.310> skull<00:04:22.669> I'm<00:04:22.880> gonna<00:04:23.060> get<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> mandible

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.620 

alright<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.190> mandible<00:04:33.700> is<00:04:33.880> made<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.390> two

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
alright the mandible is made of two

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.150 
alright the mandible is made of two
denturri<00:04:35.110> bones<00:04:37.170> they<00:04:38.170> come<00:04:38.440> together<00:04:38.620> at<00:04:39.010> the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
denturri bones they come together at the

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.250 
denturri bones they come together at the
mandibular<00:04:39.610> symphysis<00:04:42.750> okay<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:43.960> then<00:04:44.050> you

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
mandibular symphysis okay and then you

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.170 
mandibular symphysis okay and then you
have<00:04:44.470> holes<00:04:45.190> here<00:04:45.460> called<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.760> mental

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
have holes here called the mental

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.450 
have holes here called the mental
foramen<00:04:46.420> ahh<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.910> then<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:50.740> have<00:04:50.980> the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
foramen ahh and then you have the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.240 
foramen ahh and then you have the
coronoid<00:04:52.180> process<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:53.560> condyloid<00:04:54.220> process

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
coronoid process the condyloid process

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.460 
coronoid process the condyloid process
and<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.780> angular<00:04:56.140> process<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:58.260> then<00:04:59.260> this

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
and the angular process and then this

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.510 
and the angular process and then this
hole<00:04:59.740> on<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.420> medial<00:05:01.420> side<00:05:01.630> is<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.380> end<00:05:03.340> of

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
hole on the medial side is the end of

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.130 
hole on the medial side is the end of
Euler<00:05:03.820> foramen<00:05:06.510> okay<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.630> I<00:05:07.690> think<00:05:07.900> that's

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
Euler foramen okay and I think that's

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.970 
Euler foramen okay and I think that's
everything

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
everything

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.840 
everything
I<00:05:10.140> think<00:05:11.140> I<00:05:11.230> did<00:05:11.410> miss<00:05:11.620> one<00:05:11.890> part<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.670> the

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
I think I did miss one part of the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.140 
I think I did miss one part of the
temporal<00:05:13.270> bone<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:15.040> mandibular<00:05:15.520> fossa

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
temporal bone the mandibular fossa

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.320 
temporal bone the mandibular fossa
is<00:05:16.300> actually<00:05:16.780> this<00:05:16.960> part<00:05:17.200> right<00:05:17.320> here<00:05:18.330> which

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
is actually this part right here which

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.580 
is actually this part right here which
is<00:05:19.390> where<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.900> mandible<00:05:21.960> articulates<00:05:22.960> with

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
is where the mandible articulates with

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.130 
is where the mandible articulates with
the<00:05:23.650> skull
