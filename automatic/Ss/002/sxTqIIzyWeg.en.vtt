00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.390
 It is Mao Asada of figure skating 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.390
 Well try it over 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.050
 What 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:17.120
 I don't have much change now 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:24.570
 But I felt like I was doing everything throughout the season 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:26.420
 Eventually I'd have to think or return thought a lot of it is 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.990
 Believe in yourself 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.690
 I just think I can do it 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.260
 I thought 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.990
 Everyone each to there is still individuality 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.960
 I think everyone is not the same thing 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:47.079
 After all one by one each element 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.760
 After all because I think everyone is different one by one still 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.210
 I think it seems to be a highlight 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.579
 Olympic is not accustomed various particular 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.660
 There like a 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.600
 I do not think 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.970
 Slip in that tension 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.210
 And 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:11.020
 When doing the best performance at the station in the tension 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.030
 There is one of the really great say that joy 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.120
 I do not think so 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.610
 Chair anal finger as possible 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.980
 I think it's Phil 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.300
 also 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.750
 The thing that I have practiced is finally myself 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.020
 Oh 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.090
 When you can play a game that seems to have been done 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 After all many 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.280
 Cheering 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.820
 Thanks to that 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.720
 With this 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.490
 After all you get the words that say congratulations 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.950
 It is good 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.409
 I thought 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.630
 From now on 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.970
 It has not been decided yet at all 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.070
 I do not want to do seven people myself 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.170
 ame 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.540
 One by one I decided firmly 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.540
 I think the government wants to do it 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.410
 I have been doing figure skating since I was 5 years old 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.770
 It's really a small time 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:32.840
 Oh happy that Tteyuu this is to be able to 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:36.290
 I really did just that, but as it gets bigger, the pressure gets more and more 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.400
 I think the things I can not do will grow bigger 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.650
 Say another cup can always remember the old feelings Well its with it 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.700
 Have a feeling 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.700
