00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 4 we are moving forward in our installation of artificial turf 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.179
 next step put the bad that testino the amaya to say 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.769
 one ton and that is not like the anti-weed mesh is that you have seen 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:20.880
 braided 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.980
 in a lot of gardening 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.179
 this is a matter 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.249
 tÃ©lam as leader of 180 grams per square meter 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 whose function is number one 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.610
 although I do not usually talk about when it should be when it rains and the ground got wet 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.710
 numbers 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.890
 that do not lend money 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.560
 we have percent of models 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.290
 of an attractive and mexico 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.290
 will depend on the installation what you want 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.070
 being this will be the assaults on the beer to go well that forces again 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.970
 to continue with the installation process 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.700
 in this step the master priests 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.070
 fill the terrain of geotextile Maya 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.299
 to avoid losing lyric especially very important 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 to raise the mud to the lawn through the drainage holes 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.890
 we are going to help 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.200
 d some nails to be able to be about 10 centimeters long 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.430
 what is the advantage of this 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.950
 that if it's windy 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.810
 the mesh is not valued for example if you want to install 200 square meters 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.660
 in the beginning amaya geotextile and the next day what would history 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.070
 expte 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.320
 the installation of artificial turf 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.470
 and number two when this law is artificial grass on top of the amaia 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.690
 textile agirre 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.870
 and naval 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.450
 you will always have the geotextile maya 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.960
 cij to the floor with which we will be able to freely move the sextet the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 installation 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.200
 at the time of throwing 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.500
 one band next to another is very important ceased you have a three 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.459
 four of them 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.959
 what is the purpose of all this that is not even a goal land spaces 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.459
 outdoor 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.110
