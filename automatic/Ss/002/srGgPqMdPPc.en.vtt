 24 Billy 

00:00:02.559 --> 00:00:14.730
 The word Pan Weibai Qu Pan 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.281
 I am me, he is me, you are me, who am I? 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.801
 I am him, I am you, I am, who am I, who am I? 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.631
 I am me, he is me, you are me, who am I? 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.171
 I am him, I am you, I am, who are you, who are you? 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.031
 The cells in the body are rushing 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.061
 Unknown face instantly turns in the field of different space 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.361
 The strange eyes are all watching me. 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.681
 Please be careful if you don't know your emotions. 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.881
 Because I may not be able to withstand too much 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.341
 This is my body but I found that I am not the only one 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.151
 Individuals are separating 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.021
 When is the geometry gathered in my heart? 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.721

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.631
 They clearly like wrestling 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.211
 How to coexist with the same body becomes the only problem 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.891
 I have a secret OV secret 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.671
 Hidden in my heart 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.911
 The deity, he has no details, I don’t know who’s time to show up. 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.441
 Please don't sue 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.101
 I will break out at any time. 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.221
 You see me, but what you see is not me. 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.321
 You face me, but I am already not me. 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.901
 The cells in the body are rushing 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.101
 Unknown face instantly turns in the field of different space 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.301
 The strange eyes are all watching me. 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.161
 Please be careful if you don't know your emotions. 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.881
 Because I may not be able to withstand too much 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.911
 Who and who? 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.191

 Who and who? 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:09.381
 Who am I? 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.331
 When is the time, where am I hiding? 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.441
 Please don't force me, please believe that I don't understand. 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.821
 I can’t see clearly leaving the light. 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.861
 Subverting the nighttime, your respect determines my presence certificate 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.191
 So slowly pumping away and GO

 Or free to wake up freely 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.941
