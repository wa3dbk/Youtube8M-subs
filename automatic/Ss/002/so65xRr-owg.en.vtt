00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.529
 Hello everyone, linda huber 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.750
 Today I will show 3 ways to fail 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:20.810
 eyelid line with liquid eyeliner 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 pencil and shade I'll start with a soft eyeliner 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.570
 it looks like a dry liner and is applied 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.570
 wet brush 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.930
 it can be applied for centuries when you 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.530
 feel that the texture has become 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:44.420
 suitable for this when i put 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.420
 liner i always make arrows 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.670
 i start my arrow continuing water 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:00.239
 line of the lower eyelid and try to follow 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:02.070
 this corner if you take the corner too 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.870
 low or too high you will 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.740
 look really weird or 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.110
 just sad now i'm drawing 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.110
 arrow trying to find the right angle 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.950
 I want my arrow to be enough 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.840
 stretched out now I'm leading from the central 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.420
 part of the contour of the century to the outer corner 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:42.030
 to connect this line with the constructed 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:45.170
 arrow filling up a small triangle 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.170
 which we have 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.240
 again from the center of the contour of the century but to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.659
 inner corner i want the line 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.520
 turned out more fine i try 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.439
 draw the line as close as possible to the line 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.439
 eyelash growth as possible 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 like this when i use a pencil for 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.330
 an eye from the same angle as 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.700
 earlier to get the line which 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.920
 best emphasize my eyes 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 you should always make sure that 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.200
 the angle didn't change your eye shape i 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:37.330
 I use a black pencil from the head of me 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:45.540
 so now i'm drawing a line along 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:48.400
 eyelash growth lines and to the outer corner 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.170
 Do not worry if the line went out a bit 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:58.180
 beyond the boundaries you can 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:00.100
 fix it later you don't have to 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.720
 bring your arrow to the end 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.310
 inner corner of this will be enough 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.079
 now we use this small brush 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.079
 accent brush from real techniques 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.790
 slightly blend the black line to 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:22.239
 get a more blurred outline 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.280
 not everyone loves a clear liner when you 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.660
 finished with feathering eyeliner has 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.820
 more gray tint 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.220
 if you want her to be more 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.049
 dark just use pencil again 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:42.250
 in places where you think it is 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:45.190
 you need this now you saw two 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.090
 type submarine 1 looks clearly different 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.579
 more blurred 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.769
 as you can see we got two 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.380
 completely different images when completely 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.690
 same action angles and lines or 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.739
 look different with a clear arrow 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.389
 of shaded now I will fail the eyelid 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.620
 shadows using a product that 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.620
 called twink strong 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.240
 it will make the submarine waterproof that 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.320
 especially good windy and cool 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:22.990
 weather i mix myxine liquid from 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:26.770
 Makeup with shadows from nyx it gives us 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.690
 rich black color of course you can 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.460
 do it with any shade 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.460
 it doesn't have to be black 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:45.600
 continue the line of your eye from 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:45.600
 middle and see her to the outer corner 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.760
 if the line got lost later you can 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.760
 adjust it using a concealer 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:10.510
 I just need to adjust my little 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:12.460
 the arrow now I am correcting where 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:20.020
 I think it turned out a bit not exactly 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:23.430
 and do not gently do this i use 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.430
 concealer and flat brush 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.169
 concealer should be the same shade that 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.270
 I am your skin 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.270
 use it to sharpen the corners 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.910
 this is the easiest way to create 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.740
 really sharp angle and so i 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.060
 showed you three different ways of applying 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.919
 eye liner 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.320
 the first was a liquid liner then we 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.270
 used eyeliner and finally 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.370
 I showed how things are in the sub from the shadows 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.440
 for ages like i said you can do 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.150
 it with any shade like you only 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.520
 like you don't have to be like that 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.979
 as boring as i use only black 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.870
 color usually you can find the entire list 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:09.789
 used for products in the description 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.770
