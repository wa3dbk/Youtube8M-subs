probably going to be doing more

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.020 
probably going to be doing more
giveaways<00:01:47.290> but<00:01:47.829> this<00:01:48.040> one<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.460> just<00:01:48.490> for<00:01:48.759> fun

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
giveaways but this one is just for fun

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.520 
giveaways but this one is just for fun
um<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:51.070> was<00:01:52.060> going<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.479> be<00:01:52.570> giving<00:01:52.869> away<00:01:53.020> all

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
but I thought that would have been kind

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.560 
but I thought that would have been kind
of<00:01:58.330> unfair<00:01:58.690> because<00:01:58.930> not<00:01:59.620> everyone<00:01:59.980> was<00:02:00.130> there

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
of unfair because not everyone was there

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.690 
of unfair because not everyone was there
