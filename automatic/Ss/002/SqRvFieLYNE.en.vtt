00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
head only sure looks like a ragtime

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.979 
head only sure looks like a ragtime
ahead<00:00:49.940> doesn't<00:00:50.240> it<00:00:50.300> sure<00:00:50.540> does<00:00:50.720> look<00:00:50.810> like<00:00:50.900> a

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
ahead doesn't it sure does look like a

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.780 
ahead doesn't it sure does look like a
rack<00:00:51.140> tom<00:00:51.350> head<00:00:51.530> but<00:00:51.739> I<00:00:51.950> guess<00:00:52.130> the<00:00:52.310> unofficial

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
rack tom head but I guess the unofficial

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.390 
rack tom head but I guess the unofficial
banjo<00:00:53.210> head<00:00:53.420> see<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:54.290> very<00:00:54.559> useful<00:00:55.160> if<00:00:55.309> they

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
banjo head see it's very useful if they

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.070 
banjo head see it's very useful if they
stamp<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.120> banjo<00:00:56.540> on<00:00:56.570> there<00:00:56.809> they<00:00:56.930> could

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
stamp the banjo on there they could

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.440 
stamp the banjo on there they could
probably<00:00:57.230> get<00:00:57.470> like<00:00:57.590> 2<00:00:57.770> bucks<00:00:57.920> more<00:00:58.160> right

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
probably get like 2 bucks more right

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.430 
probably get like 2 bucks more right
probably<00:00:59.450> more<00:00:59.570> than<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.750> because<00:01:00.080> so

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
probably more than that because so

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.080 
probably more than that because so
