00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.690
 Hello 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.110
 Well, we will continue talking about 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.540
 germinators on how to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.630
 seeds 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.339
 cool 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.570
 for example while the seeds 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:24.199
 small mustard seeds 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.420
 the substance of a plant family 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.600
 cruciferous 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.770
 whose seeds are quite small and 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.770
 They're used 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.059
 annual crop 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.579
 they are used directly as whole seed 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.800
 to flavor vinaigrette 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.780
 condiments or also rotten seed the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.520
 plant is used as a plant for 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.520
 forage or for consumption 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.300
 in time boiled as javed by 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.540
 another part we will also have in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 germinated corn seeds helium 8 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.350
 as you can see are seeds a lot 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.200
 bigger 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.990
 that in the case of mustard then the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.909
 object of this video is to show you another 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.799
 simple way to make germinators 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.110
 for the case of the seeds very 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.060
 small and we will contrast with 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.450
 some larger seeds as it is 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.270
 the seeds of corn from lot 8 what 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.620
 be corn belonging to the family of 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.480
 grasses and native of the friends 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.040
 then for the germinators we are going to 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.500
 need a tray 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.010
 role of these roll papers 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.010
 kitchen 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.440
 at the bottom of the tray and people 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.010
 The person we are going to make is 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.770
 can be 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.360
 Seville 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.440
 well moistened let's start to 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.110
 place the seeds 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.800
 it can be even with the same 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.800
 easy 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.750
 if we want less quantity then one 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.190
 once we have them in this way the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.050
 we can go thinking about the flag 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.000
 in the case of much more corn 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.000
 simple as are large seeds 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.230
 this red coloration they see in the 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.980
 seeds 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.980
 pink 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.530
 antifungal 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.360
 with which the seeds are impregnated 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.600
 to avoid getting super 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.200
 in the little one with the pink hue 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.200
 let him come 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.260
 once we have then scattered 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.620
 all the seeds in the tray we are going to 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.620
 cover the other napkins 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.819
 a little bit of resentment, we are not going to place it 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.819
 bent 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.400
 If the function of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.920
 and in this way we are going to take it to a 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.720
 dark compartment that can be a 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.030
 kitchen cabinet 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.330
 in which we will observe then the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.330
 germination 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.170
 after three days I have you here 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.690
 the result 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.340
 of what happens then we eliminate 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.390
 here you can see how the epic lindens 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.640
 break the napkins as it is wet 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.980
 so 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.960
 and it's very smooth it has enough 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.420
 strength to break the 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.470
 then very carefully we go 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.980
 eliminating we can even go putting 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.320
 the napkin so as not to damage it 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.580
 the white ones already in this case in this 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.949
 stadium now let's talk 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.960
 no longer of seeds but of seedling 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.400
 Because we have 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.750
 present what is the radicular 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.900
 that will later form the root 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.560
 and we have the part to it 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.560
 so 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.480
 we want to help a little more or deserve 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.940
 you the mount 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.490
 do not break the closures however 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.490
 think that they are enough 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.729
 a napkin floor in the world 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.529
 what I want you to observe is 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.229
 this way we have in a short 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.270
 time a large number of seedlings and not 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.969
 it matters that the seeds are small 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.560
 because if we want to transplant then 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.550
 What we do is separate 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.380
 each template true 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:27.230
 to the plant and we would take it to 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.170
 to a pot with earth 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.710
 or germinators we continue with the case 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.210
 of corn 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.039
 is she this has only three days 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.760
 if we sow it with the excess of 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:44.330
 napkin that matters because this grade 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.100
 here we would have the embryonic root and now 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.090
 is measuring plant has 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.090
 42 come 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.330
 in four roots open 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.570
 aerial part then 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.570
 in style and the first sheet 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.990
 in the case of mustard 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:13.810
 something that I want to note is that 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.540
 have some little things still with their 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.980
 first leaves frames and diagonals 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.840
 they have yellowish color this is due 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.240
 that she found herself growing up in 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.009
 the darkness once we pass them to 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.719
 the light 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.600
 We propose to land and the 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.810
 let's expose 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:38.860
 in the light they will take their population 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.860
 green as a product from which it starts 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.129
 so here you can see that 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.390
 regardless of the size of the 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.670
 seed 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:53.590
 assists the very small method of 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:56.590
 tray that is one of the most indicated 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.500
 and it 's a simple method you can do it 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.070
 for experimentations 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.340
 Biology or experimentation 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.740
 any kind since I know 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.300
 large number of glands in little 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.300
 space or fattening well 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.639
 this is what I brought in this video in 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.710
 trays that can be 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:19.520
 for small seeds as me 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.590
 they had asked for roads 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.640
 then we saw with corn dance 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.640
 fast and very 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.889
 Y 

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:35.709
