Apple Packages

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.400
Welcome to Mutevazý Lezzetler Cuisine!

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.120
at this episode, we are sharing an easy honoring recipe

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.480
"Apple Packages"

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.960
let’s see the ingredients of this recipe

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.680
2 medium size apples

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.760
8 petit beurre biscuits

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.760
4 square shaped flaked pastries

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.840
1 tsp cinnamon

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.840
1 tsp cocoa

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.600
1 egg white

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.200
1/3 cup of beaten walnut

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.760
1/6 cup of raisins

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.720
for the upper side; 1 egg yolk

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.640
1 tbsp castor sugar

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.840
I’m breaking the 8 petit beurre biscuits by the knife

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.240
you may beaten or blend the biscuits also

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.560
or you may squeeze them in their package to turn them into pieces

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.400
I’m keeping on preparing the filling

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.640
I’m adding egg white onto the beaten biscuits

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.560
I’ll use the yolk for the upper side

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.600
I advise to beaten the 1/3 cup of walnut

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
it will be more tasty

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.080
and 1/6 cup of raisins

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.520
I’ve rested them in water for half an hour to soften them

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.520
1 tsp cinnamon

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.680
1 tsp cocoa

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.480
now I’ll knead this mixture

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.680
the egg white will keep the ingredients together

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.800
I’ve kneaded them, and as you may see it has turned into smooth dough

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.240
well, I’ll divide it into 4 pieces

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.120
because we have 2 apples, and we will use each piece of dough for each half of the apples

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.160
I’m shaping them as balls

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.880
I’m peeling the apples firstly

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.600
as you may notice, I did not peel them at the beginning to prevent them darken

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.800
you should definitely peel the apples

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.280
I’ll cut each of them into 2 pieces

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and remove the seed beds

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.040
If you do not peel the apples, they harden during the cooking

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.440
I want to emphasize that you should peel them

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.200
by this way we are also caving them and removing the seed beds

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.560
after preparing the apples, now I’m enlarging the pastries a little bit…

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.480
over flour, not too much

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.760
you should not free the flaked pastries again, after defrosting them once

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.000
I want emphasize it also

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.040
the size is enough, I’m removing the extra flour over

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.520
the apples are peeled and the filling mixture is ready

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.640
the filling mixture may seem too much, but it gives the taste, so we are preparing more

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200
I’m forcing over a little bit

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.440
and I’m placing onto the middle of the dough

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.600
and I’m packaging it, as the name of the recipe

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.360
and I’ll place them into the greased baking tray

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.200
it is a really practical recipe, you even may prepare it after your guest’s arriving immediately

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.960
and serve to your guest a delicious pastry

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.000
I’m holding the apple, placing the filling mixture by forcing over it

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.320
I’m reversing and packaging

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.920
I’m flattening by this way and placing into the greased baking tray

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.480
now, I’ll spread yolk all over

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.960
I’ve already used the white, now I’m using the yolk

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.840
I’ve spread the yolk over the packages

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.880
I’ll place the tray into the oven that is preheated to 392 F and bake them in red color

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.280
the packages are removed from the oven, they have turn to red nicely

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.800
finally I’m sifting some castor sugar over them

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.400
it is important to sift it over the packages, while they are hot yet

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.960
I’m placing them into the service plate

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.240
they smell delicious

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.720
I may show the inner side also

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.160
it is hard to cut it without bread board…

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960
you may see that it is too hot

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.680
it is really a delicious bun

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.880
we have shared a very nice recipe

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.320
"Apple Packages"

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.040
it is easy to cook and delicious, please try it

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.120
Bon Appetite! Afiyet Olsun!
