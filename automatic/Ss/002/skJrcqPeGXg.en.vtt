have of course conspiracy theorists say

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.670 
have of course conspiracy theorists say
well<00:02:10.239> if<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.450> circus<00:02:10.780> did<00:02:10.989> crash<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.440> few<00:02:11.590> of

so<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:15.549> theory<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.150> still<00:02:16.360> alive<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:17.079> I<00:02:17.530> think

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
so the theory is still alive but I think

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.009 
so the theory is still alive but I think
again<00:02:18.280> that's<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.579> fairly<00:02:18.790> dubiously<00:02:22.019> another

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
again that's a fairly dubiously another

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.770 
again that's a fairly dubiously another
popular<00:02:23.560> theory<00:02:23.799> but<00:02:24.010> one<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.280> has<00:02:24.340> been

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
popular theory but one that has been

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.600 
popular theory but one that has been
emphatically<00:02:25.780> discredited<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.799> that<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> big

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
emphatically discredited is that the big

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.910 
emphatically discredited is that the big
cats<00:02:27.879> are<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> descendant<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.230> marsupial

maybe<00:03:00.740> they<00:03:00.860> turned<00:03:00.920> into<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.370> big<00:03:01.520> cats<00:03:01.760> but

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
maybe they turned into the big cats but

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.270 
maybe they turned into the big cats but
there's<00:03:02.390> no<00:03:02.540> concrete<00:03:02.870> evidence<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.680> those

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
there's no concrete evidence that those

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.699 
there's no concrete evidence that those
events<00:03:04.730> did<00:03:05.000> occur<00:03:05.300> it's<00:03:05.690> only<00:03:05.990> anecdotal

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
events did occur it's only anecdotal

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.440 
events did occur it's only anecdotal
evidence<00:03:06.770> so<00:03:07.250> I'm<00:03:07.730> not<00:03:07.850> too<00:03:08.000> sure<00:03:08.180> about<00:03:08.209> that

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
evidence so I'm not too sure about that

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.580 
evidence so I'm not too sure about that
one<00:03:08.660> but<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.900> sounds<00:03:09.140> good

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
one but it sounds good

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.430 
one but it sounds good
so<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.400> leaves<00:03:10.640> one<00:03:10.970> final<00:03:11.540> theory<00:03:12.170> that

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
so that leaves one final theory that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.680 
so that leaves one final theory that
both<00:03:12.650> Peter<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.100> Tim<00:03:13.430> believe<00:03:13.790> has<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.450> most

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
both Peter and Tim believe has the most

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.740 
both Peter and Tim believe has the most

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
credibility the big cats are in fact are

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.770 
credibility the big cats are in fact are

the large feral cats or feral dogs and

some may have a disease called mange
mite<00:03:23.830> which<00:03:24.830> basically<00:03:25.100> means<00:03:25.430> they<00:03:25.550> lose

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
mite which basically means they lose

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.729 
mite which basically means they lose
most<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.270> fur<00:03:26.480> over<00:03:27.200> parts<00:03:27.500> or<00:03:27.620> all<00:03:27.709> of

most of the fur over parts or all of

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
their body and it can give them

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.780 
their body and it can give them
appearance<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.900> having<00:03:30.260> stripes<00:03:30.530> or<00:03:31.160> patches

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
or being very short haired and it can

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.360 
or being very short haired and it can
quite<00:03:35.690> actually<00:03:35.810> change<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.440> appearance<00:03:36.709> so

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
quite actually change the appearance so

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.530 
quite actually change the appearance so
much<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:37.910> really<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.300> stop<00:03:38.510> and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
much so that you really have to stop and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.060 
much so that you really have to stop and
think<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.900> what<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.080> is<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.620> people<00:03:39.890> just

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
think of what that is and people just

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.590 
think of what that is and people just
get<00:03:40.520> a<00:03:40.550> little<00:03:40.640> bit<00:03:40.790> confused<00:03:41.180> about<00:03:41.239> what<00:03:41.510> it

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
get a little bit confused about what it

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.440 
get a little bit confused about what it
is<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> few<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:43.220> what's<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.760> verdict<00:03:44.300> I

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
is in a few so what's the verdict I

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.759 
is in a few so what's the verdict I
think<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:46.299> 99.9%<00:03:47.299> of<00:03:47.720> cases<00:03:48.110> they<00:03:48.709> are

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
think in 99.9% of cases they are

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.830 
think in 99.9% of cases they are
probably<00:03:49.040> not<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.340> big<00:03:49.549> cat<00:03:49.790> we<00:03:50.390> just<00:03:50.570> need<00:03:50.720> that

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
probably not a big cat we just need that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.830 
probably not a big cat we just need that
one<00:03:50.900> piece<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:51.620> evidence<00:03:52.430> some<00:03:52.790> DNA<00:03:53.269> proof<00:03:53.600> for

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
one piece of evidence some DNA proof for

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.720 
one piece of evidence some DNA proof for
the<00:03:54.290> capture<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.769> an<00:03:54.860> animal<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.310> prove<00:03:55.549> that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
the capture of an animal to prove that

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.330 
the capture of an animal to prove that
it<00:03:55.880> does<00:03:56.030> exist<00:03:56.420> so<00:03:57.049> I<00:03:57.470> think<00:03:57.890> there's<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> point

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
it does exist so I think there's a point

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.830 
it does exist so I think there's a point
one<00:03:58.549> percent<00:03:58.670> chance<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.150> they<00:03:59.330> really<00:03:59.690> are

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
one percent chance that they really are

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.600 
one percent chance that they really are
out<00:03:59.989> there<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:01.040> that's<00:04:01.160> about<00:04:01.340> it

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
out there and that's about it

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.860 
out there and that's about it
you<00:04:02.570> can<00:04:02.750> never<00:04:03.430> claim<00:04:04.750> within<00:04:05.750> the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
you can never claim within the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.390 
you can never claim within the
definitive<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.470> something<00:04:06.709> doesn't<00:04:06.980> exist

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
definitive that something doesn't exist

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.960 
definitive that something doesn't exist
so<00:04:07.489> I'm<00:04:08.090> saying<00:04:08.440> definitive<00:04:09.440> no

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
so I'm saying definitive no

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.010 
so I'm saying definitive no
it's<00:04:11.150> probably<00:04:11.420> gonna<00:04:11.510> get<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:11.780> into<00:04:11.870> trouble

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
it's probably gonna get you into trouble

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.210 
it's probably gonna get you into trouble
at<00:04:12.230> some<00:04:12.380> point<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.680> future<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:14.090> that
