00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
so this would push into the side of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.510 
so this would push into the side of
another<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.780> attach<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.320> connect<00:01:01.710> that's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
another one and attach to connect that's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.690 
another one and attach to connect that's
how<00:01:02.640> they<00:01:02.789> would<00:01:02.940> connect<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> let's<00:01:05.430> turn<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
how they would connect so let's turn it

results<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.970> then<00:03:04.970> nano<00:03:05.240> kata<00:03:05.890> gives<00:03:06.890> you

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
results and then nano kata gives you

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.190

strength<00:03:07.250> jolts<00:03:07.730> then<00:03:08.510> these<00:03:08.600> other<00:03:08.780> two<00:03:09.080> you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
strength jolts then these other two you

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.340 
strength jolts then these other two you
get<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.800> download<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:11.300> therefore<00:03:12.230> the

one's for the speed and I go over each
these<00:03:16.100> games<00:03:16.400> will<00:03:16.520> show<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.760> what<00:03:16.880> they<00:03:16.970> look

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
these games will show you what they look

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.910 
these games will show you what they look
like<00:03:17.150> any<00:03:17.590> separate<00:03:18.590> videos<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.560> that's<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
like any separate videos so that's the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.970 
like any separate videos so that's the
training<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.690> then<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.959> battle<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.620> battles

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
training and then the battle the battles

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.190 
training and then the battle the battles
for<00:03:31.160> when<00:03:31.310> there<00:03:31.520> when<00:03:32.180> you're<00:03:32.300> offline<00:03:32.660> and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
for when there when you're offline and

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.050 
for when there when you're offline and
there's<00:03:33.830> more<00:03:34.070> than<00:03:34.190> one<00:03:34.310> person<00:03:34.490> with<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.820> nano

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
there's more than one person with a nano

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.870 
there's more than one person with a nano
scope<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.800> can<00:03:36.950> click<00:03:37.220> either<00:03:37.370> host<00:03:37.730> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
scope and you can click either host the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.910 
scope and you can click either host the
battle<00:03:38.240> or<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.600> join<00:03:38.840> somebody<00:03:39.320> else's<00:03:39.620> battle

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
battle or to join somebody else's battle

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.040 
battle or to join somebody else's battle
if<00:03:39.980> they're<00:03:40.160> hosting<00:03:43.270> so<00:03:44.270> no<00:03:44.360> surgeon<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.870> don't

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
if they're hosting so no surgeon I don't

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.160 
if they're hosting so no surgeon I don't
have<00:03:45.140> two<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.350> them<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.650> hook<00:03:45.800> together<00:03:47.170> but

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
have two of them to hook together but

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.780 
have two of them to hook together but
basically<00:03:48.530> this<00:03:48.770> is<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.280> go<00:03:49.459> through<00:03:49.490> this

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
basically this is you go through this

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.759 
basically this is you go through this
menu<00:03:50.060> here<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:51.709> connect<00:03:52.040> them<00:03:52.160> in<00:03:52.250> battle

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.110 

that's<00:03:57.769> basically<00:03:58.220> it

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.809 

I<00:04:02.239> preferred<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.950> training<00:04:04.400> just<00:04:04.549> so<00:04:04.730> you

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
I preferred the the training just so you

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.199 
I preferred the the training just so you
can<00:04:05.000> earn<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.840> jolts<00:04:06.730> which<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:07.849> also<00:04:08.000> earn

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
can earn the jolts which you also earn

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.750 
can earn the jolts which you also earn
in<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.569> solo<00:04:09.260> training<00:04:09.560> with<00:04:10.280> those<00:04:10.489> solo

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
in the solo training with those solo

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.970 
in the solo training with those solo
cartridges<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.510> stuff<00:04:11.659> as<00:04:11.780> well<00:04:11.989> as<00:04:12.680> the

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
cartridges and stuff as well as the

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.940 
cartridges and stuff as well as the
minigames<00:04:13.810> use<00:04:14.810> those<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.379> increase<00:04:15.799> the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
minigames use those to increase the

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.500 
minigames use those to increase the
stats<00:04:16.400> on<00:04:16.579> your<00:04:16.609> nanowar<00:04:19.540> there<00:04:20.540> you<00:04:20.660> have<00:04:20.810> it

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
stats on your nanowar there you have it

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.850 
stats on your nanowar there you have it
the<00:04:23.510> Nano<00:04:23.750> scope<00:04:26.290> and<00:04:27.290> again<00:04:27.530> like<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:27.710> said

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
the Nano scope and again like I said

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.200 
the Nano scope and again like I said
it's<00:04:27.979> probably<00:04:28.280> about<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.520> thickness<00:04:28.760> maybe

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
it's probably about the thickness maybe

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.700 
it's probably about the thickness maybe
of<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.510> cigarette<00:04:29.900> pack<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:32.479> it's<00:04:33.440> probably

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
of a cigarette pack and it's probably

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.409 
of a cigarette pack and it's probably
slightly<00:04:34.040> larger<00:04:34.580> than<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.729> cigarette<00:04:35.000> pack

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
slightly larger than a cigarette pack

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.529 
slightly larger than a cigarette pack
taller<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:36.220> mean<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.610> might<00:04:37.789> be<00:04:37.910> maybe<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.300> size

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
taller I mean it might be maybe the size

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.050 
taller I mean it might be maybe the size
of<00:04:38.750> like<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.500> 100<00:04:39.979> size<00:04:40.250> cigarette<00:04:40.610> packs<00:04:40.850> if

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
of like the 100 size cigarette packs if

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.500 
of like the 100 size cigarette packs if
anybody's<00:04:41.810> familiar<00:04:41.960> with<00:04:42.380> those<00:04:43.300> not<00:04:44.300> really

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
anybody's familiar with those not really

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.260 
anybody's familiar with those not really
sure<00:04:44.660> what<00:04:44.810> else<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.080> compare<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.560> to

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
sure what else to compare it to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.120 
sure what else to compare it to
size-wise<00:04:47.440> that's<00:04:48.440> pretty<00:04:48.680> nice<00:04:48.770> screen

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
size-wise that's pretty nice screen

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.360 
size-wise that's pretty nice screen
everything<00:04:49.760> shows<00:04:50.060> pretty<00:04:50.300> good<00:04:50.539> on<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:51.370> the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
everything shows pretty good on it the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.710 
everything shows pretty good on it the
music<00:04:52.490> can<00:04:52.820> be<00:04:52.910> annoying<00:04:53.180> that's<00:04:53.419> why<00:04:53.539> I<00:04:53.570> like

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.390 
turning it off but the volumes decent
you<00:04:56.210> can<00:04:56.330> turn<00:04:56.449> it<00:04:56.600> up<00:04:56.720> if<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.110> wish<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:58.070> also
