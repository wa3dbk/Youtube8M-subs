00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
drivers had that route but if you don't

what-have-you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.499 
what-have-you
there<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.710> driver<00:01:43.920> disk<00:01:44.189> included<00:01:44.909> okay

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
there is your driver disk included okay

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.780 
there is your driver disk included okay
now<00:01:46.290> moving<00:01:46.649> along<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> connector

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
now moving along we have a connector

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.649 
now moving along we have a connector
here<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:49.100> DVI<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.490> VGA<00:01:51.149> connector

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
here and this is a DVI to VGA connector

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.280 
here and this is a DVI to VGA connector
and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:53.310> also<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.750> standard

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and then also we have a standard

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
and then also we have a standard
DisplayPort<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.310> mini<00:01:56.880> DisplayPort<00:01:57.630> adapter

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
DisplayPort to mini DisplayPort adapter

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
DisplayPort to mini DisplayPort adapter
and<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.890> handy<00:01:59.189> because<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.579> card<00:01:59.850> does

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and this is handy because this card does

of<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.490> thousand<00:05:19.910> megahertz<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.870> still<00:05:21.080> get

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
of a thousand megahertz you still get

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.339 
of a thousand megahertz you still get
the<00:05:21.320> memory<00:05:21.620> bus<00:05:21.860> width<00:05:22.130> of<00:05:22.310> 256<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:24.020> memory
