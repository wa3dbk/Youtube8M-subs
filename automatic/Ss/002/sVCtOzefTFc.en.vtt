00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 my friends welcome to another video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.990
 class in today's viola we will talk about 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.970
 equation an intimate place kan before 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.370
 I would like to ask if I like the video 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 classes sign up for my channel 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.170
 share and enjoy and if you have 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.840
 patience watch the advertisement 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 that is passed before the video to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400
 improve the quality of the video with her in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.519
 fifth icon to the right of the video below 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.070
 the screen in an icon similar to a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.520
 and increase the quality of the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.079
 video for example 720 solve the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 equation log four times plus 24 in 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.980
 base 2 and which 5 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.010
 So how can I solve this? 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.289
 equation the first thing we have 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 determine the conditions for 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.410
 existence of a good equation for the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:58.260
 people remember a blog from a in base b is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:02.309
 equal to x if and only if raised to x 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.129
 is equal to the one that had some conditions 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.930
 that we put to a and b would have 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.140
 that is greater than zero bts greater than 0 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.409
 mb has to be different than either 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.409
 hence it is the condition of existence 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 then in this equation here who is the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.060
 biology value and b2 or else 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.659
 In Here the existence of the condition 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.540
 letter b b is two then 2 different one 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.369
 so just look here at the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.189
 then you have to have the biggest partner 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.759
 now in this equation what is the value 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.939
 of aaa equal to four times x + 24 then 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.939
 have to have that four times x + 24 has 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.070
 that being greater than 0 is good and if 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.329
 inadequacy of the first degree 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.509
 How can I solve this? 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 equation it was four times x + 24 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.469
 greater than zero after passing 24- way 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.390
 of the equation such that 4 x is greater than less 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:12.410
 24 x must be greater than minus 24 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.410
 over four 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.090
 x must be greater than six which is 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.750
 what is presented here then what is the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.660
 condition of existence x has to be 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.970
 greater than six because because if x 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.390
 is less than six x types per 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.590
 super x equals - 7 and was replace here 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.830
 this equation just will not exist 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.940
 she's got me right it would be four 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.510
 times less seven to minus 28 plus 24 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.910
 then it would have this one would soon be -4 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.960
 base2 this can not occur I can not 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.920
 have negative value here is in place of d 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.290
 here our condition of existence is x 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.660
 new york - 6 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.580
 so I know it's the solution set is 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.930
 values ​​of x cooperate with this 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.160
 solution of this equation it if you come 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.890
 here on the line 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.800
 Let's say that here is origin and here 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.650
 let's say the 6 is open ball I 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.050
 I can get shaq values at least 6 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.920
 lose crux values here O 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:30.050
 then to get the value of x in that 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:33.380
 set here from -6 until finally nito 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.150
 -6 ball open then I'll look for the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.790
 she's worth the time to solve 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.160
 this equation the value of x that I get 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.010
 try within this set 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.360
 here is from -6 to more infinity 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.550
 preparation of the equation 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.950
 we know that yes it can be registered 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.780
 equal to 5 times soon of two in the bay 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.330
 two because if you have followed my 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.550
 Viola, you know that soon two in the 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.350
 bahia two the atrium times 51 is so 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.620
 good I can write that way and 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.240
 I can write then spend 15 in 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.920
 because of that property that 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:13.490
 speak log of the high there is option in the base b 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.200
 is equal to ay times the air guide on base b 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.650
 so that's why the five come here 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.729
 the blog of 2 is actually 5 at the base 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.160
 2 then see how I'm writing 55 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.460
 points inscribed as logo of 2 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.730
 of the five in base 2 so we have long 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.330
 four times x + 24 base 2005 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.580
 this implies if you change 15 by the blog of 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.580
 two so raised at the base 2 r has here 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.310
 then this second equality soon 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.410
 four times more 24 on base two is 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.800
 equal to over two so high in the 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.340
 22 5 high basis is equal to 32 then the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.430
 place and if soon of two high 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.510
 the ba 22'll put that right on 32 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.670
 base two good this here comes nothing the logo 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.950
 of xis in the base bié equal soon after in the 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.750
 basis of if and only if x is equal to y if 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.270
 Do you have any questions that you can 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.460
 prove this equivalence here that is 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:19.030
 barbie china logo is equal to the lobby 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:22.340
 by bbc only if x blow using this 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.040
 equivalence here we will solve the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.990
 equation in what way so using 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.010
 exactly this equivalence here 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:34.040
 so I have to four times x + 24 is 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.470
 equal to 32 500 taking it all here 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.560
 as being an x 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.040
 This is how being mine now 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:47.090
 solving this equation of the first degree 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.240
 we arrive at what we arrive at 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.460
 four times x is equal to 8 because the step 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.460
 and 24 on the opposite side 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.750
 it comes with negative signal 32 - 24 is 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.450
 eight 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.520
 Now step to good can pass 14 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.790
 video is not correct talk step 4 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.640
 dividing but roughly to stay 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.610
 the easier we pass four video 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.430
 then it is getting x is equal to 8/4 and always 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.350
 who came to 2 opera and what was the 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.860
 condition of existence x has to be 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.890
 more than six or so I get you 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.969
 mine my ink solution 'inside 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.509
 of this set here 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:30.779
 the two belonging to this set 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.339
 yes then what will be the solution of 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.679
 equation 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.869
 note that reached 2 satisfies the condition 

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:38.639
 of existence which is greater x - is 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:40.649
 so the solution is usually people 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.159
 place is whether it is the same 

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:45.959
 the set containing only the number 2 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.579
 annotation here is the notation of 

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:49.469
 then the solution is equal to 

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:53.339
 set containing the number two 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:58.439
 then to this equation here her solution 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:07:00.539
 is x go 2 bibliography is the author is a 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:03.419
 new from paiva
