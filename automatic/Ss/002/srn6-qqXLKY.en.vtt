00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.750 

so<00:00:00.269> let's<00:00:00.510> talk<00:00:00.690> about<00:00:00.750> how<00:00:01.319> bone<00:00:01.979> forms<00:00:02.610> like

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
so let's talk about how bone forms like

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.400 
so let's talk about how bone forms like
where<00:00:02.970> does<00:00:03.060> your<00:00:03.240> bone<00:00:03.389> come<00:00:03.750> from<00:00:04.020> in<00:00:04.319> the

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
where does your bone come from in the

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.670 
where does your bone come from in the
first<00:00:04.620> place<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.350> relevant<00:00:07.350> because

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
first place and this is relevant because

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.009 
first place and this is relevant because
there<00:00:07.980> are<00:00:08.099> actually<00:00:08.490> two<00:00:08.849> different

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
there are actually two different

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.280 
there are actually two different
processes<00:00:10.019> by<00:00:10.290> which<00:00:10.320> bone<00:00:11.030> organs<00:00:12.049> form<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
processes by which bone organs form and

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.589 
processes by which bone organs form and
they<00:00:13.740> don't<00:00:13.980> come<00:00:14.219> out<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.460> nowhere<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:15.330> not

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
they don't come out of nowhere it's not

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.710 
they don't come out of nowhere it's not
like<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.460> random<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.760> camel<00:00:18.029> cell<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.570> going

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
like a random as in camel cell is going

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.810 
like a random as in camel cell is going
to<00:00:18.810> say<00:00:19.050> oh<00:00:19.320> gee<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> feel<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.340> need<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> bone

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
to say oh gee I feel like we need a bone

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.890 
to say oh gee I feel like we need a bone
here<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.080> let's<00:00:22.289> build<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.980> bone<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
here so let's build some bone it in the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.070 
here so let's build some bone it in the
process<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:26.359> development<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.660> fetal

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
process of development like fetal

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.660 
process of development like fetal
development<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.519> little

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
development when you are just a little

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.700 
development when you are just a little
slime<00:00:30.060> inside<00:00:30.480> your<00:00:30.840> Mama's<00:00:31.260> belly<00:00:31.790> you<00:00:33.649> at<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
slime inside your Mama's belly you at a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.180 
slime inside your Mama's belly you at a
certain<00:00:35.100> point<00:00:35.309> about<00:00:36.059> eight<00:00:36.300> weeks<00:00:36.570> along

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
certain point about eight weeks along

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.330 
certain point about eight weeks along
your<00:00:38.190> body<00:00:38.399> says<00:00:39.260> we<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.680> structures<00:00:41.160> in

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
your body says we now have structures in

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.270 
your body says we now have structures in
place<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:42.000> build<00:00:42.719> bone<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:43.680> two<00:00:44.040> ways

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
place to build bone and there's two ways

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.790 
place to build bone and there's two ways
that<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.579> happens<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.809> first<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that that happens the first one that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.279 
that that happens the first one that
we're<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.070> talk<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.610> called

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
we're going to talk about is called

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.090 
we're going to talk about is called
intramembranous<00:00:49.289> ossification<00:00:53.660> Brennus

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
intramembranous ossification Brennus

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.910 
intramembranous ossification Brennus
ossification<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.840> ossification<00:00:58.379> make<00:00:58.739> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
ossification is an ossification make you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.950 
ossification is an ossification make you
think<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.520> bone<00:01:00.559> ossification<00:01:02.570> yeah<00:01:03.570> we're

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
think a bone ossification yeah we're

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
think a bone ossification yeah we're
making<00:01:04.140> bone<00:01:04.589> dog<00:01:05.010> bones<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:07.070> all<00:01:08.240> bone

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
making bone dog bones so all bone

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.380 
making bone dog bones so all bone
formation<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.979> start<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.790> some

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
formation you have to start with some

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.560 
formation you have to start with some

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
sort of connective tissue precursor you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.450 
sort of connective tissue precursor you
can't<00:01:15.990> make<00:01:16.619> bone<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.619> random<00:01:19.619> cell<00:01:20.159> or

and if you somebody went in and like
squished<00:02:15.220> your<00:02:15.459> head

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
squished your head

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.210 
squished your head
they'd<00:02:16.120> squish<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.690> because<00:02:17.019> it's<00:02:17.379> just<00:02:17.980> dense

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
they'd squish it because it's just dense

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.100 
they'd squish it because it's just dense
irregular<00:02:18.700> connective<00:02:18.849> tissue<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:19.900> not

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
irregular connective tissue it is not

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.490 
irregular connective tissue it is not
yet<00:02:20.319> bone<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> first<00:02:22.780> thing<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.110> happens

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
yet bone so the first thing that happens

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.530 
yet bone so the first thing that happens
is<00:02:23.769> that<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.580> dense<00:02:24.970> irregular<00:02:25.420> connective

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
is that this dense irregular connective

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.750 
is that this dense irregular connective
tissue<00:02:26.640> membrane<00:02:27.640> has<00:02:29.190> mesenchymal<00:02:30.190> cells<00:02:30.580> in

tissue membrane has mesenchymal cells in

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.570 
tissue membrane has mesenchymal cells in
there<00:02:34.349> right<00:02:35.349> makes<00:02:35.799> perfect<00:02:36.280> sense

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
there right makes perfect sense

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.630 
there right makes perfect sense
and<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.450> missing<00:02:37.780> Komal<00:02:38.049> cells<00:02:38.319> are<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:39.430> to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and the missing Komal cells are going to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.509 
and the missing Komal cells are going to
differentiate<00:02:40.620> ultimately<00:02:41.620> into

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
differentiate ultimately into

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.710 
differentiate ultimately into
osteoblasts

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
osteoblasts

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.339 
osteoblasts
and<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:46.450> happens<00:02:46.989> in<00:02:47.489> like<00:02:48.489> an<00:02:48.670> Austin

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
and this happens in like an Austin

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.259 
and this happens in like an Austin
Center<00:02:50.349> like<00:02:51.069> there<00:02:51.250> are<00:02:51.430> there<00:02:51.790> are<00:02:51.819> places

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
Center like there are there are places

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.319 
Center like there are there are places
in<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.590> dense<00:02:54.160> irregular<00:02:54.549> connective<00:02:54.700> tissue

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
in the dense irregular connective tissue

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.960 
in the dense irregular connective tissue
membrane<00:02:56.290> where<00:02:57.010> there's<00:02:57.579> going<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.819> be<00:02:57.879> a

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
membrane where there's going to be a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.869 
membrane where there's going to be a
thickening<00:02:58.599> and<00:02:59.069> the<00:03:00.069> mesenchymal<00:03:00.430> cells

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
thickening and the mesenchymal cells

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.849 
thickening and the mesenchymal cells
there<00:03:01.299> are<00:03:01.329> going<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.959> differentiate<00:03:02.410> and

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
there are going to differentiate and

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.369 
there are going to differentiate and
become<00:03:03.129> osteoblasts<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.379> osteoblasts

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
become osteoblasts and the osteoblasts

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.089 
become osteoblasts and the osteoblasts
are<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.829> start<00:03:06.069> doing<00:03:06.430> their<00:03:07.120> thing<00:03:07.599> as

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
are going to start doing their thing as

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.039 
are going to start doing their thing as
they<00:03:09.099> produce<00:03:09.840> bone<00:03:10.840> matrix<00:03:11.819> or<00:03:12.819> bone<00:03:13.629> tissue

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
they produce bone matrix or bone tissue

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.559 
they produce bone matrix or bone tissue
of<00:03:14.590> course<00:03:15.579> they're<00:03:15.879> going<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.030> get<00:03:16.209> trapped

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
of course they're going to get trapped

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.960 
of course they're going to get trapped
and<00:03:16.870> become<00:03:17.139> osteocytes<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.639> course

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
and become osteocytes and of course

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.309 
and become osteocytes and of course
they're<00:03:19.239> going<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.569> build<00:03:19.780> their<00:03:19.959> little

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
they're going to build their little

Laguna's around themselves surrounded by
bone<00:03:23.260> matrix<00:03:23.829> and<00:03:24.630> eventually<00:03:25.630> they<00:03:26.230> actually

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
bone matrix and eventually they actually

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.500 
bone matrix and eventually they actually
are<00:03:26.799> going<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.040> make<00:03:27.280> spongy<00:03:28.269> bone<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:31.269> would

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
are going to make spongy bone this would

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.379 
are going to make spongy bone this would
be<00:03:31.660> step<00:03:31.900> three<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:33.160> osteoblasts<00:03:34.150> makes

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
be step three the osteoblasts makes

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:40.710 
be step three the osteoblasts makes
spongy<00:03:34.989> bone<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:38.910> now<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:39.970> have<00:03:40.540> all<00:03:40.690> the

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
spongy bone and now you have all the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.530 
spongy bone and now you have all the
spongy<00:03:41.349> bone<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:43.530> osteoblasts<00:03:45.299> oops

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
spongy bone and the osteoblasts oops

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.690 
spongy bone and the osteoblasts oops
we<00:03:47.019> don't<00:03:47.169> go<00:03:47.290> backwards<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.829> our<00:03:47.950> numbers<00:03:48.250> we

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
we don't go backwards in our numbers we

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.069 
we don't go backwards in our numbers we
go<00:03:48.880> forwards<00:03:50.040> most<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.310> time<00:03:52.079> the

go forwards most of the time the

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.740 
go forwards most of the time the

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
osteoblasts in the spongy bone keep

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.930 
osteoblasts in the spongy bone keep
building<00:03:56.139> bone<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.980> eventually<00:03:57.669> can<00:03:57.819> you

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
building bone and eventually can you

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.289 
building bone and eventually can you
visualize<00:03:58.180> how<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.650> spongy<00:04:00.129> bone<00:04:00.160> could<00:04:01.000> if

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
visualize how the spongy bone could if

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.199 
visualize how the spongy bone could if
we<00:04:01.959> kept<00:04:02.230> building<00:04:02.769> bone<00:04:03.280> tissue<00:04:03.579> all<00:04:03.910> around

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
we kept building bone tissue all around

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.409 
we kept building bone tissue all around
ourselves<00:04:04.780> if<00:04:04.950> we're<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.069> osteoblasts<00:04:06.910> we

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
ourselves if we're the osteoblasts we

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.559 
ourselves if we're the osteoblasts we
could<00:04:07.599> eventually<00:04:08.579> that<00:04:09.579> bone<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.209> spongy

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
could eventually that bone the spongy

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.890 
could eventually that bone the spongy
bone<00:04:10.599> could<00:04:10.989> turn<00:04:11.230> into<00:04:11.530> compact<00:04:12.040> bone<00:04:12.220> and

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
bone could turn into compact bone and

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.949 
bone could turn into compact bone and
the<00:04:13.900> end<00:04:14.139> model<00:04:15.129> that<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.430> end<00:04:15.609> up<00:04:15.790> with<00:04:16.030> is<00:04:16.299> a

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
the end model that you end up with is a

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.189 
the end model that you end up with is a
layer<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.560> compact<00:04:18.070> bone<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.840> this<00:04:19.959> is<00:04:20.079> my

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
layer of compact bone so this is my

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.430 
layer of compact bone so this is my
compact<00:04:20.620> bone<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:21.360> then<00:04:22.360> what's<00:04:22.659> in<00:04:22.900> between

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
compact bone and then what's in between

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.040 
compact bone and then what's in between
your<00:04:24.190> compact<00:04:24.640> bone

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
your compact bone

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.430 
your compact bone
spongy<00:04:27.050> bone<00:04:27.230> a<00:04:28.150> little<00:04:29.150> bit<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.450> mess<00:04:29.660> you

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
spongy bone a little bit of a mess you

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.720 
spongy bone a little bit of a mess you
get<00:04:30.620> what<00:04:30.770> I'm<00:04:30.860> saying<00:04:30.890> right<00:04:31.220> there<00:04:31.370> and

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
get what I'm saying right there and

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.670 
get what I'm saying right there and
that's<00:04:31.910> like<00:04:32.150> if<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.360> chop<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> bone<00:04:33.110> in<00:04:33.470> half

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
that's like if you chop a bone in half

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.020 
that's like if you chop a bone in half
and<00:04:33.890> you<00:04:33.950> look<00:04:34.130> on<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.400> inside<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.730> look<00:04:34.910> at

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
and you look on the inside you look at

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.690 
and you look on the inside you look at
the<00:04:35.180> bone<00:04:35.540> like<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.590> medullary<00:04:36.800> cavity<00:04:37.340> in

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
the bone like the medullary cavity in

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.970 
the bone like the medullary cavity in
the<00:04:37.730> middle<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.300> bone<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.660> space<00:04:39.200> where<00:04:39.800> the

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
the middle of a bone the space where the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.980 
the middle of a bone the space where the
bone<00:04:40.250> marrow<00:04:40.520> is<00:04:41.470> it's<00:04:42.470> like<00:04:42.740> kind<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.990> hid

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
bone marrow is it's like kind of hid

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.230 
bone marrow is it's like kind of hid
looks<00:04:45.290> spongy<00:04:45.920> and<00:04:46.100> that's<00:04:46.640> because<00:04:47.000> there's

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
looks spongy and that's because there's

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.500 
looks spongy and that's because there's
spongy<00:04:47.750> bone<00:04:47.930> tissue<00:04:48.200> in<00:04:48.560> there<00:04:49.300> one<00:04:50.300> thing

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
spongy bone tissue in there one thing

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.150 
spongy bone tissue in there one thing
that<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.750> did<00:04:50.900> not<00:04:51.200> tell<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:51.650> about<00:04:51.680> bone

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
that I did not tell you about bone

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.310 
that I did not tell you about bone
tissue<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:52.970> this<00:04:53.360> is<00:04:53.510> also<00:04:53.690> true<00:04:53.870> about

the periosteum so the tissue that it's

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.310 
the periosteum so the tissue that it's
made<00:05:17.150> out<00:05:17.360> of<00:05:17.510> is<00:05:17.690> dense<00:05:17.900> irregular

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
made out of is dense irregular

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.770 
made out of is dense irregular
connective<00:05:18.440> tissue<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.970> structure<00:05:20.600> is

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
connective tissue the structure is

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.640 
connective tissue the structure is
called<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.500> periosteum<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:23.150> periosteum

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
called the periosteum the periosteum

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.920 
called the periosteum the periosteum
houses<00:05:24.650> different<00:05:25.270> cells<00:05:26.270> that<00:05:26.630> are<00:05:26.780> going<00:05:26.840> to

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
houses different cells that are going to

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.640 
houses different cells that are going to
help<00:05:27.250> maintain<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.780> continue<00:05:29.780> building<00:05:30.230> and

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
help maintain and continue building and

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.310 
help maintain and continue building and
growing<00:05:30.950> this<00:05:31.520> bone<00:05:32.270> which<00:05:32.600> originally<00:05:33.080> was

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
growing this bone which originally was

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.130 
growing this bone which originally was
formed<00:05:33.710> through<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:34.070> process<00:05:34.640> of

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
formed through the process of

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.260 
formed through the process of
intramembranous<00:05:36.140> ossification<00:05:37.120> how<00:05:38.120> does

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
intramembranous ossification how does

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.500 
intramembranous ossification how does
that<00:05:38.390> work<00:05:38.630> for<00:05:38.660> y'all<00:05:39.910> let's<00:05:40.910> talk<00:05:41.150> about<00:05:41.270> the

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
that work for y'all let's talk about the

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.650 
that work for y'all let's talk about the
other<00:05:41.690> form<00:05:42.560> of<00:05:42.970> ossification<00:05:43.970> which<00:05:44.510> is

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
other form of ossification which is

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.570 
other form of ossification which is
endochondral<00:05:45.170> ossification<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:46.160> that's<00:05:46.370> how

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
endochondral ossification and that's how

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.290 
endochondral ossification and that's how
we<00:05:46.640> end<00:05:46.940> up<00:05:47.090> with<00:05:47.150> our<00:05:47.360> long<00:05:47.870> bones
