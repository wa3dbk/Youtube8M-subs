like the old Volvo p1800 back in the day
that<00:01:59.020> rear<00:01:59.229> window<00:01:59.560> there<00:02:00.250> was<00:02:00.310> also<00:02:00.460> a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
that rear window there was also a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.609 
that rear window there was also a
concept<00:02:01.000> car<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.240> Volvo<00:02:01.570> made<00:02:01.899> a<00:02:02.110> while<00:02:02.350> back

concept car that Volvo made a while back
and<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:04.450> pretty<00:02:04.659> true<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.200> concept<00:02:05.740> I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
and it's pretty true to that concept I

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.210 
and it's pretty true to that concept I
must<00:02:06.280> say<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:08.560> they<00:02:08.769> did<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.950> great<00:02:09.099> job

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
must say I think they did a great job

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.970 
must say I think they did a great job
styling<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:10.000> car<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.690> what<00:02:11.680> we'll<00:02:11.830> really

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
styling this car and what we'll really

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.309 
styling this car and what we'll really
needed<00:02:12.340> something<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.599> know<00:02:13.690> spice<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.080> up

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
needed something to you know spice it up

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.080 
needed something to you know spice it up
a<00:02:14.440> little<00:02:14.470> bit<00:02:14.769> because<00:02:15.370> their<00:02:15.640> cars<00:02:15.849> are

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
a little bit because their cars are
