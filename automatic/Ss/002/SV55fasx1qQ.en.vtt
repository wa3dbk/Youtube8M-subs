00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.610
 hello sports friends only 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.860
 dotcom physics and electrostimulation 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.079
 puntocom pedro garcÃ­a sports 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.820
 us again 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.469
 I have enough friends who are 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.449
 buying second cattle net and tell me 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.890
 hey pedro and how do we use 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.600
 at the tip ride with the conpes 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.079
 wireless because we do not know 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.739
 we know that mails and balloons with 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.210
 this type of plugs we can use 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.630
 you can look for the motor point pencil 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.760
 there is simply a video what 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.830
 think about doing it in all management 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.940
 video and I have it anyway I'll put 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:09.820
 the list of the videos below there is another 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.240
 video in which he taught that with him 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.850
 compex 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.909
 is placed and you can use the point 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.079
 engine to locate forgiveness can 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.170
 use the engine account to 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.100
 locate your simple motor point this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.049
 I do not have any doubt 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.420
 but of course the doubt comes with the conpes 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.580
 Wehrle as I do because it has the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 type of connection that others have 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.530
 you can do it in the same way 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.409
 let's open for example 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:50.380
 we do it as an example, imagine 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.409
 this we use as negatives and this what 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.679
 we use an example as positive 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.920
 we put negative the one that does not have the 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.140
 Light that has light 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.090
 let's use a positive negative what 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.590
 we put in your site and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.250
 here we can check it 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.140
 and we created the mushroom 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.070
 is the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.170
 apply gel or gel 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.150
 we locate we select we select 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.550
 as it does not have motor point program 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.840
 selection we would do the program well 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.110
 descontracturante for example or the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.640
 endorphinic program any of those 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.350
 two can help us find in the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.660
 motor point 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.810
 we select let's go up the 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:43.680
 click click intensity and exactly the same 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.019
 that with a conpes with connection is nothing 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.049
 very simple remember you have to grando 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.659
 if you see a lot of action does not fall because the 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.670
 final the pencil point motor has a 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.549
 connection exactly like that of 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.180
 electrodes then if the 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.770
 electrode 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.160
 enters 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.660
 in the vine point motor 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.100
 we look for each other once we find the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.100
 motor point we put the patch 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.100
 we place 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.710
 the electrode and to work is simple you 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.830
 I put in anyway in the part of 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:24.180
 down on youtube the previous video where 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.670
 I had where I taught how to look for the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.770
 Motor point with pencil point motor 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.500
 ok it's simple it does not have a lot 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.600
 complication so with this video 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.030
 the question of how to use is resolved 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.980
 the pencil point motor with the complete 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.630
 air comes hope that helped you 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.840
 See you in the next video to 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.840
 soon
