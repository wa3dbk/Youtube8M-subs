00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
anything anyways so really simply it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.630 
anything anyways so really simply it
allows<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> combine<00:00:37.920> buildings<00:00:38.489> with

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
allows you to combine buildings with

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
allows you to combine buildings with
other<00:00:38.790> buildings<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.200> stick<00:00:40.410> around

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
other buildings this is not stick around

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.750 
other buildings this is not stick around
for<00:00:40.800> when<00:00:40.890> people<00:00:41.040> attack<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.610> base<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
for when people attack your base and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
for when people attack your base and
when<00:00:42.059> they<00:00:42.149> talk<00:00:42.329> you're<00:00:42.480> basically

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
when they talk you're basically

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
when they talk you're basically
completely<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> normal<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.370> I'll<00:00:44.460> show

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
completely back to normal so I'll show

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.590 
completely back to normal so I'll show
you<00:00:44.670> how<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.879> works<00:00:45.030> right<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.510> take

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you how it works right here you can take

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.450 
you how it works right here you can take
any<00:00:45.840> building<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.829> yeah<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.190> looks<00:00:47.309> good

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
any building and yeah that looks good

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.150 
any building and yeah that looks good
right<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.870> very<00:00:49.050> simply<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.860> can

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
right there so just very simply you can

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
right there so just very simply you can
with<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> couple<00:00:51.210> clicks<00:00:51.300> combine<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.379> with

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
with a couple clicks combine it with

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
with a couple clicks combine it with
another<00:00:52.500> building<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.699> I've<00:00:53.789> got<00:00:53.969> two

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
another building so now I've got two

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
another building so now I've got two
barracks<00:00:54.629> right<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.860> they're

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
barracks right here you can see they're

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
barracks right here you can see they're
intersecting<00:00:56.579> pretty<00:00:57.300> silly<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.780> there

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
intersecting pretty silly right there

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.569 
intersecting pretty silly right there
you<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.890> cool<00:00:59.100> looking<00:00:59.370> stuff

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you get some pretty cool looking stuff

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.420 
you get some pretty cool looking stuff
though<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.289> perhaps<00:01:01.289> let's<00:01:01.710> take<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.219> guy

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
though so perhaps let's take this guy

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.789 
though so perhaps let's take this guy
right<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> combine<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.660> over<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
right here and combine it over here and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.870 
right here and combine it over here and
I'll<00:01:04.949> show<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.129> how<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
I'll show you how to do this in just a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420 
I'll show you how to do this in just a
second<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.470> easily<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.189> we've

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
second but just that easily now we've

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.219 
second but just that easily now we've
got<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> campfire<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:09.630> next<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> our<00:01:10.049> Town

to<00:05:24.599> mess<00:05:24.780> around<00:05:24.900> with<00:05:25.080> you<00:05:25.199> get<00:05:25.319> to<00:05:25.409> see<00:05:25.530> how

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
to mess around with you get to see how

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.920 
to mess around with you get to see how
the<00:05:25.650> games<00:05:25.949> created<00:05:26.430> for<00:05:26.940> example<00:05:27.360> down<00:05:27.750> here

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
the games created for example down here

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.689 
the games created for example down here
in<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.080> ocean<00:05:28.470> you<00:05:28.620> can<00:05:28.740> see<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:28.949> there's<00:05:29.190> the

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
in the ocean you can see it there's the

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.310 
in the ocean you can see it there's the
use<00:05:29.819> of<00:05:29.970> shadow<00:05:30.150> effect<00:05:30.659> so<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.960> buildings

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
use of shadow effect so the buildings

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.810 
use of shadow effect so the buildings
are<00:05:31.440> actually<00:05:31.530> behind<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:32.159> shading<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.789> the

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
are actually behind a shading and the

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.689 
are actually behind a shading and the
waves<00:05:33.630> are<00:05:33.930> going<00:05:34.440> on<00:05:34.500> top<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:34.979> other<00:05:35.159> cases<00:05:35.400> it

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
waves are going on top in other cases it

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:36.920 
waves are going on top in other cases it
seems<00:05:35.909> to<00:05:36.000> stack<00:05:36.270> them<00:05:36.509> in<00:05:36.539> interesting

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
seems to stack them in interesting

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.140 
seems to stack them in interesting
orders<00:05:37.409> so<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:38.159> didn't<00:05:38.520> do<00:05:38.580> any<00:05:38.729> stacking

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
orders so I didn't do any stacking

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.129 
orders so I didn't do any stacking
really<00:05:39.330> in<00:05:39.389> this<00:05:39.479> case<00:05:39.539> I'm<00:05:39.840> sure<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.050> can

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
really in this case I'm sure you can

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.499 
really in this case I'm sure you can
come<00:05:40.169> up<00:05:40.349> with<00:05:40.380> some<00:05:40.590> creative<00:05:40.979> things<00:05:41.509> for
