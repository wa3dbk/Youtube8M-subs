assist I'm gonna do Lane keep system and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
assist I'm gonna do Lane keep system and
then<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:39.989> gonna<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.230> into<00:00:40.350> intensity<00:00:40.950> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
then I'm gonna go into intensity so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.389 
then I'm gonna go into intensity so
check<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:44.070> hear<00:00:44.250> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
check this out that's how you hear that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.150 
check this out that's how you hear that
let's<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.149> how<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.500> steering<00:00:46.500> wheel<00:00:46.649> shaking

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
let's see how the steering wheel shaking

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.130 
let's see how the steering wheel shaking
that's<00:00:47.910> normal<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:50.070> low<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:51.140> find

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that's normal and that's low I find

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.439 
that's normal and that's low I find
these<00:00:52.260> systems<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.070> somewhat<00:00:54.059> intrusive

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
these systems to be somewhat intrusive

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
these systems to be somewhat intrusive
and<00:00:55.020> basically<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.680> Lane<00:00:55.860> keep<00:00:56.100> does<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and basically what Lane keep does is it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.740 
and basically what Lane keep does is it
notices<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> knows<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.190> you're<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
notices and knows that you're on the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.340 
notices and knows that you're on the
highway<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> spots<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.600> broken<00:01:03.600> line<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
highway and it spots the broken line and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
highway and it spots the broken line and
the<00:01:04.650> solid<00:01:04.830> yellow<00:01:05.159> line<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.540> car

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the solid yellow line and if the car

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.380 
the solid yellow line and if the car
starts<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.260> veer<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> highway<00:01:09.060> or

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
starts to veer out of the highway or

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
starts to veer out of the highway or
across<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> dotted<00:01:10.560> yellow<00:01:10.590> line<00:01:11.130> it'll

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
across the dotted yellow line it'll

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.230 
across the dotted yellow line it'll
actually<00:01:12.860> steer<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.159> correct<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.119> gonna

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
actually steer to correct so I'm gonna

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700 
actually steer to correct so I'm gonna
put<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.630> high<00:01:15.840> intensity<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.500> means

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
put it on high intensity which means

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
put it on high intensity which means
it's<00:01:16.860> gonna<00:01:16.950> give<00:01:17.189> me<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.400> lot<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.880> feedback<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it's gonna give me a lot of feedback and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
it's gonna give me a lot of feedback and
it's<00:01:19.320> gonna<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.560> relatively<00:01:20.100> intrusive<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it's gonna be relatively intrusive and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's gonna be relatively intrusive and
we're<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.090> give<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> try<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:22.250> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
we're gonna go give it a try here and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
we're gonna go give it a try here and
we'll<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.610> how<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> does<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.479> normally<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
we'll see how it does now normally the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.330 
we'll see how it does now normally the
way<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.200> systems<00:01:25.380> work<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
way these systems work is you have to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.550 
way these systems work is you have to
have<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.549> hand<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> steering<00:01:27.180> wheel

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
have your hand on the steering wheel

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.679 
have your hand on the steering wheel
even<00:01:28.560> though<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.159> car<00:01:29.400> could<00:01:29.689> potentially

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
even though the car could potentially

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.740 
even though the car could potentially
drive<00:01:31.290> itself<00:01:31.680> down<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.100> road<00:01:32.509> but<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
drive itself down this road but of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.270 
drive itself down this road but of
course<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.200> doesn't<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> doing<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
course for doesn't want you doing that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.609 
course for doesn't want you doing that
going<00:01:35.729> down<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> road<00:01:36.150> might<00:01:36.479> freak<00:01:37.110> some

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
going down the road might freak some

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
going down the road might freak some
people<00:01:37.650> out

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
people out

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.380 
people out
so<00:01:40.080> here<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:41.010> to<00:01:41.189> speed<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:42.150> gonna

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so here we go we have to speed I'm gonna

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.560 
so here we go we have to speed I'm gonna
set<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> high<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.549> turn<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.790> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
set to high just turn it on with this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.800 
set to high just turn it on with this
little<00:01:45.810> switch<00:01:45.930> over<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.259> time<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.780> as<00:01:48.780> soon

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
little switch over here time and as soon

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.010 
little switch over here time and as soon
as<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> finds<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:50.070> lines<00:01:50.450> it'll<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.540> green<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
as it finds the lines it'll go green it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.660 
as it finds the lines it'll go green it
just<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.590> gone<00:01:52.890> green<00:01:53.130> down<00:01:53.340> here<00:01:53.369> so

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
just it's just gone green down here so

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.090 
just it's just gone green down here so
it<00:01:53.759> knows<00:01:53.940> where<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.540> lane<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.890> now<00:01:56.040> I'm

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it knows where the lane is so now I'm

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.820 
it knows where the lane is so now I'm
gonna<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.580> try<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> veer<00:01:57.869> off<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.409> road

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
gonna have it try to veer off the road

with hands-free this time let's see if

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.460 
with hands-free this time let's see if
it<00:02:13.410> corrects<00:02:14.660> look<00:02:15.660> at<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.019> corrected

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470

but it can't be very annoying it since
I've<00:02:38.250> got<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.519> intensity<00:02:39.060> set<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.450> high

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
I've got this intensity set to high

auto corrects and
it's<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.459> good<00:02:49.640> system<00:02:49.819> but<00:02:50.750> if<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.890> used<00:02:52.069> to

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
it's a good system but if you used to

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
having the car not drive itself it's

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.130 
having the car not drive itself it's
kind<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.700> disconcerting<00:02:58.909> so<00:02:59.569> it's<00:02:59.689> a<00:02:59.750> nice<00:02:59.900> and
