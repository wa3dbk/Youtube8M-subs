00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.040
 It's a pleasure to be here presenting this 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.389
 for all the people to finish 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.389
 news program that is with a smile 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.560
 044 alice is directly but what 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 interesting that it has beyond that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.730
 they have little cameras to shoot the flight 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730
 it looks a little like a flying saucer 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.560
 that is seen from a distance 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 this tree 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.250
 it's like a similar material just 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.879
 to avoid the blows and to break them 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.020
 the propellers so that it works 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.700
 but anyone who drives from a 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.690
 remote control as they are used 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.629
 that is to handle some device 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.699
 electronic accident this is handled with 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.530
 this tablet with the ipad we talk about 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 this just I connect with a 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.800
 application is helicopter this moment 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.690
 which is on is transmitting 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.020
 a wireless wifi signal as if 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.000
 was a router in our house 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.140
 What I do now is connect with 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.369
 the application that this helicopter brings 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.530
 just and I'm going to make it fly with the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.340
 first the camera and I will show a 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.340
 little bit first you connected me 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.890
 if you help me, you are going to create the helicopter 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.890
 so that people see 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.660
 details 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.890
 Oh 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:41.570
 and just and the good thing that I in the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.570
 I repeat flight I have this 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.800
 how interesting can you handle this 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.000
 tablet the ipad from an iphone from a 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.039
 ipod and soon the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.679
 apps just for android 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.300
 I give it on and automatically the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.370
 another is going to suspend a height is not 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.650
 They scare the leaves because they 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.650
 can fly has been flying the hairstyles 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.409
 the dates 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.849
 is amazing 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:52.099
 [Music] 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.099
 this television room 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:05.299
 for that place where people are 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.530
 do not 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.659
 Tablet can do drop a 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.659
 bit 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.580
 [Music]

 in a way play and also what 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.170
 interesting that you can register the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.170
 flight because you already have a usb 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.759
