okay<00:00:00.510> it's<00:00:00.930> time<00:00:01.199> for<00:00:01.469> another<00:00:01.650> layout<00:00:02.250> update

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:02.810 
okay it's time for another layout update

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.329 
okay it's time for another layout update
as<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:03.959> can<00:00:04.110> see<00:00:04.290> that's<00:00:04.680> where<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.040> new

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
as you can see that's where the new

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.540 
as you can see that's where the new
level<00:00:05.670> crossings<00:00:06.060> gone<00:00:06.359> well<00:00:07.309> that's<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> old

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
level crossings gone well that's the old

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.370 
level crossings gone well that's the old
level<00:00:08.940> crossings<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.510> new<00:00:09.630> location<00:00:10.170> I

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
level crossings the new location I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.350 
level crossings the new location I
should<00:00:10.650> say<00:00:12.259> let's<00:00:13.259> just<00:00:13.469> scan<00:00:13.740> around<00:00:14.360> where

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
should say let's just scan around where

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.760 
should say let's just scan around where
the<00:00:15.630> new<00:00:16.410> sidings<00:00:16.949> still<00:00:17.310> are<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:18.529> tons<00:00:19.529> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the new sidings still are with tons and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.550 
the new sidings still are with tons and
tons<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.070> locos<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.670> these<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.810> DCC

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
tons of locos in these are the DCC

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.349 
tons of locos in these are the DCC
sidings<00:00:23.010> basically<00:00:23.609> everything<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.180> see

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
sidings basically everything you see

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.689 
sidings basically everything you see
there<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:26.090> DCC<00:00:27.119> every<00:00:27.990> single<00:00:28.260> loco<00:00:28.650> has<00:00:29.490> been

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
there is DCC every single loco has been

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.470 
there is DCC every single loco has been
chipped<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.410> can<00:00:31.410> run<00:00:31.759> with<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> DCC

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.290 
chipped and can run with a DCC

the main line which is now called loop

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.920 
the main line which is now called loop
for<00:00:52.250> confusingly<00:00:53.539> even<00:00:54.539> though<00:00:54.629> there's<00:00:54.809> only

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
for confusingly even though there's only

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.920 
for confusingly even though there's only
three<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.430> gonna<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.930> loop

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
three because there is gonna be a loop

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
three because there is gonna be a loop
one<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.100> ready<00:00:59.309> yet<00:01:00.980> on<00:01:01.980> loop<00:01:02.460> for

one it's just not ready yet on loop for

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.960 
one it's just not ready yet on loop for
the<00:01:03.000> moment<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> class<00:01:04.260> 58<00:01:04.799> my<00:01:05.460> original

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the moment is a class 58 my original

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.800 
the moment is a class 58 my original
class<00:01:06.119> 58<00:01:06.659> from<00:01:06.830> 1986<00:01:07.939> which<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.360> DC

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
class 58 from 1986 which is actually DC

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.350 
class 58 from 1986 which is actually DC
but<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.070> these<00:01:11.220> Express<00:01:11.820> points<00:01:12.210> on

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
but because these Express points on

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950 
but because these Express points on
Elektra<00:01:12.840> frogged<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:14.240> can<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> loop

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
Elektra frogged I can have the loop

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.219 
Elektra frogged I can have the loop
either<00:01:16.439> DC<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.130> DC<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.570> completely<00:01:19.110> up

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
either DC or DC see it's completely up

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.570 
either DC or DC see it's completely up
to<00:01:19.259> me<00:01:20.750> there's<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:21.840> extra<00:01:22.290> siding<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.369> here

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
to me there's an extra siding just here

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.960 
to me there's an extra siding just here
as<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:24.229> which<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.350> been<00:01:25.500> put<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
as well which has been put in that's the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.399 
as well which has been put in that's the
DM<00:01:27.360> new<00:01:27.540> siding<00:01:27.950> ignore<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> fact<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
DM new siding ignore the fact that this

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
DM new siding ignore the fact that this
sliced<00:01:31.409> off<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> Pendolino<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
sliced off bit of Pendolino in it at the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
sliced off bit of Pendolino in it at the
moment<00:01:33.170> that's<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
moment that's because this is the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
moment that's because this is the
longest<00:01:35.630> rolling<00:01:36.860> unit<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
longest rolling unit we have and is

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.490 
longest rolling unit we have and is
perfect<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.320> testing<00:01:42.170> whether<00:01:43.170> you've<00:01:43.350> got

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
perfect for testing whether you've got

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.389 
perfect for testing whether you've got
enough<00:01:43.920> clearance<00:01:44.189> around<00:01:44.729> curves<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.329> stuff

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
enough clearance around curves and stuff

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
enough clearance around curves and stuff
so<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.840> basically<00:01:49.369> it's<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.549> change<00:01:51.110> there's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
so so basically it's all change there's

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.620 
so so basically it's all change there's
even<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.740> light<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.220> we've<00:01:53.970> started<00:01:54.299> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
even a little light now we've started to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.719 
even a little light now we've started to
experiment<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.170> lights<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.710> laying<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
experiment with lights and laying the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.670 
experiment with lights and laying the
cables<00:01:57.180> under<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> track<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.920> Lego<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.460> gone

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
cables under the track the Lego is gone

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.749 
cables under the track the Lego is gone
don't<00:02:01.680> worry<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.100> been<00:02:02.280> replaced<00:02:02.610> with

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
don't worry it's not been replaced with

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.950 
don't worry it's not been replaced with
a<00:02:03.180> half<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.810> mineshaft<00:02:05.030> I'm<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.329> try<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
a half of a mineshaft I'm going to try a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960 
a half of a mineshaft I'm going to try a
new<00:02:07.469> technique<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:08.009> hoisting<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> cables

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
new technique of hoisting the cables

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.820 
new technique of hoisting the cables
above<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> lines<00:02:09.569> using<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> Telegraph

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
above the lines using the Telegraph

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.420 
above the lines using the Telegraph
Falls<00:02:12.570> which<00:02:13.570> was<00:02:13.720> suggested<00:02:13.930> by<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.500> user<00:02:15.130> in

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
Falls which was suggested by the user in

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.180 
Falls which was suggested by the user in
the<00:02:15.550> corner<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> screen<00:02:16.240> just<00:02:16.630> there<00:02:17.190> so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
the corner of the screen just there so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.480 
the corner of the screen just there so
see<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.090> that's<00:02:19.360> effective<00:02:19.840> or<00:02:19.960> not<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:21.280> yeah

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
see if that's effective or not so yeah

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.600 
see if that's effective or not so yeah
this<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.060> called<00:02:22.540> loop<00:02:22.780> four<00:02:23.400> because<00:02:24.400> these

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
this is called loop four because these

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.330 
this is called loop four because these
are<00:02:24.790> fourth<00:02:25.090> radius<00:02:25.570> curves<00:02:26.010> these<00:02:27.010> are<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
are fourth radius curves these are the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.550 
are fourth radius curves these are the
third<00:02:27.610> radius<00:02:28.150> curves<00:02:28.480> which<00:02:28.990> have<00:02:29.230> now<00:02:29.380> got<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
third radius curves which have now got a

lot less of after sending out so many to
different<00:02:34.210> people<00:02:34.480> that's<00:02:35.020> them<00:02:35.260> they're<00:02:36.160> all

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
different people that's them they're all

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.460 
different people that's them they're all
the<00:02:36.670> third<00:02:36.850> ones<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.420> left<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.380> was

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
the third ones I have left and that was

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.330 
the third ones I have left and that was
originally<00:02:38.920> three<00:02:39.910> or<00:02:40.000> four<00:02:40.180> times<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.780> size

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
originally three or four times the size

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.400 
originally three or four times the size
they're<00:02:42.340> my<00:02:42.640> second<00:02:43.120> radius<00:02:43.450> their<00:02:44.050> first

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
they're my second radius their first

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.820 
they're my second radius their first
radius<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.750> they're<00:02:46.750> all<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.470> other<00:02:47.620> bits

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
radius and they're all the other bits

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.110 
radius and they're all the other bits
and<00:02:47.950> bobs<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.860> fourth<00:02:51.280> radius<00:02:51.700> this

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
and bobs so this is fourth radius this

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.390 
and bobs so this is fourth radius this
is<00:02:52.240> third<00:02:52.480> radius<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.530> second<00:02:54.040> radius

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
is third radius this is second radius

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.100 
is third radius this is second radius
and<00:02:54.610> there's<00:02:55.060> even<00:02:55.510> going<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.660> be<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.810> first

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
and there's even going to be a first

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.060 
and there's even going to be a first
radius<00:02:56.709> just<00:02:57.610> for<00:02:57.970> um<00:02:58.350> some<00:02:59.350> really<00:02:59.770> really

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
radius just for um some really really

little<00:03:03.970> wagons<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.600> stuff<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.890> yeah<00:03:06.160> we've

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
little wagons and stuff so yeah we've

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.199 
little wagons and stuff so yeah we've
got<00:03:06.640> loop<00:03:07.300> 4<00:03:07.660> which<00:03:08.590> goes<00:03:09.010> all<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.520> way<00:03:09.820> around

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
got loop 4 which goes all the way around

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.290 
got loop 4 which goes all the way around
the<00:03:10.450> outside<00:03:11.220> all<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.370> costs<00:03:12.670> are<00:03:12.850> behind

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
the outside all that costs are behind

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.430 
the outside all that costs are behind
the<00:03:13.420> heater<00:03:13.600> which<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:13.990> going<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.320> to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
the heater which is going to have to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.300 
the heater which is going to have to
move<00:03:15.150> all<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.390> way<00:03:16.420> under<00:03:16.690> there<00:03:16.840> under<00:03:17.320> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
move all the way under there under the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.870 
move all the way under there under the

big Teac unit full of locators and roll

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.880 
big Teac unit full of locators and roll
and<00:03:22.030> stuff<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:24.190> right<00:03:24.640> background<00:03:25.890> and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
and stuff and then right background and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.640 
and stuff and then right background and
then<00:03:27.100> we've<00:03:27.400> got<00:03:27.550> loop<00:03:27.910> 3<00:03:28.360> which<00:03:29.350> does<00:03:29.530> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
then we've got loop 3 which does the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.290 
then we've got loop 3 which does the
same<00:03:29.830> thing<00:03:31.080> but<00:03:32.080> uses<00:03:32.910> smaller<00:03:33.910> radius

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
same thing but uses smaller radius

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.420 
same thing but uses smaller radius
curves<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.989> hasn't<00:03:35.920> got<00:03:37.680> an<00:03:38.680> operating<00:03:39.190> speed

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
as high as the value and then there's

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.449 
as high as the value and then there's
loop<00:03:41.890> 2<00:03:42.250> which<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.360> actually<00:03:43.720> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.459> shoot
