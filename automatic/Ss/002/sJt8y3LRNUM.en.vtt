the way to walk that I ended up getting

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
the way to walk that I ended up getting
across<00:01:14.040> without<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> being<00:01:14.850> applied<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.180> best

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
thing for me to do and that actually

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.039 
thing for me to do and that actually
attracted<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> most<00:01:18.119> women<00:01:18.540> ended<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:18.900> being

attracted the most women ended up being

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
attracted the most women ended up being
the<00:01:19.110> same<00:01:19.380> walk<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.920> allowed<00:01:20.220> me<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> walk

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the same walk that allowed me to walk

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
the same walk that allowed me to walk
into<00:01:20.909> oncoming<00:01:21.509> foot<00:01:21.840> traffic<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.380> everybody

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
into oncoming foot traffic and everybody

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
into oncoming foot traffic and everybody
park<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.610> front<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> me

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
park in front of me

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.490 
park in front of me
and<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:24.840> were<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> few<00:01:24.990> different<00:01:25.350> things

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and there were a few different things

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.810 
and there were a few different things
that<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.100> how<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that you have to know how to do one is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.090 
that you have to know how to do one is
that<00:01:27.080> it's<00:01:28.080> really<00:01:28.229> difficult<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> with

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that it's really difficult to do it with

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
that it's really difficult to do it with
your<00:01:29.280> sunglasses<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.570> reason<00:01:30.810> why<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
your sunglasses on and the reason why is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.749 
your sunglasses on and the reason why is
because<00:01:31.140> no<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.310> where<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.579> looking

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
because no one can see where I'm looking

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.810 
because no one can see where I'm looking
so<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.079> my<00:01:34.110> sunglasses<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.549> can't

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
so if I have my sunglasses on you can't

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.160 
so if I have my sunglasses on you can't
really<00:01:36.000> tell<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.479> looking<00:01:36.600> at<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.020> or

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
really tell if I'm looking at you or

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.300 
really tell if I'm looking at you or
looking<00:01:37.320> somewhere<00:01:37.680> else<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.159> people

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
looking somewhere else and so people

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.490 
looking somewhere else and so people
just<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.210> naturally<00:01:39.990> will<00:01:40.170> guess<00:01:40.320> you're

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
just just naturally will guess you're

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.289 
just just naturally will guess you're
looking<00:01:40.590> some<00:01:40.890> other<00:01:41.009> place<00:01:41.280> or<00:01:41.549> maybe<00:01:42.090> they

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
looking some other place or maybe they

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.910 
looking some other place or maybe they
guess<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.659> you're<00:01:42.960> looking<00:01:43.259> directly<00:01:43.500> ahead

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
guess that you're looking directly ahead

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.960 
guess that you're looking directly ahead
but<00:01:44.130> they<00:01:44.189> don't<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:44.670> looking<00:01:44.909> at

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
but they don't know if you're looking at

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
but they don't know if you're looking at
them<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.540> them<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
them and you see them so that's a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.980 
them and you see them so that's a
problem<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> usually<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> without

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
problem so usually I do it without

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649 
problem so usually I do it without
sunglasses<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.710> first<00:01:50.040> place<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:51.509> just

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
sunglasses on first place that just

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.609 
sunglasses on first place that just
helps<00:01:51.960> mean<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.290> little<00:01:52.409> bit<00:01:52.530> better

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
helps mean it a little bit better

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.130 
helps mean it a little bit better
another<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.640> take<00:01:53.820> wide<00:01:54.630> strides

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
another is that if you take wide strides

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.410 
another is that if you take wide strides
then<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:57.310> almost<00:01:57.550> think<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.150> are<00:01:58.240> less

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
then you almost think that you are less

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.060 
then you almost think that you are less
likely<00:01:58.450> get<00:01:58.900> out<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.140> way<00:01:59.290> now<00:01:59.740> less

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
likely get out of the way now less

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.070 
likely get out of the way now less
likely<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.370> move<00:02:00.580> if<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.240> take<00:02:01.420> wider<00:02:01.690> strides

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
likely to move if you take wider strides

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.290 
likely to move if you take wider strides
than<00:02:02.290> they<00:02:02.470> do<00:02:02.530> almost<00:02:03.220> always<00:02:03.760> they<00:02:04.180> will

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
than they do almost always they will

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.130 
than they do almost always they will
move<00:02:04.510> out<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.750> your<00:02:04.840> way

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
move out of your way

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.750 
move out of your way
now<00:02:05.260> there's<00:02:05.470> three<00:02:06.130> exceptions<00:02:06.550> for<00:02:06.640> this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
now there's three exceptions for this

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.249 
now there's three exceptions for this
people<00:02:07.479> who<00:02:07.570> are<00:02:07.659> walking<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.080> same

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
people who are walking the same

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.809 
people who are walking the same
direction<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:09.009> as<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.399> there<00:02:09.520> in<00:02:09.610> front<00:02:09.729> of

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
direction as you as in there in front of

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.309 
direction as you as in there in front of
you<00:02:09.910> walking<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.300> way<00:02:10.360> they<00:02:10.899> don't<00:02:11.050> see<00:02:11.200> you

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
you walking this way they don't see you

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.860 
you walking this way they don't see you
so<00:02:11.530> they<00:02:11.650> can<00:02:11.709> they<00:02:12.400> can't<00:02:12.640> turn<00:02:13.030> around<00:02:13.150> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
so they can they can't turn around the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.020 
so they can they can't turn around the
other<00:02:14.020> exception<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.530> children<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.190> never<00:02:15.610> I

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
other exception is children I never I

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.760 
other exception is children I never I
never<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.900> pulled<00:02:17.170> my<00:02:17.290> ground<00:02:17.560> with<00:02:17.680> her

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
never like pulled my ground with her

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.410 
never like pulled my ground with her
kids<00:02:18.040> always<00:02:18.340> walk<00:02:18.520> out<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.820> way<00:02:18.970> or

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
kids always walk out of the way or

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.780 
kids always walk out of the way or
pregnant<00:02:20.050> women<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.560> know<00:02:20.680> or<00:02:21.550> someone

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
pregnant women you know or someone

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.190 
pregnant women you know or someone
pushing<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> stroller<00:02:22.150> like<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.020> just

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
pushing a stroller like that I just

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.020 
pushing a stroller like that I just
don't<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.680> then<00:02:23.709> really<00:02:24.040> old<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.700> don't

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
don't do it and then really old I don't

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.940 
don't do it and then really old I don't
say<00:02:25.810> my<00:02:25.959> ground<00:02:26.170> against<00:02:26.410> them<00:02:26.530> either<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.739> just

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
say my ground against them either I just

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860 
say my ground against them either I just
move<00:02:27.130> out<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.400> way<00:02:27.430> that's<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:28.630> kind<00:02:28.840> of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
move out of the way that's just kind of

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.680 
move out of the way that's just kind of
a<00:02:28.959> dick<00:02:29.110> move<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.580> essentially<00:02:31.120> what<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.360> do<00:02:31.450> is

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
a dick move so essentially what I do is

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.900 
a dick move so essentially what I do is
I<00:02:32.140> take<00:02:32.440> wide<00:02:32.860> stride<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.550> my<00:02:33.640> heel

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
I take wide stride so that my heel

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.880 
I take wide stride so that my heel
touches<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> ground<00:02:35.019> first

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
touches the ground first

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.640 
touches the ground first
as<00:02:36.280> far<00:02:36.550> far<00:02:37.030> away<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.330> possibly<00:02:37.780> can<00:02:38.019> for<00:02:38.500> my

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
as far far away to possibly can for my

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.140 
as far far away to possibly can for my
body<00:02:38.860> now<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.100> have<00:02:39.280> flip-flops<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:39.850> right<00:02:40.000> now

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
body now I have flip-flops on right now

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.090 
body now I have flip-flops on right now
I'm<00:02:40.360> normally<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.690> did<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.050> originally<00:02:41.950> with

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
I'm normally I did this originally with

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.890 
I'm normally I did this originally with
these<00:02:42.280> shoes<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.120> are<00:02:43.209> kind<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.420> like<00:02:43.540> Cuban

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
these shoes that are kind of like Cuban

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.150 
these shoes that are kind of like Cuban
heel<00:02:44.080> shoes<00:02:44.350> with<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.560> little<00:02:44.800> bit<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.010> heel

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
heel shoes with a little bit of a heel

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.220 
heel shoes with a little bit of a heel
on<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.340> back<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.239> when<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.630> walked<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.050> made<00:02:47.200> a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
on the back and when I walked it made a

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.530 
on the back and when I walked it made a
noise<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:48.790> think<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> lot<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.330> reason

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
noise and I think a lot of the reason

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.449 
noise and I think a lot of the reason
why<00:02:49.660> guys<00:02:49.900> don't<00:02:50.320> do<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.709> kind<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.040> walk<00:02:51.250> is

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
why guys don't do this kind of walk is

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.699 
why guys don't do this kind of walk is
for<00:02:52.000> two<00:02:52.120> reasons<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.720> whenever<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.530> walk

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
for two reasons one is whenever you walk

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.070 
for two reasons one is whenever you walk
this<00:02:53.890> way<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.760> easier<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.750> fall

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
this way it's easier for you to fall

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.720 
this way it's easier for you to fall
down<00:02:56.290> as<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.980> you're<00:02:57.190> not<00:02:57.250> looking<00:02:57.580> at<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
down as in you're not looking at the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.040 
down as in you're not looking at the
ground<00:02:57.880> constantly<00:02:58.420> because<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.660> can't<00:02:58.900> be

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
ground constantly because you can't be

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.600 
ground constantly because you can't be
so<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.709> have<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.920> look<00:03:00.010> at<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.190> ground<00:03:00.340> and

and so try it out and I will show you a
demonstration<00:04:00.470> here<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.069> just<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.670> side<00:04:01.880> view

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
demonstration here of just a side view

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.150 
demonstration here of just a side view
demonstration<00:04:02.840> were<00:04:02.930> quick<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.709> this<00:04:06.860> is<00:04:07.040> the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
demonstration were quick so this is the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.030 
demonstration were quick so this is the
UH<00:04:07.190> this<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:07.700> wrong<00:04:08.060> so<00:04:08.620> short<00:04:09.620> steps<00:04:09.890> like

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
UH this is wrong so short steps like

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:22.930 
UH this is wrong so short steps like
this<00:04:20.500> not<00:04:21.500> makes<00:04:21.769> me<00:04:21.889> heartless<00:04:22.220> this<00:04:22.520> problem

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
this not makes me heartless this problem

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.620 
this not makes me heartless this problem
right

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.390 

the<00:04:30.630> difference<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.170> my<00:04:31.410> heads-up<00:04:31.950> about

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
the difference is my heads-up about

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.950 
the difference is my heads-up about
looking<00:04:32.640> at<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.790> ground<00:04:33.030> my<00:04:33.450> steps<00:04:33.750> are<00:04:33.870> as

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
looking at the ground my steps are as

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.720 
looking at the ground my steps are as
wide<00:04:34.140> as<00:04:34.320> possible<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.310> I'm<00:04:35.430> looking

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
wide as possible and I'm looking

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.700 
wide as possible and I'm looking
directly<00:04:35.970> forward<00:04:36.540> as<00:04:36.630> I'm<00:04:36.750> going<00:04:37.050> my<00:04:37.410> heels

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
directly forward as I'm going my heels

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.620 
directly forward as I'm going my heels
touching<00:04:38.040> around

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.290 

why<00:04:42.170> that's<00:04:43.070> my<00:04:43.310> life's<00:04:43.520> ended<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.030> have

why that's my life's ended I have

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.000 
why that's my life's ended I have
committed<00:04:44.720> fully<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.080> this<00:04:45.230> step<00:04:45.530> whenever<00:04:45.860> I

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
committed fully to this step whenever I

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.740 
committed fully to this step whenever I
step<00:04:46.220> there<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:47.090> that's<00:04:47.240> probably<00:04:47.480> my<00:04:47.600> most

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
step there and that's probably my most

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.900 
step there and that's probably my most
important<00:04:48.230> parts<00:04:48.470> is<00:04:48.590> process<00:04:49.040> for<00:04:49.550> making<00:04:49.670> a

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
important parts is process for making a

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.550 
important parts is process for making a
step<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.420> many<00:04:50.570> guys<00:04:50.720> are<00:04:50.870> afraid<00:04:51.080> to<00:04:51.200> commit

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
step so many guys are afraid to commit
