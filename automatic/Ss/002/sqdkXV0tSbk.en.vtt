days a year

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.130 
days a year
I<00:00:19.410> miss<00:00:19.830> maybe<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.699> don't<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.390> less<00:00:21.660> than<00:00:21.900> 10

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I miss maybe I don't know less than 10

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.990 
I miss maybe I don't know less than 10
probably<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.740> would<00:00:22.920> say<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.189> total<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.760> that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
probably I would say in total and that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.550 
probably I would say in total and that
doesn't<00:00:24.269> even<00:00:24.300> include<00:00:24.480> days<00:00:24.990> where<00:00:25.320> I'll

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
doesn't even include days where I'll

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.080 
doesn't even include days where I'll
actually<00:00:25.800> double<00:00:26.220> upload<00:00:26.490> anyway<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.000> think

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
actually double upload anyway so I think

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.310 
actually double upload anyway so I think
I<00:00:27.330> actually<00:00:27.630> make<00:00:27.779> up<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.170> that

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
I actually make up for that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.500 
I actually make up for that
so<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> basically<00:00:28.740> upload<00:00:29.340> every<00:00:29.880> single<00:00:30.330> day

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
so I basically upload every single day

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
so I basically upload every single day
like<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.869> upload<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> lot<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.769> when<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> don't

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
even keep up with phase or anything but

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.539 
even keep up with phase or anything but
basically<00:02:32.349> there's<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.739> thing<00:02:33.040> introduced

basically there's this thing introduced
that<00:02:33.819> phase<00:02:34.420> made<00:02:34.780> called<00:02:35.110> red<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.650> it's

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
that phase made called red and it's

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.069 
that phase made called red and it's
basically<00:02:36.099> like<00:02:36.459> another<00:02:36.909> team<00:02:37.329> backed<00:02:37.750> by

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
basically like another team backed by

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.960 
basically like another team backed by
phase<00:02:38.409> now<00:02:38.860> not<00:02:39.190> everybody<00:02:39.579> really<00:02:39.760> knows

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
phase now not everybody really knows

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.580 
phase now not everybody really knows
anything<00:02:40.150> about<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.629> and<00:02:40.959> there<00:02:41.260> are<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.349> lot<00:02:41.409> of

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
people in phase actually pretty much

is<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.500> all<00:02:47.620> don't<00:02:47.829> even<00:02:48.040> know<00:02:48.159> exactly<00:02:48.640> what

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
is we all don't even know exactly what

people<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.069> like<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.370> assume<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.970> know<00:02:52.090> what

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
people that like to assume you know what

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.119 
people that like to assume you know what
it<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.659> people<00:02:52.930> think<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.409> this<00:02:53.620> whole<00:02:53.799> red

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
it is people think that this whole red

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.129 
it is people think that this whole red
division<00:02:54.609> is<00:02:54.819> like<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.540> don't<00:02:55.810> even<00:02:55.900> know<00:02:56.019> if<00:02:56.049> I

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
division is like I don't even know if I

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.330 
division is like I don't even know if I
wouldn't<00:02:56.349> even<00:02:56.440> call<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.950> vision<00:02:57.129> it's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
wouldn't even call it the vision it's

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.979 
wouldn't even call it the vision it's
just<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.549> separate<00:02:57.849> team<00:02:58.090> basically<00:02:58.629> people

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
just a separate team basically people

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.110 
just a separate team basically people
think<00:02:59.319> this<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.590> like<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.889> Benchwarmers<00:03:00.280> for

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
think this is like the Benchwarmers for

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.149 
think this is like the Benchwarmers for
Phase<00:03:01.629> two<00:03:01.659> like<00:03:02.109> get<00:03:02.349> into<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.769> team<00:03:02.980> they

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
Phase two like get into the team they

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.319 
Phase two like get into the team they
think<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.459> like<00:03:03.579> this<00:03:03.760> some<00:03:04.060> sort<00:03:04.209> of

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
think it's like this some sort of

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.119 
think it's like this some sort of
stepping-stone<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.079> get<00:03:05.230> into<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> team<00:03:05.829> and

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
stepping-stone to get into the team and

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.410 
stepping-stone to get into the team and
then<00:03:06.250> there<00:03:06.430> are<00:03:06.459> other<00:03:06.639> people<00:03:06.849> that<00:03:07.030> think

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
then there are other people that think

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.720 
then there are other people that think
like<00:03:07.480> these<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:08.409> going<00:03:08.620> personality<00:03:09.250> and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
like these is like going personality and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.490 
like these is like going personality and
this<00:03:09.849> whole<00:03:10.030> red<00:03:10.359> squad<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.989> just<00:03:11.260> sticking

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
this whole red squad is just sticking

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.710 
this whole red squad is just sticking
towards<00:03:12.099> clips<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.760> shit<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.269> reality

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
going on so to just sit there and assume

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.250 
going on so to just sit there and assume
what<00:03:24.579> it<00:03:24.699> is<00:03:24.819> is<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.180> kind<00:03:25.359> of<00:03:25.449> stupid<00:03:26.079> bad

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
what it is is just kind of stupid bad

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.780 
what it is is just kind of stupid bad
things<00:03:26.470> happen<00:03:26.799> when<00:03:26.889> you<00:03:27.010> assume<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.519> mean<00:03:27.699> you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
things happen when you assume I mean you

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.369 
things happen when you assume I mean you
could<00:03:27.940> be<00:03:28.060> completely<00:03:28.629> right<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:29.230> say

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
could be completely right and just say

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.050 
could be completely right and just say
it's<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.709> bench-warming<00:03:30.069> team<00:03:30.519> or<00:03:30.760> you

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
it's like a bench-warming team or you

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.240 
it's like a bench-warming team or you
can<00:03:31.239> say<00:03:31.449> that<00:03:31.480> it's<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.319> clip<00:03:32.709> team<00:03:33.040> or

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
can say that it's the clip team or

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.349 
can say that it's the clip team or
whatever<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.639> fuck<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.879> want<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.090> call<00:03:34.209> you

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
whatever the fuck you want to call you

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.610 
whatever the fuck you want to call you
could<00:03:34.569> be<00:03:34.720> right<00:03:34.959> because<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.290> don't<00:03:35.379> know

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
could be right because I don't know

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.900 
could be right because I don't know
either<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:36.040> can't<00:03:36.220> really<00:03:36.370> write<00:03:36.579> anything

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
either you can't really write anything

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.180 
either you can't really write anything
off<00:03:37.269> exactly<00:03:37.569> for<00:03:38.139> what<00:03:38.169> this<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.799> people

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190

wanted<00:03:39.400> me<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.489> talk<00:03:39.730> about<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.329> simply

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
wanted me to talk about it and simply

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.420 
wanted me to talk about it and simply
there's<00:03:41.199> not<00:03:41.410> really<00:03:41.590> much<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.859> talk<00:03:42.160> about

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
there's not really much to talk about

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.619 
there's not really much to talk about
what<00:03:42.549> that<00:03:42.579> kind<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.000> thing<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.269> just<00:03:43.299> like

what that kind of thing is just like
nobody<00:03:43.959> really<00:03:44.199> knows<00:03:44.349> anything<00:03:44.590> about<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.949> so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
nobody really knows anything about it so

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.559 
nobody really knows anything about it so
if<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.370> just<00:03:45.579> started<00:03:45.879> talking<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.419> just

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
if I just started talking and just

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.569 
if I just started talking and just
assuming<00:03:47.169> what<00:03:47.319> I<00:03:47.349> thought<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.829> was<00:03:48.010> then<00:03:48.549> I

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
assuming what I thought it was then I

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.129 
assuming what I thought it was then I
would<00:03:48.940> just<00:03:48.970> look<00:03:49.449> like<00:03:49.599> a<00:03:49.660> fucking<00:03:50.049> idiot

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
would just look like a fucking idiot

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.449 
would just look like a fucking idiot
like<00:03:50.410> all<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.650> other<00:03:50.769> people<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.160> think

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
like all the other people that think

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.710 
like all the other people that think
they<00:03:51.579> know<00:03:51.609> what<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.150> when<00:03:52.419> there<00:03:52.599> is<00:03:52.629> no

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
they know what it is when there is no

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.479 
they know what it is when there is no
information<00:03:53.139> released<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.099> look<00:03:54.250> like<00:03:54.370> an

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
information released and I look like an

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.979 
information released and I look like an
idiot<00:03:54.579> enough<00:03:54.970> at<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.180> time<00:03:55.329> so<00:03:55.599> I<00:03:55.629> would<00:03:55.959> just

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
idiot enough at the time so I would just

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.720 
idiot enough at the time so I would just
rather<00:03:56.379> not<00:03:56.530> assuming<00:03:57.190> things<00:03:57.400> are<00:03:57.519> bad

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
rather not assuming things are bad

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.300 
rather not assuming things are bad
because<00:03:58.180> that's<00:03:58.359> how<00:03:58.650> STDs<00:03:59.650> are<00:03:59.829> spread<00:04:00.129> what

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
because that's how STDs are spread what

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.240 
because that's how STDs are spread what
I<00:04:00.340> recommend<00:04:00.819> is<00:04:00.970> use<00:04:01.389> protection<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.250> just

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
I recommend is use protection and just

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.670 
I recommend is use protection and just
think<00:04:03.730> before<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.150> say<00:04:04.480> shit<00:04:04.540> or<00:04:05.230> think
