00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.680
 hello friends still playing 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.430
 video games and don't play board games 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.800
 then we are not going to you but instead 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.110
 this will tell you about one very cool 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.110
 board game lord of tokyo 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.940
 love the worked world deep 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.670
 history is difficult multi-level system 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.040
 pumping and fighting then this game is not for you 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.230
 there is nothing of it you just 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.320
 bloodthirsty monster who dreams 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.450
 devils destroy tokyo by the way drew 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.050
 attention that have a monster in some kind 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.550
 fad about the capital of Japan I don't know 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.770
 what is it but I suspect 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.400
 it's because the japanese are killing 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.400
 dolphins 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.659
 but let's get everything in order you 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.780
 choose one of six monsters go 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.659
 destroys the currents you goal noble but 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.119
 the problem is that same day is still from 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.149
 one to five monsters respectively 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.819
 also decides to destroy tokyo and you don't 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.700
 together destroy and you have to 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.700
 fight each other for 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.649
 being called the lord of poker is your goal 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.890
 hold the capital as long as possible 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.869
 Japan captured the city you are not easy 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.380
 have fun but you get 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.049
 victory points gaining 20 such points you 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.360
 win but the problem is that he 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.119
 being in tokyo all the other monsters 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.060
 forgetting about each other begin to attack 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.299
 here you have to choose either 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.899
 risk either wait and then attack and 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.170
 finish off 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.160
 surplus self-confident opponent to 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.160
 throw 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.080
 all-all-all 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.720
 don't kill me the players take turns 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.150
 and the key point of entry is throwing 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.510
 cubes with them you can get 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.790
 victory points earn energy this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.860
 something like local currencies to which 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.620
 you can buy different goodies 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.150
 and also increase your health either and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.780
 get an opportunity to pitch the enemy 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.819
 and capture Tokyo it is important that after 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.599
 first throw you get the opportunity 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:53.019
 throw all or part of the cubes two more 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.810
 times and spread means risk and in 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.519
 drove tokyo risk this is a huge part 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:08.260
 games 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:13.000
 letting the drawing jet start yes I 'm not me 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.540
 well done and that personally i really like 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.160
 this interaction between rivals 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.769
 your every action affects 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.750
 opponents and you have to be prepared that in 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.410
 this game you have neither friends nor 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.410
 allies 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:44.640
 I offer good good let everyone 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:48.400
 once you have a great home 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.790
 5 all all those dollars app on the verge of 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.680
 to get off the skyscraper from him to me 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.980
 hard to talk about the minuses of the game but 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.040
 too hardcore players can play 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.359
 seem too simple the party lasts 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.340
 somewhere 20-30 minutes and ideally you need 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.650
 take place in a relaxed atmosphere 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.049
 if you treat the Tokyo winner 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.069
 too seriously you can spoil 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.470
 impression of the game 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.660
