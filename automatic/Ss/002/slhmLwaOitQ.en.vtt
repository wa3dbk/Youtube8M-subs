00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.970 

it<00:03:33.550> was<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.730> pretty<00:03:34.030> simple<00:03:34.330> installation<00:03:34.980> took

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
it was a pretty simple installation took

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.140 
it was a pretty simple installation took
me<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.160> while<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.340> forget<00:03:36.640> how<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.760> get<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.030> all

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
me a while to forget how to get it all

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.060 
me a while to forget how to get it all
out<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:37.720> thought<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.020> would<00:03:38.110> cool<00:03:38.320> off<00:03:38.500> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
out I just thought it would cool off the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.790 
out I just thought it would cool off the
harness<00:03:39.490> but<00:03:39.930> actually<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.050> take<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.410> fall

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
harness but actually to take the fall

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.819 
harness but actually to take the fall
back<00:03:42.040> first

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.500 

gives<00:03:46.250> me<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.400> little<00:03:46.519> bit<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.819> uniqueness<00:03:47.150> to

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
gives me a little bit of uniqueness to

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.710 
gives me a little bit of uniqueness to
my<00:03:47.629> car<00:03:47.900> now<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:51.129> like<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.159> thank<00:03:52.549> Cottrell
