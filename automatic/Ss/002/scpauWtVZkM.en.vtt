five minutes so the meat will get more

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.550 
five minutes so the meat will get more
sticky<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.240> then<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.870> cutlets<00:02:42.230> will<00:02:42.380> not

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
sticky and then the cutlets will not

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.600 
sticky and then the cutlets will not
fall<00:02:42.770> apart<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:44.650> working<00:02:45.650> working<00:02:45.890> that's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610
