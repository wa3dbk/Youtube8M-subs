00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.430
 and well let's burn files to a dvd 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.179
 currently the dvd were imposed more 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:14.289
 to make movies but with this 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:17.619
 program you can record videos but not 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:20.300
 like to play a dvd in my 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:25.000
 next video maybe make 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.000
 this how to record a movie 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.150
 on a dvd 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.460
 this program called power made 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:42.030
 I'll let you read in the description that 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:42.030
 just the low in the load by the middle 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.969
 this with this can burn for example 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.129
 an anti operating system are no matter 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.720
 that do not register exams like winrar 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.370
 does not affect anything as soon as the hero enters 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.120
 no matter 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.280
 for example in burling and directly 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.400
 would burn on his dvd that in my house and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.400
 I have here as a team 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.149
 and this one owes me empty then that 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.340
 what he's going to do is that he's going to burn 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.920
 so that it never erases good if it 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.009
 they can erase but I'm already in that more 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.250
 I already know what you can put this point of 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.130
 see correctly 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.560
 and it would be re-burling and for example from 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.380
 this operating system 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.110
 it would be installed in the park dvd 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.970
 when I understood the accountant 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.130
 directly good you do not have to start 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.920
 from the rivers to start this system 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.799
 operative as insurance already I saw in my 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.659
 previous life of how they turned to the cb is 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.729
 the same function no more than with the power 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.729
 is an example if we open it alone 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.970
 let's continue direct the amount 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.900
 really and because we want to put a 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.720
 fact 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.080
 a document that has left a task 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.880
 a movie is not and now more wanted 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.530
 put them here directly those that 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.430
 you do not have to be either in 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.960
 system neither nor to have it start it is only 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.200
 open the program and directly here 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.070
 low two us put the files and what 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.600
 more is a pretty useful application I know 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.300
 that many of you already know how to 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.010
 burn times but it's not too much for 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.120
 people who do not know how 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.599
 well here cut the video 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.599
 that makes her burn 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.569
 disk 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.569
 and it would no longer be crazy 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.530
 and within it, the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.530
 information 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.359
 and young people are inside of us 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.180
 it's all for today 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.550
