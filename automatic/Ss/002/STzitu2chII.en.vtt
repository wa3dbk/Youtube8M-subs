00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.870
 so there were signs that can also say he has already uploaded some videos 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.260
 and then yes our two interviews from the games com the game is out now 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.539
 come 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.400
 so there is now a test report 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.610
 this one can be grumpy managing our videos is playing on two 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.839
 second World War 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 The SinnerSchrader do not say World War II again 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.739
 A garden went to him Kroppach through narrow streets other if but remained 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.739
 wobbly has two corner bumps that are always more realistic 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.850
 if it does it 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 that was the last test for him to see a lot of fun then 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.840
 the Battle of Stalingrad is considered one of the most brutal bloody of the second 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.420
 world war II 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.510
 in this scenario, the directory us-numbers is loosely settled 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.810
 the nickname here so heroes is historically naturally arguable 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.610
 because that neither of the two sides really did have the heroes 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.670
 commanding the sixth German AMI first left the city out of the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.840
 Air and artillery in ruins and then on foot and partly 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.280
 In any case, with tanks, this was the plan 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.930
 because the idea strengthen numerically superior to the Russian soldiers 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.240
 great prayers of resistance made the battle suitable for six 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.400
 long months from September 42 to February 43 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.210
 in the end, the Red Army often emerged as lossy winners 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.280
 the Battle of Stalingrad was seen as a turning point in the war in Europe 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.440
 and in fact then the Red Army made their attacks towards Berlin for steel 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.270
 concord 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.600
 The battle is now so by the developer Tripwire Interactive as a basis 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.100
 taken for her new piece 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.210
 At that time, a horrible atmosphere must have prevailed and has felt 60 too 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.210
 we almost 40 years later in front of the screen 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.410
 the atmosphere is extremely good especially the sound and light the norm well done 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.760
 to capture the living often without our opponents seeing 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.840
 it all creates an atmosphere 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.270
 this way can come up easily 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.920
 but these are the preparations as many as that all so long ferry 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.139
 lost 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.329
 and numbers heavily the ugly textures and graphic artists 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.049
 Graphics are not everything because they should not break the game if possible 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.769
 but she found it used to human 3 is old 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:24.339
 The ducklings have been around for five years now and you can see that 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.689
 though and that must say the middle of the Holy Book 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.540
 the game is still good, especially in the «Be filter like the Moor Movie 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.909
 Adding filters again often storms washed-out textures and 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.909
 sometimes very ugly texture to Prague 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.899
 most often stands out as the simple graphics in single-player 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:46.209
 that's just how we must learn to be on the alert and everything 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.249
 Have preliminary round opponents 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:51.819
 the singleplayer is the multiplayer with Bach's and pretty cool made and 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.989
 cutscenes 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.769
 their youngest can not score their own goal above 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.229
 historical visual axes 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.539
 there we are in the single-player always commander and 15 percent each 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.779
 has the fasting possible lead to the hand washing goal is taken 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.499
 become 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.549
 That may be from Angela Wittig 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.679
 she leaves something to be desired 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:13.820
 Let opponents 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.950
 but shoot down Müller and meet us maybe not quite 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.250
 to be simple Uwe multiplayer shooter once we could be dead 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.449
 single player drink another beer and shoot all enemies 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.619
 more in the final game more on the acts of the military in the marshy area they are with 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.649
 to play with me to get acquainted with the deeds 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.449
 All three of them are still Germany to play 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.639
 because the Russian side Krefelder Flanders right 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.230
 So there are quite a few of the pledges but let's go ahead and buy 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.219
 we only come to places 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.139
 on many cards he plays as an infantile soldier or as a tank crew 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.219
 different game modes 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.840
 The men's heart team deathmatch also gives it a Oberhof emergency call 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.319
 I'm still other modes 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.169
 In the top back, you'll have to try to get Bella off or places today 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.709
 to take or, of course, to defend it 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.389
 the level of difficulty is enormous most of our members seem 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.300
 possible to be hardcore fans 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.799
 and I rarely get degrees 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.930
 but once they are familiar with the totally different feel 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.859
 as with Co di and GEW 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.759
 He also found to get points 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.250
 You are always happy with every game that is not just ours 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:24.289
 Weapons graduations get better the hits five meters depth insights into 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:25.029
 is 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:29.689
 which not only rarely worked according to survival necessities also scrap 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:30.939
 is there 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.090
 also the child is older 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.090
 very cool against the SCO and there is also a commander 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.759
 who can then give you the correct many with the forwarded 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.400
 can 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.180
 even if this feature is not necessary its successful game makes it 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.180
 still fun to get around in group f 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.430
 As I said before, our weapons are better with every degree 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.680
 complete with each shooting movie the bar on for each weapon 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.860
 Finally finally gotten for example a Bayern editors Donhauser 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.410
 Guarantee but also in classrooms threw cross-empirical values ​​exist 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.330
 then simply free new weapons for this damage 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.930
 These are the most diverse genres so we should be with 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.830
 Guns machine guns a machine gun Annika Nies Nathan and 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.500
 Gun in the fight pull in a gun factory of the list ever stood 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.780
 after how many have worn with slower and I definitely with 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.159
 Plus 4 carry 2 of them 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:26.319
 So for example an end of the 40 MWp PSV 41 is also the physical 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.190
 Behavior would have been down next to Earth's gravity or even considered 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.189
 the night watch had correctly hit rooflights or wood 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.199
 St 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.080
 the day of the directory then in Cottbus Anaheim the multiplayer game 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.639
 Let's face it, because good single player is looking for in each one 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.639
 not found 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.139
 but who a good multiplayer and appropriate appeal for me 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.729
 interested and COO 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.610
 find the work here 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.110
 The feeling is completely different here and dying at the beginning but to 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.250
 gradually you will play in and also become better only and alone 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.090
 the graphics are disappointing the global economy at Engine 3 as well 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.599
 Here we have better chances 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.199
 However, you have rarely seen such a good atmosphere that a touch of 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.189
 Cruel fans catching the battle all in all fell to the one or the other 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.039
 Girlfriend who deals with the amount of play 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.029
 and the fast gameplay of so many he is sorry Yapis are in second place over 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.110
 But one thing has to be clear 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.039
 it's different and you do not have to get used to habituation and then law 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.060
 can look away over mistakes like wrong shopping and become full and 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.060
 let carry away from the atmosphere 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.840
 there was to see and to the next place
