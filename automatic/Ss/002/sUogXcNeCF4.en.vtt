I<00:00:15.000> would<00:00:15.269> recommend<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.139> night<00:00:16.470> out

I would recommend this for a night out
feel<00:00:17.580> free<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.330> any<00:00:18.660> lip<00:00:18.900> color<00:00:19.140> with<00:00:19.350> this

feel free to do any lip color with this

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.290 
feel free to do any lip color with this
look<00:00:19.800> since<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.279> pretty<00:00:20.430> neutral<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
look since it's pretty neutral on the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
look since it's pretty neutral on the
eyes<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.810> far<00:00:21.840> as<00:00:22.170> colors<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.830> really<00:00:23.070> use

any<00:00:23.460> lip<00:00:23.699> color<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> think<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.300> would<00:00:24.390> look

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
any lip color and I think it would look

any lip color and I think it would look
great<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.990> decided<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> go<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.980> bold<00:00:26.519> lip<00:00:26.939> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
