you<00:01:43.960> know<00:01:44.080> I<00:01:44.110> try<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.470> be<00:01:44.680> thrifty<00:01:44.980> and

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
you know I try to be thrifty and

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.700 
you know I try to be thrifty and
remember<00:01:45.760> when<00:01:45.940> I<00:01:45.970> was<00:01:46.300> young<00:01:46.540> it<00:01:46.960> was<00:01:47.020> too

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
remember when I was young it was too

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.160 
remember when I was young it was too
expensive<00:01:47.860> actually<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.790> get<00:01:49.030> into<00:01:49.360> RC<00:01:49.540> for<00:01:49.990> me

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
expensive actually to get into RC for me

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.860 
expensive actually to get into RC for me
and<00:01:50.460> today<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.670> not<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.090> bad<00:01:52.270> for<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.660> guys

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
and today it's not so bad for the guys

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.720 
and today it's not so bad for the guys
but<00:01:52.900> still<00:01:53.590> for<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.920> young<00:01:54.100> folks<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.700> think

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
but still for the young folks I think

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.430 
but still for the young folks I think
saving<00:01:55.390> money<00:01:55.660> should<00:01:56.410> be<00:01:56.440> welcomed<00:01:58.230> so<00:01:59.230> for

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
saving money should be welcomed so for

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.110 
saving money should be welcomed so for
that<00:01:59.530> reason<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.430> fact<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.790> i<00:02:00.970> have

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
and make landing around you know it

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.550 
and make landing around you know it
seemly<00:02:55.030> right<00:02:55.330> shape<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:56.140> only<00:02:56.290> took

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
seemly right shape and it only took

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.400 
seemly right shape and it only took
about<00:02:56.709> an<00:02:57.010> hour<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.340> make<00:02:57.670> i<00:02:57.970> also<00:02:58.840> think<00:02:59.140> it'll

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
about an hour to make i also think it'll

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.920 
about an hour to make i also think it'll
never<00:02:59.620> ever<00:02:59.860> break<00:03:00.160> again<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.570> think<00:03:01.630> I
