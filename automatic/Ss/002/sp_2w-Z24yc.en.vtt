00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
came up with the disk drive replacement

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.060 
came up with the disk drive replacement
which<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> week<00:01:30.930> he<00:01:30.960> fusion<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.799> those<00:01:31.920> of

which is the week he fusion for those of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
which is the week he fusion for those of
you<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:33.290> here<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you that do not know here it is on the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.830 
you that do not know here it is on the
back<00:01:36.140> wired<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.490> works<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.729> charm<00:01:38.840> except

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
back wired up works like a charm except

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710 
back wired up works like a charm except
for<00:01:40.079> these<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.650> cable<00:01:41.579> areas<00:01:41.909> they're<00:01:42.420> kind

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
for these two cable areas they're kind

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.560 
for these two cable areas they're kind
of<00:01:42.930> loose<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:44.060> probably<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.149> little<00:01:45.360> bit

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
of loose and probably a little bit

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.660 
of loose and probably a little bit
cheaply<00:01:45.840> made<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.590> sometimes<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
cheaply made so sometimes the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.370 
cheaply made so sometimes the
connections<00:01:48.149> aren't<00:01:48.450> down<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> way

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
connections aren't down on the way

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.190 
connections aren't down on the way
causing<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.729> wiki<00:01:51.210> fusion<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.810> turn<00:01:52.020> on

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
causing the wiki fusion to not turn on

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800 
causing the wiki fusion to not turn on
but<00:01:52.649> otherwise<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.460> works<00:01:53.640> fine<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.570> think

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
but otherwise it works fine and I think

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.450 
but otherwise it works fine and I think
using<00:01:55.049> some<00:01:55.439> hot<00:01:55.590> glue<00:01:55.740> will<00:01:56.009> take<00:01:56.250> care<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
using some hot glue will take care of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.580 
using some hot glue will take care of
that<00:01:56.549> problem<00:01:56.780> here's<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.200> temporary

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that problem here's a little temporary

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.429 
that problem here's a little temporary
switch<00:01:59.659> maybe<00:02:00.659> I'll<00:02:00.810> turn<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.380> you

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
switch maybe I'll turn it on for you

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.510 
switch maybe I'll turn it on for you

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.480 
push it down going to push the down
arrow<00:04:19.850> right<00:04:20.150> now<00:04:20.329> let's<00:04:20.599> see<00:04:20.720> if<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:20.900> resets

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.490 
arrow right now let's see if it resets

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.820 
arrow right now let's see if it resets
ya<00:04:22.490> see<00:04:22.759> it<00:04:23.419> reset<00:04:23.930> when<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.169> was<00:04:24.259> pushing<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.620> on

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
ya see it reset when I was pushing it on

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.999 
ya see it reset when I was pushing it on
like<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.430> third<00:04:25.639> game<00:04:26.320> that's<00:04:27.320> something<00:04:27.860> I'm

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
like the third game that's something I'm

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.529 
like the third game that's something I'm
not<00:04:28.099> really<00:04:28.280> sure<00:04:28.370> about<00:04:28.669> I'm<00:04:29.030> going<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.270> try

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
not really sure about I'm going to try

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.640 
not really sure about I'm going to try
to<00:04:29.570> figure<00:04:29.840> that<00:04:30.080> out<00:04:30.139> maybe<00:04:31.099> ask<00:04:31.340> some<00:04:31.520> people

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
to figure that out maybe ask some people

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.370 
to figure that out maybe ask some people
but<00:04:33.650> this<00:04:34.190> is<00:04:34.370> proof<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.639> it<00:04:34.910> works<00:04:35.199> this<00:04:36.199> is

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
but this is proof that it works this is

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.620 
but this is proof that it works this is
Zelda<00:04:36.889> Wind<00:04:37.070> Waker<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:38.349> yeah<00:04:39.349> there's<00:04:40.099> the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
Zelda Wind Waker and yeah there's the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:49.180 
Zelda Wind Waker and yeah there's the
gamecube<00:04:41.770> turned<00:04:42.770> on<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.560> little<00:04:48.860> bar

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
gamecube turned on and that little bar

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.249 
gamecube turned on and that little bar
you're<00:04:49.490> seeing<00:04:49.759> down<00:04:49.910> there<00:04:49.970> is<00:04:50.300> not<00:04:51.050> actually

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
you're seeing down there is not actually

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.850 
you're seeing down there is not actually

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
there it's just a figment of your

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.409 
there it's just a figment of your
imagination<00:04:55.039> I<00:04:57.009> don't<00:04:58.009> know<00:04:58.099> why<00:04:58.310> TV's<00:04:59.210> do

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419
