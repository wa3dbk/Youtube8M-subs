firstly make mountain folds along the
horizontal<00:00:10.980> lines<00:00:11.750> then<00:00:12.750> open<00:00:13.590> them<00:00:13.710> up<00:00:14.420> if

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
horizontal lines then open them up if

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
make sure to only fold where you can see

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:22.690 
make sure to only fold where you can see
the<00:02:14.090> blue<00:02:14.360> dotted<00:02:14.780> lights

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.580 

again<00:02:23.700> if<00:02:24.209> you're<00:02:24.510> having<00:02:24.720> trouble<00:02:25.170> making<00:02:25.379> a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
again if you're having trouble making a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.610 
again if you're having trouble making a
good<00:02:25.860> sharp<00:02:26.370> fold<00:02:26.750> try<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.810> from<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> opposite

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
good sharp fold try it from the opposite

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:44.000 
good sharp fold try it from the opposite
side<00:02:40.730> moving<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:41.909> let's<00:02:42.750> make<00:02:43.019> diagonal<00:02:43.620> folds

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
side moving on let's make diagonal folds

00:02:44.010 --> 00:03:21.920 
side moving on let's make diagonal folds
on<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.189> other<00:02:44.609> side<00:03:19.609> now<00:03:20.609> if<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.510> find<00:03:21.750> it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
on the other side now if you find it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.839 
on the other side now if you find it
difficult<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.560> make<00:03:22.739> these<00:03:22.980> small<00:03:23.489> valley

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
difficult to make these small valley

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:24.439 
difficult to make these small valley
folds

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
folds

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.990 
folds
flip<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.290> paper<00:03:25.500> over<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.579> and

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
flip the paper over just like this and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.900 
flip the paper over just like this and
pinch<00:03:27.569> them<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:28.650> much<00:03:28.949> easier<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.430> do<00:03:29.730> that

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
pinch them it's much easier to do that

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:52.400 
pinch them it's much easier to do that
way

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.250 

now<00:03:53.410> on<00:03:53.950> these<00:03:54.220> marked<00:03:54.760> areas<00:03:55.210> apply<00:03:55.810> Valley

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
now on these marked areas apply Valley

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.410 
now on these marked areas apply Valley
folds<00:03:56.800> to<00:03:57.280> where<00:03:57.430> you've<00:03:57.550> already<00:03:57.790> made

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
folds to where you've already made

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.190 
folds to where you've already made
mountain<00:03:59.080> folds<00:03:59.910> make<00:04:00.910> sure<00:04:01.240> each<00:04:01.510> crease<00:04:01.930> is

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
mountain folds make sure each crease is

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.770 
mountain folds make sure each crease is
sharp<00:04:02.580> this<00:04:03.580> will<00:04:03.850> help<00:04:04.060> give<00:04:04.270> a<00:04:04.300> much<00:04:04.570> better

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
sharp this will help give a much better

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:20.910 
sharp this will help give a much better
final<00:04:05.440> shape<00:04:18.390> now<00:04:19.390> you<00:04:19.450> have<00:04:19.900> all<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.530> folds

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
final shape now you have all the folds

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.620 
final shape now you have all the folds
you<00:04:21.010> need<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.510> let's<00:04:22.720> turn<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.110> into<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.530> gloop

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
you need so let's turn it into a gloop
