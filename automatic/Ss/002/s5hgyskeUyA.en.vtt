are presently living in the last
generation<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.729> only<00:01:53.969> question<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.570> how<00:01:55.109> long

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
generation the only question is how long

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.520 
generation the only question is how long
is<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> generation<00:01:56.810> there<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:57.960> more<00:01:58.140> than<00:01:58.350> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
is a generation there are more than a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.190 
is a generation there are more than a
few<00:01:58.950> theories<00:01:59.429> at<00:01:59.759> how<00:01:59.969> long<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> generation<00:02:01.020> is

few theories at how long a generation is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.859 
few theories at how long a generation is
but<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> believe<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.909> average<00:02:03.360> lifespan

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
but I believe it is the average lifespan

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.819 
but I believe it is the average lifespan
of<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.439> man<00:02:04.649> or<00:02:04.950> 70<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.850> 80<00:02:06.030> years<00:02:06.500> with<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.649> in

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
of a man or 70 to 80 years with this in

of a man or 70 to 80 years with this in
mind<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.179> last<00:02:09.420> generation<00:02:10.140> began<00:02:10.319> in
