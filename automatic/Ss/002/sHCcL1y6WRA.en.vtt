00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
charging cable i made a bigger before i

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.800 
charging cable i made a bigger before i
guess<00:00:18.359> i<00:00:18.660> didn't<00:00:19.230> explain<00:00:19.529> myself<00:00:19.710> thoroughly

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
guess i didn't explain myself thoroughly

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.300

charging<00:00:27.180> cable<00:00:27.449> won't<00:00:27.570> when<00:00:27.869> will<00:00:28.199> not

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
charging cable won't when will not

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.160 
charging cable won't when will not
charge<00:00:28.590> your<00:00:28.980> phone<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> first<00:00:30.449> thing<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
charge your phone so the first thing the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.750 
charge your phone so the first thing the
first<00:00:31.199> common<00:00:31.769> thing<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.430> always<00:00:32.840> that<00:00:34.760> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
first common thing is always that the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.619 
first common thing is always that the
head<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> wires<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:37.559> exposed<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.629> there

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
head of the wires get exposed and there

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.790 
head of the wires get exposed and there
is<00:00:39.719> anything<00:00:39.960> happens<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.620> our

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is anything happens is because of our

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.569 
is anything happens is because of our
other<00:00:41.040> twisting<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> turning<00:00:42.559> you<00:00:43.559> know<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
other twisting and turning you know that

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.959 
other twisting and turning you know that
eventually<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.180> little<00:00:45.690> red<00:00:45.870> cable<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.760> it's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
eventually a little red cable so if it's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
eventually a little red cable so if it's
not<00:00:48.090> charging<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.440> cables<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.039> going

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
not charging the cables that are going

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.450 
not charging the cables that are going
to<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:51.050> disconnected<00:00:52.160> there's<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> be

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
to be disconnected there's going to be

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.819 
to be disconnected there's going to be
most<00:00:53.879> likely<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.329> ground<00:00:54.600> wire<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.800> ground

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
most likely the ground wire for ground

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.420 
most likely the ground wire for ground
wires<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.449> ones<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.250> this<00:00:59.250> is

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
wires with this ones right here this is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.569 
wires with this ones right here this is
the<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.000> covers<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> wires<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
the one that covers all the wires and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.620 
the one that covers all the wires and
and<00:01:02.579> inside<00:01:03.229> all<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.680> says<00:01:04.920> well

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
and inside all right this one says well

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.460 
and inside all right this one says well
the<00:01:06.630> silver<00:01:07.020> ones

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the silver ones

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.120 
the silver ones
all<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> them<00:01:08.689> ground<00:01:09.689> wires<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.619> silver<00:01:10.920> ones

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
all of them ground wires the silver ones

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.690 
all of them ground wires the silver ones
the<00:01:11.369> ones<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.820> exposed

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.750 

this<00:01:16.700> one's<00:01:16.970> get<00:01:17.360> disconnected<00:01:17.690> that<00:01:18.760> means

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
this one's get disconnected that means

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.730 
this one's get disconnected that means
that<00:01:21.160> your<00:01:22.160> phone<00:01:22.340> will<00:01:22.520> not<00:01:22.700> charge<00:01:23.740> so

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
that your phone will not charge so

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.160 
that your phone will not charge so
easily<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.490> just<00:01:25.840> connect<00:01:26.840> them<00:01:26.990> back

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
easily to just connect them back

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.400 
easily to just connect them back
together<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:29.150> they'll<00:01:29.810> get<00:01:29.990> your<00:01:30.170> phone

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
charged that's one thing the other thing

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.210 
charged that's one thing the other thing
is<00:01:33.700> if<00:01:34.700> it's<00:01:34.940> not<00:01:35.200> if<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.410> is<00:01:36.710> not<00:01:36.950> being

great ripped or it has like a like a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.359 
great ripped or it has like a like a
tear<00:02:05.930> in<00:02:06.050> side<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.710> ground<00:02:06.890> wires<00:02:07.130> are

tear in side and the ground wires are

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.280 
tear in side and the ground wires are
making<00:02:07.640> contact<00:02:08.030> with<00:02:08.270> them<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.720> then

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
making contact with them and then

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.030 
making contact with them and then
that'll<00:02:09.590> prevent<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:10.040> from<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.429> from<00:02:12.040> from

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that'll prevent it from it from from

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.130 
that'll prevent it from it from from
transferring<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> data<00:02:14.060> later<00:02:14.270> interrupted

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.759 

so<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.360> case<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:21.260> would<00:02:21.380> literally<00:02:21.590> have

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
so in that case you would literally have

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.320 
so in that case you would literally have
to<00:02:21.830> cut<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.340> wire<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:24.370> peel<00:02:25.370> off<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.120> one

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
to cut the wire and peel off the one

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.840 
to cut the wire and peel off the one
that's<00:02:26.540> unplugged<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.380> attach<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> back<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
that's unplugged and attach it back to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.000 
that's unplugged and attach it back to
over<00:02:29.390> t1<00:02:29.570> I'll<00:02:30.140> text<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.410> back<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.920> other

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
over t1 I'll text you back to the other

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.180 
over t1 I'll text you back to the other
one<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.700> same<00:02:31.910> color<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.510> touch<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.870> back

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
one the same color and touch it back

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.340 
one the same color and touch it back
okay<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.720> will<00:02:35.840> help<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.110> out<00:02:36.170> with

okay and that will help you out with
that<00:02:36.380> problem<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.070> as<00:02:37.370> far<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.880> charging

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
that problem so as far as the charging

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.860 
that problem so as far as the charging
like<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.480> said<00:02:39.489> just<00:02:40.489> expose<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.239> wires<00:02:41.420> cut

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
like I said just expose the wires cut

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.490 
like I said just expose the wires cut
them<00:02:41.989> up<00:02:43.360> pull<00:02:44.360> off<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.660> plastic<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.290> can

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
them up pull off the plastic so you can

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.170 
them up pull off the plastic so you can
see<00:02:45.650> what's<00:02:45.890> going<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.190> in<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.549> link<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.850> there

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
see what's going on in the link in there

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
see what's going on in the link in there
whatever<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.270> see<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.600> sluice<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:50.050> not

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
whatever you see that sluice it's not

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.620 
whatever you see that sluice it's not
connected<00:02:50.850> connected<00:02:51.850> back<00:02:52.030> together<00:02:52.209> this

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
connected connected back together this

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.100 
connected connected back together this
one<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:54.459> also<00:02:54.730> works<00:02:55.030> for<00:02:55.150> charging<00:02:55.630> but<00:02:55.840> since

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
one it also works for charging but since

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.910 
one it also works for charging but since
this<00:02:56.260> one<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.800> think<00:02:57.490> that<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.000> original<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
this one I think that the original the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.370 
this one I think that the original the
other<00:03:00.130> original<00:03:00.819> charger<00:03:01.600> did<00:03:01.840> not<00:03:01.959> come<00:03:02.200> with

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
other original charger did not come with

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.100 
other original charger did not come with
this<00:03:02.640> silver<00:03:03.640> wires<00:03:03.880> ground<00:03:04.330> wires<00:03:04.510> inside

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
this silver wires ground wires inside

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.130 
this silver wires ground wires inside
like<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.530> iPhone<00:03:05.920> did<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.090> one<00:03:07.300> can

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
like this iPhone did so this one can

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.050 
like this iPhone did so this one can
still<00:03:08.410> work<00:03:08.590> with<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:09.070> with<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.459> silver

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
still work with that with this silver

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.870 
still work with that with this silver
part<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.950> not<00:03:12.160> being<00:03:12.310> connected<00:03:12.580> together

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
part here not being connected together

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.760 
part here not being connected together
no<00:03:13.180> more<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:18.160> since<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:19.030> did<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.690> one<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.290> find

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
no more but since I did this one I find

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.240 
no more but since I did this one I find
like<00:03:20.920> cable<00:03:21.640> vancouver's<00:03:22.450> has<00:03:22.830> ground<00:03:23.830> wires

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
like cable vancouver's has ground wires

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.150 
like cable vancouver's has ground wires
inside<00:03:24.730> as<00:03:24.880> well<00:03:25.260> besides<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.500> one<00:03:26.739> it'll

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
inside as well besides this one it'll

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.520 
inside as well besides this one it'll
still<00:03:27.370> charge<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.780> if<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:28.959> have<00:03:29.080> nightmare

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
still charge but if you have nightmare

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.790 
still charge but if you have nightmare

this<00:03:32.800> tape<00:03:33.160> was<00:03:33.280> having<00:03:33.670> being<00:03:34.230> separated

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
this tape was having being separated

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.550 
this tape was having being separated
it's<00:03:36.430> not<00:03:36.580> charging<00:03:37.060> that's<00:03:37.780> because<00:03:38.050> this

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
it's not charging that's because this

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.620 
it's not charging that's because this
ground<00:03:39.130> wire<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.580> needs<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.910> be<00:03:40.030> together<00:03:40.360> with

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
ground wire it needs to be together with

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.520 
ground wire it needs to be together with
this<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.739> what<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.010> do<00:03:42.160> is<00:03:43.860> get<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:44.920> piece<00:03:45.040> of

this so what you do is get a piece of

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.620 
this so what you do is get a piece of
wire<00:03:47.530> they<00:03:48.430> really<00:03:48.790> have<00:03:49.030> something<00:03:49.269> around

circulate<00:04:51.070> all<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.490> way<00:04:51.580> here<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.930> when<00:04:53.410> you

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
circulate all the way here and when you

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.469 
circulate all the way here and when you
only<00:04:53.770> attach<00:04:54.130> this<00:04:54.370> cable<00:04:54.610> right<00:04:54.820> there<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.600> it

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
only attach this cable right there to it

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.969 
only attach this cable right there to it
but<00:04:58.479> that's<00:04:58.870> pretty<00:04:59.139> much<00:04:59.260> it<00:04:59.560> that's<00:04:59.590> easy

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
but that's pretty much it that's easy

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.850 
but that's pretty much it that's easy
like<00:05:00.639> I<00:05:00.760> said<00:05:01.110> this<00:05:02.110> is<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.350> most<00:05:02.530> common

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
like I said this is the most common

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.680 
like I said this is the most common
problem<00:05:03.010> that<00:05:03.250> everybody<00:05:03.700> has<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.180> wire<00:05:04.419> just

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
problem that everybody has the wire just

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.230 
problem that everybody has the wire just
gets<00:05:04.960> exposed<00:05:05.350> like<00:05:05.560> this<00:05:06.000> due<00:05:07.000> to<00:05:07.030> the

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
gets exposed like this due to the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.370 
gets exposed like this due to the
pulling<00:05:07.950> already<00:05:08.950> spinning<00:05:09.280> around<00:05:10.169> okay<00:05:11.169> and

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
pulling already spinning around okay and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.779 
pulling already spinning around okay and
then<00:05:11.500> if<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.740> have<00:05:11.860> rats<00:05:12.070> in<00:05:12.220> your<00:05:12.370> household

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
then if you have rats in your household

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.350 
then if you have rats in your household
pet<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.810> bunny<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.260> they<00:05:14.860> still<00:05:15.400> bit<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.240> off

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
pet a bunny and they still bit it off

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.330 
pet a bunny and they still bit it off
the<00:05:17.050> same<00:05:17.380> thing<00:05:17.680> all<00:05:17.830> you're<00:05:17.979> gonna<00:05:18.100> do<00:05:18.310> is

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
the same thing all you're gonna do is

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.650 
the same thing all you're gonna do is
cut<00:05:18.760> it<00:05:18.850> off<00:05:18.970> where<00:05:19.750> he<00:05:19.870> did<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:21.090> and<00:05:22.090> then<00:05:22.330> just

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
cut it off where he did it and then just

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.740 
cut it off where he did it and then just
connect<00:05:22.960> all<00:05:23.169> the<00:05:23.260> wires<00:05:23.430> back<00:05:24.430> together<00:05:24.750> just

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
connect all the wires back together just

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.710 
connect all the wires back together just
next<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.200> colors<00:05:26.500> make<00:05:26.800> sure<00:05:26.950> that<00:05:27.070> any<00:05:27.720> and

none of the cables touch each other they
all<00:05:33.729> got<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:33.970> be<00:05:34.000> individually<00:05:35.130> wrapped<00:05:36.130> with

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
all got to be individually wrapped with
