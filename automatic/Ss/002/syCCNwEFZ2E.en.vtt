00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.539 
simply really all you do is plug the USB
cable<00:01:24.180> from<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.600> printer<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:26.220> side<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
cable from your printer into one side of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.710 
cable from your printer into one side of
the<00:01:27.390> USB<00:01:28.200> printer<00:01:28.710> hub<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> other

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the USB printer hub and on the other

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.039 
the USB printer hub and on the other
side<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.710> plug<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:33.000> Ethernet<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
side you plug in your Ethernet and you

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.390 
side you plug in your Ethernet and you
would<00:01:34.170> probably<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> situate<00:01:35.220> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
would probably want to situate this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.999 
would probably want to situate this
somewhere<00:01:35.820> near<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:36.720> router<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.740> home

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
somewhere near your router and your home

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.039 
somewhere near your router and your home
you<00:01:38.520> simply<00:01:38.850> plug<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:39.570> Ethernet<00:01:39.900> cable

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you simply plug in an Ethernet cable

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.590 
you simply plug in an Ethernet cable
from<00:01:40.350> your<00:01:40.409> router<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> really

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
from your router to this and really

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990 
from your router to this and really
quite<00:01:43.259> magically<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.250> printer<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
quite magically your printer is going to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
quite magically your printer is going to
show<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:46.320> network<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> can

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
show up on your network and then you can

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880 
show up on your network and then you can
add<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.149> printer<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> network<00:01:49.320> printer<00:01:49.710> in

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
add that printer as a network printer in

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.920 
add that printer as a network printer in
Windows<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.670> Mac<00:01:50.850> OS<00:01:51.119> 10<00:01:51.149> whichever<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
on a wireless network you can print

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
on a wireless network you can print
right<00:01:59.549> over<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.000> wireless<00:02:00.420> network

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
right over your wireless network

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.980 
right over your wireless network
it<00:02:01.020> makes<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> whole<00:02:01.740> situation<00:02:02.329> very<00:02:03.329> very

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
it makes the whole situation very very

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.740 
it makes the whole situation very very
simple<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.490> print<00:02:05.909> server<00:02:06.180> does

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
simple now this print server does

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.820 
simple now this print server does
support<00:02:07.970> DHCP<00:02:08.970> clients<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:10.470> actually

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
support DHCP clients and it's actually

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.290 
support DHCP clients and it's actually
gonna<00:02:10.950> support<00:02:11.250> telnet<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.819> web<00:02:12.000> management

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
gonna support telnet and web management

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.360 
gonna support telnet and web management
software<00:02:12.810> as

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
software as

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.180 
software as
so<00:02:13.610> if<00:02:13.909> you<00:02:14.659> can<00:02:14.989> set<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.349> up<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.040> actually

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
so if you can set it up you can actually

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.160 
so if you can set it up you can actually
print<00:02:16.610> directly<00:02:16.940> over<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> Internet<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.080> can

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
print directly over the Internet you can

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.259 
print directly over the Internet you can
actually<00:02:18.260> print<00:02:18.590> from<00:02:18.890> work<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.730> your<00:02:19.849> printer

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
actually print from work to your printer

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.479 
actually print from work to your printer
at<00:02:20.480> home<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:21.290> not<00:02:21.650> very<00:02:21.950> difficult<00:02:22.129> to<00:02:22.340> do

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
at home it's not very difficult to do

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.119 
at home it's not very difficult to do
all<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:23.060> have<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.239> do<00:02:23.299> is<00:02:23.420> set<00:02:23.690> up<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.110> URL<00:02:24.769> to

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
all you have to do is set up the URL to

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.570 
all you have to do is set up the URL to
your<00:02:25.640> printer<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.780> also<00:02:27.019> supports<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.769> IPP

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
your printer it also supports the IPP

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.220 
your printer it also supports the IPP
protocol<00:02:29.150> which<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.420> also<00:02:29.659> going<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.989> give<00:02:30.140> you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
protocol which is also going to give you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.809 
protocol which is also going to give you
that<00:02:30.379> printing<00:02:31.099> over<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.400> internet<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
that printing over the internet and

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.149 
that printing over the internet and
anywhere<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.569> your<00:02:33.019> network<00:02:33.349> functionality

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
anywhere on your network functionality

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.339 
anywhere on your network functionality
so<00:02:34.370> this<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.879> going<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.180> work<00:02:35.450> perfectly<00:02:36.049> for

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
so this is going to work perfectly for

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.470 
so this is going to work perfectly for
you<00:02:36.590> if<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.430> multiple<00:02:38.060> computers

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you if you have multiple computers

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.649 
you if you have multiple computers
sharing<00:02:39.049> one<00:02:39.409> printer<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.700> solves<00:02:41.510> that

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
sharing one printer this solves that

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.809 
sharing one printer this solves that
issue<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.290> solves<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.610> rather

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
issue and it solves it in a rather

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.479 
issue and it solves it in a rather
inexpensive<00:02:44.349> manner<00:02:45.349> as<00:02:45.620> well<00:02:46.129> and<00:02:46.370> it's

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
inexpensive manner as well and it's

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.410 
inexpensive manner as well and it's
pretty<00:02:46.640> much<00:02:46.730> plug-and-play

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
pretty much plug-and-play
