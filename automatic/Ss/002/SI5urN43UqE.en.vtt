00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
for it they don't watch the whole thing

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
for it they don't watch the whole thing

and in this pack we got ourselves
Aquilani<00:01:58.710> i<00:01:59.009> believe<00:01:59.909> he<00:02:00.030> used<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> play<00:02:00.390> for

Aquilani i believe he used to play for
liverpool<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.149> average<00:02:03.149> lee<00:02:03.360> good<00:02:03.509> pack<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420 
liverpool and so average lee good pack I
thought<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.380> silver<00:02:04.770> guy<00:02:04.890> would<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.250> for

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
thought that silver guy would go for

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.199 
thought that silver guy would go for
more<00:02:05.549> than<00:02:05.700> he<00:02:05.880> did<00:02:06.090> 83<00:02:06.840> pace<00:02:07.079> striker<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:08.209> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
more than he did 83 pace striker a the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.880 
more than he did 83 pace striker a the
quorum<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:09.810> country<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.440> something

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
quorum of what country that is something

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.370 
quorum of what country that is something
like<00:02:11.060> Denmark<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.540> not<00:02:12.660> Denmark

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
like Denmark or so it's not Denmark

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.950 
like Denmark or so it's not Denmark
somewhere<00:02:13.710> up<00:02:13.740> there<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.610> yeah<00:02:15.510> he<00:02:15.750> didn't

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
somewhere up there but yeah he didn't

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.360 
somewhere up there but yeah he didn't
actually<00:02:16.110> go<00:02:16.380> for<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.620> much<00:02:16.770> as<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.980> thought<00:02:17.220> he

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
actually go for as much as I thought he

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.400 
actually go for as much as I thought he
would<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.820> only<00:02:18.150> good<00:02:18.360> stats<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.900> he<00:02:19.050> has<00:02:19.230> is

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
would the only good stats that he has is

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.650 
would the only good stats that he has is
his<00:02:19.500> dribbling<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.190> his<00:02:20.430> pace<00:02:20.760> which<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.240> kind

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
his dribbling and his pace which is kind

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.230 
his dribbling and his pace which is kind
of<00:02:21.780> bad<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.860> need<00:02:23.040> better<00:02:23.460> stats<00:02:23.790> than<00:02:23.940> that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
of bad you need better stats than that

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.570 
of bad you need better stats than that
really<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.750> be<00:02:24.900> worth<00:02:25.170> anything<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.160> we<00:02:26.280> send

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
really to be worth anything but we send

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.420 
really to be worth anything but we send
Aquilani<00:02:27.180> into<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.840> active<00:02:28.230> squad<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.830> I

fit into my consumables pile on him to
make<00:02:53.790> him<00:02:54.120> look<00:02:54.240> more<00:02:54.480> appealing<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:55.200> people

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
make him look more appealing when people

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.000

should have maybe remove one of the
healing<00:03:51.209> cards<00:03:51.570> purely<00:03:51.930> because<00:03:52.370> this<00:03:53.370> year

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
healing cards purely because this year

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
healing cards do not go for anything you

healing cards do not go for anything you
don't<00:03:56.190> even<00:03:56.310> get<00:03:56.550> injured<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.260> stockpiled<00:03:58.260> my

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
don't even get injured I stockpiled my

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.980 
don't even get injured I stockpiled my
healing<00:03:58.890> cards<00:03:59.310> at<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.610> start<00:03:59.910> thinking<00:04:00.810> that

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
healing cards at the start thinking that

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.810 
healing cards at the start thinking that
they<00:04:01.230> would<00:04:01.350> come<00:04:01.680> into<00:04:01.890> use<00:04:02.280> thinking<00:04:02.730> I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
they would come into use thinking I

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.130 
they would come into use thinking I
would<00:04:02.940> get<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> lot<00:04:03.270> of<00:04:03.330> injuries<00:04:03.690> from<00:04:03.900> playing

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
would get a lot of injuries from playing

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.290 
would get a lot of injuries from playing
a<00:04:04.260> lot<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.440> games<00:04:04.650> online<00:04:04.890> but<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.730> didn't<00:04:06.180> and

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
a lot of games online but I didn't and

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.510 
a lot of games online but I didn't and
that's<00:04:06.990> quite<00:04:07.350> annoying<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:07.950> used<00:04:08.310> up<00:04:08.459> my

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
that's quite annoying that I used up my

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.190 
that's quite annoying that I used up my
trade<00:04:08.820> pass<00:04:09.030> space<00:04:09.330> when<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.630> could<00:04:09.900> have<00:04:09.990> used

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
trade pass space when I could have used

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.140 
trade pass space when I could have used
it<00:04:10.410> for<00:04:10.590> something<00:04:10.800> else<00:04:11.100> for<00:04:11.430> example<00:04:11.850> squad

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
it for something else for example squad

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.420 
it for something else for example squad
Morales<00:04:12.540> which<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.840> do<00:04:12.900> need<00:04:13.320> but<00:04:14.010> was<00:04:14.130> sent<00:04:14.280> to

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
Morales which I do need but was sent to

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.830 
Morales which I do need but was sent to
stamford<00:04:14.790> bridge<00:04:14.820> over<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.450> tree<00:04:15.660> part

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
stamford bridge over to the tree part

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.140 
stamford bridge over to the tree part
and<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.109> 4222<00:04:16.890> formation<00:04:17.609> i<00:04:17.760> think<00:04:18.030> i

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
and that 4222 formation i think i

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.870 
and that 4222 formation i think i
discarded<00:04:18.810> which<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.590> really<00:04:19.980> really<00:04:20.310> foolish

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
discarded which is really really foolish

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.780 
discarded which is really really foolish
em<00:04:21.239> it's<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.290> good<00:04:22.530> formation<00:04:22.950> card<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.669> i

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
em it's a good formation card and i

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.580 
em it's a good formation card and i
don't<00:04:24.060> know<00:04:24.210> why<00:04:24.390> i<00:04:24.419> discarded<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.020> but

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
don't know why i discarded that but

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.050 
don't know why i discarded that but
we're<00:04:25.710> going<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:26.010> what<00:04:26.190> i<00:04:26.220> think<00:04:26.550> is<00:04:26.729> the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
we're going to what i think is the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.060 
we're going to what i think is the
last<00:04:27.210> episode<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.260> last<00:04:28.470> part<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.950> this

this pack we pull ourselves boney now

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.909 
this pack we pull ourselves boney now
that<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:35.970> possibly<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.960> weirdest<00:04:37.470> name<00:04:37.710> in

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
that is possibly the weirdest name in

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.520

the<00:04:38.070> game<00:04:38.280> boney<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:39.870> he's<00:04:40.139> not<00:04:40.320> worth

the game boney but he's not worth
