00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.190 

but<00:03:32.349> yeah<00:03:32.590> my<00:03:33.220> eyebrows<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.750> reason<00:03:35.049> why<00:03:35.170> I

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
but yeah my eyebrows the reason why I

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.740 
but yeah my eyebrows the reason why I
didn't<00:03:35.560> take<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:35.950> long<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.280> do<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:37.329> fill<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.630> my

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
didn't take so long to do the fill in my

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.220 
didn't take so long to do the fill in my
eyebrows<00:03:38.079> because<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:39.269> three<00:03:40.269> my<00:03:40.419> eyebrows<00:03:40.840> and

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
eyebrows because I three my eyebrows and

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.890 
eyebrows because I three my eyebrows and
they're<00:03:42.160> usually<00:03:42.669> while<00:03:43.540> they're<00:03:43.750> always

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
they're usually while they're always

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.720 
they're usually while they're always
clean<00:03:44.410> when<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.709> comes<00:03:44.980> through<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.489> have

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
clean when it comes through and I have

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.400 
clean when it comes through and I have
no<00:03:45.959> extra<00:03:46.959> here<00:03:47.290> anywhere<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:50.049> yeah<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.349> is

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
no extra here anywhere so yeah this is

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.520 
no extra here anywhere so yeah this is
why<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.930> like<00:03:53.109> this

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
why I this is like this

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.740 
why I this is like this
I<00:03:53.560> thought<00:03:53.950> tutorial<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.669> a<00:03:55.030> lot<00:03:55.720> shorter

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
I thought tutorial is a lot shorter

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.319 
I thought tutorial is a lot shorter
because<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.590> don't<00:03:56.739> really<00:03:56.889> have<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.910> following

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
because I don't really have to following

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.589 
because I don't really have to following
that<00:03:58.569> much<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.650> really<00:03:59.680> feel<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.370> need<00:04:00.549> to

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
that much and I really feel the need to

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.789 
that much and I really feel the need to
but<00:04:01.599> between<00:04:02.500> my<00:04:02.620> eyebrows<00:04:03.660> here<00:04:04.660> II<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:05.620> I

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
but between my eyebrows here II and I

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.319 
but between my eyebrows here II and I
don't<00:04:05.859> go<00:04:06.459> through<00:04:06.609> them<00:04:06.790> for<00:04:06.910> a<00:04:06.970> really<00:04:07.180> long

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
don't go through them for a really long

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.759 
don't go through them for a really long
time<00:04:07.560> that's<00:04:08.560> when<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.340> use<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.510> lot<00:04:10.900> that's<00:04:11.560> when

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
time that's when I use a lot that's when

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.000 
time that's when I use a lot that's when
my<00:04:11.859> eyebrow<00:04:12.220> routine<00:04:12.810> changes<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.019> the
