for rappel everyone is we're willing to

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.579 
for rappel everyone is we're willing to
make<00:00:42.429> sure<00:00:42.579> that<00:00:42.699> we<00:00:42.819> actually<00:00:43.260> stack<00:00:44.260> the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
make sure that we actually stack the

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.259 
make sure that we actually stack the
rope<00:00:44.739> from<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.129> middle<00:00:45.519> so<00:00:45.819> you<00:00:45.879> may<00:00:46.120> have<00:00:46.239> a

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
rope from the middle so you may have a

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:47.939 
rope from the middle so you may have a
duo<00:00:46.510> des<00:00:46.809> rope<00:00:47.079> or<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.289> rope<00:00:47.530> with<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.769> good

marking<00:00:48.460> it's<00:00:48.760> really<00:00:48.969> important<00:00:49.420> we<00:00:49.569> have

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
marking it's really important we have

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.419 
marking it's really important we have
the<00:00:49.870> rope<00:00:50.019> right<00:00:50.260> in<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.469> middle<00:00:50.679> we<00:00:51.249> don't

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
the rope right in the middle we don't

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:52.950 
the rope right in the middle we don't
want<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.670> rappel<00:00:51.940> down<00:00:52.149> and<00:00:52.359> have<00:00:52.449> ten<00:00:52.659> meters

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
want to rappel down and have ten meters

want to rappel down and have ten meters
in<00:00:52.989> one<00:00:53.260> side<00:00:53.499> and<00:00:53.530> fifty<00:00:54.010> on<00:00:54.159> the<00:00:54.280> other

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.309 
in one side and fifty on the other
obviously<00:00:55.359> that's<00:00:55.510> going<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.719> create<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:56.019> slew

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
obviously that's going to create a slew

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.739 
obviously that's going to create a slew
of<00:00:56.350> problems<00:00:56.639> the<00:00:57.639> other<00:00:57.760> thing<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:58.030> we<00:00:58.539> want

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
to have knots at the end of our rope you

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.039 
to have knots at the end of our rope you
know<00:01:00.489> going<00:01:00.969> down<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.600> don't<00:01:01.719> want<00:01:01.839> to<00:01:01.929> be<00:01:01.989> able

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
know going down we don't want to be able

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.479

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
to rappel off the end of the rope

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.520 
to rappel off the end of the rope
especially<00:01:04.269> you<00:01:04.330> can<00:01:04.420> imagine<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.960> multi-pitch

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
especially you can imagine a multi-pitch

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.870 
especially you can imagine a multi-pitch
situation<00:01:06.190> when<00:01:06.280> you're<00:01:06.400> going<00:01:06.520> down<00:01:06.729> you

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
situation when you're going down you

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.790 
situation when you're going down you
have<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.030> stop<00:01:07.360> at<00:01:07.540> an<00:01:07.630> anchor<00:01:07.990> always<00:01:08.710> be

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
have to stop at an anchor always be

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.350 
have to stop at an anchor always be
thinking<00:01:09.010> about<00:01:09.160> that<00:01:09.400> worst<00:01:09.670> case<00:01:09.790> scenario

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
thinking about that worst case scenario

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.570 
thinking about that worst case scenario
a<00:01:10.420> rock<00:01:10.720> clocking<00:01:11.260> you<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.560> head<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.370> you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
a rock clocking you in the head and you

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.490 
a rock clocking you in the head and you
let<00:01:12.790> go<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.270> rope<00:01:13.480> and<00:01:13.780> we're<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.440> to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
let go of the rope and we're going to

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.750 
let go of the rope and we're going to
try<00:01:14.650> to<00:01:14.710> make<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.040> there's<00:01:15.190> no<00:01:15.370> way<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.670> we

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
try to make it there's no way that we

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.400 
try to make it there's no way that we
can<00:01:15.850> go<00:01:16.000> sailing<00:01:16.270> off<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.840> end<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.230> rope

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
can go sailing off the end of the rope

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.530 
can go sailing off the end of the rope
so<00:01:18.130> those<00:01:18.280> two<00:01:18.490> things<00:01:18.760> is<00:01:19.090> how<00:01:19.330> we're<00:01:19.450> going

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
so those two things is how we're going

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.300 
so those two things is how we're going
to<00:01:19.600> kind<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.810> get<00:01:19.930> our<00:01:20.050> rope<00:01:20.230> set<00:01:20.500> up<00:01:20.650> stack

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
to kind of get our rope set up stack

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.280 
to kind of get our rope set up stack
from<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.640> midpoint<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.300> I'm<00:01:22.780> not<00:01:22.960> an<00:01:23.110> either

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
from the midpoint and I'm not an either

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.020 
from the midpoint and I'm not an either
end<00:01:23.470> of<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.680> strand<00:01:24.010> so<00:01:24.700> now<00:01:24.790> we<00:01:24.850> actually

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
end of the strand so now we actually

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.540 
end of the strand so now we actually
need<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.360> get<00:01:25.480> set<00:01:25.720> up<00:01:25.750> for<00:01:25.870> rappelling<00:01:26.560> so

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
need to get set up for rappelling so

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.610 
need to get set up for rappelling so
there's<00:01:28.030> tons<00:01:28.300> of<00:01:28.540> different<00:01:28.630> rappel<00:01:29.140> devices

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
there's tons of different rappel devices

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.350 
there's tons of different rappel devices
on<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.980> market<00:01:30.010> we're<00:01:31.000> not<00:01:31.150> really

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
on the market we're not really

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.150 
on the market we're not really
advocating<00:01:31.960> one<00:01:32.110> over<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.470> other<00:01:32.500> but<00:01:32.890> we<00:01:32.980> did

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
advocating one over the other but we did

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.770 
advocating one over the other but we did
say<00:01:33.370> those<00:01:33.580> make<00:01:33.880> sure<00:01:33.910> whichever<00:01:34.360> one<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.660> do

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
say those make sure whichever one you do

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.020 
say those make sure whichever one you do
purchase<00:01:35.260> you're<00:01:35.920> good<00:01:36.220> at<00:01:36.370> using<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
purchase you're good at using it and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.790 
purchase you're good at using it and
you're<00:01:37.120> safe<00:01:37.390> at<00:01:37.600> using<00:01:37.900> it<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.110> you're<00:01:38.290> aware

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
you're safe at using it and you're aware

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.770 
you're safe at using it and you're aware
most<00:01:39.550> of<00:01:39.700> them<00:01:39.790> have<00:01:39.880> instruction<00:01:40.360> manuals

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
most of them have instruction manuals

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.480 
most of them have instruction manuals
make<00:01:40.990> sure<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.290> use<00:01:41.590> them<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:41.950> read<00:01:42.160> them<00:01:42.340> get

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
make sure you use them and read them get

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.490 
make sure you use them and read them get
a<00:01:42.520> good<00:01:42.580> idea<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.630> then<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.110> use<00:01:44.320> is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
a good idea and then we we use is

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.540 
a good idea and then we we use is
actually<00:01:44.770> we<00:01:44.860> use<00:01:44.980> a<00:01:45.010> triple<00:01:45.400> action

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
actually we use a triple action

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.220 
actually we use a triple action
carabiner<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.480> locks<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.900> it's<00:01:47.050> quite

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
carabiner so it locks and it's quite

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.840 
carabiner so it locks and it's quite
difficult<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.830> unlock<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.400> sort<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.670> while

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
difficult to unlock it sort of while

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.640 
difficult to unlock it sort of while
you're<00:01:49.000> rappelling<00:01:49.450> it's<00:01:50.140> going<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.380> take<00:01:50.470> my

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
you're rappelling it's going to take my

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.440 
you're rappelling it's going to take my
beater<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.670> I'm<00:01:51.790> going<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:51.940> clip<00:01:52.120> it<00:01:52.270> through

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
beater and I'm going to clip it through

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.600 
beater and I'm going to clip it through
the<00:01:52.540> belay<00:01:52.780> loop<00:01:52.810> on<00:01:53.200> my<00:01:53.380> harness<00:01:53.650> I'm<00:01:54.460> going

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
the belay loop on my harness I'm going

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.550 
the belay loop on my harness I'm going
to<00:01:54.670> take<00:01:54.820> my<00:01:54.970> belay<00:01:55.300> device<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:56.320> I'm<00:01:56.380> going<00:01:56.530> to

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
to take my belay device and I'm going to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320 
to take my belay device and I'm going to
set<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.860> up<00:01:56.950> as<00:01:57.160> I'm<00:01:57.430> supposed<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.820> given<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
set it up as I'm supposed to given the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.530 
set it up as I'm supposed to given the
manufacturers<00:01:58.960> recommendations<00:01:59.770> so<00:02:00.510> take<00:02:01.510> a

take<00:02:50.980> my<00:02:51.129> project<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.510> I'm<00:02:52.659> going<00:02:52.689> to<00:02:52.840> clip<00:02:53.079> it

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
take my project and I'm going to clip it

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.740 
take my project and I'm going to clip it
into<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.590> döner<00:02:54.010> there<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.579> couple<00:02:55.389> important

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
into that döner there a couple important

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.940 
into that döner there a couple important
things<00:02:55.930> regarding<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.439> we<00:02:56.590> want<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.829> make

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
things regarding this we want to make

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.759 
things regarding this we want to make
sure<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.129> prusik<00:02:57.400> can't<00:02:57.939> reach<00:02:58.349> our<00:02:59.349> belay

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
sure a prusik can't reach our belay

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.530 
sure a prusik can't reach our belay
device<00:03:00.129> if<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.819> happens<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.329> know<00:03:01.419> it's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
device if that happens you know it's

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.879 
device if that happens you know it's
going<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.719> mind<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.139> open<00:03:02.439> and<00:03:02.560> it's<00:03:02.709> going<00:03:02.799> to

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
going to mind it open and it's going to

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.709 
going to mind it open and it's going to
kind<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.129> be<00:03:03.250> just<00:03:03.519> a<00:03:03.639> useless<00:03:03.909> piece<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.419> gear

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:04.719 
kind of be just a useless piece of gear

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.569 
kind of be just a useless piece of gear
so<00:03:04.900> we<00:03:05.319> need<00:03:05.439> to<00:03:05.500> make<00:03:05.680> sure<00:03:05.829> it<00:03:05.950> can't<00:03:06.250> reach

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
so we need to make sure it can't reach

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.140 
so we need to make sure it can't reach
that<00:03:06.849> blade<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.329> ice<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> I've<00:03:09.519> got<00:03:09.700> my<00:03:09.849> press

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
that blade of ice so I've got my press

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.789 
that blade of ice so I've got my press
it<00:03:10.329> going<00:03:10.480> on<00:03:10.599> I<00:03:10.629> got<00:03:10.870> my<00:03:10.989> blade<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.379> ice<00:03:11.530> on

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
it going on I got my blade of ice on

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.339 
it going on I got my blade of ice on
another<00:03:12.609> failsafe<00:03:12.939> we<00:03:13.599> put<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> guy<00:03:14.109> at<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
another failsafe we put a guy at the

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.559 
another failsafe we put a guy at the
bottom<00:03:14.650> he's<00:03:15.280> actually<00:03:15.459> holding<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
bottom he's actually holding on to the

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.990 
bottom he's actually holding on to the
rope<00:03:16.750> what<00:03:16.959> we<00:03:17.049> call<00:03:17.200> fireman's<00:03:17.829> bleh<00:03:18.159> and<00:03:18.579> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
rope what we call fireman's bleh and the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.399 
rope what we call fireman's bleh and the
event<00:03:19.209> something<00:03:19.419> goes<00:03:19.510> wrong<00:03:19.780> he<00:03:19.989> can<00:03:20.169> pull

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
event something goes wrong he can pull

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.170 
event something goes wrong he can pull
down<00:03:20.650> on<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.979> Rope<00:03:21.159> just<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.669> me<00:03:21.819> pulling

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
down on the Rope just like me pulling

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.360 
down on the Rope just like me pulling
down<00:03:22.329> on<00:03:22.359> my<00:03:22.540> blade<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.959> ice<00:03:23.139> and<00:03:23.440> arrest<00:03:24.129> the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
down on my blade of ice and arrest the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.250 
down on my blade of ice and arrest the
fall<00:03:24.609> so<00:03:25.389> those<00:03:25.510> are<00:03:25.629> really<00:03:25.900> good<00:03:26.049> things

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
fall so those are really good things

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.319 
fall so those are really good things
this<00:03:27.099> prusik<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.669> also<00:03:27.879> going<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.060> give<00:03:28.239> us

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
this prusik is also going to give us

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.759 
this prusik is also going to give us
that<00:03:28.449> other<00:03:28.629> layer<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:28.930> safety<00:03:29.260> injures<00:03:29.620> if<00:03:29.709> I

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
that other layer of safety injures if I

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.530 
that other layer of safety injures if I
get<00:03:29.919> clocked<00:03:30.220> by<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.400> rock<00:03:30.669> and<00:03:30.879> my<00:03:31.000> hand<00:03:31.269> comes
