hours<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.980> advance<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.580> dyeing<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:17.940> lashes

hours in advance of dyeing your lashes

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.570

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
and the reason for this is that it can

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.220 
and the reason for this is that it can
cause<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:21.060> allergic<00:00:21.270> reaction<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:21.990> just

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
cause an allergic reaction so you just

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.480 
cause an allergic reaction so you just
need<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> make<00:00:22.680> sure<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.980> you've<00:00:23.250> done<00:00:23.279> that

before<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.539> ahead<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.710> what's<00:00:25.949> your

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
before you go ahead so what's your

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
before you go ahead so what's your
reason<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.460> dyeing<00:00:26.820> your<00:00:27.000> lashes<00:00:27.390> well

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
dyeing them it's just the same as a hair

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.490 
dyeing them it's just the same as a hair
dice<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:29.970> you've<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.240> quite<00:00:30.449> fine<00:00:30.840> lashes<00:00:31.109> not

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
dice if you've got quite fine lashes not

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200

only will it color them but it'll plump

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.990 
only will it color them but it'll plump
them<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.809> well<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.890> people<00:00:35.610> sometimes

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
them out as well so of people sometimes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.130 
them out as well so of people sometimes
say<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:36.540> they've<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.719> fine

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
lashes and that a mascara is too heavy

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.690 
lashes and that a mascara is too heavy
for<00:00:39.600> them<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.410> would<00:00:40.559> replace<00:00:40.980> mascara

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
for them so this would replace mascara

would dye my lashes so I'll get that
plumping<00:00:46.260> effect<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> mascara

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
plumping effect and then use a mascara

without my mascara have you and I do
look<00:00:52.949> particularly<00:00:53.460> odd<00:00:53.960> another<00:00:54.960> reason<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
look particularly odd another reason to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.080 
look particularly odd another reason to
color<00:00:55.860> them<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> look<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
color them is if you have a look in the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.619 
color them is if you have a look in the
mirror<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.809> lashes<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.559> much<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.370> are

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
mirror your lashes so much of them are

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.510 
mirror your lashes so much of them are
empty<00:01:00.629> dark<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> very<00:01:01.590> tips<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.460> very

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
empty dark but the very tips are very

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
empty dark but the very tips are very
very<00:01:03.000> light<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.719> obviously<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> color<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
very light and obviously the color is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920 
very light and obviously the color is
going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> color<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> whole<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> lash

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
going to color the whole of the lash

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.090 
going to color the whole of the lash
so<00:01:07.140> they're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> seem<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.830> bit

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
so they're going to seem a little bit

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
so they're going to seem a little bit
longer<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> full<00:01:09.570> length

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
longer because you get the full length

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
longer because you get the full length
of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> lash<00:01:10.920> crystal<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.369> those<00:01:11.549> tips<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
of the lash crystal at those tips and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
of the lash crystal at those tips and
died<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.810> well<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.530> we're<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> get<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
died as well so we're going to get on

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
died as well so we're going to get on
with<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:14.490> that's<00:01:14.670> me<00:01:14.880> stop<00:01:15.150> talking<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.600 
with it now that's me stop talking so
the<00:01:16.290> products<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.310> color

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the products I'm going to use is color

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.420 
the products I'm going to use is color
spot<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> third<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.229> dye<00:01:19.439> 30-day

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
spot and this is the third to dye 30-day

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.450 
spot and this is the third to dye 30-day
mascara<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.770> long-lasting<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.400> I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
mascara and this is long-lasting and I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
mascara and this is long-lasting and I
pretty<00:01:23.850> much<00:01:24.000> think<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.600> lasts<00:01:25.080> until

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
pretty much think that it lasts until

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.289 
pretty much think that it lasts until
your<00:01:25.680> lashes<00:01:26.100> drop<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:26.939> cause<00:01:27.150> obviously

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
your lashes drop out cause obviously

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.350 
your lashes drop out cause obviously
your<00:01:27.600> lashes<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> keep<00:01:28.979> growing<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
your lashes and keep growing and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.819 
your lashes and keep growing and
dropping<00:01:31.020> out<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.470> think<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.799> just

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
dropping out so I think that just

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.730

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
this kind of wand that you mix with and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.740 
this kind of wand that you mix with and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
mix around it kind of seems like it

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.530 
mix around it kind of seems like it
doesn't<00:02:20.210> want<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.740> mix<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.980> first<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:23.390> is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
doesn't want to mix it first so this is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.950 
doesn't want to mix it first so this is
going<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.780> take<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.470> minute<00:02:25.010> or<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.960> and

ten drops of the developer liquid in

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.080 
ten drops of the developer liquid in
there<00:02:38.980> really<00:02:39.980> mix<00:02:40.190> through<00:02:41.950> okay<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.670> that'll

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
there really mix through okay so that'll

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.490 
there really mix through okay so that'll
do<00:02:44.210> I'm<00:02:44.450> going<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.690> leave<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:44.870> just<00:02:45.260> for<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
do I'm going to leave that just for a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.710 
do I'm going to leave that just for a
minute<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.760> next<00:02:46.790> step<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.390> need<00:02:47.570> to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
minute and the next step that I need to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.030 
minute and the next step that I need to
do<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.990> preparation<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:49.720> get<00:02:50.720> some<00:02:51.040> Vaseline

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
do in preparation is get some Vaseline

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.070 
do in preparation is get some Vaseline
petroleum<00:02:52.250> jelly<00:02:53.030> if<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.270> look<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:53.900> I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
petroleum jelly if you look like this I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.960 
petroleum jelly if you look like this I
really<00:02:54.470> think<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.860> heavy<00:02:55.070> moisturizer<00:02:55.610> will

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
really think a heavy moisturizer will

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.020 
really think a heavy moisturizer will
work<00:02:56.210> if<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.020> just<00:02:57.230> scoop<00:02:57.920> out<00:02:58.130> some<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.640> a

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
work if you just scoop out some on a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.450 
work if you just scoop out some on a
cotton<00:02:59.300> bud<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.780> then<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.260> want<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:01.250> rub

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
cotton bud and then you want to just rub

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.729 
cotton bud and then you want to just rub
it<00:03:01.490> onto<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.910> back<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.270> your<00:03:03.050> hand<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.500> to

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
it onto the back of your hand just to

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.290 
it onto the back of your hand just to
rub<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.010> all<00:03:04.190> over<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.610> bud<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.209> they

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
rub it all over the bud and so they

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.780 
rub it all over the bud and so they
haven't<00:03:05.480> got<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.660> big<00:03:05.840> lump<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.500> cream<00:03:07.459> on<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
haven't got a big lump of cream on the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.150 
haven't got a big lump of cream on the
bud<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.410> then<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:09.620> have<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> look<00:03:09.920> in<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
bud and then just have a look in the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.400 
bud and then just have a look in the
mirror<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.730> want<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:10.940> apply<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.410> under

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
mirror and you want to apply it under

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.910 
mirror and you want to apply it under
your<00:03:12.530> eyes<00:03:13.840> without<00:03:14.840> touching<00:03:15.290> your<00:03:15.560> lashes

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
your eyes without touching your lashes

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.670 
your eyes without touching your lashes
which<00:03:16.070> is<00:03:16.220> easier<00:03:16.580> said<00:03:16.790> than<00:03:16.940> done<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.340> also

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
which is easier said than done and also

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.430 
which is easier said than done and also
above<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.920> top<00:03:22.130> lash<00:03:22.400> line<00:03:22.430> as<00:03:22.850> well<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
above the top lash line as well and the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.430 
above the top lash line as well and the
reason<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:24.770> this<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.430> don't<00:03:25.700> want

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
reason for this is that you don't want

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.020 
reason for this is that you don't want
it's<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.590> dye<00:03:27.770> it's<00:03:28.070> going<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.340> color<00:03:28.550> your<00:03:28.730> skin

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
it's a dye it's going to color your skin

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.550 
it's a dye it's going to color your skin
it's<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.420> color<00:03:29.600> wherever<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:30.110> touches

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
it's going to color wherever it touches

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.040 
it's going to color wherever it touches
and<00:03:31.010> obviously<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.400> don't<00:03:31.580> want<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:32.090> all<00:03:32.720> of

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
and obviously you don't want it all of

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.690 
and obviously you don't want it all of
it<00:03:33.170> around<00:03:33.530> your<00:03:33.770> eyes<00:03:33.890> as<00:03:34.160> well<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.550> this<00:03:34.640> is

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
it around your eyes as well so this is

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.800 
it around your eyes as well so this is
just<00:03:34.940> going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.150> act<00:03:35.330> as<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.510> barrier<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:36.890> stop

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
just going to act as a barrier to stop

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.110 
just going to act as a barrier to stop
the<00:03:38.810> dye<00:03:38.989> from<00:03:39.290> getting<00:03:39.620> onto<00:03:39.770> your<00:03:40.010> skin<00:03:40.310> now

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the dye from getting onto your skin now

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.210 
the dye from getting onto your skin now
like<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.540> say<00:03:41.810> if<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:42.019> touch<00:03:42.230> your<00:03:42.380> lashes<00:03:42.860> it's

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
like I say if you touch your lashes it's

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.830 
like I say if you touch your lashes it's
also<00:03:43.370> going<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.700> be<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.820> barrier<00:03:44.209> against<00:03:44.690> your

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
also going to be a barrier against your

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.479 
also going to be a barrier against your
lashes<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.739> don't<00:03:45.920> want<00:03:46.070> that<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.340> happen

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
lashes and you don't want that to happen

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.790 
lashes and you don't want that to happen
so<00:03:46.700> keep<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.360> clear<00:03:47.780> from<00:03:48.380> your<00:03:48.470> lashes

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
so keep it clear from your lashes

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.229 
so keep it clear from your lashes
otherwise<00:03:49.100> it's<00:03:49.310> going<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.550> stop<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.910> product

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
otherwise it's going to stop the product

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.290 
otherwise it's going to stop the product
from<00:03:50.450> being<00:03:51.110> absorbed<00:03:52.000> now<00:03:53.000> we're<00:03:53.150> going<00:03:53.239> to

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
from being absorbed now we're going to

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.000 
from being absorbed now we're going to
go<00:03:53.420> back<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.840> little<00:03:54.019> mixture<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.500> I've

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
go back to the little mixture that I've

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.830 
go back to the little mixture that I've
done<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:55.610> just<00:03:55.850> apply<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:56.300> with<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.570> wand

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
done and you just apply it with a wand

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.370 
done and you just apply it with a wand
as<00:03:57.019> if<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.290> were<00:03:57.410> applying<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.920> mascara<00:03:58.070> and

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
as if you were applying a mascara and

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.790 
as if you were applying a mascara and
just<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.500> just<00:04:00.709> need<00:04:00.950> a<00:04:01.190> thin<00:04:01.600> cut

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.730 

so<00:04:07.800> it<00:04:08.010> kind<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:09.230> formulations<00:04:10.230> kind<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.650> a

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
so it kind of the formulations kind of a

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.970 
so it kind of the formulations kind of a
little<00:04:11.070> bit<00:04:11.190> lumpy<00:04:11.660> so<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:12.960> be<00:04:13.110> careful<00:04:13.380> that

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
little bit lumpy so just be careful that

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.500 
little bit lumpy so just be careful that
you<00:04:14.040> don't<00:04:14.190> put<00:04:14.400> massive<00:04:14.700> big<00:04:14.970> lump<00:04:15.210> because

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
you don't put massive big lump because

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.630 
you don't put massive big lump because
it<00:04:15.570> will<00:04:15.660> just<00:04:15.810> kind<00:04:15.990> of<00:04:16.140> drip<00:04:17.130> right<00:04:17.400> off

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
it will just kind of drip right off

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.210 
it will just kind of drip right off
it'll<00:04:17.880> be<00:04:17.940> too<00:04:18.150> heavy<00:04:18.390> for<00:04:18.510> your<00:04:18.750> lashes<00:04:19.220> so

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
it'll be too heavy for your lashes so

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.440 
it'll be too heavy for your lashes so
you<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.459> see<00:04:20.640> how<00:04:20.820> that's<00:04:20.970> going<00:04:21.390> on<00:04:22.010> there

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
you can see how that's going on there

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.580 
you can see how that's going on there
I'm<00:04:24.450> going<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.660> put<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.050> bottom<00:04:25.380> lashes

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
I'm going to put it on the bottom lashes

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:42.260 
I'm going to put it on the bottom lashes
as<00:04:26.550> well

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.800 

now<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.840> have<00:04:43.139> got<00:04:43.319> a<00:04:43.380> little<00:04:43.590> bit<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.919> dye<00:04:44.810> above

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
now I have got a little bit of dye above

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.110 
now I have got a little bit of dye above
the<00:04:45.960> top<00:04:46.410> lash<00:04:46.919> line<00:04:46.949> there<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.819> I'm<00:04:47.970> going<00:04:48.090> to

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
the top lash line there and I'm going to

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.150 
the top lash line there and I'm going to
take<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.479> off<00:04:48.690> hopefully<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.770> wouldn't

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
take that off hopefully it wouldn't

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.999 
take that off hopefully it wouldn't
color<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.550> skin<00:04:50.759> anyway<00:04:51.300> because<00:04:51.900> I've<00:04:52.500> put

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
color the skin anyway because I've put

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.740 
color the skin anyway because I've put
that<00:04:53.190> bustling<00:04:53.729> on<00:04:53.910> there<00:04:54.150> as<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.449> barrier

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
that bustling on there as the barrier

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.059 
that bustling on there as the barrier
but<00:04:54.870> I'm<00:04:55.020> just<00:04:55.139> going<00:04:55.319> to<00:04:55.380> lift<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.650> off<00:04:55.860> with

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
but I'm just going to lift that off with

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.960 
but I'm just going to lift that off with
a<00:04:56.099> clean<00:04:56.460> cotton<00:04:57.240> bud<00:04:58.130> there<00:04:59.130> we<00:04:59.220> go<00:04:59.340> like<00:04:59.550> that

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
a clean cotton bud there we go like that

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.180 
a clean cotton bud there we go like that
okay<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:00.840> what<00:05:01.349> you<00:05:01.440> need<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.650> do<00:05:01.830> then<00:05:02.039> is

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
okay so what you need to do then is

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.960 
okay so what you need to do then is
leave<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.610> on<00:05:02.910> for<00:05:02.940> 10<00:05:03.449> minutes<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:04.500> develop

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
leave that on for 10 minutes to develop

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.700 
leave that on for 10 minutes to develop
obviously<00:05:05.970> this<00:05:06.479> video<00:05:06.780> be<00:05:06.930> really<00:05:07.349> long<00:05:07.470> if

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
obviously this video be really long if

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.230 
obviously this video be really long if
you<00:05:07.800> had<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:08.039> sit<00:05:08.190> there<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.580> look<00:05:08.729> at<00:05:08.880> me<00:05:08.910> for

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
you had to sit there and look at me for

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.700 
you had to sit there and look at me for
10<00:05:09.389> minutes<00:05:09.660> while<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.870> goes<00:05:09.990> through<00:05:10.259> so<00:05:10.620> I'm

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
10 minutes while it goes through so I'm

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.110 
10 minutes while it goes through so I'm
just<00:05:10.860> going<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.130> skip<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.669> and<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.900> remove

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
just going to skip that and to remove

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.830 
just going to skip that and to remove
you<00:05:15.120> can<00:05:15.150> use<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:16.759> warm<00:05:17.759> water<00:05:18.000> on<00:05:18.240> a<00:05:18.270> cotton<00:05:18.599> bud

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
you can use a warm water on a cotton bud

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.050 
you can use a warm water on a cotton bud
but<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.169> find<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.590> if<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:19.830> rub<00:05:20.130> it<00:05:20.280> like<00:05:20.490> too

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
but I find that if you rub it like too

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.260 
but I find that if you rub it like too
much<00:05:21.270> if<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.960> touches<00:05:22.199> any<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.970> clean

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
much if it touches any of the you clean

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.570 
much if it touches any of the you clean
skin<00:05:24.720> you<00:05:24.930> don't<00:05:25.080> want<00:05:25.319> to<00:05:25.470> color<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:25.889> so<00:05:26.550> I

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
skin you don't want to color that so I

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.700 
skin you don't want to color that so I
think<00:05:26.819> it's<00:05:27.120> easier<00:05:27.419> to<00:05:27.449> get<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.900> makeup<00:05:28.470> wipe

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
think it's easier to get a makeup wipe

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.300 
think it's easier to get a makeup wipe
and<00:05:29.580> hold<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.509> underneath<00:05:30.870> your<00:05:31.139> lashes<00:05:31.560> close

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
and hold it underneath your lashes close

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.210 
and hold it underneath your lashes close
your<00:05:32.520> eye<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:32.990> then<00:05:33.990> put<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.830> tissue<00:05:34.979> over

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
your eye and then put the tissue over

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.159 
your eye and then put the tissue over
the<00:05:35.280> top<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.849> pull<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:36.270> off<00:05:36.479> so<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:36.810> kind<00:05:37.110> of

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
the top and pull it off so you kind of

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.529 
the top and pull it off so you kind of
get<00:05:37.319> in<00:05:37.409> a<00:05:37.500> grubbing<00:05:38.039> motion<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.210> if<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:39.389> just

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
get in a grubbing motion and if you just

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:46.700 
get in a grubbing motion and if you just
do<00:05:39.720> that<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:40.280> couple<00:05:41.280> of<00:05:41.669> times<00:05:45.349> that<00:05:46.349> will<00:05:46.530> take

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
do that a couple of times that will take

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.240 
do that a couple of times that will take
it<00:05:46.860> off<00:05:48.199> obviously<00:05:49.199> you<00:05:49.349> can<00:05:49.530> see<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.860> result

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
it off obviously you can see the result

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.279 
it off obviously you can see the result
because<00:05:51.000> I've<00:05:51.210> not<00:05:51.360> left<00:05:51.570> it<00:05:51.719> further<00:05:51.960> ten

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
because I've not left it further ten
