00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.369 
I of course do not recommend doing
anything<00:02:10.390> except<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:10.869> straight<00:02:11.349> out

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
anything except just straight out

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.589 
anything except just straight out
vanilla<00:02:11.950> racing<00:02:12.580> do<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.940> as<00:02:13.120> much<00:02:13.360> as<00:02:13.390> you

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
vanilla racing do that as much as you

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.140 
vanilla racing do that as much as you
can<00:02:13.930> because<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.800> racer<00:02:15.310> will<00:02:15.550> just<00:02:15.790> flip

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
can because your racer will just flip

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.479 
can because your racer will just flip
out<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.690> game<00:02:16.930> will<00:02:17.140> become<00:02:17.489> impossible

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
out and the game will become impossible

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.550 
out and the game will become impossible
the<00:02:18.940> camera<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.599> still<00:02:19.750> shaking<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.410> don't

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the camera is still shaking you don't

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.540 
the camera is still shaking you don't
know<00:02:20.620> what's<00:02:20.800> happening<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.340> don't<00:02:21.370> know

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
where the other racers are you

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.900

won't be able to follow because the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.870 
won't be able to follow because the

fly off the tracks

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.259 
fly off the tracks
there<00:02:44.860> was<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.160> one<00:02:45.400> place<00:02:45.670> where<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:45.970> flew

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
there was this one place where I flew

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.420 
there was this one place where I flew
off<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.450> track<00:02:46.959> while<00:02:47.319> going<00:02:47.620> up<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:47.980> ramp<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
off the track while going up a ramp and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.600 
off the track while going up a ramp and
the<00:02:48.849> game<00:02:49.209> placed<00:02:49.750> me<00:02:50.049> right<00:02:50.410> back<00:02:50.709> on<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.250> tip

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
the game placed me right back on the tip

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.150 
the game placed me right back on the tip
of<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.030> ramp<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.870> game<00:02:53.110> gave<00:02:53.380> me<00:02:53.410> absolutely

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
of the ramp the game gave me absolutely

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.610 
of the ramp the game gave me absolutely
no<00:02:54.400> space<00:02:54.940> where<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.599> pick<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:56.019> some<00:02:56.230> speed

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
no space where I can pick up some speed

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.280 
no space where I can pick up some speed
and<00:02:56.860> actually<00:02:57.640> jump<00:02:58.090> onto<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.750> next<00:02:58.780> platform

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
and actually jump onto the next platform

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.729 
and actually jump onto the next platform
so<00:03:00.010> obviously<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.910> fell<00:03:01.510> right<00:03:01.930> back<00:03:01.989> off<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
so obviously I fell right back off the

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.069 
so obviously I fell right back off the
ramp<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.190> guess<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.970> placed<00:03:04.450> me<00:03:04.720> on<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
ramp and guess what it placed me on the

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.259 
ramp and guess what it placed me on the
tip<00:03:05.349> of<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.650> ramp<00:03:05.829> again<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.579> again<00:03:06.970> and

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
tip of the ramp again and again and

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.809 
tip of the ramp again and again and
again<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.870> literally<00:03:08.650> had<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.040> turn<00:03:09.549> my

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
again I literally had to turn my

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.220 
again I literally had to turn my
podracer<00:03:10.599> around

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
podracer around

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.920 
podracer around
drive<00:03:11.829> backwards<00:03:12.489> stop<00:03:12.910> turn<00:03:13.329> around<00:03:13.359> and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
drive backwards stop turn around and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.009 
drive backwards stop turn around and
drive<00:03:14.650> forward<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.639> I<00:03:15.700> could<00:03:15.910> have<00:03:16.060> some<00:03:16.299> speed

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
drive forward so I could have some speed

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.400 
drive forward so I could have some speed
