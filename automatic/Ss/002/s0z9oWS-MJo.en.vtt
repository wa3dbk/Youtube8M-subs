00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.730
 there are very good everyone, that 's more 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.000
 the project 115 channel and we get good 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.920
 I come back rather said with another video of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.259
 how to create the good jet weapon here 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.330
 You see happening that pretty the first 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.539
 seasonal to what is the coffee bar 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.130
 money as vice gas station too and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 good you have to catch the rapids to 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.260
 do not miss the bus like here my friend paul 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.260
 there is that the truth is a loser this 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.970
 and well after this 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.440
 you have to go to the cornfield you have to get down more 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.170
 or less at the height of the streetlight and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.650
 put us through this hole for this 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:50.090
 hole in the cornfield and now it's 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.790
 left here and then now to the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.710
 right and now all straight 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.520
 we follow the volley down the point of 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.000
 803 coupons and we get inside 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.800
 to be born a totem is worth two for one 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600
 this is where they are treated to the pieces 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.270
 ok here you see that it is the first site in 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.970
 the one that is usually there above and here 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.040
 where they are at the beginning and here are 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.550
 where is the last site is worth very 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.130
 easy and nothing simply to choose it as 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.350
 how to do by law now and then nothing 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.509
 we go with the next stone 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.360
 let's see now is the laboratory 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.710
 where the license of us is activated 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.990
 but if we are going to do it with the turbine 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.690
 so let's go down here we go down here 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.470
 ok no danger is usually there 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.050
 also going through here here about this 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.200
 also and lastly site that is in 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.330
 the one that is currently there is worth is a 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.110
 kind of cable that connects the engine 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.750
 with all the rest and so on so nothing 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.550
 we went to see how we built these two 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.620
 first pieces since as we were two 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.140
 we can not take the four pieces to the 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.000
 once we will see we assemble all these 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.880
 little princesses 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.350
 and let's move on to after you can 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.560
 dirty fuck 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.000
 catch that let's move on to the last 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.000
 piece is usually the most 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.680
 difficult is like going to the cabin of the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.720
 hut in which the subject is hidden 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:25.720
 is that we are here in the laboratory 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.920
 said that 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.810
 as much as possible 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.650
 I 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.610
 forever 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.890
 it is true six steps of this tree and 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.890
 you come 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:07.220
 and here in the cabin your site 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.340
 quite hidden where is the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.569
 bowie knife here this is a first 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.090
 site where it could be but there 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.560
 that is the second and finally there is 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.560
 is what will be with you 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.380
 we are going to assemble all this 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.620
 and let's see how it is 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.010
 we passed with the seven pieces already counting 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.010
 everything 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.349
 and well after mounting all this 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.659
 of jet correctly 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.870
 and finally we are going to show you what 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:51.480
 would happen if we use it too much 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.090
 problems of if it breaks mass bond and 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.599
 since you see that I do not have my hands but 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.040
 more say that if it breaks or good here 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.739
 you see me doing a little silly and 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.239
 let's try it for the person 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.349
 Do not know how it is 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.349
 I'll let you say it 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.139
 it looks pretty handsome there I leave a 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.479
 tornado flipante and good here you will see 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.360
 what happens when we load it you see 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.069
 still that it's as if I absorbed you 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.860
 Now I'm like I'm that foolish to 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:29.889
 charge and what happens good because they break 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.990
 here the pieces of the pieces as there 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.639
 that catch them is worth here you have one and two 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.979
 what about the other two that are the 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.469
 who are in the fog because they return to their 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.120
 same place is worth where we have gone to 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.069
 the cabin and have access a totem vale 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.439
 is in the same place where the 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.110
 we have taken it, no, it does not change to the place 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.810
 the various places I've seen are worth that 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.240
 that nothing because it was simply to tell you 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.210
 how it was formed I hope that I have 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.830
 liked to like and favorites and 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.449
 subscribe and but you are that the truth 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.759
 is that a little help would not hurt at all 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.759
 but so nothing until later 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.040
 how could you forget to count your 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.040
 ammo more mouse
