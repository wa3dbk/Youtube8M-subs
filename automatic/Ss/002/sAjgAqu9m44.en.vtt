00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
like this over the past couple years has

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.680 
like this over the past couple years has
been<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.640> new<00:03:24.850> story<00:03:25.150> every<00:03:25.210> couple<00:03:25.480> while

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
been a new story every couple while

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.910

other<00:03:25.900> patrols<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.470> obviously<00:03:26.710> a<00:03:26.770> big

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
other patrols and obviously a big

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.320 
other patrols and obviously a big

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
problem and that kind of thing I think

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.750
