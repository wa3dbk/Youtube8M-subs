00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
our splotches but we don't want it to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.109

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
hide them completely at this point you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.730 
hide them completely at this point you
may<00:02:06.240> be<00:02:06.270> questioning<00:02:06.840> my<00:02:06.930> method<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.530> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
