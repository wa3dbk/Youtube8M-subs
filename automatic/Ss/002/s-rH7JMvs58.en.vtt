00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hello today I'm Louie doing a review on

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.140 
hello today I'm Louie doing a review on
my<00:00:02.610> r45<00:00:03.480> light<00:00:03.870> tank<00:00:04.339> this<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.700> light<00:00:05.850> tank

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
my r45 light tank this is the light tank

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.700 
my r45 light tank this is the light tank
used<00:00:06.390> by<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.600> French<00:00:06.810> during<00:00:07.049> Second<00:00:07.680> World

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
used by the French during Second World

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.839 
used by the French during Second World
War<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.330> the<00:00:09.330> sensor<00:00:09.719> review<00:00:10.160> so<00:00:11.160> start<00:00:11.670> with

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
War and the sensor review so start with

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.580 
War and the sensor review so start with
it<00:00:12.240> has<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> 360<00:00:13.349> degree<00:00:13.590> rotating<00:00:14.009> turret

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
it has a 360 degree rotating turret

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.650 
it has a 360 degree rotating turret
currently<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.800> slightly<00:00:17.480> prohibited<00:00:18.480> by

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
currently it is slightly prohibited by

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.630 
currently it is slightly prohibited by
these<00:00:18.930> studs<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> slope<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.430> when<00:00:20.609> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
these studs on the slope but when I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.210 
these studs on the slope but when I
convert<00:00:21.150> them<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.890> studless<00:00:22.890> slope

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
convert them to the studless slope

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.320 
convert them to the studless slope
version<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.090> will<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:25.220> complete<00:00:26.330> turnaround

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
version it will be a complete turnaround

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.429 
version it will be a complete turnaround
with<00:00:27.660> no<00:00:27.990> obstruction<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:30.170> that's<00:00:31.170> pretty

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
with no obstruction and that's pretty

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.350 
with no obstruction and that's pretty
much<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.830> features<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:32.820> where<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.149> so

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
much it features because where is so

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.720 
much it features because where is so
small<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.719> doesn't<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.110> any<00:00:34.230> hatches<00:00:34.730> turret

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
small it doesn't have any hatches turret

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.150 
small it doesn't have any hatches turret
don't<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.149> any<00:00:36.450> cos<00:00:36.660> otherwise<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.860> had<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
don't have any cos otherwise I had to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.530 
don't have any cos otherwise I had to
break<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> sheep<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> yep<00:00:41.790> let's<00:00:42.300> go<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
break up the sheep so yep let's go to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.290 
break up the sheep so yep let's go to
the<00:00:42.719> track<00:00:42.930> area<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.879> relatively

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the track area now it's relatively

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
the track area now it's relatively
detailed<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.170> opinion<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.710> probably<00:00:46.980> could

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
detailed in my opinion it probably could

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090 
detailed in my opinion it probably could
give<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.579> around<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> wheels<00:00:49.100> while

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
give a bit more around the wheels while

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.439 
give a bit more around the wheels while
I<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.219> limited<00:00:50.579> for<00:00:50.610> parts<00:00:51.000> when<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.180> built

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
I was limited for parts when I built

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.580 
I was limited for parts when I built
this<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:53.030> anyone<00:00:54.030> pre<00:00:54.300> police<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.750> this

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
this so anyone pre police for this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
this so anyone pre police for this
January<00:00:56.579> looks<00:00:56.760> pretty<00:00:57.000> good

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
January looks pretty good

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
January looks pretty good
and<00:00:57.440> accurate<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.590> real<00:00:58.680> thing<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.789> do

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and accurate to the real thing they do

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.579 
and accurate to the real thing they do
spin<00:01:00.390> incredibly<00:01:01.140> well<00:01:01.730> probably<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.850> best

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
spin incredibly well probably my best

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.490 
spin incredibly well probably my best
model<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.799> far<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.250> aspect<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.350> on

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
model was so far in that aspect and on

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.580 
model was so far in that aspect and on
some<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> carpet<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:09.330> will<00:01:09.540> spin<00:01:10.470> on

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
some of that carpet they will spin on

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.160 
some of that carpet they will spin on
their<00:01:10.710> own<00:01:10.860> first<00:01:11.189> over<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.990> obviously<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
their own first over and obviously the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.260 
their own first over and obviously the
other<00:01:13.320> side<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.799> identical<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.170> side

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
other side is identical to the up side

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.960 
other side is identical to the up side
I'll<00:01:18.270> show<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> front<00:01:19.610> around<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> front

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I'll show you the front around the front

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
I'll show you the front around the front
it's<00:01:21.240> relatively<00:01:22.110> undetailed<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.159> does

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it's relatively undetailed but it does

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
it's relatively undetailed but it does
have<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> inverted<00:01:24.240> slope<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.170> there's<00:01:25.950> some

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
have the inverted slope so there's some

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.130 
have the inverted slope so there's some
detail<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.240> looks<00:01:27.630> accurate

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
detail there and it looks accurate

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.390 
detail there and it looks accurate
because<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.409> mean<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> roofing<00:01:29.009> doesn't<00:01:29.310> have

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
because I mean the roofing doesn't have

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.210 
because I mean the roofing doesn't have
a<00:01:29.430> lot<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> detail<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.220> pretty

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
a lot of detail so you know it's pretty

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.850 
a lot of detail so you know it's pretty
accurate<00:01:36.020> run<00:01:37.020> sides<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.770> I'm

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
accurate run sides you can see I'm

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.800 
accurate run sides you can see I'm
actually<00:01:38.009> using<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.759> brick<00:01:39.090> arms<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.570> clip

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
actually using the brick arms you clip

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.950 
actually using the brick arms you clip
to<00:01:39.960> connect<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.590> 1<00:01:40.920> by<00:01:41.070> 4<00:01:41.310> tile<00:01:41.720> its<00:01:42.720> first

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to connect this 1 by 4 tile its first

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.090 
to connect this 1 by 4 tile its first
time<00:01:43.110> I've<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.320> done<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> lot<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
time I've actually done that a lot of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
time I've actually done that a lot of
people<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.000> I've<00:01:45.840> generally<00:01:46.170> not

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
people do that but I've generally not

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
people do that but I've generally not
like<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.220> far<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
like to so far because it's kind of

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.859 
like to so far because it's kind of
kinda<00:01:49.259> cheating<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.060> fard<00:01:51.060> incorporate<00:01:51.659> into

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
kinda cheating the fard incorporate into

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.539 
kinda cheating the fard incorporate into
this<00:01:51.930> model<00:01:52.259> anyway<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> means<00:01:52.829> there's<00:01:53.369> no

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
this model anyway it means there's no

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.959 
this model anyway it means there's no
studs<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:55.100> all<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.340> doing<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.579> from<00:01:56.759> now

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
studs so all you be doing that from now

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.600 
studs so all you be doing that from now
on<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.750> because<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.430> quite<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.579> about

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
on but just because I quite like about

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.620

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
studs around the back here as the watch

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.889 
studs around the back here as the watch
units<00:02:04.079> exhaust<00:02:04.469> detail<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:06.689> little

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
units exhaust detail and the little

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.669 
units exhaust detail and the little
fenders<00:02:08.239> there's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.330> will<00:02:09.599> detail<00:02:10.110> is

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
fenders there's a will detail is

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.470 
fenders there's a will detail is
actually<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.280> wrong<00:02:11.550> type<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> wheel<00:02:12.239> it's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
actually the wrong type of wheel it's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.470 
actually the wrong type of wheel it's
from<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
from the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.900 
from the
because<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.200> previously<00:02:15.069> used<00:02:15.340> those<00:02:15.610> wheels

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
because I previously used those wheels

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.080 
because I previously used those wheels
out<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.360> these<00:02:16.510> wheels<00:02:16.840> instead<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.379> those<00:02:18.090> and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
out of these wheels instead of those and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.400 
out of these wheels instead of those and
I've<00:02:19.209> yet<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.480> replace<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:21.280> one<00:02:21.489> from<00:02:21.790> those

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
I've yet to replace this one from those

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.920 
I've yet to replace this one from those
anyway<00:02:23.410> some<00:02:23.620> detailer<00:02:24.390> rotary<00:02:25.390> box<00:02:25.660> here<00:02:25.840> on

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
anyway some detailer rotary box here on

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.470 
anyway some detailer rotary box here on
the<00:02:26.080> back<00:02:26.489> which<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.580> don't<00:02:27.700> really<00:02:27.849> like<00:02:28.120> but

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
the back which I don't really like but

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.120 
the back which I don't really like but
it's<00:02:28.720> accurate<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.680> that's<00:02:32.830> not<00:02:32.980> really

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
it's accurate so and that's not really

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.400 
it's accurate so and that's not really
much<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.370> show<00:02:33.849> here<00:02:34.300> some<00:02:34.540> look<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.230> back

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
much to show here some look on the back

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.250 
much to show here some look on the back
deck<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.819> can<00:02:36.880> see<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.269> ventilation<00:02:40.260> have

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
deck you can see is the ventilation have

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.280 
deck you can see is the ventilation have
a<00:02:41.290> quick<00:02:41.560> look<00:02:41.680> at<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.980> turret<00:02:43.019> Taurus<00:02:44.019> all

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
a quick look at the turret Taurus all

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.750 
a quick look at the turret Taurus all
right<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.709> my<00:02:44.739> opinion<00:02:44.830> probably<00:02:45.280> had<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.640> be

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
right in my opinion probably had to be

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.140 
right in my opinion probably had to be
done<00:02:45.940> better<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:47.459> I'm<00:02:48.459> relatively<00:02:48.940> pleased

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
done better but I'm relatively pleased

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.030 
done better but I'm relatively pleased
well<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.480> looks<00:02:49.680> pretty<00:02:50.680> accurate<00:02:53.010> anyway<00:02:54.010> I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
well it looks pretty accurate anyway I

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.830 
well it looks pretty accurate anyway I
read<00:02:54.400> Fink<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.760> much<00:02:55.000> more<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.390> show

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
