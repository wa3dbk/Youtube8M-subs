one<00:01:39.119> thing<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.509> would<00:01:39.630> strongly<00:01:40.500> recommend<00:01:40.920> is

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
one thing I would strongly recommend is

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.899 
one thing I would strongly recommend is
cleaning<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:43.080> fretboard<00:01:43.380> every<00:01:44.040> now<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
cleaning the fretboard every now and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.880 
cleaning the fretboard every now and
then<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:47.100> certain<00:01:48.590> fretboard<00:01:49.590> choose

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
then with a a certain fretboard choose

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.440 
then with a a certain fretboard choose
or<00:01:50.159> fretboard<00:01:50.880> conditioner<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:53.460> haven't

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
or fretboard conditioner and I haven't

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.200 
or fretboard conditioner and I haven't
actually<00:01:54.690> cleaned<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.950> few<00:01:56.789> years<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
actually cleaned this in a few years so

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.679 
actually cleaned this in a few years so
I<00:01:57.450> bet<00:01:58.140> there<00:01:58.350> will<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:59.330> lot<00:02:00.330> better<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.840> play

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
I bet there will be a lot better to play

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.859

here is to just take a single string
like<00:04:21.640> this<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:23.530> band<00:04:23.920> it<00:04:24.190> with<00:04:25.060> your

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
like this and I band it with your

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.610 
like this and I band it with your
fingers<00:04:26.260> like<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:27.040> then<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.730> run<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.290> I<00:04:29.290> do<00:04:29.500> it

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
fingers like this then I run and I do it

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.490 
fingers like this then I run and I do it
for<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:30.010> whole<00:04:30.280> length<00:04:30.880> of<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.480> string<00:04:31.810> all

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
for the whole length of the string all

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.960 
for the whole length of the string all
the<00:04:32.560> way<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.360> neck<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:35.610> do<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.820> couple

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
the way to the neck and do it a couple

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.550 
the way to the neck and do it a couple
of<00:04:37.180> times<00:04:37.510> for<00:04:38.380> each<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.190> strings<00:04:39.550> like

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
of times for each of the strings like

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.500 
of times for each of the strings like
this<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:43.140> I<00:04:44.140> think<00:04:44.680> this<00:04:45.070> will<00:04:45.280> make<00:04:45.550> these

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
this and I think this will make these

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.350 
this and I think this will make these
strings<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:47.260> little<00:04:48.160> bit<00:04:48.280> bit<00:04:48.640> stronger<00:04:49.180> and

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
strings a little bit bit stronger and

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.940 
strings a little bit bit stronger and
and<00:04:49.810> more<00:04:50.350> elastic<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.880> get<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.360> can

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
and more elastic and you get you can

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.710 
and more elastic and you get you can
bend<00:04:59.950> them<00:05:00.220> pretty<00:05:00.669> strong<00:05:01.060> here<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:03.540> do<00:05:04.540> this

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
bend them pretty strong here and do this

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:14.410 
bend them pretty strong here and do this
for<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.050> while<00:05:05.290> for<00:05:05.680> every<00:05:06.340> string

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.110 

now<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:15.050> I've<00:05:15.250> changed<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.580> new<00:05:16.700> strings

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
now that I've changed the new strings

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.580 
now that I've changed the new strings
here<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:18.280> cleaned<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.430> fretboard<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:20.780> not<00:05:21.560> a

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
here and cleaned the fretboard the not a

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.010 
here and cleaned the fretboard the not a
guitar<00:05:21.860> feels<00:05:22.430> very<00:05:22.790> nice<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.330> actually<00:05:23.810> feels

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
guitar feels very nice it actually feels

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.480 
guitar feels very nice it actually feels
almost<00:05:24.770> like<00:05:25.510> like<00:05:26.510> a<00:05:26.570> brand<00:05:26.900> new<00:05:27.110> guitar<00:05:27.380> so<00:05:28.100> I

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
almost like like a brand new guitar so I

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.390 
almost like like a brand new guitar so I
really<00:05:29.060> recommend<00:05:29.530> cleaning<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.860> fretboard

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
really recommend cleaning the fretboard

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.400 
really recommend cleaning the fretboard
and<00:05:32.860> preventing<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:34.070> strings
