00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
ever not so I think what we're going to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.009 
ever not so I think what we're going to
have<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.610> do<00:02:50.760> we're<00:02:51.239> probably<00:02:51.450> going<00:02:51.689> to<00:02:51.870> have

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
have to do we're probably going to have

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.750 
have to do we're probably going to have
to<00:02:52.230> mix<00:02:52.560> up<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.829> troops<00:02:53.159> a<00:02:53.250> little<00:02:53.459> there<00:02:53.640> is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
to mix up the troops a little there is

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.050 
to mix up the troops a little there is
an<00:02:53.879> identical<00:02:54.599> village<00:02:55.340> available<00:02:56.370> that's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
an identical village available that's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.330 
an identical village available that's
that<00:02:57.329> recommended<00:02:57.900> target<00:02:58.349> right<00:02:58.560> there<00:02:58.590> it's

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
that recommended target right there it's

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.580 
that recommended target right there it's
identical<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.390> one<00:03:00.599> I<00:03:00.629> attacked<00:03:01.140> earlier

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
identical to this one I attacked earlier

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.949 
identical to this one I attacked earlier
let's<00:03:01.829> take<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.069> look<00:03:02.340> at<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.579> here<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.599> now<00:03:03.930> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
let's take a look at it here it is now I

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.080 
let's take a look at it here it is now I
guess<00:03:04.349> they've<00:03:04.769> decided<00:03:05.220> this<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.730> an<00:03:05.819> ante

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
guess they've decided this is an ante

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.670 
guess they've decided this is an ante
three-star<00:03:06.659> base<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.170> why<00:03:07.409> it's<00:03:07.530> been

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
three-star base this is why it's been

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.270 
three-star base this is why it's been
chosen<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.310> J<00:03:09.180> thrift<00:03:09.629> he<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.470> also<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.099> guy

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
chosen and J thrift he is also the guy

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.809 
chosen and J thrift he is also the guy
who<00:03:11.849> only<00:03:12.060> got<00:03:12.329> one<00:03:12.629> star<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.379> my<00:03:13.650> vase<00:03:14.310> he<00:03:14.579> only

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
who only got one star on my vase he only

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.430 
who only got one star on my vase he only
got<00:03:14.970> one<00:03:15.090> star<00:03:15.359> on<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.659> other<00:03:15.780> as<00:03:15.989> well<00:03:16.170> so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
got one star on the other as well so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.809 
got one star on the other as well so
he'll<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.769> little<00:03:17.010> bit<00:03:17.099> upset<00:03:17.220> about<00:03:17.459> that

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
he'll be a little bit upset about that

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.360 
he'll be a little bit upset about that
hoping<00:03:18.599> I'm<00:03:18.750> not<00:03:18.780> going<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.290> emulate<00:03:19.680> him<00:03:19.859> I'm

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
hoping I'm not going to emulate him I'm

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.830 
hoping I'm not going to emulate him I'm
going<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.790> take<00:03:20.970> home<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.329> other<00:03:21.450> one<00:03:21.629> it

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
going to take home the other one it

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.500 
going to take home the other one it
looks<00:03:22.049> exactly<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:23.010> same<00:03:23.159> as<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.609> one<00:03:23.670> but<00:03:24.480> I

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
looks exactly the same as this one but I

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.479 
looks exactly the same as this one but I
think<00:03:24.599> I'm<00:03:24.930> going<00:03:25.109> to<00:03:25.200> change<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.920> troops<00:03:26.220> a

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
think I'm going to change the troops a

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.000 
think I'm going to change the troops a
little<00:03:27.060> bit<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:27.870> let's<00:03:28.290> go<00:03:28.440> back<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.680> village

let's modify that troop combination that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.800 
let's modify that troop combination that
I<00:03:31.590> used<00:03:31.859> before<00:03:32.090> what<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.120> should<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.540> done<00:03:33.750> I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
I used before what I should have done I

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.449

means you've done something wrong
somewhere<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.819> I<00:03:45.060> definitely<00:03:45.540> did<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:45.989> let's

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
somewhere and I definitely did so let's

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.839 
somewhere and I definitely did so let's
mess<00:03:46.500> around<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.949> these<00:03:47.069> troops<00:03:47.400> let's<00:03:47.609> make

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
mess around with these troops let's make

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.150 
mess around with these troops let's make
it<00:03:47.879> a<00:03:48.150> little<00:03:48.269> bit<00:03:48.510> more<00:03:49.129> tailor-made<00:03:50.129> for

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
it a little bit more tailor-made for

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.699 
it a little bit more tailor-made for
this<00:03:50.549> particular<00:03:50.879> village<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.810> don't<00:03:52.500> think

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
this particular village I don't think

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.349 
this particular village I don't think
we're<00:03:52.829> going<00:03:52.949> to<00:03:53.010> take<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.370> many<00:03:53.639> giants<00:03:54.180> I

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
we're going to take this many giants I

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.330 
we're going to take this many giants I
think<00:03:54.959> we'll<00:03:55.139> probably<00:03:55.319> drop<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:55.889> down<00:03:56.099> to

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
think we'll probably drop this down to

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.330 
think we'll probably drop this down to
eight<00:03:56.579> we'll<00:03:57.480> take<00:03:57.810> an<00:03:57.989> extra<00:03:58.319> golem<00:03:58.709> get

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
eight we'll take an extra golem get

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.729 
eight we'll take an extra golem get
these<00:03:59.519> wizards<00:03:59.940> cooking<00:04:00.389> I<00:04:00.569> think<00:04:01.139> what<00:04:01.560> we're

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
these wizards cooking I think what we're

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.559 
these wizards cooking I think what we're
going<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.099> do<00:04:02.190> is<00:04:02.310> take<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.609> extra<00:04:02.879> golem<00:04:03.180> that

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
going to do is take the extra golem that

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.539 
going to do is take the extra golem that
should<00:04:03.900> keep<00:04:04.079> our<00:04:04.319> Royals<00:04:04.680> alive<00:04:04.980> just<00:04:05.340> that

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
should keep our Royals alive just that

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.729 
should keep our Royals alive just that
