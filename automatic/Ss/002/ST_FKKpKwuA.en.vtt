00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
darkest and and move that way it needs

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.670 
darkest and and move that way it needs
very<00:01:59.490> very<00:01:59.850> little<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.270> an<00:02:00.360> e<00:02:00.450> 59<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.350> order<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680

got a little bit out of focus sorry
about<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.710> but<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.130> can<00:03:36.250> still<00:03:36.460> see<00:03:36.700> the

about that but you can still see the
coloring<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.870> way<00:03:37.990> that<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.260> works<00:03:38.500> not

worrying<00:03:39.550> about<00:03:39.640> being<00:03:39.760> tidy<00:03:40.380> just<00:03:41.380> worrying

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
worrying about being tidy just worrying

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.260 
worrying about being tidy just worrying

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
about getting the color on there and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.490 
about getting the color on there and
then<00:03:43.330> getting<00:03:43.600> back<00:03:43.840> in<00:03:44.050> there<00:03:44.200> while<00:03:44.350> it's

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
then getting back in there while it's

the car you'll see just the video does
weird<00:04:07.240> things<00:04:07.330> this<00:04:08.230> one<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.470> apologize<00:04:09.040> will

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
weird things this one I apologize will

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.930 
weird things this one I apologize will
look<00:04:09.340> really<00:04:09.610> really<00:04:09.760> dark<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:11.500> also<00:04:12.250> tend<00:04:12.670> to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
look really really dark I also tend to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.450 
look really really dark I also tend to
not<00:04:13.150> put<00:04:13.600> if<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:14.200> can<00:04:14.590> help<00:04:14.770> it<00:04:15.010> around<00:04:15.310> the

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
not put if I can help it around the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.300 
not put if I can help it around the
bottom<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:16.060> someone's<00:04:16.420> chin<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:17.109> leave<00:04:18.010> just<00:04:18.250> a

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
bottom of someone's chin I leave just a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.400 
bottom of someone's chin I leave just a
little<00:04:18.340> tiny<00:04:18.730> bit<00:04:18.940> of<00:04:19.090> space<00:04:19.390> so<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.020> the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
little tiny bit of space so that the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.480 
little tiny bit of space so that the
darkest<00:04:21.100> color<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.669> not<00:04:22.660> just<00:04:23.490> completely

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
darkest color is not just completely

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.730 
darkest color is not just completely
underneath<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.270> their<00:04:25.510> chin

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
underneath of their chin

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.710 
underneath of their chin
just<00:04:27.099> cuz<00:04:27.220> on<00:04:27.370> people<00:04:27.819> that's<00:04:28.210> not<00:04:28.389> realistic

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
just cuz on people that's not realistic

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.960 
just cuz on people that's not realistic
that<00:04:29.139> it<00:04:29.259> completely<00:04:30.099> gets<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.639> dark

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
that it completely gets that dark

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.760 
that it completely gets that dark
there's<00:04:31.300> sometimes<00:04:31.539> a<00:04:31.870> reflection<00:04:32.440> off<00:04:32.560> their

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
there's sometimes a reflection off their

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.040 
there's sometimes a reflection off their
shirt<00:04:33.069> and<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:34.150> that<00:04:34.300> adds<00:04:34.599> a<00:04:34.750> little<00:04:34.840> bit<00:04:34.960> of

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
shirt and so that adds a little bit of

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.689 
shirt and so that adds a little bit of
realism<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:37.720> e<00:04:38.289> 35<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.520> color

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
realism to it so the e 35 is the color

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.430 
realism to it so the e 35 is the color
and<00:04:39.849> going<00:04:40.030> in<00:04:40.150> with<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.449> pull<00:04:40.780> all<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.050> color

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
and going in with to pull all that color

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.730 
and going in with to pull all that color
from<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.800> edges<00:04:42.069> and<00:04:42.490> blend<00:04:42.849> it<00:04:43.560> it's<00:04:44.560> going

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
from the edges and blend it it's going

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.680 
from the edges and blend it it's going
in<00:04:44.949> over<00:04:45.160> all<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.880> different<00:04:46.180> bits<00:04:46.330> of<00:04:46.479> it<00:04:46.569> now

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
in over all the different bits of it now

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.150 
in over all the different bits of it now
some<00:04:46.900> people<00:04:47.020> will<00:04:47.259> take<00:04:47.440> one<00:04:47.710> arm<00:04:47.919> at<00:04:48.069> a<00:04:48.130> time

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
some people will take one arm at a time

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.100 
some people will take one arm at a time
one<00:04:48.610> leg<00:04:48.849> at<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.030> time<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.479> sort<00:04:49.720> of<00:04:49.750> thing<00:04:49.810> I

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
one leg at a time that sort of thing I

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.010 
one leg at a time that sort of thing I
tend<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.740> go<00:04:50.860> for<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:51.039> whole<00:04:51.220> image<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:52.020> then

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
tend to go for the whole image and then

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.600 
tend to go for the whole image and then
just<00:04:53.199> keep<00:04:53.349> going<00:04:53.620> over<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:53.919> over<00:04:54.099> again<00:04:54.310> it

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
just keep going over and over again it

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.760 
just keep going over and over again it
looks<00:04:54.639> really<00:04:55.300> dark<00:04:55.449> here<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:55.900> it's<00:04:56.530> not
