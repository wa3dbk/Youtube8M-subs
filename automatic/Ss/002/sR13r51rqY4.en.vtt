do the electronic wiring I'll talk to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.969 
do the electronic wiring I'll talk to
the<00:02:00.060> why<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.960> with<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> wiring<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.860> an

the why that you with the wiring is an

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.490 
the why that you with the wiring is an
independent<00:02:02.790> thing<00:02:03.049> because<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> little

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
independent thing because it's a little

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.660
