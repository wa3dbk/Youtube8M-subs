00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.390 

using<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.990> stamp<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.290> got<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
using a stamp that I got I think that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800 
using a stamp that I got I think that
the<00:01:26.520> stamp<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.820> called<00:01:27.030> couple<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.450> love<00:01:27.479> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the stamp is called couple in love and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.260 
the stamp is called couple in love and
then<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> used<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.350> arm<00:01:28.850> prismacolor<00:01:29.850> pencils

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
then I used my arm prismacolor pencils

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
then I used my arm prismacolor pencils
to<00:01:30.750> color<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.500> there's<00:01:31.710> just

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
to color it in and then there's just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440 
to color it in and then there's just
tickles<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> sides<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.270> their

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
tickles on the sides and this is their

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
tickles on the sides and this is their
wedding<00:01:33.869> colors<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.290> think<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.740> pink

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and cream or something so so that's that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
and cream or something so so that's that
