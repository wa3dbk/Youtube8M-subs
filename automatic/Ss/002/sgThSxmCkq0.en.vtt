00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.170
 It's loose, it's okay, you 're here for 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.929
 do one more example and you got 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.449
 Also the video starts so I'm here 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.189
 My neighbor is very special. 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.609
 substance 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.060
 so they are very special but really 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.949
 today another tip is very nice in 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.539
 that the campaign that he does there works 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.989
 with custom working with 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.360
 inkjet printing but the fight does not 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.090
 recognize my face i came here today 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.410
 and told you 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.559
 been abducted in management of tired without 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.559
 say nothing but I could not let the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.460
 channel without video information you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.629
 So I came to make this video and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.850
 mainly because of this material 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.670
 I'm sure you'll like it. 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.469
 very very very much to know how it is that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.270
 happens when I make an impression 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.309
 The one I have in my dreams. 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.820
 I need to waterproof my work 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.600
 so that he does not lose with water the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.820
 that he does not lose ink with 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.680
 exposure to light that everyone knows 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.140
 the inkjet printer on the paper 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.119
 photographic how to know the time she 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.619
 discovers that she loses the color of the paper 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.869
 It gets boring depending on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.689
 I do not know the color enough if I can 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.960
 You see, but I tried to make the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.380
 little modelie I know what I left it is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.049
 plenty of time here in the light and there too 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.590
 say little is not giving 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.710
 in print and this one here I dn 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.790
 right now recently so the dog a hand 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.369
 from the other 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.509
 You can see how much this one 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.210
 here lies school 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.280
 So this stuff I use to 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.210
 put my boxes when I went to see 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 a son 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.960
 I put revenue keep this car there. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.119
 works with alcohol in the box and how do I 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.920
 performance to leave large quantity 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.380
 It's time I went to use it. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.410
 stand out 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.810
 ah and it will also pasted on the box goes 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:18.319
 is subject to rain and subject to voting 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.390
 Because of the heat, I'm not in contact 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.110
 with the sun of luminosity 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.910
 I always use God spray too 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.580
 some materials and do a good job 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.550
 here in cultivating a dream that I do not 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.160
 I want it to come back in time. 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.870
 I do not know he's going to be exposed to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.239
 its use this narrow 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.010
 So what does he like for you today? 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.590
 these players the vinyl 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.330
 I see you all as what is the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.170
 subject application is easy to suffer 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.180
 quiet 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.120
 some people have difficulty as 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.269
 spray because if you apply too much of 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.940
 near a viscosity and if there is 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.480
 16 from the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.670
 aspect of the role and he thereby gave 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.510
 little appearance made collective a little bit 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.640
 of the barrel 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.709
 but it ensures resistance of your 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.269
 work I do not use at all 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.900
 here as I told you to 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.440
 I do not use other jobs, but it 's 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.989
 the one that I know is going to have to 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.220
 greater durability that marks the debut 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.829
 of a new coach 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.370
 I often optimism so enough 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.500
 you as geoapi and pernes and who 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.750
 have an interest in buying one more 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.090
 I buy a supplier every time I 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.230
 world knows the channel here is to be 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.180
 nec shop 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.359
 I do not even have the eternal question 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.100
 then as on a website you guarantee your 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.350
 this than necessary for those 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.299
 customized for anyone who makes a 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.019
 think a photo paper jet 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.870
 ink 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.730
 so come on then let's beat the avaÃ­ 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.730
 in the video with its application for two 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.330
 dry in an innovative dry 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.280
 quick little right very fast 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.190
 you think for example I do because 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.170
 I think I feel it 's hold of Sao Paulo 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.380
 then the spaces will be filled 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.310
 still have no date distances at 8 feet 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.470
 do not stay and I will not do my fifth 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.300
 in many stores will not give the effect that 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.060
 you need about a 15 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.070
 centimeters and another tip for you 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.750
 I suggest you make the cut 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.620
 first born the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.280
 is and then apply the varnish 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.050
 because the inverness on paper does not 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.910
 applied the red after you go 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.400
 send him to stop let 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.040
 besides this more his work because of the south 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.790
 applied a thin layer of a product 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.710
 of that sheet is this waste is not of 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.060
 If you wait, your bis can also 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.720
 check your machine 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.280
 today you make the cut and must have 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.140
 its governing application 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.530
 so it was that way that they 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.590
 I really do not think you can see. 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:02.270
 one but a terrine was created so he 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.540
 not pro'll aa guy right eye and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.669
 nor I hope you enjoyed
