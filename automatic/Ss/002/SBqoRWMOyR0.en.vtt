00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
game I thought he was very very good in
doing<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.780> he<00:01:00.870> did<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.010> know<00:01:02.129> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
doing what he did and that you know you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100
