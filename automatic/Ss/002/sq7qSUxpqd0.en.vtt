00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.689 
that I used in this tutorial so I
started<00:00:41.960> off<00:00:42.140> by<00:00:42.379> using<00:00:42.620> this<00:00:42.890> Turkish<00:00:43.430> color

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
started off by using this Turkish color

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.880 
started off by using this Turkish color
and<00:00:43.910> then<00:00:44.000> transitioned<00:00:44.660> into<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:45.050> darker

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.920 
and then transitioned into the darker
color<00:00:46.160> I<00:00:46.250> always<00:00:46.790> use<00:00:46.970> these<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.390> transition
