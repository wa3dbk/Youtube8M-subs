the freezer you don't have to toast it
so<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.759> next<00:02:05.969> step<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:07.049> take<00:02:07.290> an<00:02:07.469> egg<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
so the next step is to take an egg and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.140 
so the next step is to take an egg and
crack<00:02:08.700> it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.729 

and<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.330> you're<00:02:12.450> gonna<00:02:12.569> crack<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.290> them<00:02:13.530> in

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
and if you're gonna crack it in them in

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:25.030 
and if you're gonna crack it in them in
a<00:02:14.129> plate<00:02:14.489> like<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.819> ah<00:02:21.379> and<00:02:23.030> then<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.150> take<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
a plate like this ah and then you take a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:35.839 
a plate like this ah and then you take a
fork<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.250> you're<00:02:26.400> gonna<00:02:26.519> biscuit<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
fork and you're gonna biscuit so the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.600 
fork and you're gonna biscuit so the
next<00:02:36.030> step<00:02:36.269> is<00:02:36.480> I'll<00:02:37.470> take<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> cinnamon<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610

you sprinkle the cinnamon a little bit
over<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.450> app<00:02:42.599> just<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.560> little<00:02:43.859> bit<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.190> this

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
over the app just a little bit like this

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.470 
over the app just a little bit like this
I<00:02:45.650> would<00:02:46.650> say<00:02:46.829> it's<00:02:47.010> about<00:02:47.280> 1/2<00:02:47.670> teaspoon<00:02:47.940> of
