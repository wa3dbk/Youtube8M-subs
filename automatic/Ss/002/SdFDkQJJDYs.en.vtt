00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
idea which i think it really shows him I

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.230 
idea which i think it really shows him I
like<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.760> combine<00:02:23.150> our<00:02:23.200> ambient<00:02:24.200> light<00:02:24.350> with

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
like to combine our ambient light with

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.550 
like to combine our ambient light with
the<00:02:26.240> strobe<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.440> do<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.830> lot<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.610> find<00:02:29.240> that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
the strobe and I do it a lot I find that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.560 
the strobe and I do it a lot I find that
it<00:02:30.560> sort<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.860> allows<00:02:31.280> my<00:02:31.760> background<00:02:32.300> to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
it sort of allows my background to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.420 
it sort of allows my background to
become<00:02:32.800> seamless<00:02:33.800> in<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.010> way<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.610> very<00:02:36.430> very

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
become seamless in a way and very very

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.140 
become seamless in a way and very very
flat<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.860> picture<00:02:40.160> itself<00:02:40.430> almost

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
flat and and the picture itself almost

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.110 
flat and and the picture itself almost
becomes<00:02:41.420> like<00:02:41.480> almost<00:02:42.670> one-dimensional<00:02:43.670> by

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
becomes like almost one-dimensional by

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.260 
becomes like almost one-dimensional by
lighting<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.570> subject<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.290> foreground<00:02:45.470> I

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
lighting the subject in the foreground I

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.480 
lighting the subject in the foreground I
find<00:02:47.270> that<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.690> like<00:02:47.930> pop<00:02:48.290> them<00:02:48.560> they<00:02:49.220> pop

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
find that I can like pop them they pop

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.030 
find that I can like pop them they pop
forward<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.420> then<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.320> leave<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:54.040> leave

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
forward and then you leave the I leave

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.090

other words it's a long exposure it's a

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.900
