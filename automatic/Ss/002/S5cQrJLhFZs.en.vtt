 and pron. of DJ training 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.270
 it will pass. this training e 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.309
 a month that has been passing this mask for forty years 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.949
 how are the chats guys up then reply post to the header renault i know 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.669
 very well piero because in the past we have 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.380
 a similar dj tool was created just when I was born 

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:25.600
 I am part of this dj fool love 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.600
 there was fidelfatti who had created thing 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.660
 yes I know that he now really a 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.730
 I think I stopped working in the disco directly, dedicating everything to myself 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 outline now does but that things 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.400
 the permissibility of all these things here 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.850
 and I'm in contact with him via feisbuk france and beyond 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.730
 and he too had involved me in the sense he had proposed 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 d participate in this school for DJs 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.150
 or even I was one evening with him 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.250
 but I did not hear it because I heard of it 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.680
 not up to par that 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.200
 but how do I teach another what I am doing but a man i 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 means I can't find the means to transmit 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.350
 what I have to do what you want me to do with you, you do so if you don't 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.650
 I feel something enough 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.370
 I mean you have to do it yourself, it won't let me sleep - you won't be there evenings 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.370
 definitely g processes carefully people who have the opportunity to transmit 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.560
 instead this kind of thing indeed 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.950
 I saw the program of the Piero school and there were more beautiful things 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.110
 systematic ce 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.400
 part of the music bpm I agree 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.480
 for this I say things to do better you do it for android 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.430
 and this why 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.920
 having no loans does not make sense. what topically brings what is more 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.890
 difficult also to explain basically appracadabra state 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.870
 technician I don't even know if 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.350
 I can be a one thing 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.580
 if I were laziness there is no nonononone I've ever had I never thought if I want 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.700
 teach a guy with mine in my way of doing what I have to shave after 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.810
 the birth here is maybe I should go 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.610
 where to stay can reflect before the notes for 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.450
 create but with what we say that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.939
 I'm always others, I never think about it 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.519
 it's not that i don't wanna make lol school in the future i wanna make it cry in 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.880
 head. mashed potato 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 I'd like to say that I'm probably 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.700
 make us a night program 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.230
 maybe radio all night works as he listens once 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.469
 stereonotte something different. 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.499
 how far we have been the experience over the beautiful 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.420
 radio first courses with me with another environment 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.769
 let's hope it's not the disco 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.120
 but let's say that maybe I see it I see it as maybe a near future in the sense 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.269
 which probably the fighter 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.269
 faieta pasta faculty which for me is therefore 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.129
 info sidi ifni I feel uncomfortable at a certain age to still be going but 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.650
 maybe not because nobody 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.040
 that's something I tell you 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.100
 in a nutshell it could be a voluptuous greeting from my of mine 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.690
 work since i have. 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.690
 so many discs could serve 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:22.289
 hahaha teach what I can not do so say by a cate
