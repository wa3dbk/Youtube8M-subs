the<00:00:01.140> new<00:00:01.319> braking<00:00:01.740> systems<00:00:02.100> upon<00:00:02.490> which<00:00:02.730> we

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
the new braking systems upon which we

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.180 
the new braking systems upon which we
are<00:00:03.090> now<00:00:03.300> discussing<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.350> requirements<00:00:05.009> is

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
are now discussing the requirements is

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.880 
are now discussing the requirements is
intended<00:00:05.880> to<00:00:06.060> intervene<00:00:06.900> in<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.109> case<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.350> a

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
intended to intervene in the case that a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.699 
intended to intervene in the case that a
driver<00:00:08.579> for<00:00:08.909> whatever<00:00:09.059> reason<00:00:09.659> would<00:00:10.320> not<00:00:10.530> be

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:10.709 
driver for whatever reason would not be

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.289 
driver for whatever reason would not be
aware<00:00:10.860> about<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.459> possibility<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.059> an

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
aware about the possibility of an

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.720 
aware about the possibility of an
accident<00:00:12.659> and<00:00:12.900> would<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.230> react<00:00:13.589> in<00:00:13.769> time<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
accident and would not react in time so

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.390 
accident and would not react in time so
the<00:00:14.849> system<00:00:15.179> would<00:00:15.299> then<00:00:15.360> automatically

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
the system would then automatically

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.310 
the system would then automatically
first<00:00:17.400> start<00:00:17.730> by<00:00:17.939> warning<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.689> driver<00:00:18.990> that

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
first start by warning the driver that

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.349 
first start by warning the driver that
there<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.800> potential<00:00:20.580> collision<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
there is a potential collision and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.839 
there is a potential collision and
secondly<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> driver<00:00:22.890> still<00:00:23.310> would<00:00:23.640> not

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
secondly if the driver still would not

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.130 
secondly if the driver still would not
react<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> system<00:00:25.019> would

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
react then the system would

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.710 
react then the system would
automatically<00:00:25.769> intervene<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.490> brake<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
automatically intervene and brake the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720 
automatically intervene and brake the
vehicle<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.349> order<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.829> reduce<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.519> severity

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
vehicle in order to reduce the severity

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.290 
vehicle in order to reduce the severity
of<00:00:30.089> the<00:00:30.329> accident

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.720 

according<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.350> our<00:00:35.379> estimations<00:00:36.250> if<00:00:36.430> these

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
according to our estimations if these

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.830 
according to our estimations if these
systems<00:00:37.149> are<00:00:37.300> fitted<00:00:37.690> on<00:00:37.989> these<00:00:38.649> vehicles<00:00:39.840> our

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
systems are fitted on these vehicles our

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.380 
systems are fitted on these vehicles our
assessment<00:00:41.410> is<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:41.620> in<00:00:42.190> general<00:00:42.390> about

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
assessment is that in general about

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.740 
assessment is that in general about
2,000<00:00:44.379> lives<00:00:44.559> a<00:00:44.980> year<00:00:45.070> can<00:00:46.059> be<00:00:46.210> saved<00:00:46.480> in<00:00:46.660> the

2,000 lives a year can be saved in the
European<00:00:47.199> Union<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.590> of<00:00:47.680> course<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.100> lot<00:00:48.370> more

European Union and of course a lot more

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
European Union and of course a lot more
injuries<00:00:50.260> can<00:00:50.559> be<00:00:50.820> prevented

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.180 

we<00:00:58.059> have<00:00:58.150> Aradia<00:00:58.420> radar<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.199> front<00:00:59.440> these

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
we have Aradia radar in front these

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.790 
we have Aradia radar in front these
measures<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.909> objects<00:01:01.510> which<00:01:01.899> are<00:01:02.199> moving<00:01:02.680> in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
critical and more critical then you get

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.889 
critical and more critical then you get

an acoustic optical warning it beeps and

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.200 
an acoustic optical warning it beeps and

it's<00:01:52.870> very<00:01:53.260> reliable<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.250> already<00:01:54.430> have

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's very reliable and we already have

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.109 
it's very reliable and we already have
accidents<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.460> ABA<00:01:58.180> active<00:01:58.720> brake<00:01:58.930> assist

without the ABA there would be deaths

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.949 
without the ABA there would be deaths
and<00:02:08.920> with<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.550> ABA<00:02:09.819> everything<00:02:10.420> everybody

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
and with the ABA everything everybody

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.170 
and with the ABA everything everybody
was<00:02:11.140> fine<00:02:11.380> only<00:02:12.000> some<00:02:13.290> wrecked<00:02:14.290> cars<00:02:15.180> we

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
was fine only some wrecked cars we

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.970 
was fine only some wrecked cars we
started<00:02:16.630> with<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> system<00:02:17.350> in<00:02:18.060> 1999

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
started with the system in 1999

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.540 
started with the system in 1999
developing<00:02:20.980> CS<00:02:21.910> production<00:02:22.300> was<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:22.480> 2006<00:02:23.200> and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
developing CS production was in 2006 and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.090 
developing CS production was in 2006 and
this<00:02:24.550> production<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:26.140> system<00:02:26.530> including

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
this production of the system including

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.220 
this production of the system including
stationary<00:02:27.580> objects<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.360> 2010<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:32.050> see

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
stationary objects in 2010 so you see

00:02:32.230 --> 00:03:16.510 
stationary objects in 2010 so you see
it's<00:02:32.380> complex<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.040> difficult

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.060 

thank<00:03:16.910> you
