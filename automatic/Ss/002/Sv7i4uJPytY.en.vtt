often should I water this is one of my
pet<00:00:19.290> peeves<00:00:19.560> people<00:00:20.190> buy<00:00:20.369> these<00:00:20.430> new<00:00:20.790> plants

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
pet peeves people buy these new plants

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.519 
pet peeves people buy these new plants
they<00:00:21.570> put<00:00:21.810> them<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> ground

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
they put them in the ground

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.470 
they put them in the ground
they<00:00:22.710> take<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.160> hose<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.790> water<00:00:24.060> around

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
they take the hose they water around

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.120 
they take the hose they water around
them<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.810> then<00:00:25.080> they<00:00:25.200> disappear<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.890> two<00:00:26.010> or

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
them and then they disappear for two or

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.070 
them and then they disappear for two or
three<00:00:26.340> days<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.820> next<00:00:27.150> time<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.660> check<00:00:27.900> on

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
three days the next time they check on

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.690 
three days the next time they check on
the<00:00:28.230> plant<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.340> shriveled

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
the plant it's all the shriveled

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.390 
the plant it's all the shriveled
half-dead<00:00:30.450> plant<00:00:30.780> the<00:00:31.410> reason<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.129> is

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
half-dead plant the reason for that is

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.520 
half-dead plant the reason for that is
you<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.000> understand<00:00:33.420> these<00:00:33.840> plants<00:00:34.410> are

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you have to understand these plants are

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
you have to understand these plants are
raised<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.190> nursery<00:00:35.580> and<00:00:35.730> every<00:00:36.239> day

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
raised in a nursery and every day

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
raised in a nursery and every day
someone<00:00:36.989> waters<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.830> plants<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
someone waters the plants so they get a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.960 
someone waters the plants so they get a
good<00:00:39.360> dosage<00:00:40.080> of<00:00:40.260> water<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.340> come<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
good dosage of water now you come and

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.670 
good dosage of water now you come and
you<00:00:42.180> buy<00:00:42.330> them<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.720> put<00:00:43.170> them<00:00:43.290> into<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you buy them you put them into the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.100 
you buy them you put them into the
native<00:00:44.040> soil<00:00:44.250> that's<00:00:44.730> basically<00:00:45.270> dry<00:00:45.630> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
native soil that's basically dry the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
native soil that's basically dry the
first<00:00:46.410> time<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.890> water<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.940> water

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
first time you water it all that water

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
first time you water it all that water
is<00:00:48.480> sucked<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.500> root<00:00:49.680> zone

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
is sucked out of the root zone

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.520 
is sucked out of the root zone
and<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.640> there's<00:00:51.059> basically<00:00:51.239> no<00:00:51.840> water<00:00:52.200> to<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and so there's basically no water to the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.310 
and so there's basically no water to the
plant<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.059> what<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.510> most<00:00:54.720> important

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
plant so what is the most important

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.950 
plant so what is the most important
thing<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> first<00:00:56.969> two<00:00:57.600> weeks

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
thing to know is for the first two weeks

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
thing to know is for the first two weeks
after<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.739> plant<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.190> plant<00:00:59.460> too<00:00:59.940> watered

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
after you plant the plant too watered

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.350 
after you plant the plant too watered
every<00:01:01.110> single<00:01:01.530> day<00:01:01.739> by<00:01:02.280> doing<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:02.969> that

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
every single day by doing that that

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.080 
every single day by doing that that
allows<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.350> root<00:01:04.559> zone<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.100> establish<00:01:05.700> itself

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
allows the root zone to establish itself

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850 
allows the root zone to establish itself
and<00:01:06.300> go<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.540> into<00:01:06.780> native<00:01:06.990> soil<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and go out into native soil and that

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
and go out into native soil and that
also<00:01:08.100> takes<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.300> native<00:01:09.630> soil<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
also takes all of the native soil and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.139 
also takes all of the native soil and
keeps<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> nice<00:01:10.649> and<00:01:10.710> moist<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.030> about

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
keeps it nice and moist so what about

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.210 
keeps it nice and moist so what about
water<00:01:12.660> well<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.350> need<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:14.009> there's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
water well you need to know that there's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
water well you need to know that there's
some<00:01:14.430> brand-new<00:01:14.970> technologies<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:16.020> there

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
some brand-new technologies out there

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
some brand-new technologies out there
some<00:01:16.500> great<00:01:16.860> new<00:01:17.130> drip<00:01:17.490> systems<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.210> drip

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
some great new drip systems the drip

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780 
some great new drip systems the drip
spray<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> drip<00:01:19.440> emitters<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> actually

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
spray or the drip emitters that actually

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240 
spray or the drip emitters that actually
put<00:01:21.000> water<00:01:21.210> directly<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> root<00:01:22.770> zone<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
put water directly on to the root zone a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.520 
put water directly on to the root zone a
lot<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> might<00:01:24.150> say<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.840> should<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.290> water

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
lot of you might say when should I water

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.810 
lot of you might say when should I water
what<00:01:25.890> time<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.369> day

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what time of the day

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.030 
what time of the day
I<00:01:26.850> recommend<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> mornings<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> reason

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
I recommend the mornings and the reason

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.190 
I recommend the mornings and the reason
for<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.760> gives<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> maximum

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
for that is that gives you the maximum

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.469 
for that is that gives you the maximum
benefit<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> plant<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.390> you

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
benefit to the plant now a lot of you

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
benefit to the plant now a lot of you
might<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.780> saying<00:01:34.020> well<00:01:34.439> shouldn't<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.860> water

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
might be saying well shouldn't I water

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.399 
might be saying well shouldn't I water
in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> heat<00:01:35.760> of<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> day<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.020> worst

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
in the heat of the day that's the worst

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
in the heat of the day that's the worst
time<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> reason<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:38.970> get

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
time and the reason for that is you get

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.420 
time and the reason for that is you get
water<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.049> leaves<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> plant<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
water on the leaves of the plant and the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249 
water on the leaves of the plant and the
Sun<00:01:41.700> reflects<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.110> almost

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
Sun reflects off of that it's almost

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.899 
Sun reflects off of that it's almost
like<00:01:43.500> putting<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.860> spyglass<00:01:44.130> it'll<00:01:44.700> burn<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
like putting a spyglass it'll burn the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.490 
like putting a spyglass it'll burn the
plant<00:01:45.270> some<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.020> might<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.229> wondering
