00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.419
 Hmm 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:17.370
 Well then I think that I would like to follow usm 3 this time too 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:22.080
 Last time I talked about the video 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:28.230
 I would like to talk about the sound this time 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:33.810
 Whether it is or say that we want to talk I think it actually being recorded in Fu What say 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.560
 I would like to compare it with my children in various ways, but it is also true that it looks like m 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.390
 3 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.810
 Hey mirrorless camera but 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 So I do not expect much about responses 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:52.310
 I'm a player Animing that I can take a video What kind of sound lo effect 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.510
 I think that I want to do a little this time 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:04.239
 By the way, I say it, but is a camera that say camera you are shooting with m separation of Sony 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:09.580
 Very ne Since this another first place of the concept it is is is the camera that questioning the sound 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:15.430
 Voice also sounds neat Well I Well outrageous it neatly in mind sound Kedomo I'm not here 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:18.530
 I think that it is the best voice I appreciate the sound and the video Street take the Well I very neo 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:24.220
 Well I think it will be a comparison too 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.940
 Also this time before the incorporation of this news M3 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.970
 And now it's possible with audio 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.460
 at Uejon 某cm 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.179
 I have taken this with 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 It is a road that has been actually set-up looks in 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:46.200
 I think that I would like to compare 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.260
 Yes This video is Ryotsu store 3 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:55.780
 I'm shooting using the built-in microphone 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.780
 I am shooting with Yoshikawa built-in microphone 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.450
 E-mail from the teeth 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.720
 The picture of a cow is explained with a good M3 picture microphone 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.340
 25 empty 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:52.030
 Yes I came back to the room now I hear the sound 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:57.160
 It is the sound of the built-in microphone of the state M3 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.160
 How do you hear the high-pitched white noise? 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.910
 I think so but I also 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.780
 It will but had 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:10.810
 Then I would like to switch to Audio Technica atq 945 c too 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:16.120
 Don't you say yes now? 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.299
 Have a recording with a microphone called at 9945 Mr. Secretary of Audio-Technica 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.590
 I will 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:27.069
 You may hear it like the news when you put on the microphone 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.069
 I wonder What kind of feeling response of the built-in microphone is also but a comparison 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.800
 I 'm afraid of white noise, but 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.800
 Maybe you 're in 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:44.610
 Yes and it works 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:46.100
 It is here being recorded in M3 of how voice is using mv version of Sony 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.360
 I turnip 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:54.139
 Hey Will not that this is okay most 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.510
 Image quality of Ne state Emsley is also beautiful 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.930
 The sound of mv seems to be systematic too 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:03.880
 How will we hear Kedomo I think that An Inn Do 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.020
 How was it by saying yes 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:15.250
 a My impression is 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:17.140
 Compared with built-in microphone is better to external microphone Erukon say that I wonder there is a sense of realism Kanjigashi 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.750
 In fact I just below 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.870
 The sound I've taken at that place and the sound I've taken is so wide 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.460
 Complete 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.780
 It's not, maybe I'm going to make it more beautiful if I create v 1 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.849
 Well Kedomo is 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.219
 Compared to the built-in microphone 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:41.320
 Full of more piggybacking feeling is better to put an external microphone 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:46.480
 I think tofu or tofu can be taken 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:52.690
 However, it is better to use us m 3 built-in microphone 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:58.849
 Take turn because the directivity is that this unidirectional microphone do it I will feel a variety of 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:06:04.860
 It's not there, so if you go back in there, it's really here 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:09.960
 I think that the built-in microphone of M3 became the result of fatigue 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.630
 And it is a disappointing place but still this time 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.130
 White noise 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:19.850
 When you are taking out is we have so much seen a while ago Kedomo I do not mind 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:22.920
 You Yes I is taken in this case are available in this room 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.400
 White noise looks great 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.420
 So say 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.950
 Hmm I feel this kind of review is not suitable 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.400
 I think you double the bones 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.729
 I know a little I of this time to say or not there 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.360
 I was expecting but 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:45.360
 If it ended in a disappointing result 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.510
 Is it because of this Mike ? 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.740
 I think I was a child microphone of state M3 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:54.750
 I think that Well there after compatibility Toka also Kedomo I'm the Senna of the brain do not know a little 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.430
 Or what Kedomo I 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:01.040
 White noise does not enter 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:04.790
 Kedomo I think Fu that I wish if there is a drug 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.440
 By all means in the comment section below there was something good way 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:12.230
 I would like you to change it 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:15.820
 Kedomo this time by saying yes went to do the voice Hen of the state m water 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:20.760
 Well hey tray is day 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:23.940
 For now, shoot using this ios m 3 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.040
 Oatama in Emubuiwan of Sony 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.390
 And we should try to Rokkon 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:34.320
 I think so 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:35.910
 It 's kind of annoying but I think it 's the best way to go 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.750
 Something good in the nerd 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.070
 Hmm 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:43.360
 Information 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.870
 If you have that good a good microphone where I compatibility is so I would like to debut 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.340
 But 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.280
 Well, for now 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:53.980
 I'm wondering if I could do it that way 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.980
 It was an anhydrous shrimp by the situation 

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.130
 I will
