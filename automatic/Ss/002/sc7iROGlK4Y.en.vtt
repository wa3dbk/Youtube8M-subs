00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
word piece with lots of graphics on the

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.999 
word piece with lots of graphics on the
mystery<00:00:29.369> surrounding<00:00:30.029> 4:00<00:00:30.329> a.m.<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:31.800> seen

mystery surrounding 4:00 a.m. you seen

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.770 
mystery surrounding 4:00 a.m. you seen
that<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.340> amazing<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.270> kept<00:00:33.450> thinking

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that one amazing so I kept thinking

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
that one amazing so I kept thinking
poetry<00:00:34.290> needs<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:34.620> keep<00:00:34.829> pushing<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.280> need<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
poetry needs to keep pushing we need to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.040 
poetry needs to keep pushing we need to
keep<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.760> further<00:00:36.149> further<00:00:36.570> order<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> keep

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
keep going further further order to keep

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.319 
keep going further further order to keep
up<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:37.980> generation<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.760> I've<00:00:39.030> had

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
up with this generation of I've had

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
up with this generation of I've had
users<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.469> textures<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.190> need<00:00:41.339> to<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.519> able<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
users and textures we need to be able to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
users and textures we need to be able to
keep<00:00:42.210> poetry<00:00:42.629> innovative<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.289> think<00:00:43.379> we

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
keep poetry innovative so I think we

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.529 
keep poetry innovative so I think we
should<00:00:44.039> push<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> different<00:00:45.359> level<00:00:45.449> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
should push to a different level and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.669 
should push to a different level and
what<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.989> poet<00:00:46.949> we're<00:00:47.489> telling<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.059> poem

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
what if a poet we're telling you a poem

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.979 
what if a poet we're telling you a poem
while<00:00:49.679> solving<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> Rubik's<00:00:50.910> Cube<00:00:51.300> wouldn't

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
while solving the Rubik's Cube wouldn't

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.790 
while solving the Rubik's Cube wouldn't
that<00:00:52.109> be<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.289> amazing<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:54.350> mean<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.710> really

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that be like amazing I mean we really

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
that be like amazing I mean we really
don't<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.460> any<00:00:56.760> Rubik's<00:00:57.120> cubes<00:00:57.359> lying

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
don't have any Rubik's cubes lying

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.310 
don't have any Rubik's cubes lying
around<00:00:57.749> now<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.199> we

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.520 

okay<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> since<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.759> have<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.030> queue<00:01:09.380> at<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
okay so since we have this queue at this

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.070 
okay so since we have this queue at this
time<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:11.490> our<00:01:11.880> history<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.390> isn't<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.750> amazing

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
time in our history it isn't so amazing

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.389 
time in our history it isn't so amazing
to<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.229> somebody<00:01:13.500> solve<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> Rubik's<00:01:14.100> Cube<00:01:14.159> is

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
to see somebody solve a Rubik's Cube is

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.070 
to see somebody solve a Rubik's Cube is
it<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.240> YouTube<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.810> find

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
it you can go on YouTube you can find

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.109 
it you can go on YouTube you can find
somebody<00:01:16.290> solving<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:16.979> record<00:01:17.159> time<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.909> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
somebody solving it in record time so it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
somebody solving it in record time so it
one<00:01:18.390> hand<00:01:18.630> tied<00:01:18.780> behind<00:01:18.930> their<00:01:19.140> back<00:01:19.380> solving

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
one hand tied behind their back solving

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
one hand tied behind their back solving
it<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.159> their<00:01:20.310> toes<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.909> suppose<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> only

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it with their toes I suppose the only

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.779 
it with their toes I suppose the only
thing<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.530> separates<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.460> average<00:01:23.700> human

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
thing that separates the average human

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.450 
thing that separates the average human
being<00:01:24.149> from<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.690> could<00:01:24.810> solve<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
being from one you could solve it is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.359 
being from one you could solve it is
putting<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> time<00:01:27.530> speak<00:01:28.530> at<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> time<00:01:28.890> when

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
putting in the time speak at a time when

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.830 
putting in the time speak at a time when
air<00:01:29.520> palm<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:33.030> seems<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:33.720> always

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
air palm it seems like I'm always

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.300 
air palm it seems like I'm always
wasting<00:01:34.770> time<00:01:35.450> buying<00:01:36.450> time<00:01:37.069> spending<00:01:38.069> time

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
wasting time buying time spending time

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.859

time<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.280> essence<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:53.940> essentially

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
time is of the essence and essentially

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.410 
time is of the essence and essentially
in<00:01:54.990> order<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.530> more<00:01:55.709> time<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.549> got<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> have

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
in order to get more time I got to have

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090 
in order to get more time I got to have
lots<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.959> money<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.590> order<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.830> get<00:01:58.979> more

lots of money but in order to get more

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.630 
lots of money but in order to get more
money<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.690> got<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:00.810> spend<00:02:00.990> time<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:01.560> time<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
money I got to spend time so time is the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.460
