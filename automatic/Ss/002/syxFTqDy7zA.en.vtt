Monday<00:00:23.310> March<00:00:23.670> 31st<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.810> must<00:00:25.170> say<00:00:25.470> Jeff<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.980> hear

Monday March 31st I must say Jeff I hear

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460 
Monday March 31st I must say Jeff I hear
the<00:00:26.550> words<00:00:26.730> coming<00:00:26.910> out<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.359> your<00:00:27.480> mouth<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:28.019> can

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the words coming out of your mouth I can

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.250 
the words coming out of your mouth I can
recognize<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.640> they<00:00:29.820> mean<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:31.050> not

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
buying it or maybe I'm saying that I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.060 
buying it or maybe I'm saying that I
think<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.200> might<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> learn<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.040> hard

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
think we might have to learn the hard

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.889 
think we might have to learn the hard
way<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.640> might<00:00:35.820> try<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:36.480> faster

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
way we might try to get there faster

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.990 
way we might try to get there faster
anyhow<00:00:37.469> oh<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> think<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.790> try

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
anyhow oh I think we're going to try

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.150 
anyhow oh I think we're going to try
look<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> moon<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.050> aries<00:00:40.379> aries<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
look the moon is in aries aries is a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.389 
look the moon is in aries aries is a
spontaneous<00:00:41.879> Mars<00:00:42.870> ruled<00:00:43.500> impulsive

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
spontaneous Mars ruled impulsive

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.490 
spontaneous Mars ruled impulsive
impatient<00:00:45.090> sign<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.140> point<00:00:46.410> for

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
impatient sign so that's a point for

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.069 
impatient sign so that's a point for
being<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.039> hurry<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:48.360> Aries<00:00:48.809> Moon

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
being in a hurry and that Aries Moon

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.220 
being in a hurry and that Aries Moon
today<00:00:49.489> opposes<00:00:50.489> its<00:00:50.700> key<00:00:50.910> ruling<00:00:51.420> planet<00:00:51.930> Mars

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
today opposes its key ruling planet Mars

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.770 
today opposes its key ruling planet Mars
that's<00:00:52.890> two<00:00:53.489> points<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.059> being<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.570> hurry

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that's two points for being in a hurry

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
that's two points for being in a hurry
why<00:00:55.379> don't<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.680> think<00:00:55.890> we're<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.280> get

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
why don't I think we're going to get

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.150 
why don't I think we're going to get
there<00:00:56.610> as<00:00:56.760> fast<00:00:56.789> Mars<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.020> retrograde<00:00:58.710> well<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
there as fast Mars is retrograde well I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.090 
there as fast Mars is retrograde well I
and<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.480> hear<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.989> Mars<00:01:01.289> retrograde<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and I and I hear that Mars retrograde is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.929 
and I and I hear that Mars retrograde is
like<00:01:02.280> personally<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> strangle<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
like personally I want to strangle it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.420 
like personally I want to strangle it
but<00:01:05.939> take<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.540> time<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.280> other

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but take your time but but but the other

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.039 
but take your time but but but the other
thing<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.210> we're<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.659> couple<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
thing is is that we're just a couple of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
thing is is that we're just a couple of
days<00:01:10.200> away<00:01:10.470> from<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:11.040> annual<00:01:11.580> conjunction<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
days away from an annual conjunction of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.800 
days away from an annual conjunction of
the<00:01:12.299> Sun<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.070> Uranus<00:01:14.070> also<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> areas<00:01:15.090> Uranus

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the Sun and Uranus also in areas Uranus

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.469 
the Sun and Uranus also in areas Uranus
is<00:01:15.990> lightning<00:01:16.770> its<00:01:16.979> immediate<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.299> this

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
is lightning its immediate we have this

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.469 
is lightning its immediate we have this
buildup<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.290> various<00:01:19.710> planets<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.400> Mars<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
buildup of various planets and Mars and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.300 
buildup of various planets and Mars and
I<00:01:21.540> think<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:21.869> got<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> exactly<00:01:22.350> right<00:01:22.770> it's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
I think you're got it exactly right it's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.630 
I think you're got it exactly right it's
backing<00:01:23.850> into<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.720> danger<00:01:25.290> zone<00:01:25.320> through<00:01:26.040> April

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
backing into a danger zone through April

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.499 
backing into a danger zone through April
that<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.930> create<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.979> think

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
that will really create I think

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.380 
that will really create I think
frustration<00:01:30.509> fresh<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.110> can't<00:01:31.530> even<00:01:31.619> say<00:01:31.740> yeah

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
frustration fresh I can't even say yeah

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
frustration fresh I can't even say yeah
frustration<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.540> stress<00:01:34.200> around<00:01:34.829> those

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
frustration and stress around those

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.969 
frustration and stress around those
things<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.079> are<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.380> close<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.710> we

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
things that we that are so close that we

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.800 
things that we that are so close that we
know<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> want<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.119> right<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
know that we want there right there and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
know that we want there right there and
yet<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> work<00:01:40.590> longer<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.549> have

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
yet we have to work longer at it we have

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.940 
yet we have to work longer at it we have
to<00:01:41.790> work<00:01:41.909> harder<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.920> think

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to work harder at it and and and I think

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.330 
to work harder at it and and and I think
today<00:01:44.340> you're<00:01:45.240> right<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.049> faster<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.130> go

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
today you're right is the faster we go

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.090 
today you're right is the faster we go
the<00:01:47.369> slower<00:01:48.270> things<00:01:48.810> appear<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.890> moving

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the slower things appear to be moving
