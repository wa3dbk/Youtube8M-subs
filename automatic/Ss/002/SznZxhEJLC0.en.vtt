company which is doing a similar stuff

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.549 
company which is doing a similar stuff
and<00:00:34.399> why<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> introduce<00:00:36.239> dislike<00:00:37.050> okay

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and why I want to introduce dislike okay

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.549 
and why I want to introduce dislike okay
first<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:39.000> light<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.660> our<00:00:39.780> eye<00:00:39.809> level<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
first this light to see our eye level is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.760 
first this light to see our eye level is
talking<00:00:41.520> about<00:00:42.440> 95<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.890> very<00:00:44.340> high<00:00:45.350> CRI<00:00:46.350> level

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
talking about 95 is very high CRI level

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.520 
talking about 95 is very high CRI level
so<00:00:46.980> which<00:00:47.190> why<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.969> good<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:49.200> give

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so which why it is good because you give

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
so which why it is good because you give
the<00:00:49.890> CRI<00:00:50.190> level<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.789> actually<00:00:51.149> very<00:00:51.180> high<00:00:51.539> so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the CRI level is actually very high so

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.139 
the CRI level is actually very high so
you<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.199> actually<00:00:52.379> compare<00:00:53.039> like<00:00:53.460> maybe<00:00:53.640> mix

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
you can actually compare like maybe mix

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
you can actually compare like maybe mix
the<00:00:54.809> light<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.590> light<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.340> some

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the light with light with some

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180 
the light with light with some
traditional<00:00:57.210> tungsten<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:58.170> maybe<00:00:58.350> x<00:00:58.530> mi<00:00:58.890> or

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
traditional tungsten or maybe x mi or

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
traditional tungsten or maybe x mi or
maybe<00:00:59.370> frozen<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.059> which<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.870> cannot<00:01:01.289> do

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
maybe frozen like which you cannot do

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
maybe frozen like which you cannot do
also<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.489> having<00:01:02.730> each<00:01:03.000> situation

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
also with not like having each situation

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.230 
also with not like having each situation
this<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.229> color<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.589> shift<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.670> green<00:01:06.000> or

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
this the color is shift to like green or

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.719 
this the color is shift to like green or
magenta<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.350> always<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.250> find<00:01:08.520> out

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
magenta this is always you will find out

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.810 
magenta this is always you will find out
maybe<00:01:09.150> during<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.110> shoots<00:01:10.380> why<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.189> why<00:01:11.580> my

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
maybe during the shoots why my why my

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.630 
maybe during the shoots why my why my
light<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.720> green<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.320> maybe<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.830> magenta

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
light is so green or maybe so magenta

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.630 
light is so green or maybe so magenta
it's<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.110> lights<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
it's just because the lights it's the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.200 
it's just because the lights it's the
the<00:01:18.330> light<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.960> actually<00:01:19.380> shift<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the light is actually shift to do that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749 
the light is actually shift to do that
color<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.530> very<00:01:22.799> hard<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> Libya

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
color and then it's very hard to Libya

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.929 
color and then it's very hard to Libya
to<00:01:23.850> check<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> fool<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.960> maybe<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.939> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
to check it fool like maybe a a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.960 
to check it fool like maybe a a
kilometer<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.470> other<00:01:28.799> than<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.490> also

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
kilometer so other than this and also

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.929 
kilometer so other than this and also
you<00:01:30.180> will<00:01:30.360> find<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:32.130> technology<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
you will find out the technology that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.330 
you will find out the technology that
Loomis<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.049> using<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.680> slightly<00:01:35.040> different

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
Loomis is using is slightly different

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.310 
Loomis is using is slightly different
than<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.880> traditional<00:01:36.090> LED<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
than the traditional LED because the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.429 
than the traditional LED because the
chair<00:01:37.530> additional<00:01:38.100> led<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.640> actually<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.439> pop

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
chair additional led is actually a pop

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.850 
chair additional led is actually a pop
itself<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.240> de<00:01:42.689> Loomis<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.259> using

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
itself but this the de Loomis is using

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
itself but this the de Loomis is using
the<00:01:44.009> l<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.909> IC<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.930> IC<00:01:46.439> lumens<00:01:47.009> LED<00:01:47.520> pop<00:01:48.030> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the l the IC the IC lumens LED pop so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
the l the IC the IC lumens LED pop so
that<00:01:48.630> means<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.020> means<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.100> LED

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that means what that means is the LED

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.149 
that means what that means is the LED
the<00:01:50.939> IC<00:01:51.360> LED<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.930> actually<00:01:52.320> getting<00:01:52.619> more

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the IC LED is actually getting more

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.690 
the IC LED is actually getting more
powerful<00:01:53.610> light<00:01:54.060> than<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.659> LED<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.520> be

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
powerful light than the LED so it can be

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.630 
powerful light than the LED so it can be
affordable<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> put<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.200> light<00:01:58.710> diffuser<00:01:59.310> on

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
affordable to put on a light diffuser on

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.389 
affordable to put on a light diffuser on
top<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.079> put<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.350> light<00:02:01.530> diffuser<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
top so if we put on light diffuser you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.209 
top so if we put on light diffuser you
maybe<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.149> using<00:02:03.360> LED<00:02:03.930> lights<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.409> lot<00:02:05.189> of

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
maybe if you using LED lights a lot of

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.100 
maybe if you using LED lights a lot of
people<00:02:05.340> will<00:02:05.700> become<00:02:05.969> playing<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> ok<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
people will become playing that ok if I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.380 
people will become playing that ok if I
fate<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.799> straightly<00:02:08.280> look<00:02:08.580> through<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
fate if I straightly look through to the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.290 
fate if I straightly look through to the
LED<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.379> I'm<00:02:10.830> I'm<00:02:11.489> feel<00:02:11.910> sick<00:02:12.150> because

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
LED and then I'm I'm feel sick because

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
LED and then I'm I'm feel sick because
this<00:02:12.599> has<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:12.989> many<00:02:13.110> dots

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
this has so many dots

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.830 
this has so many dots
after<00:02:14.160> maybe<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.460> maybe<00:02:14.850> when<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.270> finish<00:02:15.690> the

after maybe a maybe when I finish the

after maybe a maybe when I finish the
shoots<00:02:16.050> be<00:02:16.590> well<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.160> mind<00:02:17.340> into<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.730> eye<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.300> I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
shoots be well in mind into my eye but I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.870 
shoots be well in mind into my eye but I
for<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> defuser<00:02:19.320> it's<00:02:19.980> actually<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.670> did

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
for the defuser it's actually you did

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.000 
for the defuser it's actually you did
you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.750> look<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
you can you just look like you can you

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.860 
you can you just look like you can you
just<00:02:23.250> look<00:02:23.490> through<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> white<00:02:24.330> sheet<00:02:24.660> of

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
just look through to a white sheet of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.440 
just look through to a white sheet of
paper<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.500> then<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:27.090> more

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
paper and then it's it's more

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.020 
paper and then it's it's more
comfortable<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.230> also<00:02:29.010> at<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> same<00:02:29.250> time<00:02:29.730> is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
comfortable and also at the same time is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.410 
comfortable and also at the same time is
if<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.900> put<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.800> diffuser<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.850> top<00:02:33.210> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
if you put on the diffuser on top and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.890 
if you put on the diffuser on top and
then<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.290> will<00:02:34.440> find<00:02:34.710> out<00:02:35.330> when<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.480> put<00:02:36.690> onto

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
then you will find out when you put onto

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.230 
then you will find out when you put onto
to<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.740> background<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.400> will<00:02:38.520> see<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> much

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
to the background you will see a much

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.200 
to the background you will see a much
clearer<00:02:39.750> shadow<00:02:40.440> rather<00:02:41.190> than<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> lot<00:02:42.060> of

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
clearer shadow rather than like a lot of

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.300 
clearer shadow rather than like a lot of
light<00:02:42.540> maybe<00:02:42.690> different<00:02:43.080> shadows<00:02:43.530> around<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
light maybe different shadows around it

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.780 
light maybe different shadows around it
because<00:02:44.510> there<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.780> many<00:02:45.930> LED<00:02:46.500> box<00:02:46.740> in<00:02:47.040> it

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
because there is so many LED box in it

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.240 
because there is so many LED box in it
and<00:02:48.060> other<00:02:48.690> than<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.380> also<00:02:49.830> find

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
and other than that you can also find

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.040 
and other than that you can also find
out<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.000> version<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:51.780> actually

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
out the version that I'm actually

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.220 
out the version that I'm actually
demonstration<00:02:52.770> now<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.160> actually<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:54.230> Debye

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
demonstration now is actually the Debye

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.800 
demonstration now is actually the Debye
color<00:02:55.500> versions<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.100> then<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.690> just

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
color versions and then it's it's just

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.980 
color versions and then it's it's just
like<00:02:58.580> no<00:02:59.580> matter<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.940> they<00:03:00.210> liked<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.600> also

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
like no matter that they liked and also

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.810 
like no matter that they liked and also
tons<00:03:01.290> them<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.890> color<00:03:02.130> temperature<00:03:02.370> is

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
tons them the color temperature is

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.650 
tons them the color temperature is
actually<00:03:03.300> very<00:03:03.360> accurate<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.970> actually

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
actually very accurate and and actually

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.380 
actually very accurate and and actually
efficiency<00:03:07.020> too<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:08.130> if<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.610> want<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.910> know

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
efficiency too so if you want to know

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.780 
efficiency too so if you want to know
more<00:03:09.690> about<00:03:09.750> like<00:03:10.290> maybe<00:03:10.590> these<00:03:10.770> LED<00:03:11.760> lights

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
more about like maybe these LED lights

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.120 
more about like maybe these LED lights
you<00:03:12.330> can<00:03:12.570> actually<00:03:12.810> visit<00:03:13.140> our<00:03:13.710> NS<00:03:14.490> website
