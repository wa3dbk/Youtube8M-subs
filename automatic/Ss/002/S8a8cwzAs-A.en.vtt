 nettheim aquino gta5 has several cars 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.979
 same side so that the gta4 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.979
 front closely resembles a symbol 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.100

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.210
 so on duty here in our series of 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.420

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.790
 You'll see that there's a lot of good stuff. 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.470
 in this car but to put the shield 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.329

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.440
 yellow black 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.440
 I paint the idea of ​​putting 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.360
 a metallic frosted in that means fucking 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.480
 metallic was good 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.629

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.110
 by the side then if that a bug galera that 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.450
 it can be done 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.260
 You can put it on the side, 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.110
 yellow I do not think there's going to be much 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.049
 many changes right? 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.660
