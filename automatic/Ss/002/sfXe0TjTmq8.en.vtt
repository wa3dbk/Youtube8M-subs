got<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> start<00:02:33.610> somewhere<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.320> that's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
got to start somewhere and that's

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.620 
got to start somewhere and that's
actually<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:36.100> motivator<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.300> us<00:02:37.420> to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
actually a motivator to for us to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.020 
actually a motivator to for us to
actually<00:02:37.870> make<00:02:38.260> better<00:02:39.130> content<00:02:39.700> than<00:02:39.910> we've

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
actually make better content than we've

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.410 
actually make better content than we've
ever<00:02:40.240> made<00:02:40.570> before<00:02:40.810> our<00:02:41.740> top<00:02:42.520> priority<00:02:43.090> was<00:02:43.390> to

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
ever made before our top priority was to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.950 
ever made before our top priority was to
was<00:02:44.230> always<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:45.430> make<00:02:45.610> good<00:02:45.850> videos<00:02:45.960> we

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
was always to make good videos we

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.460 
was always to make good videos we
figured<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.500> if<00:02:47.770> we<00:02:47.980> make<00:02:48.190> great<00:02:48.460> content

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
figured that if we make great content

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.110 
figured that if we make great content
then<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.650> money<00:02:50.860> would<00:02:51.040> come<00:02:51.100> eventually<00:02:51.430> and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
then the money would come eventually and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.930 
then the money would come eventually and
that's<00:02:52.810> what<00:02:52.990> we<00:02:53.110> still<00:02:53.350> believe<00:02:53.680> now<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:54.670> want

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
think that this is a step in the right

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.480 
think that this is a step in the right

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
direction and that might be it so I'm

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.700 
direction and that might be it so I'm
