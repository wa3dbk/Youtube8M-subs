00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
portal to go instantly to cabins a time

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.670 
portal to go instantly to cabins a time
so<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.480> faster<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:48.930> easier<00:00:51.230> I'll<00:00:52.230> speed<00:00:52.559> up

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so it's faster and easier I'll speed up

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.220 
so it's faster and easier I'll speed up
the<00:00:52.800> video<00:00:52.920> later<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> portal<00:00:57.230> or

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the video later so this is the portal or

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.060 
the video later so this is the portal or
cabins<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> time<00:01:02.420> I'll<00:01:03.530> speed<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.920> little

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
cabins of time I'll speed it up a little

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.660 
cabins of time I'll speed it up a little
bit<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.540> don't<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.020> wait<00:01:07.170> too<00:01:07.350> much

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
elemental speck to form this wave with

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.449 
elemental speck to form this wave with
like<00:02:11.510> because<00:02:12.510> simply<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:13.040> an<00:02:14.040> ends<00:02:14.250> is

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
going to take a while every every time

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.330 
going to take a while every every time
you<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.299> it<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.630> takes<00:02:18.840> about<00:02:18.989> 14<00:02:19.590> minutes<00:02:19.769> well

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you do it it takes about 14 minutes well

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.099 
you do it it takes about 14 minutes well
for<00:02:20.579> me<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.760> took<00:02:20.940> fourteen<00:02:21.450> minutes<00:02:21.660> per

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
for me it took fourteen minutes per

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.849 
for me it took fourteen minutes per
eighth<00:02:22.410> wave<00:02:23.359> and<00:02:24.359> that<00:02:24.390> includes<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.620> time

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
eighth wave and that includes the time

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.729 
eighth wave and that includes the time
of<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.190> reset<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.959> everything<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.109> every<00:02:28.320> 14

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
of the reset and everything so every 14

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.819 
of the reset and everything so every 14
minutes<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.940> get<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.480> create<00:02:30.690> waves<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.950> gel

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
minutes you get to create waves of a gel

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.280 
minutes you get to create waves of a gel
the<00:02:34.829> waves<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:35.730> spawning<00:02:36.359> here<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.140> is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
the waves are spawning here so this is

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.110 
the waves are spawning here so this is
why<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.500> came<00:02:37.890> all<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.190> way<00:02:38.220> here<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.730> kill<00:02:38.760> them

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
why I came all the way here to kill them

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.910 
why I came all the way here to kill them
now<00:02:39.600> I'm<00:02:39.989> at<00:02:40.470> 6<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.340> 8<00:02:41.850> wave<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.470> seven

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
now I'm at 6 of 8 wave this is the seven
