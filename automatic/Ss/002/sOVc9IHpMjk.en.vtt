00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.379
 I want to tell you something about global warming and I'll take you 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.499
 for that to Kenya 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.480
 we have all heard of the enormous consequences of global warming 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.730
 of the earth has on the lives of the people 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.770
 due to the emission of ceo 2, the earth is now almost one degree celsius warmer than 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.029
 a century ago 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.429
 that seems little but it has major consequences 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.549
 the eleven hottest years ever have been measured over the past twelve years 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 the sea level is tens of centimeters due to the melting of the ice caps 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080
 increased 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
 because Kenya is one of the highest mountains in Africa 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 it has lost more than 92 percent of its snow cover 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.250
 the melt water from the snowy mountain tops that the lower land 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.310
 almost without water 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.430
 The small temperature rise on Earth leaves in some parts of the world 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.960
 heavy rains fall with devastating floods as a result 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.310
 while prolonged periods of drought occur in parts of the world 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.670
 in kenya in the turkana district from the giro one can hardly do more 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.090
 predict when the rules will come 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.270
 people no longer know when to plant the fields 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.550
 harvests are increasingly being lost and it is getting worse for people 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.850
 which are already very different are these changes 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.810
 very radical 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.700
 names that role do you have that tells how important it vs to the discipline ana 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.350
 has also told how difficult it is to get water for their fields and 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.570
 their animals 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.749
 Lander droughts occur more often before they last longer 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.250
 and the rivers also dry up 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.870
 people have to sell their cattle and often and sometimes the party just dies 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.470
 the age-old lifestyle of 30 km h utrecht will disappear forever 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.460
 the diocese of rotterdam has, among other things, the mission office roermond 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.170
 set up projects that help the local population with the changing 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.099
 climate to deal with 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.639
 Water catchment dug dams are being built and wells are being dug 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.579
 so that one has water resources every ever longer periods of drought 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.069
 to bridge 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.059
 in addition, people are taught to earn their money in other ways 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.939
 but that does not eliminate the cause of the problem 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.099
 we have to work with all of them on that, otherwise two billion people will soon 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.099
 on earth suffer the consequences of the water shortage 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:45.269
 halving agriculture rising sea levels and millions of people 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.549
 have to live somewhere else 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.029
 we must do everything to prevent this from happening 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.939
 we must keep the emissions of gases that pollute our air, especially ceo 2 strong 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.419
 Reduce 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.839
 ceo 2 is released when coal and oil use to produce energy 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:07.159
 the cars planes heating electricity and computers 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.250
 The sad thing is that the poorer countries that suffer the most are the 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.400
 climate change are least guilty of ceo 2 emissions 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.919
 a powerful approach is therefore very much needed 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.199
 then all governments of the world must take care of it 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.379
 but we can also contribute to the solution 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.089
 how economical are we with electricity 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.749
 we are not in the shower for too long 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.799
 we cannot cycle more often than always by car 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.339
 They are still dealing with energy contributes to reducing emissions 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.139
 from CEO 2 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.689
