 Yes I can hear the release of the Galaxy s4 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.379
 Yoga is not that a little press play 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.980
 Which of these famous phones will be the next model when it comes to consumer interest 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.260
 How much of an increase there is news sources ago ryeoon down because wonak high doetdago 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.090
 I have not done it right. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:32.669
 So it's not there you that this news we are going to tighten tomorrow. 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.690
 Ah I'm going to score today, so I lived Safety 4 yoreotge eotneunde 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.190
 The most important thing when you go is when a man is important, but this is the first quarter of next year 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.660
 In the second quarter of this year, 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.980
 Yes for each company 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.210
 Apple is expected to accelerate the launch cycle of its flagship products such as Samsung Electronics 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.020
 It's likely. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 Example 1 is reduced will now naseoneun period one year in the second quarter second quarter end 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.980
 It's down to nine months because it's coming out. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.969
 That's how consumers want to change their desire to change quickly . 4 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.769
 This time to advance the release time to catch the village quickly come and go. 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.610
 It's a guess . 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:13.950
 If that's the case, then the fact is that Apple may be in a bit of a crisis . 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.909
 Because Samsung's past has many different schedules, 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.720
 You 've done a lot of things like that, so if that release cycle gets shorter, 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.710
 Samsung seems to be able to use low pressure for that part of the year. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.369
 Every once in a while, the girl came out with a new product . 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.079
 It is natural to say that you are already working on the fact that you are developing in 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.680
 1 I am more interesting these days it rattling past, so anything developed by Samsung 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.329
 I have a lot of rumors in front of me. 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.590
 Nowadays, Samsung does not come out. 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.799
 Apple is rather able to fix this picture so it just comes out at sunrise 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.030
 I see that the designers are Samsung's Gangnam. 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.320
 Yeah the one in Gangnam and engineers are now in the past have worked in Suwon 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.560
 I have to work together. 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.610
 3 I sent the sample to Seoul with a sample 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.740
 4 I watched Suwon, and this is how Jess was exposed like this. 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.380
 I think the designers have come out to answer with a little water and deny it now. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.660
 so 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:14.500
 4 Scarcely Samsung Scarcery is hard to see beyond us, in fact the iPhone 5s 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.700

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:30.040
 Hey when is the time when the new product is 2 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.430
 We, as there is a period of weak consumer product cycle a third time 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.810
 There is such a tragic situation that macy's have a two year cycle to skip 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.470
 Now that we're out of the picture, 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.780
 Okay, and if there is a spare in the worst case with me now 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.819

 The next day I bought an i4 pyrotechnic 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:03.910
 So again, I saw a Mac mini in the wine. 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.910
 I got credit. So part of the church is at 4 o'clock. 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.299
