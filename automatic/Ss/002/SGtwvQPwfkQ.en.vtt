green pumpkin blue flash I really like
the<00:00:43.300> color<00:00:43.510> because<00:00:43.839> it<00:00:43.960> uses<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
the color because it uses the

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.439 
the color because it uses the
traditional<00:00:44.920> green<00:00:45.640> pumpkin<00:00:45.820> colors<00:00:46.330> we've

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
traditional green pumpkin colors we've

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.079 
traditional green pumpkin colors we've
spent<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:47.019> producer<00:00:47.650> for<00:00:47.769> so<00:00:48.010> many<00:00:48.129> years<00:00:48.489> but

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
spent a producer for so many years but

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.360 
spent a producer for so many years but
adds<00:00:49.299> that<00:00:49.479> blue<00:00:49.720> flash<00:00:50.019> in<00:00:50.290> it<00:00:50.409> which

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
adds that blue flash in it which

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.549 
adds that blue flash in it which
crawfish<00:00:51.760> typically<00:00:52.150> have<00:00:52.330> you<00:00:53.140> know<00:00:53.260> on<00:00:53.409> this

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
crawfish typically have you know on this

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.259 
crawfish typically have you know on this
day<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.830> grass<00:00:54.040> was<00:00:54.280> really<00:00:54.580> thick<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.239> I

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
day the grass was really thick so I

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.450 
day the grass was really thick so I
decided<00:00:55.659> to<00:00:55.780> use<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:56.049> 1<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.589> 1/4<00:00:56.799> ounce<00:00:57.040> green

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
decided to use a 1 and 1/4 ounce green

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:07.130 
decided to use a 1 and 1/4 ounce green
pumpkin<00:00:57.699> flipping<00:00:58.210> weight<00:00:58.390> by<00:00:58.659> true<00:00:58.960> tungsten

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.789 

badly<00:01:08.310> sit<00:01:09.310> on<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.520> way<00:01:09.640> down<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.560> point

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
badly sit on the way down on the point

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:26.380 
badly sit on the way down on the point
where<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:11.979> thought<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.250> would<00:01:12.340> be

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.810 

like<00:01:27.620> you<00:01:28.620> know<00:01:28.740> even<00:01:29.040> though<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.160> use<00:01:29.370> a<00:01:29.400> very

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
like you know even though you use a very

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.250 
like you know even though you use a very
heavy<00:01:30.270> weight<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.720> you're<00:01:30.840> flipping<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
heavy weight when you're flipping and

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.590 
heavy weight when you're flipping and
pitching<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:32.190> idea<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.120> lay<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
pitching the idea is to lay them to a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.260 
pitching the idea is to lay them to a
spot<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.170> softly<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.680> possible<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
spot as softly as possible that way it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.969 
spot as softly as possible that way it
provides<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.720> very<00:01:36.750> natural<00:01:37.110> presentation<00:01:37.620> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
provides a very natural presentation to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:51.140 
provides a very natural presentation to
