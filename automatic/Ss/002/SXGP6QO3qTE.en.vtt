00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
everybody does that and of course

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
everybody does that and of course
everybody<00:01:39.420> doesn't<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:40.799> causes

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
everybody doesn't do that what causes

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.100 
everybody doesn't do that what causes
what<00:01:41.490> causes<00:01:42.090> these<00:01:42.240> sleep<00:01:42.479> disorders<00:01:42.930> well

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
what causes these sleep disorders well

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
what causes these sleep disorders well
if<00:01:43.170> we're<00:01:43.290> talking<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:43.680> these<00:01:44.180> parasomnias

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
if we're talking about these parasomnias

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.910 
if we're talking about these parasomnias
sleepwalking<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> lot<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> them

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
sleepwalking and there are a lot of them

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.020 
sleepwalking and there are a lot of them
so<00:01:47.159> there's<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.759> they're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so there's not just one they're

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.020 
so there's not just one they're
sleepwalking<00:01:48.750> sleep-talking<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.250> recognize

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
sleepwalking sleep-talking you recognize

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.719 
sleepwalking sleep-talking you recognize
these<00:01:51.240> night<00:01:51.540> terrors<00:01:52.070> nightmares<00:01:53.070> even<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
these night terrors nightmares even and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
these night terrors nightmares even and
then<00:01:54.090> REM<00:01:54.360> behavior<00:01:54.509> disorder<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.500> strange

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
then REM behavior disorder the strange

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.440 
then REM behavior disorder the strange
thing<00:01:56.130> where<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> act<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:56.939> dreams

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
thing where you act out your dreams

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510 
thing where you act out your dreams
which<00:01:57.719> sounds<00:01:58.110> something<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.950> we've

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
which sounds something like what we've

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.240 
which sounds something like what we've
been<00:01:59.670> hearing<00:01:59.729> about<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.439> these<00:02:01.770> very

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
been hearing about all of these very

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.370 
been hearing about all of these very
dangerous<00:02:02.820> very<00:02:03.060> dangerous<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.170> should

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
dangerous very dangerous so that should

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.429 
dangerous very dangerous so that should
be<00:02:04.409> understood<00:02:05.399> right<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> beginning

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
be understood right from the beginning

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.630 
be understood right from the beginning
it's<00:02:07.439> hard<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.740> know<00:02:07.860> what<00:02:08.039> causes<00:02:08.280> them

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it's hard to know what causes them

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
it's hard to know what causes them
there's<00:02:08.879> definitely<00:02:09.420> genetic<00:02:09.869> factors

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
there's definitely genetic factors

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.710 
there's definitely genetic factors
familial<00:02:10.950> factors<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.610> aside<00:02:11.879> from<00:02:11.940> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
familial factors but aside from that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.270 
familial factors but aside from that
I'd<00:02:12.840> say<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.170> most<00:02:13.320> important<00:02:13.860> things<00:02:14.070> are

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
I'd say the most important things are

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.100 
I'd say the most important things are
sleep<00:02:14.580> deprivation<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.570> if<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.780> deprive

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
sleep deprivation so if you deprive

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.330 
sleep deprivation so if you deprive
yourself<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.040> an<00:02:17.160> abnormal

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
yourself or you have an abnormal

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.880 
yourself or you have an abnormal
schedule<00:02:18.150> you're<00:02:18.630> likely<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.020> rebound<00:02:19.590> into

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
schedule you're likely to rebound into

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.860 
schedule you're likely to rebound into
one<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.280> those<00:02:20.400> stages<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.060> deep<00:02:21.300> sleep<00:02:21.510> or

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
one of those stages the deep sleep or

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.480 
one of those stages the deep sleep or
the<00:02:21.960> REM<00:02:22.140> sleep<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.400> those

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
the REM sleep and have one of those

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.280 
the REM sleep and have one of those
events<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:24.150> waking<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.810> during<00:02:24.990> those<00:02:25.230> events

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
events or waking up during those events

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.710 
events or waking up during those events
so<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:25.980> example<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.120> real<00:02:27.390> sleep

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
so for example if you have a real sleep

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.260 
so for example if you have a real sleep
disorder<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.290> sleep<00:02:28.560> apnea<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.000> middle

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
disorder like sleep apnea in the middle

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.050 
disorder like sleep apnea in the middle
of<00:02:30.420> deep<00:02:30.990> sleep<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.770> can<00:02:31.980> start<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.880> one

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
of deep sleep you can start to have one

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.340 
of deep sleep you can start to have one
of<00:02:33.180> these<00:02:33.270> events<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.900> they<00:02:34.080> could<00:02:34.230> be

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
of these events and they could be

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.600 
of these events and they could be
dangerous<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.860> yourself<00:02:34.950> or<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.460> others

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
dangerous to yourself or to others

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.790 
dangerous to yourself or to others

people around you I want to quickly talk
about<00:02:37.860> treatment<00:02:38.490> we<00:02:38.580> saw<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.940> mike<00:02:39.180> has

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
about treatment we saw that mike has

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.970 
about treatment we saw that mike has
resorted<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.960> sleeping<00:02:40.290> with<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.410> sleeping<00:02:40.830> bag

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
resorted to sleeping with a sleeping bag

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.620 
resorted to sleeping with a sleeping bag
admittance<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:41.670> he<00:02:41.790> doesn't<00:02:41.970> harm<00:02:42.420> himself

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
admittance so he doesn't harm himself

admittance so he doesn't harm himself
taking<00:02:43.200> pills<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:44.460> pretty<00:02:44.670> drastic<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.209> that

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
taking pills it's pretty drastic is that

taking pills it's pretty drastic is that
is<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> only<00:02:45.900> solution<00:02:46.380> well<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.950> know

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
is that the only solution well the know

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.670 
is that the only solution well the know
is<00:02:47.370> again<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.390> start<00:02:48.750> from<00:02:48.900> making<00:02:49.590> the
