00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 diop hi to all people it's xenon 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.040
 today we are on gta 5 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.990
 for a new video so this time 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.119
 here I am going to show you how to get 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.439
 a vehicle that can be played in a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.689
 solo mission but we can more 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.770
 then found anyway I do not 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.259
 am never falling back on it so it 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.989
 this is the tow truck so the 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.669
 tow truck that lets you do stuff 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.559
 funny enough especially one even if you 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.219
 get to the online shop 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.989
 never found 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.460
 but it was the case of several 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.019
 americans so i think that's 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.879
 possible to see it just need to 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.660
 go at the right time so to find 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.850
 this tow truck 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.949
 it will go to the north of the map 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.690
 so it's east two pallets 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.489
 aubin when you arrive on the highway 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.829
 you will have some kind of small tunnel to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.870
 left that will lead a kind of village 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.879
 shantytowns actually there are houses in 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.559
 hard and next to the tents with 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.960
 caddies end it's a little village 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.149
 clodo so once you'll be there 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.530
 you'll just have to go to the bottom of 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.330
 this village so next to a house 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.020
 having some kind of barns and in this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.610
 mini barn 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.720
 I call it a barn but actually 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.730
 it's just a fucking wooden garage 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 in short, in this wooden garage there 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.130
 will have the tow truck that you can 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.390
 then recover to be able to take 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.290
 vehicles with because that's it 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.480
 who will be interesting 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.030
 it will be necessary to approach and lower 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.290
 a little bit the crane at the back with the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.540
 right stick so normally there is nothing 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.460
 else to do if you approach a 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.890
 decent speed with the crane well 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.510
 dropped you should be able to catch a 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.500
 car like that without having more 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.310
 of actions to do that will be done 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.010
 automatically 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.600
 so I made this solo video 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.250
 but what can be interesting 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.690
 it's in multi to return to the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.910
 city ​​and to catch like that the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.860
 supportive supersportives who lives books in 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.090
 station and on the road to go for 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.230
 to rob a bank or finally a 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.500
 bank their store my bullshit like 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.090
 it 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.260
 you arrive with two tow trucks 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.140
 you steal their cars and 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.340
 break with it's funny after the guy 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.810
 who will run after you for 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.720
 hours to recover his cash 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.340
 well, that's what I hope for 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.320
 that this video would have been useful 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.020
