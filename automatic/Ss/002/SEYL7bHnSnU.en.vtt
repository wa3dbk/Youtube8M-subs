00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
after I was working on my beast Buster's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.109 
after I was working on my beast Buster's
board<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.039> for<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:20.160> beast<00:00:20.369> Buster's<00:00:20.699> board<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
board and for my beast Buster's board I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.050 
board and for my beast Buster's board I
cranked<00:00:21.510> up<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.140> +5<00:00:22.439> volts<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:23.970> I

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
cranked up the the +5 volts to see if I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.429 
cranked up the the +5 volts to see if I
could<00:00:24.119> get<00:00:24.300> more<00:00:24.510> sound<00:00:24.840> out<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.380> it

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
could get more sound out of it and it

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.019 
could get more sound out of it and it
sounded<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.890> little<00:00:26.099> bit<00:00:26.310> more<00:00:26.550> sound<00:00:26.789> was

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
here and we're gonna crank this thing

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
here and we're gonna crank this thing
the<00:01:15.450> other<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:15.840> we're<00:01:16.080> gonna<00:01:16.170> turn<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.590> down

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the other way we're gonna turn it down

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.600 
the other way we're gonna turn it down
and<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:19.530> should<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.950> putting<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.490> don't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and this should be putting out I don't

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
and this should be putting out I don't
know<00:01:20.880> maybe<00:01:21.470> roughly<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> little<00:01:22.619> bit<00:01:22.950> less

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
know maybe roughly a little bit less

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.469 
know maybe roughly a little bit less
than<00:01:23.369> 5<00:01:23.820> volts<00:01:24.619> but<00:01:25.619> let's<00:01:26.400> try<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.670> now<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
than 5 volts but let's try this now and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
than 5 volts but let's try this now and
see<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.229> let's<00:01:29.130> kill<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> lights

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
see what we get let's kill the lights

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:38.310 
see what we get let's kill the lights
again<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:31.579> turn<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.700> thing<00:01:32.909> back<00:01:33.090> on

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.510 

and<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.860> should<00:01:40.159> come<00:01:40.369> up<00:01:40.430> green<00:01:40.820> now<00:01:41.979> yep<00:01:42.979> so

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
and that should come up green now yep so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.149 
and that should come up green now yep so
as<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.820> can<00:01:43.909> see<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.299> 63<00:01:44.840> will<00:01:45.140> come<00:01:45.409> up<00:01:45.530> red

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
as you can see you 63 will come up red

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.990 
as you can see you 63 will come up red
if<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.970> +5<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:48.110> turned<00:01:48.950> out<00:01:49.100> too<00:01:49.400> high<00:01:49.640> and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
if the +5 is turned out too high and

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.700 
if the +5 is turned out too high and
that's<00:01:50.570> something<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:51.080> I<00:01:51.140> just<00:01:51.170> figured<00:01:51.560> out

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
that's something that I just figured out

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.969 
that's something that I just figured out
here<00:01:52.130> by<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.360> know<00:01:53.479> having<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.740> +5

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
here by you know having the the +5

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.740

you know I'll turn it on one more time
in<00:02:19.069> this<00:02:19.519> this<00:02:20.150> state<00:02:20.450> here<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.250> it'll<00:02:22.250> come

in this this state here and it'll come

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.229 
in this this state here and it'll come
up<00:02:22.430> green<00:02:23.950> we'll<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.130> go<00:02:25.280> until<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.760> hits<00:02:26.000> you

crank up the +5 and we'll turn this on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:50.259 
crank up the +5 and we'll turn this on
again<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:42.320> will<00:02:42.709> pop<00:02:42.920> up<00:02:42.980> red<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.940> as<00:02:50.150> you

can see right there and with you 63

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.840 
can see right there and with you 63
being<00:02:53.329> red<00:02:53.660> it'll<00:02:54.560> read<00:02:54.739> as<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> bad<00:02:55.190> ROM<00:02:55.489> it'll

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
being red it'll read as a bad ROM it'll

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.509 
being red it'll read as a bad ROM it'll
still<00:02:56.120> work<00:02:56.390> but<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.799> graphics<00:02:58.280> will<00:02:58.400> be

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
still work but the graphics will be

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.729 
still work but the graphics will be
glitched<00:02:58.820> up<00:02:59.030> bad<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.660> the<00:03:00.440> game<00:03:00.590> will

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
glitched up bad and the game will

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.259 
glitched up bad and the game will
actually<00:03:00.769> lock<00:03:01.310> up<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.670> bit<00:03:01.850> here<00:03:02.030> I'll<00:03:02.120> show

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
actually lock up a bit here I'll show

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.610 
actually lock up a bit here I'll show
you<00:03:02.299> what<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.570> mean<00:03:03.310> here<00:03:05.049> try<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.260> start<00:03:06.470> this

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
you what I mean here try and start this

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.620 
you what I mean here try and start this
thing<00:03:06.859> up<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.310> ROM<00:03:08.209> chips<00:03:08.450> bad<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.630> the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
thing up is ROM chips bad and the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.180 
thing up is ROM chips bad and the
beginning<00:03:11.989> here<00:03:12.200> we'll<00:03:12.380> have<00:03:12.530> missing<00:03:13.010> music

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
beginning here we'll have missing music

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.030 
beginning here we'll have missing music
and<00:03:13.700> they'll<00:03:14.630> be<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.810> little<00:03:15.260> bit<00:03:15.470> glitched<00:03:15.829> up

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
and they'll be a little bit glitched up

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.120 
and they'll be a little bit glitched up
at<00:03:16.700> least<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.030> was<00:03:17.150> last<00:03:17.390> time<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:17.980> we'll<00:03:18.980> see

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
at least it was last time so we'll see

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
at least it was last time so we'll see

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.900 
voltage that you put on them so if you
have<00:04:25.850> au<00:04:26.000> 63<00:04:26.900> air<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.500> keeps<00:04:27.740> popping<00:04:28.190> up<00:04:28.280> you

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
have au 63 air that keeps popping up you

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.990 
have au 63 air that keeps popping up you
know<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.210> looks<00:04:29.360> like<00:04:29.539> it's<00:04:29.750> semi<00:04:30.500> working<00:04:31.039> but

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
know it looks like it's semi working but

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.909 
know it looks like it's semi working but
it's<00:04:32.120> glitched<00:04:32.419> out<00:04:32.630> before<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.680> start

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
it's glitched out before you start

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.800 
it's glitched out before you start
messing<00:04:34.039> around<00:04:34.280> with<00:04:34.490> stuff<00:04:34.760> just<00:04:35.510> try<00:04:35.750> and

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
messing around with stuff just try and

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.580 
messing around with stuff just try and
crank<00:04:36.080> down<00:04:36.289> the<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:37.699> +5<00:04:38.210> bolts<00:04:38.810> on<00:04:38.960> there<00:04:39.199> it

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
crank down the the +5 bolts on there it

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.469 
crank down the the +5 bolts on there it
might<00:04:39.770> be<00:04:39.949> an<00:04:40.490> issue<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.970> other<00:04:41.090> way<00:04:41.210> around

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
might be an issue the other way around

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.210 
might be an issue the other way around
as<00:04:41.630> well<00:04:41.660> if<00:04:42.110> you<00:04:42.289> don't<00:04:42.440> have<00:04:42.620> enough<00:04:42.830> voltage

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
as well if you don't have enough voltage

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.850 
as well if you don't have enough voltage
going<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.729> it<00:04:43.910> it's<00:04:44.539> a<00:04:44.810> might<00:04:45.470> do<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.710> same

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
going to it it's a might do the same

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.140 
going to it it's a might do the same
thing<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.160> don't<00:04:46.220> know<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.430> didn't<00:04:46.729> try<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:46.940> with

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
thing I don't know I didn't try it with

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.730 
thing I don't know I didn't try it with
the<00:04:47.270> voltage<00:04:47.600> all<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.810> way<00:04:47.900> turned<00:04:48.139> down<00:04:48.320> but

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
the voltage all the way turned down but

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.830 
the voltage all the way turned down but
yeah<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:50.060> little<00:04:50.150> tip<00:04:50.389> here<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:50.630> thought

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
yeah just a little tip here I thought

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.270 
yeah just a little tip here I thought
that<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.080> could<00:04:51.320> share<00:04:51.530> with<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.770> guys<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:52.130> help

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
that I could share with you guys to help

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.580 
that I could share with you guys to help
you<00:04:52.430> out<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.810> as<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:53.900> can<00:04:54.020> see<00:04:54.080> here<00:04:54.440> with

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
you out and as you can see here with

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.500 
you out and as you can see here with
this<00:04:54.710> processing<00:04:55.310> chip<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.789> went<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.240> put

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
this processing chip I went and I put

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.040 
this processing chip I went and I put
some<00:04:57.169> epoxy<00:04:58.039> well<00:04:58.460> some<00:04:58.820> some<00:04:59.270> similar<00:04:59.750> kind

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
some epoxy well some some similar kind

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.930 
some epoxy well some some similar kind
of<00:05:00.169> epoxy<00:05:00.740> resin<00:05:01.070> around<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.400> outside<00:05:01.759> of<00:05:01.789> it

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
of epoxy resin around the outside of it

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.969 
of epoxy resin around the outside of it
to<00:05:02.060> keep<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.389> chip<00:05:02.599> in<00:05:02.720> place<00:05:02.860> haven't<00:05:03.860> had

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
to keep that chip in place haven't had

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.560 
to keep that chip in place haven't had
one<00:05:04.220> problem<00:05:04.610> with<00:05:04.760> this<00:05:04.880> since<00:05:05.090> I<00:05:05.180> did<00:05:05.389> that

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
one problem with this since I did that

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.589 
one problem with this since I did that
so<00:05:05.900> it's<00:05:06.590> working<00:05:06.860> out<00:05:06.949> great<00:05:07.130> but<00:05:08.000> it's

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
so it's working out great but it's

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.000 
so it's working out great but it's
figured<00:05:08.810> I'd<00:05:08.930> share<00:05:09.080> that<00:05:09.139> with<00:05:09.380> you<00:05:09.470> guys<00:05:09.500> and

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
figured I'd share that with you guys and

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.620 
figured I'd share that with you guys and
that's<00:05:10.550> about<00:05:10.699> all<00:05:10.880> for<00:05:10.910> me<00:05:11.150> for<00:05:11.180> right<00:05:11.479> now

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
that's about all for me for right now

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.480 
that's about all for me for right now
like<00:05:12.289> always<00:05:12.530> I'll<00:05:12.800> put<00:05:12.979> up<00:05:13.010> another<00:05:13.220> video

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
like always I'll put up another video

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:46.860 
like always I'll put up another video
here<00:05:13.699> soon<00:05:13.940> so<00:05:14.270> thanks<00:05:15.229> for<00:05:15.380> watching
