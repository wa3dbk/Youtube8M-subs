00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.700
 I have first defeat of the season for 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.560
 he ruled an area until the ninetieth 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.600
 he had practically managed to get out 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.609
 unscathed even here on the field of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.020
 Bassano leaders have touched on a 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 another half miracle considering also 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.310
 the general condition of the team 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.539
 I ask her how much regret there is though 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.070
 they also look at how many 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.080
 satisfied however the proof of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 team and the team can not be 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.980
 canceled by one minute 2 minutes then 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.020
 these guys did another one 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 masterpiece another miracle even 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.210
 recover in numerical inferiority 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.180
 and normal that I had to unbalance 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.870
 vascular I remained then unlike 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.149
 the last 15 minutes with 5 Jun Four 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.090
 players who are four forwards 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.760
 more cucciniello who was a fullback and 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.670
 a midfielder then out of 10 out of nine 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.369
 movement players or 54 were 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.130
 strikers and one was a midfielder 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.390
 that they were in a defensive phase is normal 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.790
 that we had recovered the game 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.939
 through substitutions through i 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.060
 fields so there was great satisfaction 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.590
 but this certainly cannot be 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.439
 covered by a goal taken at 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.189
 ninety-second even in a causal manner 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.320
 because of panariello has spit the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.170
 ball and left out of position 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.750
 and Pisans who were on the trajectory 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.470
 but I mean there is great regret it is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.810
 normal you split everything to get 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.720
 of the results of recoveries make you 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
 play every three days I think I a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.740
 man's memory I don't remember a team a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.500
 professional level I have 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.610
 played so many close matches 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.610
 but honestly 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.330
 we respect all decisions and normal 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.549
 which is not good to lose in this 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.140
 way because with the frankness that there is 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.790
 distinguishes until we have 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.830
 there was only one area in the middle of the right 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.740
 field ie the art came with 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.399
 personality to maneuver to cover everyone 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.649
 the spaces 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.239
 then we took this goal in the cold it is 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.720
 normal that I had to unbalance the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.209
 team 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.739
 the mass team always tidy up 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.500
 when also said that it was not done 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.209
 an acer is out here i ask her how much 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.290
 angry at the expulsion of directors 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.580
 also that of millesi then from 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.560
 bench of two other players who 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.600
 they will miss much more angry about the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.940
 expulsion directors of the milles that the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.459
 defeat maybe you don't believe me much 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.350
 maybe you'll learn to know me 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.269
 I am much more angry about this than that 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.190
 have a defeat and doing however a 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.569
 general budget 12 points however one 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.010
 yield that went beyond the most optimistic 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.330
 now important expectations a 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.150
 metabolize this defeat e 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.900
 leave but we have been defeated 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.519
 we were not a losers 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.190
 very very important 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.709
 and normal we had done another 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.150
 miracle is normal that enthusiasm 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.130
 But it would be even more increased this 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.859
 now it must not make us demoralize the 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.410
 football is this and must be accepted accepted 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.100
 in all the components in all 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.810
 situations 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.880
 certainly for what we have 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.959
 product for the efforts made not 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.640
 we deserved to lose 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.130
 unfortunately this is the 92nd football 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.320
 91st I don't know now we lost 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.720
 unbeaten we lost one 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.200
 game where we were once again 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.109
 acam at 11 in varying it and suffering 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.609
 up to the limit of our crazy and with 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.130
 the visit of this match that was 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.049
 characterized we say from the divorce between 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.700
 the art and the federico diesse here are the 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.540
 asks for a comment on this one too 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.040
 corporate turnaround 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.750
 I repeat with extreme frankness 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.200
 federico for me was a person who has 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.130
 worked in a remarkable way for the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.730
 cause of the art 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.069
 then why is it not my job to 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.049
 he left but I can say he has 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.450
 worked seriously with great honesty and 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.680
 prepare with great spirit of sacrifice 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.900
 new sports director for what 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.780
 but I do the coach I do 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.209
 the coach and I think I do it well 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.680
 with great commitment and with great challenge of 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.800
 sacrifice you must not do these 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.800
 questions to me ie a property thank you
