00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.349
 since we are in bologna 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.289
 physical force 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.289
 I make myself feel like a bologna morning 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.119
 all these machines all these salon organs 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.379
 they were also built in northern Europe 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.510
 from Italy to 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.070
 over above pd germany 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.210
 Holland 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.030
 twitter eastern countries exempt from this especially Swiss 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.770
 to build these machines there are in one character 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.210
 which is not the relative one 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.770
 character 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.570
 check valves built by hand slowly this is a lavorar 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.010
 bad trieste bus that it was the electric saw for which 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.020
 cagliari texts and ropes with photos 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.240
 - bologna in about 1850 in the area of ​​piazza 8 agosto of the current square 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.230
 constructive concert giovanni was 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.090
 which he left 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.190
 a beautiful history of musical machines has unfortunately not left the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.000
 his story has disappeared nobody knows anything 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.410
 I only know that it exists in this John Frog 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.330
 why 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.390
 quardia col di lana habitat concert rione forgieri 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 which when he saw 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 today this role. over a hundred years 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.100
 at 20 30 years old this machine and business in dialect is laughing at you 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.170
 meat sauce 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.050
 stamp of the coffee machine to defend 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.770
 translated pierino bolognesi is the machine that my father built in 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.980
 square 8 August 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.180
 why the mysky denis more piergiovanni rate 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.830
 yes because in my opinion in the 800 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.720
 he worked as a young frog 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.319
 and now he tells you now I'll show you 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.380
 an important I have a photo 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.490
 intellipoker of the end of 800 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.479
 where the mushroom pope is depicted 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.529
 This 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.869
 and the uncle who both work as Giovanni Rana and this photo is taken 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.809
 on a melodic plane 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.310
 in this position of course only curved glass plate machines 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.759
 and so seen this picture is made with 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.319
 in this position 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.249
 then it was he who told me these things 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.399
 otherwise it went unnoticed because 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.519
 fast dishes of girls that are many 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.729
 if you find around, they are much sought after because 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.399
 I had a curious feature 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.909
 they worked with perforated cardboard that you see gold reductively 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.739
 and now you are working 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.900
 this perforated cardboard try to imagine that these out 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.839
 match amoti music 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:00.119
 the strange thing is that I would be able to make my weather holes in the cars for 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.309
 fix our opinions are out of tune heard 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:08.029
 xp problem is the pd the curious fact the important thing is that these holes do not 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.489
 are made at the head 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.279
 but try to make you first with which first 100 points tt cry not harmonies but how 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.519
 do ludovico bbc here is the head of these characters 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.469
 giovanni racchia 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.179
 I said constructive these extraordinary streams 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:25.359

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.059
 photo sharing 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.129
 you can make any of these 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.179
 modern 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.179
 up to the end of the 800 this to say above 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.039
 if he went to a table like this here after someone's cost 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.179
 that seem almost like game plans 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.649
 score things his photos are 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.649
 el of the end 800 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 perforated actor passes when the brain 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.429
 he returned to monale hahaha 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.429

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.399
 we were 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.719

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.740
 look believe we can say the Bolognese and bologna wine 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.249
 see our city because it is so 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:42.689
 Athanaton 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.440
