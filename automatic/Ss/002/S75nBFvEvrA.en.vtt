this dish but let's get into the
strawberry<00:01:45.640> shortcakes<00:01:46.299> we<00:01:47.140> sliced<00:01:47.619> our

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
strawberries and to the strawberries we

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.889 
strawberries and to the strawberries we
added<00:01:50.679> a<00:01:50.770> third<00:01:51.039> cup<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.399> sugar<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.270> these

added a third cup of sugar and these

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.870 
added a third cup of sugar and these
have<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.350> sit<00:01:53.679> because<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.249> sugar<00:01:54.549> really

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
have to sit because the sugar really

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.539 
have to sit because the sugar really
makes<00:01:55.359> this<00:01:55.689> all<00:01:55.899> come<00:01:56.439> together<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:57.100> sweet

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
makes this all come together and sweet

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.149 
makes this all come together and sweet
but<00:01:58.179> it<00:01:58.299> also<00:01:58.479> is<00:01:58.689> what's<00:01:59.020> called<00:01:59.259> maceration

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
but it also is what's called maceration

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.779 
but it also is what's called maceration
and<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:01.329> maceration<00:02:02.109> allows<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:03.280> liquid

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
and that maceration allows the liquid

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.209 
and that maceration allows the liquid
allows<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.719> sweetness<00:02:05.229> that's<00:02:05.409> naturally

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
allows the sweetness that's naturally

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.609 
allows the sweetness that's naturally
from<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.700> strawberries<00:02:07.359> to<00:02:07.899> blend<00:02:08.229> with<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.410 
from the strawberries to blend with the
sugar<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:08.979> we<00:02:09.160> added<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.880> we<00:02:10.060> need<00:02:10.390> that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
sugar that we added and we need that

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.930

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.259 

and<00:03:46.260> now<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.319> texture<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.069> this<00:03:48.220> dough<00:03:48.549> should

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
and now the texture to this dough should

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.630 
and now the texture to this dough should
be<00:03:49.480> just<00:03:49.900> moistened<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.830> if<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.190> see<00:03:51.430> that
