00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609 
report series here at Thunder Valley and
I<00:00:15.240> probably<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.690> another<00:00:15.960> three<00:00:16.320> hours<00:00:16.590> in

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
I probably have another three hours in

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.650 
I probably have another three hours in
the<00:00:16.770> game<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.130> probably<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.910> don't<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.300> six<00:00:18.570> or

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the game so probably I don't know six or

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.140 
the game so probably I don't know six or
seven<00:00:18.960> total<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:20.400> I'm<00:00:20.490> definitely<00:00:20.640> still<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
seven total so I'm definitely still a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.840 
seven total so I'm definitely still a
rookie<00:00:21.650> but<00:00:22.650> trying<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> improve<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> think

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
rookie but trying to improve and I think

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.340 
rookie but trying to improve and I think
I've<00:00:23.939> improved<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.480> bit<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.050> i<00:00:25.080> figured

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
I've improved a little bit so i figured

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.720 
I've improved a little bit so i figured
it's<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> good<00:00:25.619> time<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.640> i'm

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it's a good time to do this and i'm

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.429 
it's a good time to do this and i'm
actually<00:00:26.849> doing<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> time<00:00:27.599> trial<00:00:27.930> now<00:00:28.140> so

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
actually doing it as a time trial now so

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.050 
actually doing it as a time trial now so
i<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.680> press<00:00:28.800> Y<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.310> it'll<00:00:29.490> resent<00:00:29.849> me<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
i can press Y and it'll resent me to

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.640 
i can press Y and it'll resent me to
here<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.840> I'm<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.109> do<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.349> until<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
here and I'm going to do that until I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.799 
here and I'm going to do that until I
get<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> lap<00:00:32.279> without<00:00:32.520> crashing<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.750> least

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
get a lap without crashing or at least

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.010 
get a lap without crashing or at least
any<00:00:34.140> bad<00:00:34.440> crashes<00:00:34.920> anything<00:00:35.430> totally<00:00:35.579> stupid

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
any bad crashes anything totally stupid

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
any bad crashes anything totally stupid
and<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.440> try<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> move<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.489> from<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:38.760> next

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and then try to move on from there next

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.130 
and then try to move on from there next
time<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> same<00:00:39.660> thing<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.020> hopefully

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
time do the same thing and hopefully

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.590 
time do the same thing and hopefully
we'll<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.620> cutting<00:00:41.040> down<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.309> our<00:00:41.399> lap

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
we'll just be cutting down on our lap

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.520 
we'll just be cutting down on our lap
that's<00:00:42.600> what's<00:00:42.780> cool<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.260> because

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that's what's cool about this is because

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
that's what's cool about this is because
it'll<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> lap<00:00:44.610> time<00:00:44.850> involved<00:00:45.450> in

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it'll will have a lap time involved in

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420 
it'll will have a lap time involved in
that<00:00:45.780> whatever<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.710> we'll<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.010> able<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> kind

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that whatever so we'll be able to kind

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.529 
that whatever so we'll be able to kind
of<00:00:47.460> build<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> plan<00:00:50.420> let<00:00:51.420> me

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
of build on so that's the plan let me

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.730 
of build on so that's the plan let me
know<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
know what you think of

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.830 
know what you think of
let<00:00:54.280> me<00:00:54.340> know<00:00:54.430> what<00:00:54.550> you<00:00:54.610> think<00:00:54.790> of<00:00:55.030> this

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
let me know what you think of this

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.570 
let me know what you think of this
format<00:00:56.320> versus<00:00:56.650> me<00:00:56.800> just<00:00:57.010> going<00:00:57.220> around<00:00:57.310> and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
format versus me just going around and

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.370 
format versus me just going around and
playing<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:58.120> doing<00:00:58.390> a<00:00:58.570> couple<00:00:58.810> laps<00:00:58.840> and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
playing and doing a couple laps and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.490 
playing and doing a couple laps and
that's<00:00:59.830> that<00:01:00.100> I<00:01:01.030> almost<00:01:01.930> didn't<00:01:02.350> do<00:01:02.470> a

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
that's that I almost didn't do a

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.740 
that's that I almost didn't do a
commentary<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.370> was<00:01:03.580> just<00:01:03.700> going<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.910> do<00:01:04.120> it<00:01:04.270> go

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
commentary I was just going to do it go

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.360 
commentary I was just going to do it go
until<00:01:04.930> you<00:01:05.200> get<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.410> Lap<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.800> want<00:01:06.010> and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
until you get the Lap that I want and

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.520 
until you get the Lap that I want and
post<00:01:06.610> it<00:01:06.760> but<00:01:07.060> that's<00:01:07.750> kind<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.170> defeats<00:01:08.530> the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
post it but that's kind of defeats the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.900 
post it but that's kind of defeats the
purpose<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:09.070> this<00:01:09.130> i<00:01:09.430> know<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.610> lot<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.820> people

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
purpose of this i know a lot of people

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.670 
purpose of this i know a lot of people
in<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.270> past<00:01:10.420> haven't<00:01:10.780> liked<00:01:11.020> things<00:01:11.320> that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
in the past haven't liked things that

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.250 
in the past haven't liked things that
I've<00:01:11.800> done<00:01:11.830> without<00:01:12.280> commentary<00:01:13.260> for

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
I've done without commentary for

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.040 
I've done without commentary for
whatever<00:01:14.560> reason<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.640> anyway<00:01:16.570> that's<00:01:16.840> that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
whatever reason so anyway that's that

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.190 
whatever reason so anyway that's that
Mike<00:01:17.920> goes<00:01:18.130> back<00:01:18.790> there<00:01:19.060> had<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> little

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
Mike goes back there had a little

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.050 
Mike goes back there had a little
trouble<00:01:20.500> but<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.160> think<00:01:21.550> it's<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.730> three<00:01:22.030> minute

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
trouble but I think it's a three minute

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.860 
trouble but I think it's a three minute
last<00:01:22.540> time<00:01:23.010> 301<00:01:24.010> actually<00:01:24.550> so<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:25.090> think<00:01:25.660> if<00:01:25.750> we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
last time 301 actually so I think if we

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.480 
last time 301 actually so I think if we
beat<00:01:26.050> this<00:01:26.260> it'd<00:01:26.560> be<00:01:26.680> nice<00:01:26.860> if<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.160> could<00:01:27.190> beat

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
beat this it'd be nice if we could beat

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.469 
beat this it'd be nice if we could beat
that<00:01:27.520> ghost<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.930> would<00:01:29.050> put<00:01:29.260> us<00:01:29.290> into<00:01:29.620> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that ghost and it would put us into the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.230 
that ghost and it would put us into the
sub<00:01:31.479> 3<00:01:32.110> minute<00:01:32.500> range<00:01:33.040> and<00:01:33.520> that'd<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.210> a

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
sub 3 minute range and that'd be a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.900 
sub 3 minute range and that'd be a
really<00:01:34.660> cool<00:01:34.960> just<00:01:35.470> benchmark<00:01:36.040> you<00:01:36.280> know<00:01:36.400> it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
really cool just benchmark you know it's

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.370 
really cool just benchmark you know it's
like<00:01:37.000> okay<00:01:37.330> now<00:01:37.510> we<00:01:37.570> got<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.869> be<00:01:37.960> beaten<00:01:38.140> that

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
like okay now we got to be beaten that

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:47.780 
like okay now we got to be beaten that
you<00:01:38.680> know<00:01:39.510> we'll<00:01:40.510> see<00:01:40.660> we'll<00:01:40.900> see

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.150 

I<00:01:47.910> usually<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.570> take<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.960> line<00:01:49.230> there<00:01:50.040> we

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
I usually don't take that line there we

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.950 
I usually don't take that line there we
go<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.550> worked<00:01:50.760> it<00:01:51.000> worked<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
go it worked it worked so this is the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
go it worked it worked so this is the
spot<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.440> I<00:01:52.740> struggle<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> most<00:01:53.280> this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
spot that I struggle with the most this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.750 
spot that I struggle with the most this
step<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.180> triple<00:01:54.620> is<00:01:55.620> kind<00:01:55.980> of<00:01:56.100> hard<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.520> can

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
step up triple is kind of hard you can

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.070 
step up triple is kind of hard you can
see<00:01:57.000> ah<00:01:58.280> man<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.570> need<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.900> take<00:02:01.050> a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
see ah man I really need to take a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.420 
see ah man I really need to take a
different<00:02:01.290> angle<00:02:01.830> through<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.400> I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
different angle through there when I

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.450 
different angle through there when I
jump<00:02:02.760> it<00:02:03.320> I'm<00:02:04.320> actually<00:02:04.560> gonna<00:02:04.800> go<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
jump it I'm actually gonna go with this

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.499 
jump it I'm actually gonna go with this
because<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:07.560> struggled<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.509> that's

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
because I really struggled there that's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.810 
because I really struggled there that's
one<00:02:09.750> spot<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.020> I'm<00:02:10.320> for<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.070> it's<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:11.490> okay

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
one spot that I'm for now it's like okay

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.780 
one spot that I'm for now it's like okay
I'll<00:02:11.970> deal<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.390> deal<00:02:12.990> with<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> crash<00:02:13.790> and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I'll deal with a deal with a crash and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.340 
I'll deal with a deal with a crash and
we<00:02:15.030> won't<00:02:15.120> even<00:02:15.330> call<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.690> crash<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:15.990> was

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
we won't even call that a crash that was

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.900 
we won't even call that a crash that was
just<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.740> sweet<00:02:17.400> tricky<00:02:17.910> Oh<00:02:19.520> anyway<00:02:20.520> that's<00:02:20.730> my

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
just a sweet tricky Oh anyway that's my

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.220 
just a sweet tricky Oh anyway that's my
hardest<00:02:21.330> section<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.870> clear<00:02:22.110> that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
hardest section you have to clear that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.390 
hardest section you have to clear that
step<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.590> triple<00:02:22.850> just<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.300> cleanly<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.470> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
step up triple just so cleanly and I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
step up triple just so cleanly and I
struggle<00:02:26.820> with<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.090> too<00:02:27.570> because<00:02:27.990> if<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.230> /

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
struggle with that too because if we /

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.320 
struggle with that too because if we /
jump<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:28.950> our<00:02:29.250> case<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:29.910> really<00:02:30.120> hard<00:02:30.270> to

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
jump in our case it's really hard to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.530 
jump in our case it's really hard to
make<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> corner<00:02:30.900> Oh<00:02:31.850> tough<00:02:32.850> luck<00:02:33.000> come<00:02:33.390> on

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
make the corner Oh tough luck come on

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.940 
make the corner Oh tough luck come on
got<00:02:34.350> through<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.560> pretty<00:02:34.709> quick

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.580

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
I'm obviously trying to just get better

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.830 
I'm obviously trying to just get better
and<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.610> not<00:03:00.819> leaning<00:03:01.120> back<00:03:01.269> saying<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.629> knew

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
and the not leaning back saying I knew

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.199 
and the not leaning back saying I knew
it<00:03:02.019> but<00:03:02.290> I've<00:03:02.890> kind<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.310> taught<00:03:03.879> me<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> lot

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
it but I've kind of taught me a lot

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.970 
it but I've kind of taught me a lot
about<00:03:04.269> how<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.959> get<00:03:05.230> through<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.709> track

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
about how to get through the track

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.580 
about how to get through the track
mainly<00:03:06.970> through<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.269> rough<00:03:07.480> stuff<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:08.290> what

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
mainly through the rough stuff is what

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.229 
mainly through the rough stuff is what
I've<00:03:08.709> struggled<00:03:08.980> with<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.579> now<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.940> I'm<00:03:10.060> not

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
I've struggled with and now that I'm not

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.940 
I've struggled with and now that I'm not
trying<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.569> lean<00:03:10.720> back<00:03:10.930> through<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.349> all<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.799> it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
trying to lean back through it all of it

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.390 
trying to lean back through it all of it
it's<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.610> little<00:03:12.790> bit<00:03:12.880> easier<00:03:13.860> case<00:03:14.860> there<00:03:15.190> but

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
it's a little bit easier case there but

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.509 
it's a little bit easier case there but
I'll<00:03:15.489> go<00:03:15.670> with<00:03:15.819> it<00:03:17.099> sometimes<00:03:18.099> I<00:03:18.190> go<00:03:18.340> down

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
I'll go with it sometimes I go down

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.339 
I'll go with it sometimes I go down
there<00:03:19.319> rough<00:03:20.319> into<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:20.650> corner<00:03:21.040> Oh

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.750 

kind<00:03:26.349> of<00:03:26.379> blue<00:03:26.590> both<00:03:26.799> those<00:03:27.040> ruts<00:03:27.370> but<00:03:27.579> we'll

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
kind of blue both those ruts but we'll

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.610 
kind of blue both those ruts but we'll
go<00:03:27.879> with<00:03:27.909> it<00:03:28.239> be<00:03:28.510> nice<00:03:28.659> to<00:03:28.720> try<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.079> finish<00:03:29.290> this

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
go with it be nice to try to finish this

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:42.910 
go with it be nice to try to finish this
and<00:03:29.890> not<00:03:29.980> crash

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.670 

big<00:03:43.920> crash<00:03:44.190> oh<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:45.300> just<00:03:45.630> didn't<00:03:45.990> crash<00:03:46.170> not<00:03:46.470> bad

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
big crash oh I just didn't crash not bad

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.780 
big crash oh I just didn't crash not bad
not<00:03:46.950> bad<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:49.410> don't<00:03:49.770> see<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.950> lap<00:03:50.220> time<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:50.760> I

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
not bad so I don't see a lap time and I

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.180 
not bad so I don't see a lap time and I
think<00:03:50.970> it's<00:03:51.060> because<00:03:51.210> I<00:03:51.750> went<00:03:52.710> off<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.950> track

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
think it's because I went off the track

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.080 
think it's because I went off the track
but<00:03:54.860> probably<00:03:55.860> should<00:03:56.010> feel<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.520> can<00:03:56.790> tell

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
but probably should feel I can tell

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.150 
but probably should feel I can tell
through<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:58.170> youtube<00:03:58.470> video<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.800> that'll

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
through the youtube video and that'll

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.130 
through the youtube video and that'll
tell<00:03:59.310> me<00:03:59.430> I'll<00:03:59.670> post<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.570> screen<00:04:00.780> or

tell me I'll post it on the screen or
whatever<00:04:01.830> when<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.040> figured<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.520> out<00:04:02.640> when<00:04:03.450> I

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
whatever when I figured it out when I

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.410 
whatever when I figured it out when I
edit<00:04:03.750> video<00:04:04.050> but<00:04:04.290> that's<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.370> lap<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.910> little<00:04:06.300> bit

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
edit video but that's a lap a little bit

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.540 
edit video but that's a lap a little bit
of<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.540> crash<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.170> then<00:04:07.260> off<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.010> whatever

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
of a crash and then off and whatever

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.970 
of a crash and then off and whatever
else<00:04:08.640> but<00:04:09.140> i'm<00:04:10.140> getting<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.500> little<00:04:10.530> bit<00:04:10.800> better

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.510 
and i think it's a good step in the
right<00:04:12.990> direction<00:04:13.140> but<00:04:13.560> again<00:04:13.890> let<00:04:14.280> me<00:04:14.340> don't
