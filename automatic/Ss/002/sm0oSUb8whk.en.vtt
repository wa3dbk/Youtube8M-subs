00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.680
 these people here with another nuclear 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.359
 gameplay commentary and yes there is today 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.250
 again a little comments with 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.930
 a six against six team on it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.369
 villa backed many I think 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.869
 I have not uploaded for a while 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.449
 I can not remember me 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.269
 and me the enns politician really nice 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.059
 to the 50 zloty around 66 team man 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.250
 actually pretty nice and yes there is 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.430
 some information today 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.320
 black ops 2 or to the pc version of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 black ops for two years it was about that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.440
 I stand before think 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.969
 three walls even more 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.649
 Weeks, the net was about this 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.770
 version spoken and now there is 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.110
 today again some news about it and what 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.879
 we'll see right now so it works 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.399
 first at least 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.140
 system requirements and separately 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.820
 there as operating system at least 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.510
 windows vista with the second service 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 pack an intel core duo as a processor 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.700
 two gigabytes of RAM 432 theme 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.659
 or 4 GB of RAM for 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.430
 14 45 and 64 bit operating systems my 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.080
 I have goodness now and as 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.000
 graphics card nvidia geforce 8800 gt so 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.740
 The system requirements are quite a bit 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.710
 gone up why no windows 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.020
 xp is supported is completely 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.030
 easy to explain and although you have off 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.759
 some reasons or different 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.920
 founding on a graphics engine tells 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.549
 x11 used 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.950
 and there the new x11 and 10 for windows 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.009
 xp was developed and only for 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.860
 vista and windows 7 is available 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.020
 shut windows xp out as an operating system 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.090
 so who else as sugar windows xp 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.369
 has installed there is still there 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.790
 some must now for black ops 2 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.299
 upgrade to vista or windows 7 resp 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.420
 then soon windows 8 yes why did 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.590
 one resorted to a dx11 engine 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.509
 that's easy because it offers 11 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.510
 much better performance so it 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.700
 makes quasi for the same quality 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.409
 less services is that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.480
 result much better actually still 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.090
 So the quality is even better with 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.239
 less performance loss 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.040
 So just a good step in the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.560
 right direction you have more power 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.379
 you have more 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.049
 more results for less pure 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.120
 so it looks like this 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.549
 whole game is also pity x10 too 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.190
 play 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.420
 However, there is not extreme 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.480
 as far as I do not put you each 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.730
 hardware support but stop there before 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.730
 supported everything as far as I know so 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.780
 he could not choose what she was free 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.859
 I would definitely use it now 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.540
 Update the xl fact and the graphic 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.450
 was also improved a lot 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.829
 the hunt with the pc development team and 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.840
 Although there should be significant improvements in 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.730
 then things scotch give then 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.959
 very important to pia leißing that's yes 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.609
 the weakness of the console 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.470
 the pc players always have it 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.420
 last time suffered but pia 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.730
 leißing therefore be much stronger 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.290
 Blum effects depth of field and still 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.180
 other features but not mentioned 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.949
 because they still seem to be in the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.199
 development what exactly that is 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.340
 I can not tell you unfortunately 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.379
 we have to wait 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.750
 The fine ones are possible in larger ones 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.849
 I like to play resolutions like 1080p 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.260
 White can do that in black ops possible 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.910
 was in any case is also has one 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.120
 higher resolution can be like the consoles 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.470
 and of course there is no limit 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.209
 you can take so many pictures per second 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.489
 have as you want 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.060
 Although there is a small regulator of 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.199
 but also a view of no border 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.940
 but set it nevertheless when you to 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.739
 example only will play with 80 frame 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.940
 for example not the complete pc 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.949
 let out 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.620
 although 80 films actually full 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:57.810
 rich in seconds and yes there can 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.250
 you put a limit because also 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.659
 actually quite nice is primarily the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.560
 Also good for the youtube commentators 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:07.829
 who are playing on a pc because it is 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.169
 sometimes hear frames per second and yes 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.000
 so you can limit yourself to 60 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.220
 usually better quality 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.729
 offer or simply 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.900
 record more stable so hear the whole 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.269
 look good on it 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.150
 furthermore , there was still league play for 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.180
 the pc yes so not confirmed as at 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.910
 elite 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.860
 a console feature just no it will 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.669
 be available for the pc on what i have 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.320
 very good 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.870
 and then there was talk of 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.669
 an anti-technology itself 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.190
 was developed so has access 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.160
 black ops 2 no longer on wrc by steam 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.320
 thomas wolfe back but relies on 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.139
 his own anti technology which i 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.520
 really good think what really 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.110
 very few developers then do where 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.660
 I do not really do so 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.060
 As far as I know, that's right 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.800
 back to tape basta and here cod it 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.599
 always has to wrc from steam 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.460
 used but good 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.680
 then there were still some 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.660
 Information announced shortly 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.610
 we should go to technology and stuff 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.150
 further and to the new features times 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.639
 watch 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.500
 if there is new information there 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.599
 will you hear this from me immediately? 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.699
 So subscribe to update every now and then 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.080
 look in and the other side always 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.669
 up to date 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.380
 the gameplay is already so good 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.320
 how over I hope you like and 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.580
 if yes also gives off like 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.360
 and yes I hope belong and again at 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.360
 look at it next time
