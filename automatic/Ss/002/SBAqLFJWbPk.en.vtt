kinds<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.500> setups<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.430> let's<00:00:32.610> say<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> have

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
kinds of setups is that let's say I have

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.500 
kinds of setups is that let's say I have
two<00:00:33.809> dmx<00:00:34.489> chains<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.360> two

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
two dmx chains right and I have two

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
two dmx chains right and I have two
wireless<00:00:36.920> your<00:00:37.920> receivers<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.399> I'm<00:00:38.489> doing

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
wireless your receivers and I'm doing

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.119 
wireless your receivers and I'm doing
the<00:00:38.820> X<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.329> mean<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.950> can

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the X I mean I can do one here and I can

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.280 
the X I mean I can do one here and I can
do<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:42.329> great<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.050> what<00:00:43.170> does

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
do one there that's great but what does

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.720 
do one there that's great but what does
if<00:00:43.379> I'm<00:00:43.469> doing<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.829> example<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.219> call<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
if I'm doing for example we call the I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
if I'm doing for example we call the I
the<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> set<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> got<00:00:45.870> two<00:00:46.110> beams<00:00:46.289> one

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the I set up you got two beams one

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.290 
the I set up you got two beams one
across<00:00:46.950> well<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.520> gonna<00:00:47.640> need<00:00:47.850> more<00:00:48.000> than<00:00:48.059> two

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
across well I'm gonna need more than two

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330 
across well I'm gonna need more than two
because<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.230> put<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.770> either<00:00:49.980> end

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
because if not I put one on either end

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
because if not I put one on either end
and<00:00:50.640> ultimately<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.329> still<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> run<00:00:51.899> DMX

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and ultimately we still have to run DMX

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.310 
and ultimately we still have to run DMX
cable<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.760> way<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.149> another<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.110> want

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
cable back one way or another and I want

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.560 
cable back one way or another and I want
to<00:00:55.379> run<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.620> little<00:00:55.949> DMX<00:00:56.370> cable<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.850> possible

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
to run as little DMX cable as possible

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.200 
to run as little DMX cable as possible
another<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.590> gonna<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.550> for<00:01:00.000> my

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
another thing is I'm gonna just for my

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.869 
another thing is I'm gonna just for my
own<00:01:00.239> sanity<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.190> DMX

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
own sanity I want to use this little DMX

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.850 
own sanity I want to use this little DMX
or<00:01:03.000> Wireless<00:01:03.420> DMX<00:01:03.600> receivers<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.350> possible

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
or Wireless DMX receivers as possible

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.920 
or Wireless DMX receivers as possible
not<00:01:05.309> because<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.670> hasn't<00:01:05.880> been<00:01:06.030> stable<00:01:06.869> or

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
not because it hasn't been stable or

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
not because it hasn't been stable or
anything<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.280> need<00:01:08.430> other

things<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.110> satellite<00:01:10.500> light<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.979> we

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
things we have satellite light so we

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.100 
things we have satellite light so we
have<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.939> lighting<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.540> other<00:01:12.689> things<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.080> I

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
have up lighting on other things that I

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.420 
have up lighting on other things that I
need<00:01:13.350> those<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.710> receivers<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
need those little receivers are the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.060 
need those little receivers are the
transceivers<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> solution

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
transceivers for so what is the solution

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130 
transceivers for so what is the solution
to<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.670> able<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.000> create<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> nice<00:01:18.600> big<00:01:18.869> setup

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
over the dance floor and only use one to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.050 
over the dance floor and only use one to
receive<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.600> run<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.320> less<00:01:22.619> DMX<00:01:23.250> cable

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.429 
we've got six out and of course we got a
DMX<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.479> actually<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.409> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
DMX in so you can actually use this as a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
DMX in so you can actually use this as a
wife<00:01:43.829> light<00:01:44.130> transmitter<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.149> receiver<00:01:45.390> so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
wife light transmitter or a receiver so

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.940 
wife light transmitter or a receiver so
now<00:01:46.140> you've<00:01:46.320> got<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> lot<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.829> different

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
options or you have to use Wi-Fi you may

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.230 
options or you have to use Wi-Fi you may
just<00:01:49.290> need<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> regular<00:01:50.009> splitter<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.970> guys

it now the great thing about this

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.090 
it now the great thing about this
particular<00:01:53.670> unit<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.720> compact<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
particular unit is that it is compact it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.730 
particular unit is that it is compact it
is<00:01:56.210> IEC<00:01:57.210> versus<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.659> world<00:01:57.899> war<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.530> you're

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
is IEC versus a world war so if you're

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.760 
is IEC versus a world war so if you're
using<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.100> IC<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.490> ICS<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.630> easier<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.500> then

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
using the IC to ICS much easier and then

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.370 
using the IC to ICS much easier and then
you've<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:02.159> built-in<00:02:02.670> velcro<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.140> you're

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you've got built-in velcro so you're

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.520 
you've got built-in velcro so you're
hanging<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> inside<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.610> truss<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.380> just

hanging it inside your truss and just
take<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:08.190> come<00:02:08.459> out<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.200> there<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.379> go

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
take that now come out and there you go

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.980 
take that now come out and there you go
you<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.770> hang<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.310> there<00:02:11.489> tight

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
you just hang it in there tight

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.940 
you just hang it in there tight
and<00:02:12.290> you're<00:02:12.620> good<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.220> go<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.660> again<00:02:14.950> super
