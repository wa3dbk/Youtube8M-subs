00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
we could say on track and you know I get

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.420 
we could say on track and you know I get
this<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> lot<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> great<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.309> all

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
this a lot it's a great one we all

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.600 
this a lot it's a great one we all
suffer<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.180> problem<00:00:42.629> too<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
suffer with this problem too it's the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.549 
suffer with this problem too it's the
main<00:00:45.149> thing<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> try<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:45.960> consistently

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
main thing is to try and consistently

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.600 
main thing is to try and consistently
carry<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.100> math<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.940> trickiest<00:00:48.450> part

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
carry on math that's the trickiest part

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.189 
carry on math that's the trickiest part
that<00:00:50.610> part<00:00:50.940> along<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.780> would<00:00:51.960> say<00:00:52.140> start

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that part along with I would say start

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.770 
that part along with I would say start
in<00:00:52.680> signs<00:00:52.980> always<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> tricky<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.390> while

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
in signs always a tricky one so while

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
in signs always a tricky one so while
done<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.170> actually<00:00:55.469> starting<00:00:56.039> that's<00:00:56.219> really

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
done for actually starting that's really

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
done for actually starting that's really
good<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:57.090> could<00:00:57.239> be<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.360> few<00:00:57.570> factors<00:00:58.050> really

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
good there could be a few factors really

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.779 
good there could be a few factors really
didn't<00:00:58.770> dive<00:00:58.949> into<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.520> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.539> email<00:01:00.870> enough

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
didn't dive into it in the email enough

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
didn't dive into it in the email enough
for<00:01:02.789> me<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> exactly<00:01:03.899> describe<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
think of just a few months doing evil

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.289 
think of just a few months doing evil
think<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.650> long<00:01:40.799> through<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> years<00:01:41.939> so

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
think of like long through the years so
