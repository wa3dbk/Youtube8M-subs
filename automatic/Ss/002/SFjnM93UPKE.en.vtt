00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 the stretch marks are annoying and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.240
 unsightly marks on the skin that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.250
 appear in certain areas of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 our body as a result of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.330
 hormonal imbalances or how 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.870
 consequence of increasing or gaining weight 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.180
 abruptly these marks appear both 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 in men as women and there are periods 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.289
 key to our life as the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.199
 adolescence in those who have older 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.420
 probabilities of suffering in general 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.670
 we are the women we have 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.160
 greater chances of them appearing 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.469
 because we are more vulnerable to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 hormonal changes and changes in 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.690
 weight as for example during 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 pregnancies that are and how the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.020
 stretch marks 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 although our skin is very elastic and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 has the possibility to stretch 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.070
 quite when changes occur 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.320
 abrupt weight this is overloaded 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.570
 and the usual production of collagen does not 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.600
 it's enough to pace these 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.000
 processes the collagen is the main 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.980
 responsible for the connective tissues of 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.739
 the skin and if it can not accompany 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 our changes the fabric breaks and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.409
 as a result they appear 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.090
 these scars called stretch marks 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.310
 Some areas of the body have greater 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.180
 predisposition for the appearance of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.450
 stretch marks like hips thighs buttocks 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.030
 and all the abdominal contour however 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.220
 The good news is that stretch marks do not 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 they arise in the skin from one day to the other 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 and there is a time when they can 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.170
 stop or diminish yes we know 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.090
 recognize them in time at the beginning they look 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.700
 as a thin line and color 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.979
 purple or violet more like a 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.649
 spill this is because they still have 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 blood irrigation this is the moment 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.479
 indicated to take action in this regard 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.479
 and apply some type of moisturizer 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.600
 or anti-stretch mark cream to prevent the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.149
 break tissue then take a color 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.310
 pink and later they become 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.160
 nacre color when they have reached this 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.250
 point is almost impossible to get rid of 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.619
 them at this time the stretch marks no longer 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.720
 they will leave our body for what it is 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.790
 really important to apply the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.990
 treatments in the first phase of the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.060

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.510
 with injections in turn tend to be 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.970
 much more economical than 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.300
