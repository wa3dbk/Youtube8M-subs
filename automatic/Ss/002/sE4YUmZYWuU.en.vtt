00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
hi welcome to today's video today we're

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.740 
hi welcome to today's video today we're
to<00:00:07.160> be<00:00:07.279> talking<00:00:07.640> about<00:00:07.670> doing<00:00:08.059> strips<00:00:08.389> and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
to be talking about doing strips and

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.330 
to be talking about doing strips and
what<00:00:09.290> we're<00:00:09.379> going<00:00:09.500> to<00:00:09.530> be<00:00:09.620> doing<00:00:09.770> is<00:00:10.010> using<00:00:10.160> a

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
what we're going to be doing is using a

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.910 
what we're going to be doing is using a
glass<00:00:10.549> strip<00:00:11.000> cutter<00:00:11.270> these<00:00:12.170> cutters<00:00:12.469> will<00:00:12.799> do

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
glass strip cutter these cutters will do

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.650 
glass strip cutter these cutters will do
strips<00:00:13.250> as<00:00:13.400> well<00:00:13.430> as<00:00:13.699> circle<00:00:14.090> circles<00:00:14.510> we're

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
strips as well as circle circles we're

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.240 
strips as well as circle circles we're
going<00:00:14.779> to<00:00:14.840> cover<00:00:14.959> in<00:00:15.139> a<00:00:15.170> different<00:00:15.199> video<00:00:15.590> but

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
going to cover in a different video but

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.040 
going to cover in a different video but
today<00:00:16.520> we're<00:00:16.640> talking<00:00:16.760> about<00:00:16.970> strips<00:00:17.420> so

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
today we're talking about strips so

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.529 
today we're talking about strips so
basically<00:00:18.560> as<00:00:18.740> Tripp<00:00:18.949> is<00:00:19.100> is<00:00:19.640> a<00:00:19.699> parallel<00:00:20.330> line

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
basically as Tripp is is a parallel line

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.329 
basically as Tripp is is a parallel line
so<00:00:20.839> if<00:00:20.990> you're<00:00:21.140> making<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:21.500> box<00:00:21.740> where<00:00:22.130> you<00:00:22.189> need

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:22.339 
so if you're making a box where you need

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.650 
so if you're making a box where you need
to<00:00:22.460> have<00:00:22.550> four<00:00:22.849> sides<00:00:23.089> that<00:00:23.330> are<00:00:23.359> all<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.539> same

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
to have four sides that are all the same

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.960 
to have four sides that are all the same
size<00:00:24.140> if<00:00:24.830> you're<00:00:25.039> doing<00:00:25.220> a<00:00:25.279> window<00:00:25.640> you've<00:00:25.939> got

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
size if you're doing a window you've got

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.960 
size if you're doing a window you've got
border<00:00:26.570> or<00:00:26.689> you<00:00:26.839> know<00:00:27.050> all<00:00:27.320> sizes<00:00:27.679> I<00:00:27.949> this<00:00:28.789> is

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
border or you know all sizes I this is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.029 
border or you know all sizes I this is
for<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.179> four<00:00:29.329> identical<00:00:29.960> this<00:00:30.560> tool<00:00:30.859> will

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
for the four identical this tool will

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.830 
for the four identical this tool will
not<00:00:31.070> only<00:00:31.310> save<00:00:31.579> you<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.759> lot<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:31.970> time<00:00:32.300> but

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
not only save you a lot of time but

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.319 
not only save you a lot of time but
everything<00:00:33.230> will<00:00:33.350> be<00:00:33.470> perfectly<00:00:33.920> accurate<00:00:34.329> so

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
everything will be perfectly accurate so

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.800 
everything will be perfectly accurate so
this<00:00:36.170> is<00:00:36.410> my<00:00:37.130> particular<00:00:37.400> favorite<00:00:38.330> strip

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
this is my particular favorite strip

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.470 
this is my particular favorite strip
cutters<00:00:39.110> made<00:00:39.290> by<00:00:39.440> glass<00:00:39.620> star<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:41.180> find<00:00:41.420> it

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
cutters made by glass star and I find it

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.380 
cutters made by glass star and I find it
really<00:00:41.600> easy<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:41.960> use<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:43.370> comes<00:00:43.610> with<00:00:43.820> six

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
really easy to use it comes with six

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.120 
really easy to use it comes with six
wheels<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:44.990> you<00:00:45.110> start<00:00:45.350> off<00:00:45.530> using<00:00:45.740> wheel

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
wheels so you start off using wheel

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.770 
wheels so you start off using wheel
number<00:00:46.310> one<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:46.910> progress<00:00:47.090> all<00:00:47.480> your<00:00:47.630> way

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
number one and you progress all your way

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.780 
number one and you progress all your way
around<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.770> number<00:00:49.070> six<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:49.580> know

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
around to to number six so you know

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.180 
around to to number six so you know
exactly<00:00:50.090> how<00:00:50.420> many<00:00:50.590> sharp<00:00:51.590> wheels<00:00:51.830> you<00:00:52.040> have

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
exactly how many sharp wheels you have

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.640 
exactly how many sharp wheels you have
left<00:00:52.460> these<00:00:53.270> are<00:00:53.480> just<00:00:53.720> steel<00:00:53.990> wheels<00:00:54.290> as

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
left these are just steel wheels as

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.440 
left these are just steel wheels as
opposed<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.070> carbide<00:00:55.520> but<00:00:55.700> they<00:00:55.790> will<00:00:56.000> last<00:00:56.180> a

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
opposed to carbide but they will last a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.020 
opposed to carbide but they will last a
long<00:00:56.630> time<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.250> as<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.310> matter<00:00:58.430> of<00:00:58.520> fact<00:00:58.700> we<00:00:58.850> sell

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
long time so as a matter of fact we sell

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.630 
long time so as a matter of fact we sell
hundreds<00:00:59.450> of<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.690> actual<00:01:00.140> strip<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.130> circle

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
hundreds of the actual strip and circle

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.910 
hundreds of the actual strip and circle
cutters<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.120> very<00:01:02.570> few<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:02.990> the<00:01:03.080> actual<00:01:03.410> turrets

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
cutters a very few of the actual turrets

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.740 
cutters a very few of the actual turrets
so<00:01:04.430> you'll<00:01:04.790> find<00:01:04.939> that<00:01:05.059> you<00:01:05.180> have<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.479> replace

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
so you'll find that you have to replace

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.260 
so you'll find that you have to replace
this<00:01:05.960> very<00:01:06.200> infrequently<00:01:07.189> it<00:01:08.090> has<00:01:08.240> a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
this very infrequently it has a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.149 
this very infrequently it has a
graduation<00:01:08.869> along<00:01:09.289> here<00:01:09.530> although<00:01:09.799> I<00:01:09.829> don't

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
graduation along here although I don't

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.859 
graduation along here although I don't
personally<00:01:10.399> use<00:01:11.060> this<00:01:11.240> I'll<00:01:11.479> show<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:11.719> how<00:01:11.840> I

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
personally use this I'll show you how I

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.459 
personally use this I'll show you how I
use<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.170> ruler<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:13.670> measure<00:01:13.850> mine<00:01:14.119> my

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
use a ruler to to measure mine my

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.709 
use a ruler to to measure mine my
dimensions<00:01:15.469> a<00:01:15.560> little<00:01:15.740> more<00:01:15.859> accurately<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:17.390> a

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
dimensions a little more accurately so a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.330 
dimensions a little more accurately so a
really<00:01:18.170> good<00:01:18.320> base<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:18.950> for<00:01:19.100> cutting

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
really good base for it for cutting

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.489 
really good base for it for cutting
strips<00:01:19.579> is<00:01:19.819> if<00:01:19.969> you<00:01:20.090> supply<00:01:20.390> with<00:01:20.719> 3/4<00:01:21.380> inch

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
strips is if you supply with 3/4 inch

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.160 
strips is if you supply with 3/4 inch
plywood<00:01:21.799> good<00:01:22.549> one<00:01:22.729> side<00:01:22.999> is<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.420> really<00:01:24.020> all

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
plywood good one side is is really all

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.380 
plywood good one side is is really all
you<00:01:24.319> need<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:25.069> piece<00:01:25.310> is<00:01:25.520> two<00:01:25.700> feet<00:01:25.880> by<00:01:26.090> three

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
you need this piece is two feet by three

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.649 
you need this piece is two feet by three
feet

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
feet

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.410 
feet
most<00:01:27.499> of<00:01:27.649> our<00:01:27.770> glass<00:01:27.979> is<00:01:28.009> is<00:01:28.579> usually<00:01:28.939> two<00:01:29.149> feet

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
most of our glass is is usually two feet

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.749 
most of our glass is is usually two feet
wide<00:01:30.289> so<00:01:30.619> that's<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.039> really<00:01:31.249> good<00:01:31.369> dimension

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
wide so that's a really good dimension

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.910 
wide so that's a really good dimension
to<00:01:31.880> work<00:01:32.030> with<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.509> then<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.409> get<00:01:33.499> a<00:01:33.560> one<00:01:33.770> by

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
to work with and then you get a one by

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.590 
to work with and then you get a one by
two<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.159> nice<00:01:34.399> straight<00:01:34.729> one<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:34.969> you<00:01:35.179> screw<00:01:35.509> it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
two a nice straight one and you screw it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.230 
two a nice straight one and you screw it
down<00:01:35.749> so<00:01:36.679> it's<00:01:36.799> firmly<00:01:37.100> attached<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:37.999> one

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
down so it's firmly attached to the one

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.830 
down so it's firmly attached to the one
side<00:01:39.189> I'm<00:01:40.189> going<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.579> be<00:01:40.700> running<00:01:40.999> this<00:01:41.450> tool

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
side I'm going to be running this tool

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.870 
side I'm going to be running this tool
along<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.380> edge<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:42.889> I<00:01:43.130> have<00:01:43.639> seen

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
along the edge of this I have seen

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.249 
along the edge of this I have seen
people<00:01:44.299> where<00:01:44.450> they'd<00:01:44.569> have<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.869> cutter<00:01:45.079> on

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
people where they'd have the cutter on

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.690 
people where they'd have the cutter on
this<00:01:45.409> side<00:01:45.619> obviously<00:01:46.069> going<00:01:46.280> along<00:01:46.520> the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
this side obviously going along the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.499 
this side obviously going along the
inside<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.389> find<00:01:48.109> that<00:01:48.259> having<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.920> space<00:01:49.509> and

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
inside I find that having that space and

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.980 
inside I find that having that space and
going<00:01:50.899> along<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.200> outside<00:01:51.350> as

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
going along the outside as

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.679 
going along the outside as
much<00:01:52.200> better<00:01:52.380> situation<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:54.030> let's<00:01:54.299> pretend<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
much better situation so let's pretend I

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.109 
much better situation so let's pretend I
wanted<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:55.470> inch<00:01:55.790> border<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
wanted to do a two inch border for a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.850 
wanted to do a two inch border for a
window<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.049> course<00:01:58.229> I'm<00:01:58.350> using<00:01:58.530> clear

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
window and of course I'm using clear

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.230 
window and of course I'm using clear
blue<00:01:59.100> chip<00:01:59.310> glass<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.090> it's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
blue chip glass just because it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.749 
blue chip glass just because it's
inexpensive<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.899> handy<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.640> use

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
inexpensive and handy but you can use

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
inexpensive and handy but you can use
this<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.030> cut<00:02:03.149> opalescent<00:02:03.750> glass<00:02:03.780> since<00:02:04.290> you

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this to cut opalescent glass since you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.230 
this to cut opalescent glass since you
have<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.950> through<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> once<00:02:05.909> we've<00:02:06.090> made

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
have to see through it once we've made

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
have to see through it once we've made
the<00:02:06.450> made<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> proper<00:02:07.560> adjustments<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.940 
wanted to do a two inch border I'm going
to<00:02:15.390> take<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.630> ruler<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.650> ruler<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
to take a ruler and this ruler is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.190 
to take a ruler and this ruler is
excellent<00:02:17.430> as<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.640> actually<00:02:17.790> has<00:02:18.200> it's

got<00:03:38.610> three<00:03:38.819> pieces<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.269> are<00:03:39.450> exactly<00:03:40.200> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
got three pieces that are exactly the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.770 
got three pieces that are exactly the
same<00:03:40.620> height<00:03:41.269> there's<00:03:42.269> no<00:03:42.450> variation

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
same height there's no variation

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.890 
same height there's no variation
whatsoever<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:44.340> if<00:03:45.150> something<00:03:45.569> is<00:03:45.659> going<00:03:45.810> to

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
whatsoever so if something is going to

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.360 
whatsoever so if something is going to
be<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.019> round<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.349> size<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.830> slightly<00:03:47.099> bigger

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
be a round of size it is slightly bigger

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.009 
be a round of size it is slightly bigger
slightly<00:03:47.940> smaller<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:48.540> really<00:03:48.750> going<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.930> be

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
slightly smaller it's really going to be

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.470 
slightly smaller it's really going to be
acceptable<00:03:49.500> if<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.610> has<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.819> be<00:03:50.849> an<00:03:50.970> exact<00:03:51.239> size

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
acceptable if it has to be an exact size

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.309 
acceptable if it has to be an exact size
then<00:03:51.659> you're<00:03:51.750> gonna<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:51.989> be<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> little

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
then you're gonna have to be a little

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.140 
then you're gonna have to be a little
more<00:03:52.379> cautious<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:53.010> your<00:03:53.159> sizing<00:03:53.579> this

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
more cautious with your sizing this

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.000 
more cautious with your sizing this
works<00:03:54.390> really<00:03:54.599> well<00:03:54.840> for<00:03:54.900> as<00:03:55.409> I<00:03:55.650> mentioned

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
works really well for as I mentioned

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.979 
works really well for as I mentioned
jewelry<00:03:56.280> boxes<00:03:56.730> or<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.180> borders<00:03:57.510> on<00:03:57.690> Windows

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
jewelry boxes or the borders on Windows

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.069 
jewelry boxes or the borders on Windows
if<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:59.040> wanted<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.370> do<00:03:59.459> mosaic<00:03:59.970> work<00:04:00.209> you're

going to want to cut a narrower piece so

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.160 
going to want to cut a narrower piece so
again<00:04:04.739> we<00:04:04.890> loosen<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.519> off<00:04:05.730> let's<00:04:06.720> go<00:04:06.900> for<00:04:07.140> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
again we loosen that off let's go for a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.890 
again we loosen that off let's go for a
half<00:04:07.349> inch<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:07.920> we'll<00:04:08.160> go<00:04:08.310> down<00:04:08.540> we'll<00:04:09.540> adjust

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
half inch so we'll go down we'll adjust

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.370 
half inch so we'll go down we'll adjust
this<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.349> half<00:04:10.560> an<00:04:10.769> inch<00:04:11.629> tighten<00:04:12.629> our<00:04:12.900> screw

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.569 

the<00:04:16.380> only<00:04:16.590> thing<00:04:16.769> that's<00:04:16.949> really<00:04:17.100> important

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
the only thing that's really important

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.979 
the only thing that's really important
is<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:17.970> actually<00:04:18.180> have<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:18.570> straight

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
is that you actually have a straight

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.620 
is that you actually have a straight
edge<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.199> start<00:04:19.739> off<00:04:19.919> with<00:04:20.359> so<00:04:21.359> if<00:04:21.510> you're

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
edge to start off with so if you're

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.879 
edge to start off with so if you're
going<00:04:21.810> along<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.320> one<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.530> your<00:04:22.650> pieces

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
going along and one of your pieces

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.909 
going along and one of your pieces
breaks<00:04:23.520> off<00:04:23.789> crooked<00:04:24.440> what<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.470> find<00:04:25.800> works

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
breaks off crooked what I find works

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.659 
breaks off crooked what I find works
really<00:04:26.130> well<00:04:26.340> is<00:04:26.490> just<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.760> pull<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.150> away

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
really well is just to pull it away

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.860 
really well is just to pull it away
adjust<00:04:29.669> this<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> little<00:04:30.630> wider

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
adjust this so that it's a little wider

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.529 
adjust this so that it's a little wider
and<00:04:31.280> then<00:04:32.280> let's<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:32.639> push<00:04:32.820> this<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.150> cricket

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
and then let's just push this in cricket

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.159 
and then let's just push this in cricket
so<00:04:33.780> even<00:04:34.410> though<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.710> crooked<00:04:35.130> now<00:04:35.990> if<00:04:36.990> I

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
so even though this is crooked now if I

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.409 
so even though this is crooked now if I
roll<00:04:37.349> along<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.800> drape<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.099> off<00:04:41.210> I've<00:04:42.210> got<00:04:42.389> a

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
roll along and drape it off I've got a

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.210 
roll along and drape it off I've got a
nice<00:04:42.660> straight<00:04:42.930> edge<00:04:42.990> again<00:04:43.440> so<00:04:44.099> that's

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
nice straight edge again so that's

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.469 
nice straight edge again so that's
really<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.639> only<00:04:44.669> thing<00:04:44.849> that<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.210> throw<00:04:45.419> you

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
really the only thing that can throw you

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.790 
really the only thing that can throw you
off<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:45.720> little<00:04:46.050> bit<00:04:46.139> with<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.380> if<00:04:46.530> one<00:04:46.680> of

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
off a little bit with this if one of

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.260 
off a little bit with this if one of
your<00:04:46.919> pieces<00:04:47.070> doesn't<00:04:47.550> break<00:04:47.729> properly

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
your pieces doesn't break properly

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.790 
your pieces doesn't break properly
you've<00:04:48.780> got<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.050> waste<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.410> little<00:04:49.620> bit<00:04:49.740> of

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
you've got to waste a little bit of

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.230 
you've got to waste a little bit of
glass<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.160> get<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.340> nice<00:04:50.490> straight<00:04:50.760> edge<00:04:50.910> again

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
glass to get a nice straight edge again

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.089 
glass to get a nice straight edge again
to<00:04:52.050> get<00:04:52.349> your<00:04:52.470> point<00:04:52.620> in<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.740> right<00:04:52.889> direction

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
to get your point in the right direction

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.540 
to get your point in the right direction
so<00:04:54.320> again<00:04:55.320> going<00:04:55.530> back<00:04:55.710> down<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:55.950> my<00:04:56.160> half<00:04:56.340> inch

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
so again going back down to my half inch

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.120 
so again going back down to my half inch
piece<00:04:59.870> it's<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.960> half<00:05:01.139> inch<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:01.500> definitely

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
piece it's a half inch I definitely

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:11.200 
piece it's a half inch I definitely
recommend<00:05:02.400> using<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:02.880> running<00:05:03.120> pliers

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.629 

and<00:05:12.210> there<00:05:12.720> you<00:05:12.810> go<00:05:12.840> so<00:05:13.259> I<00:05:13.949> hope<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.280> find<00:05:14.430> this

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
and there you go so I hope you find this

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.360 
and there you go so I hope you find this
the<00:05:15.120> skill<00:05:15.360> very<00:05:15.539> useful<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.259> I'm<00:05:17.129> quite

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
confident that if you're doing a lot of

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.029 
confident that if you're doing a lot of
parallel<00:05:19.139> lines<00:05:19.379> this<00:05:19.560> would<00:05:19.710> be<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.860> great

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
parallel lines this would be a great

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.669 
parallel lines this would be a great
tool<00:05:20.250> for<00:05:20.370> you
