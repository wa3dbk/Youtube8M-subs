not<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.650> huge<00:00:11.099> fan<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.519> live<00:00:11.700> wallpapers<00:00:12.300> but

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
not a huge fan of live wallpapers but

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.700 
not a huge fan of live wallpapers but
for<00:00:14.880> obvious<00:00:15.179> reasons<00:00:15.509> like<00:00:15.630> battery<00:00:16.260> drain

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
for obvious reasons like battery drain

for obvious reasons like battery drain
and<00:00:17.039> performance<00:00:17.550> issues<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.869> admit

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
and performance issues but I will admit

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.200 
and performance issues but I will admit

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
graphical representation of some kind

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.929 
graphical representation of some kind
and<00:01:16.590> we'll<00:01:16.950> go<00:01:17.070> ahead<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> set<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> wallpaper

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and we'll go ahead and set the wallpaper

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.609 
and we'll go ahead and set the wallpaper
up<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:21.060> video<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.170> set<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> go

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
up and the video right now is set to go

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.749 
up and the video right now is set to go
with<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> swiping<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.549> see<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
with the swiping and you can see the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.030 
with the swiping and you can see the
performance<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:28.409> much<00:01:28.560> different

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
performance is really not much different

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.929 
performance is really not much different
than<00:01:29.670> any<00:01:30.119> other<00:01:30.270> live<00:01:30.630> wallpaper<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.939> some

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
than any other live wallpaper and some

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.090 
than any other live wallpaper and some
what<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> noticed<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.659> better<00:01:34.110> dream<00:01:34.470> isn't<00:01:34.770> any

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
what I noticed a better dream isn't any

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.690 
what I noticed a better dream isn't any
worse<00:01:36.259> than<00:01:37.259> any<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:38.009> again<00:01:38.340> any<00:01:38.549> other

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
worse than any you know again any other

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.469 
worse than any you know again any other
live<00:01:38.909> wallpaper<00:01:41.780> as<00:01:42.780> far<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.229> settings<00:01:43.590> go

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.359 
live wallpaper as far as settings go
there<00:01:45.479> are<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> few<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.649> don't

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
there are a few here and there but don't

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.679 
there are a few here and there but don't
fool<00:01:47.520> around<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:47.850> them<00:01:47.939> too<00:01:47.970> much<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
fool around with them too much because I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.020 
fool around with them too much because I
want<00:01:48.930> them<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.409> want<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> best

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
want them I want to have the best

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.560 
want them I want to have the best
performance<00:01:51.689> possible<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> least

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
performance possible and the least

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450 
performance possible and the least
amount<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.049> battery<00:01:55.470> drain<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> kind<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
amount of battery drain so I kind of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.100 
amount of battery drain so I kind of
stay<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:56.850> whatever<00:01:57.560> defaults<00:01:58.560> are<00:01:58.770> but<00:02:00.110> one

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
stay with whatever defaults are but one

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.569 
stay with whatever defaults are but one
of<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> things<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:04.340> lock<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
of the things you can do is lock the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.429 
of the things you can do is lock the
video<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> swipe<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.930> doesn't<00:02:07.290> move

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
video so when you swipe it doesn't move

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.969 
video so when you swipe it doesn't move
with<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.829> swiping<00:02:08.599> that<00:02:09.599> would<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
with your swiping that would be for a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.400 
with your swiping that would be for a
video<00:02:11.310> where<00:02:11.840> whatever<00:02:12.840> you're<00:02:13.020> filming

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
video where whatever you're filming

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
when he first started walking I just

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.460 
when he first started walking I just
moved<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.690> go<00:02:21.840> shift<00:02:22.140> video

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.530 
over and this way whenever I swipe
sometimes<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.860> also<00:02:35.010> notice<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.490> pause<00:02:35.730> when

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
sometimes I also notice a pause when

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.240 
sometimes I also notice a pause when
loading<00:02:36.960> up<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.230> video<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.740> first<00:02:37.770> time
