before your scheduled appointment a
reason<00:04:02.079> being<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.799> unless<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.400> have<00:04:03.489> a

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
reason being is that unless you have a

reason being is that unless you have a
physical<00:04:03.700> defect<00:04:04.299> with<00:04:04.840> your<00:04:04.959> device<00:04:05.139> such<00:04:05.319> as

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
physical defect with your device such as

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.559 
physical defect with your device such as
bubbling<00:04:05.799> under<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.130> screen<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:07.120> genius<00:04:07.450> is

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
bubbling under the screen the genius is

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.640 
bubbling under the screen the genius is
probably<00:04:07.870> going<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.079> suggest<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.470> you

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
probably going to suggest that you

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.020 
probably going to suggest that you
restore<00:04:09.010> your<00:04:09.040> device<00:04:09.190> and<00:04:09.549> then<00:04:09.819> make

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
restore your device and then make

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.250 
restore your device and then make
another<00:04:10.239> appointment<00:04:10.569> if<00:04:10.900> you're<00:04:11.079> still

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
another appointment if you're still

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.569 
another appointment if you're still
experiencing<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.069> same<00:04:12.190> problems

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
experiencing the same problems

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.190 
experiencing the same problems
afterwards<00:04:12.880> I'm<00:04:13.750> pretty<00:04:13.930> sure<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.109> don't

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
afterwards I'm pretty sure you don't

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.449 
afterwards I'm pretty sure you don't
want<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.440> make<00:04:14.680> another<00:04:14.889> appointment<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.400> go

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
want to make another appointment to go

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.360 
want to make another appointment to go
back<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:16.180> an<00:04:16.660> easy<00:04:16.989> way<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.229> remedy<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:18.010> to

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
back so an easy way to remedy this is to

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.949 
back so an easy way to remedy this is to
tell<00:04:18.639> them<00:04:18.789> that<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.389> first<00:04:19.600> noticed<00:04:19.900> this

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
tell them that you first noticed this

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.599 
tell them that you first noticed this
problem<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.560> restored<00:04:21.220> your<00:04:21.250> phone<00:04:21.459> to

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
problem and you restored your phone to

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.430 
problem and you restored your phone to
see<00:04:21.729> if<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.909> would<00:04:21.970> help<00:04:22.090> fix<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.510> problem<00:04:22.539> but

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
see if it would help fix the problem but

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.050 
see if it would help fix the problem but
after<00:04:23.740> restoring<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.310> you're<00:04:24.760> still<00:04:24.940> having

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
after restoring it you're still having

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.670 
after restoring it you're still having
the<00:04:25.240> same<00:04:25.270> problem<00:04:25.750> as<00:04:25.870> problems

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the same problem as problems

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.409 
the same problem as problems
before<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.280> restoring<00:04:27.699> it<00:04:27.759> obviously<00:04:28.120> didn't

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
before so restoring it obviously didn't

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.560
