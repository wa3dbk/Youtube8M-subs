00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.200 
to story and this is my morality rating
as<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:33.380> can<00:02:33.500> see<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.520> lowest<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.030> can

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
as you can see it is the lowest it can

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.970 
as you can see it is the lowest it can
be<00:02:35.390> because<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.960> just<00:02:36.170> taking<00:02:36.620> all<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.800> money

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
be because you just taking all the money

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.030 
be because you just taking all the money
at<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.250> kingdom<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.450> what<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.110> do<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.830> go

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
at the kingdom so what you do is you go

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.740 
at the kingdom so what you do is you go
back<00:02:40.250> in<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.760> give<00:02:42.160> basically<00:02:43.160> all<00:02:44.150> that

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
back in and you give basically all that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.880 
back in and you give basically all that
back<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.540> your<00:02:47.810> Marlene<00:02:48.350> will<00:02:48.530> increase

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
back and so your Marlene will increase

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.440 
back and so your Marlene will increase
where<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.280> keep<00:02:49.520> both<00:02:49.700> your<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.270> move
