one<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> most<00:01:04.500> common<00:01:05.339> reasons<00:01:05.970> why<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.119> see

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
one of the most common reasons why I see

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.649 
one of the most common reasons why I see
a<00:01:06.600> heavy<00:01:07.170> shot<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.340> lateral<00:01:08.909> movement<00:01:09.180> away

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
a heavy shot is a lateral movement away

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.260 
a heavy shot is a lateral movement away
from<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.260> golf<00:01:10.470> ball<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> backswing<00:01:11.400> so

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
from the golf ball in the backswing so

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
from the golf ball in the backswing so
once<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.810> set<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> ball<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:14.189> soon<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.700> we

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
once we set up to the ball as soon as we

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.600 
once we set up to the ball as soon as we
move<00:01:15.060> away<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.259> body<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.040> sternum<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
move away the body the sternum the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
move away the body the sternum the
Centers<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.450> body<00:01:18.630> moves<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> away

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
Centers of your body moves to the away

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.070 
Centers of your body moves to the away
from<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.640> target<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.479> what<00:01:21.630> then<00:01:21.750> tends

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
from the target really what then tends

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
from the target really what then tends
to<00:01:22.170> happen<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> center<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.009> gravity<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
to happen is the center of gravity is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.969 
to happen is the center of gravity is
placed<00:01:24.119> behind<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.600> golf<00:01:24.780> ball<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.710> when<00:01:25.890> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
placed behind the golf ball so when you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.550 
placed behind the golf ball so when you
come<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.340> unless<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.880> make<00:01:27.060> another<00:01:27.560> massive

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
come in unless you make another massive

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.340 
come in unless you make another massive
lateral<00:01:29.040> slide<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.549> way<00:01:29.869> you<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> take

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
lateral slide that way you like to take

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.660 
lateral slide that way you like to take
the<00:01:31.439> floor<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.860> bit<00:01:31.979> behind<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> golf

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the floor a little bit behind the golf

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.859 
the floor a little bit behind the golf
ball<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> give<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
ball so if I was to give that a bit of a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.499
