 it is packaged as always with high quality 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.260
 here we have a vertical stabilizer 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.260
 also steering wheel 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.410

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.410

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.100
 there is also a cable or a thousand 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.189
 next we have a wing of the nose 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.189
 I 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.860
 well, like this 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.430

 ailerons 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.630
 all necessary pro 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.630
 treatment 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:28.980
 also we have 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 my lights and in the wings here 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.280
 highway mounts 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.090
 act 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.090
 take up electronics 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.840
 servo and already 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.840
 sealed with white tape 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.430
 everything looks very good 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.050
 on the engine should pay attention 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.530
 and see because some 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.640
 instances they need alignment 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.640
 it happens that it is crookedly installed at the factory 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.219
 further she shoot herself 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.120

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.770
 volumetric beautiful cabin details 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.840
 she is holding a pilot so he can 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.840
 if necessary, manage your model 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.390
 front landing gear we controlled 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.380
 57 for to

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.510
 can also detect these 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:32.260
 extra stickers and glue for 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.260
 to glue 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:44.670
 maybe something else is called smolder 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:45.330
 everything is thought out well done factory this 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:55.800

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.330
 extension cords 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.340
 here there is something you need for 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.820
 order to build a model everything is there 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.820
 complete 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:58.490
 there is also an instruction for yourself 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:01.199
 the investigator Nastya needs to collect a model 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.800

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.770
 This is how the assembled model looks very 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:25.320
 beautifully similar to the original 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:28.440
 system legends such as antenna 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.440
 exhaust pipes 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:37.890
