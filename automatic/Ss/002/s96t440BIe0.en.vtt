00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and a half whatever so yes this is like

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.620 
and a half whatever so yes this is like
a<00:01:09.210> side<00:01:09.689> view<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.850> don't<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:12.000> how<00:01:12.180> long<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630

I think it's like no right the first

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
I think it's like no right the first
bone<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.220> neck<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:20.970> that
