systems<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.599> what<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.900> means<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.740> decide

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
systems and what that means is I decide

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.709 
systems and what that means is I decide
what<00:00:11.340> kind<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.700> hardware<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.300> use<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.630> our

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
what kind of hardware we use in our

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.959 
what kind of hardware we use in our
systems<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.549> today<00:00:14.549> I'm<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.849> be

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
systems and today I'm going to be

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.380 
systems and today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.960> AMD<00:00:16.680> a10<00:00:17.240> 6800<00:00:18.240> K

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
talking to you about the AMD a10 6800 K

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.950 
talking to you about the AMD a10 6800 K
it's<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.140> APU<00:00:19.590> which<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.820> means<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.449> CPU

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
it's an APU which that means it's a CPU

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.029 
it's an APU which that means it's a CPU
and<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.380> GPU<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:23.070> combined<00:00:23.640> into<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.390> chip<00:00:25.039> so

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and a GPU all combined into one chip so

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.769 
and a GPU all combined into one chip so
what<00:00:26.550> we're<00:00:26.640> gonna<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.849> today<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.240> we're<00:00:27.599> going

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
what we're gonna do today is we're going

what we're gonna do today is we're going
to<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.289> some<00:00:28.800> benchmarks<00:00:29.449> just<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to show you some benchmarks just to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.750 
to show you some benchmarks just to
explain<00:00:31.199> exactly<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:33.290> functional<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.760> how

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
explain exactly how functional and how

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.709 
explain exactly how functional and how
powerful<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:37.200> chip<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:39.540> right

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
powerful this chip can be in the right

00:00:39.719 --> 00:01:14.800 
powerful this chip can be in the right
hands

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:02:38.729
