00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.660
 hello and welcome to all on the whole 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.840
 new youtube video channel grc de 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.840
 start again today I present you 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:39.069
 the 2014 novelties the detector box 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.899
 ds3 and the central ds3 r the box is 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:48.190
 so present in a black box like 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:51.989
 this inside you will find the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:57.429
 detectors as well as the central ds3 r 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.839
 each detector is equipped with a hull 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.839
 protective soft plastic 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.530
 and the power plant comes with a small 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:19.509
 cord way she tied around the neck 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:22.119
 you want to exist a box so with 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.340
 three detectors it is obviously 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.340
 available in four detector version 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.819
 here is how the new 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.590
 ds3 radar you simply turn it on 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.709
 with the button on the front by pressing a 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.780
 second like this you see the diode 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:45.220
 which lights up and for the stamps of the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.289
 same way or second victories 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.840
 was time you can play next 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.179
 on sensitivity with the duo wheel 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.000
 on the tone with the wheel of the 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.299
 middle and on the volume with the wheel 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.709
 from below one of the peculiarities 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.509
 important of this new detector is 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.879
 his indication touches 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.130
 you see that the diode is slightly 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:11.019
 elongated so she is truly 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.389
 consisting of several small diodes 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.010
 and actually when you have a departure 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.010
 normal in its place 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.790
 the diode goes up when you have 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.790
 a return key 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.160
 the diode is going down it can 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.380
 so you indicate the meaning of the key 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.360
 simply another peculiarity 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.050
 very interesting especially for the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.210
 night deposit is the diode that 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.350
 you see on the back of the detector it 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.700
 you simply need to actually press the 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.950
 setting button that below the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.430
 volume in several seconds five 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.150
 seconds precisely like these here the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.310
 diode lights up and flashes so that 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.460
 guide you at night and it's very 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.870
 interesting that allows you to keep the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.650
 kz2 navigation when you drop in 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.150
 very handy boat to extinguish 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.530
 so the positioning diode it you 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.450
 simply press the 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.610
 same button during seconds clients 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.900
 until the bible the diode is off 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.000
 another technical particularity of the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.650
 new ds3 radar is the setting 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.630
 detector watch very convenient when 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.700
 we can rest the tho 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.260
 unwanted beeps and in particular to use 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.330
 the batteries just in fact 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.910
 to press the on off button 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.250
 just once land goes into 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.800
 eve we see it on the diode you 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.770
 can so much of the can or in 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.660
 putting on the thread the braid where 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.510
 the son not on the roulette ya no 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.100
 bible the day before for 10 minutes if 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.950
 you want to reach before to support 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.600
 just once in nine 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.750
 the detector returns to mode 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.090
 normal detection 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.440
 equipping you to the blan for p'tite 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.660
 billy radar ds3 you can connect 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.700
 your detector with the lamp and so 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.430
 trigger the light during a departure 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.860
 you connect your radar lamp 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.350
 ds3 you just turn off the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.430
 detector to long press on the 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.890
 on button stop lamp up 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.850
 what the red silk button you turn on 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.530
 your detector the lamp will turn on at the 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.920
 log on 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.250
 turn off your lamp there at a 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.440
 touch 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.310
 it is enough that the Arabic the detector beep 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.310
 for the lamp to turn on 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.720
 the lamp can be used from two 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.120
 ways first ways we support 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.190
 on the button on off 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.790
 you have a small flashlight located 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.400
 under the tongue 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.050
 if you press a second time you 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.700
 have the diodes that light up here you 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.390
 so have a lamp a lot more 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.400
 powerful to change the color of 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.160
 your radar ds3 you just have to press 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.020
 simultaneously the key is off and 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:13.630
 on the button that has below the volume 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:14.800
 or watch so choose the color that 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.560
 you wish 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.660
 according to your taste with the same button 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.970
 located under the volume you can adjust 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.830
 the intensity of the diode according to whether you 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.980
 want an idiot who is powerful or 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:31.990
 a discrete diode like these that 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.160
 you press then it goes down until 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.420
 that intensity increases so on 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.550
 the power plant is like these 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.860
 was slightly smaller than the 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:48.670
 detectors which is already rather of a 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:50.140
 small size the central so you 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.810
 simply switch it on with the button 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.460
 on off which lies on top as 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.350
 this is it 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.060
 then you adjust the volume with the 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:05.260
 touch more - yeah less and less 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.760
 loudly to the vibrate function where it 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.690
 just press it or a few 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:15.060
 seconds on the key - where to go in 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.060
 vibrator to extinguish it 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.460
 that was michael so for you 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.180
 present novelty 2014 new 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:27.420
 radars ds3 jrc I give an appointment on 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.860
 the new channel youtube videos jrc 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.080
 mouth because france for two new 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.740
 videos coming soon and good 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.740
 fishing for everything goes away
