 had effect 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.290
 whatever the decision would end 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.240
 returning to violence over time is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.520
 holding in a pressure cooker 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.910
 to the deputy is a matter of police 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.900
 has no connection with sport 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.020

 practicing acts of violence is the same 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.370

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.630
 going to the pocket of the organized is one of 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.400
 paths is too much money involved to 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.290
