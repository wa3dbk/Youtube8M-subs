which you are viewing on HTC One X so

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.529 
which you are viewing on HTC One X so
let's<00:00:20.430> see<00:00:20.609> how<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
let's see how do we do it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.140 
let's see how do we do it
so<00:00:21.900> basically<00:00:22.380> actually<00:00:23.039> allows<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.939> take

so basically actually allows you to take
the<00:00:24.180> picture<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:25.109> any<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.529> scene<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.760> save

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
vodka scene as an image so we have

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.910

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
let's play this video and let's see how

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.090 
let's play this video and let's see how
we<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.980> save<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.640> particular<00:00:48.090> scene<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
we can save a particular scene as a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.830 
we can save a particular scene as a
screenshot<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> photo<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.510> order<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
screenshot or as a photo so in order to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.389 
screenshot or as a photo so in order to
take<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> screenshot<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> particular

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
take the screenshot of a particular

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.549 
take the screenshot of a particular
scene<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.359> need<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.899> tap<00:01:01.109> over<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
scene you just need to tap over the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:16.770 
scene you just need to tap over the
shutter<00:01:01.890> icon<00:01:02.820> which<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.750> over<00:01:04.110> here

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.960 

so<00:01:17.320> as<00:01:17.620> you<00:01:17.860> can<00:01:18.010> see<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.490> image<00:01:18.730> has<00:01:18.940> been

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
so as you can see the image has been

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.030 
so as you can see the image has been
saved<00:01:19.510> to<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.080> camera<00:01:20.500> gallery<00:01:21.390> let's<00:01:22.390> see

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
saved to the camera gallery let's see

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.289 
saved to the camera gallery let's see
whether<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.280> image<00:01:24.460> have<00:01:24.700> been<00:01:24.880> saved<00:01:25.150> or<00:01:25.270> not

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.660 

so<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> image<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.920> particular<00:01:35.430> scene

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so so the image of that particular scene

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.750 
so so the image of that particular scene
which<00:01:35.940> we<00:01:36.210> tried<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.810> capture<00:01:37.100> has<00:01:38.100> been<00:01:38.400> saved

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
which we tried to capture has been saved

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.140 
which we tried to capture has been saved
so<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.050> can<00:01:40.080> actually<00:01:40.380> basically<00:01:41.150> select

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so you you can actually basically select

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700 
so you you can actually basically select
any<00:01:42.300> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> scene<00:01:42.750> from<00:01:43.020> any<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.350> your
