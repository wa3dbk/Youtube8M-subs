00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
on zero energy and one thing that all

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.540 
on zero energy and one thing that all
these<00:00:23.820> talks<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.750> common<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.550> they

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
these talks have in common is that they

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
have this speaker clock that shows the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.979 
have this speaker clock that shows the
speakers<00:00:31.500> how<00:00:32.099> long<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.329> spoken<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
speakers how long they have spoken and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
speakers how long they have spoken and
how<00:00:34.140> much<00:00:34.320> time<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> left<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.219> there's<00:00:35.370> also

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
how much time is left and there's also

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.970 
how much time is left and there's also
this<00:00:35.820> kind<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.270> traffic<00:00:37.230> light<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.739> tells

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this kind of traffic light that tells

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.510 
this kind of traffic light that tells
them<00:00:38.219> when<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.910> wrap<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.960> their<00:00:40.140> speech<00:00:40.440> now<00:00:41.280> I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
them when to wrap up their speech now I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280 
them when to wrap up their speech now I
figured<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.180> wanted<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.899> something<00:00:42.930> like

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
figured I wanted to do something like

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.680 
figured I wanted to do something like
that<00:00:43.440> myself<00:00:43.800> especially<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:45.390> I'd

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that myself especially because I'd

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.580 
that myself especially because I'd
created<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.770> dt<00:00:47.190> LED<00:00:48.110> number<00:00:49.110> view<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
created the dt LED number view and that

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
created the dt LED number view and that
would<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.719> good<00:00:51.800> thing<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> use<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
would be a good thing to use for that so

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.420 
would be a good thing to use for that so
I<00:00:55.219> present<00:00:56.219> speaker<00:00:57.059> clock<00:00:57.980> when<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.070> open<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
I present speaker clock when you open it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.260 
I present speaker clock when you open it
the<00:00:59.579> first<00:00:59.820> time<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.329> set<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.989> 18

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
the first time it's set up for 18

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.000 
the first time it's set up for 18
minutes<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.960> that's<00:01:04.199> exactly<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
minutes because that's exactly the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.960 
minutes because that's exactly the
duration<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.260> tted<00:01:07.260> Ted<00:01:07.920> speakers<00:01:08.520> are

once it starts counting down it's very

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.260 
once it starts counting down it's very

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
amounts this distillations you can set

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.970 
amounts this distillations you can set
them<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.280> example<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.790> wanted<00:02:35.940> say<00:02:36.980> four

minutes to be the yellow one you just

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.020 
minutes to be the yellow one you just
tap<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.800> hold<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.840> if<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.110> want<00:02:43.350> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
increase the red one say to one and a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.220 
increase the red one say to one and a
half<00:02:47.460> minutes<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:49.230> tap<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.680> hold<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:51.230> and

you<00:02:52.350> see<00:02:52.560> not<00:02:52.980> set<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.550> these<00:02:54.060> values<00:02:54.420> get

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
you see not set and these values get

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.110 
you see not set and these values get
saved<00:02:54.960> obviously<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:56.370> new<00:02:56.640> preferences

whether<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:00.420> basically<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.160> main

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
whether that's basically the main

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.380 
whether that's basically the main
functionality<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.270> very<00:03:03.570> basic<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:05.390> could

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
functionality it's very basic I could

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.050 
functionality it's very basic I could
have<00:03:06.540> made<00:03:06.780> more<00:03:07.260> presets<00:03:08.130> than<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.490> but

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
have made more presets than that but

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.330 
have made more presets than that but
first<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.600> want<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> see<00:03:10.170> how<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:11.010> app<00:03:11.280> is

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
first I want to see how this app is

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.050 
first I want to see how this app is

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
as free when it gets approved there's

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.340 
as free when it gets approved there's

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
besides the LED numbers that is how this

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.360 
besides the LED numbers that is how this
app<00:03:24.810> also<00:03:25.260> uses<00:03:25.860> dt<00:03:26.250> about<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.760> controller

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
app also uses dt about you controller

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.480 
app also uses dt about you controller
you<00:03:29.370> can<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:31.260> switch<00:03:31.680> here<00:03:31.950> just<00:03:32.310> by

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
you can see I can switch here just by

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.080 
you can see I can switch here just by

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
tapping the eye and this is a table view

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.710 
tapping the eye and this is a table view
that<00:03:36.840> gets<00:03:37.140> created<00:03:38.100> by<00:03:40.940> an<00:03:41.940> XML<00:03:42.480> file

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
that gets created by an XML file

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.699
