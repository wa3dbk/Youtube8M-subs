00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.210
 and we try to cross today was to tell a bit more about the advice well 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.180
 agree with the plans of the woman 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.670
 he finally gave the nicest registration on my macbook yesterday 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.779
 can you do we can of course but can of course do it yourself 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.480
 the registration must meet the requirements that are actually up to date 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.499
 they must be 25 meters high at the start 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.109
 EP that can be the newest 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.380
 In addition, consider ordering your own desk 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 I wanted the ball 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.320
 is to do that you can not stand it yourself 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.330
 deventer the hood on the eighteenth stage 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.060
 First of all, of course, the boat starts 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.840
 so you can sail as a collateral school so that it remains a charity 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.400
 stumble 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.100
 we pack 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.080
 simple 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.230
 housekeeping book this booklet 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.730
 but postponing the attic 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.090
 and the macbook completely clean stressed immediately do martin with your mobile 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.460
 well i think so i'll mark it stuck 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.250
 so x5 9 tip 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.790
 afterwards 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 make sure everything he made was wrong 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.800
 cycle national highway 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.520
 a separate training 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.380
 and the part used to have the ball properly cleaned so that it stings with smoke 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.380
 goes on 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 well that is nice and completely nice 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.730
 get rid of all that 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.550
 and ruben chess and look esther because I have set the foundation 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.110
 was building for the rest of europe 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.950
 the Pact continent drew inward edge 2 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.730
 food for the layman also comes to justice 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.159
 who see where citizens want to wake people up on the boat 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.830
 how can that actually be done? 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.830
 all the extra you can see where my rhythm on the boat have 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 yes I have said a movie I want more 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.189
 true 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.070
 this is the number that the collectors also have for a long time 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.530
 I could not go that should you can do the best for arts 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 because it can be placed in the right place 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.750
 yes suppose i would have it 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 grab a piece of painting styles 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.139
 I sold 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.779
 and I am becoming a little bit different 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.229
 topside 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.229
 a little higher 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.159
 previously there were around 10 kilos 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.699
 first start with the back ponies a nice way 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.879
 and that works through to the front I just keep the rest 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.279
 the stitches 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:36.599
 the coverage off this is the coverage the painters ordered the english study after 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.239
 get a place from then they will see 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.979
 stuck with old paint tape 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.529
 that is of course very dangerous 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:48.520
 and I cut utrecht if I can actually take this away 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.879
 it becomes a great scissors 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.879
 and the packages 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.879
 after i have scissors 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.130
 I'm gonna cut the back of life 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.179
 want to leave the club 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.179
 and I give away easily 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.169
 to touch new ones on impact to be picked up or something else that lives there 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.859
 to prepare this document these days us 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.729
 attach it very easily 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.929
 without the sky falling 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.149
 and I actually five from that newspaper after that side 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:27.149
 so i excellent against alex ferguson 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.480
 but the cards were boycotted 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.959
 because this picture 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.390
 what has swirls after the bottom do 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.169
 the first the top that I can work the werkendam tour down 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.530
 we have this side continues to draw the ladies this odds 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.169
 luckily did 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.419
 avr I'm going refused 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.419
 important difference is two points above purchasing power 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.029
 this way 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:00.209
 and the water storage burg coverage is this material 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.939
 the offender had 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.879
 the plug remains attached to the painting tape 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.879
 and so can I 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.129
 it is best to take it easy 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.879
 I grab headlines again 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.979
 and I now begin to doubt from this side that they spoke room week 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.490
 turn away 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.879
 in free sale 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.879
 but we are so high up the lock road 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.060
 matthieu both too 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.620
 use a special for outside also for the boat still abroad 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.169
 to sit 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.300
 and so absolute problem I have to take a good look now I know 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.509
 sometimes there was one more watch but the black letters 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.439
 another color you have some darker boots like this that you can dark blue 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.360
 best to miss extra unreadable 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 He gets his money back 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.340
 and those works may go down 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.469
 then you know that a little bit walking around 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.779
 so clearly include women who 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.969
 so the neude 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.009
 the prime minister 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.110
 the show 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.789
 and that down ma 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.219
 therefore had additional to refuse 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.120
 which continues to run well 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.240
 in the cloud 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.349
 and now according to tap 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.839
 you both support your story and get an explanation 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.409
 you can of course do more and more 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.529
 if you pack a body bag that would have those customers we wanted 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.139
 Sticking evening reader will also from now on it's best to be as close as possible 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.360
 the painters put two suspects on the sides 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.800
 just like me now 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.059
 like i do now 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:47.059
 and it is very greatly expanding 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.569
 do you think you better off 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.719
 so we look at simple the first to work later still a bit 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:59.020
 clearly 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.020
 Take a look at some places that are not completely beautiful 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.500
 the result very nicely clearly legible 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.099
 meet the water regulations 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.229
 and the strong races 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.650
 I walk after a while 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.650
 who is still a bell 100 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.999
 but of course it can be completely eliminated 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.900
 very nice if you have a good plan 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.529
 saab says harry kewell bearing ashore to boot 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:41.280
 go to our website of the stentor tricky point nl 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.630
 maybe I don't often think of another format or another club 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.740
 other material is your email the question because secretly have to report who is already 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.909
 asked 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.650
 come to see later today if you have any questions please let us know 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:54.649
 today
