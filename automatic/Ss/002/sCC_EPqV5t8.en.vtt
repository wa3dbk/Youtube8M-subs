00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.420
 the best bankers behave this way 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.800
 certainly like the most primitive illiterate 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.530
 at present, actually are not 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.900
 to overlook more 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.610
 We will become one in the coming years 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.770
 increasing poverty funding though 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.070
 I 've got this money system 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.050
 in its final phase precious metals gold and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.770
 Silver has always been the oldest 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.920
 money of the world 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.540
 In 2008, it was very clear that 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.380
 against the rise of the gold 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.380
 was intervened 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.610
 In the future, it could even be because of war 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.610
 these metals are led 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.500
 We are now investing in bonds 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.859
 23 answers have more because he once 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.859
 majority 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.500
 they are not just thrill-seekers 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.770
 desires precious metals and also raw materials 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.140
 become more and more popular as a capital investment 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.830
 People notice they have to do something around 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.950
 you are able to sustain it yourself 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.100
 a run into precious metals 1 in gold 1 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.020
 Silver 1 So physical noble metals are 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.729
 absolute duty gold actually remains 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.890
 in his value always just the same 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.570
 currency in which it is settled 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.250
 field and that's why I have to have gold around 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.229
 Klaus to tell the capital protection so 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.580
 that we do not get currency reform 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.890
 I think is very unlikely to 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.330
 But still can on the stock market in 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.000
 investing in crisis periods 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.310
 80 percent and more all branches of industry 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.350
 the world would be without strategic 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.960
 Metals can not exist already 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.470
 summer 2010, the eu has the alarm bells 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 ringed 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.090
 because she saw that the supply 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.159
 with these critical metals becomes scarce 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.080
 the danger for the private investor is 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.539
 always that he does not know which 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.610
 metals replacement buys the situation 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.110
 is more difficult should there be 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.880
 can prevent reputable that the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.739
 Actually in the market I suspect 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.269
 also that state it too 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.549
 So interventions will give the 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.310
 As always, it will be more official to look at the state 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.230
 people in this valve use and out 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.799
 out of this current monetary system 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.880
 flee 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.430
 At this time will be behind gold 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.290
 Central banks do not intervene with me 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 only in the precious metal area but also on 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.420
 exchange market or the bond market 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.660
 this sometimes open usually concealing the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.739
 what the strong ones are doing now is 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.739
 comparable to bankruptcy
