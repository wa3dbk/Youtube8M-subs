00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 sn 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.529
 hazy 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.529
 his 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.530
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.840
 People watching a new video from german 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.230
 I count by the airforce was pixo 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.680
 seven headset by turtle beach was extra 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.120
 for the xbox want to have been developed 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.250
 we have here from the wonderful 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.470
 headset in this beautiful boxed 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.620
 carton what hides underneath please 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:42.109
 now it gets even better this 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:43.730
 hour box you can complain on me, I think 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.059
 the right money would certainly have 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.649
 still only that existed was 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.909
 really good rating already 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.420
 in advance on the internet 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.260
 that's why I chose it 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.789
 our microphone rows 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.989
 Here I come, we are ours 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.989
 connection cable for the controller 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.710
 here under it 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.080
 is the adapter cable needed 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.140
 to give our controller the opportunity 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.690
 Give the headset to use stuck 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:23.180
 just as usual like the standard 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:25.190
 microphone down here so so the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.350
 head adaptions connected like her 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.100
 can see 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.720
 under this plastic box are 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.890
 the connection cable for the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.950
 connection cable before ever 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.100
 once unpacked the microphone 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.970
 We here on the headset to connect 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.149
 is completely self-explanatory actually 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.149
 just pure 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.369
 Here is the connection cable what we are 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.690
 Need for the controller 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:03.369
 it is also easy with the pure 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.369
 controller we also connect with it 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.959
 Here we have yet to deliver 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.490
 to get 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.530
 a connecting cable when we go to 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.090
 example, then we have to go 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.069
 it would not just have to gamble 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.410
 so can we can to music for 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.420
 Example at the bus station confirm or 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:26.810
 Update controller now 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.060
 just keep going and now it will be 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.060
 Therefore, controller gave a certain time 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.299
 We do not want to update others 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.299
 therefore finish 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.360
 I'm really happy with this 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.090
 this would be really nice on the head 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.620
 it is relatively easy so relative it 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.010
 is very very easy to put 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.360
 it does not have a tight head shape but it is 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.220
 keep very close to the head 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.850
 it is not accessible that presses or 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.410
 you just have her head optimally 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.330
 can here depending on how size 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.790
 to adjust 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.900
 whether now in small or big complete 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.790
 I'm perfect with this headset 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.860
 satisfied 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:27.700
 The really good thing it still is 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:29.350
 that they finally times the oar on 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.900
 controller is what now new so 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.800
 that will be standard for the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.620
 subsequent headsets or for the 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.910
 would have liked to appear for the xbox 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.209
 here as usual the new button in the 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.620
 middle here to loud and quiet 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.050
 There will be an additional one now 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.640
 for the voice chat the red button and 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.340
 once for the gaming sound up here 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.820
 the button you can depending on the change 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.320
 nobitz if you chat or png ever 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.370
 after what you want to have louder 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.470
 you regulate here 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.720
 Of course you can do both 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.700
 activate and also both louder 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.840
 and make it quieter that he almost chat 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.549
 and gamble during a party 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.370
 I think this product is really good and 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.230
 I really have to say 499 euro I have 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.030
 For example, you can buy Amazon 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.250
 really nothing against saying the quality is 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.040
 if I had several tritons earlier 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.220
 headsets and I really have to say this 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.840
 turtle beach is definitely one 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.840
 worth the purchase recommendation
