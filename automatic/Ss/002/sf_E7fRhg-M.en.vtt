probably<00:03:39.750> going<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.200> be<00:03:40.320> going<00:03:40.440> for<00:03:40.709> about<00:03:40.800> 7k

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
probably going to be going for about 7k

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.270 
probably going to be going for about 7k
eat<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.270> about<00:03:42.420> 14<00:03:43.080> k<00:03:43.470> you're<00:03:44.070> going<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.860 
eat so for about 14 k you're going to
get<00:03:44.400> an<00:03:44.580> elite<00:03:44.940> quarterback<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.630> think

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
get an elite quarterback and I think
