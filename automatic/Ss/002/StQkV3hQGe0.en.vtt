you<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> get-go

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
you have to know that from the get-go

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.760 
you have to know that from the get-go
and<00:02:04.500> rights<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.040> experience<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and rights to experience it's not the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
and rights to experience it's not the
quantity<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.489> quality<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.810> well<00:02:10.080> if

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
quantity but the quality and as well if

quantity but the quality and as well if
you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
you

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.530 
you
get<00:02:11.349> different<00:02:11.980> variations<00:02:12.910> on<00:02:13.180> your

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
get different variations on your

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.920 
get different variations on your
experience<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.920> staying<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.400> one<00:02:15.580> practice

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
experience so staying in one practice

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.350 
experience so staying in one practice
might<00:02:16.930> not<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.459> best<00:02:18.730> thing<00:02:18.910> because<00:02:19.209> you

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
might not be the best thing because you

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.059 
might not be the best thing because you
might<00:02:19.510> only<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.900> experience<00:02:20.379> from<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.530> one

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
might only get experience from that one

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.920 
might only get experience from that one
practice<00:02:21.489> but<00:02:21.760> if<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:22.000> practice<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.540> mixed

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
practice but if that practice is a mixed

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.479 
practice but if that practice is a mixed
practice<00:02:23.290> where<00:02:23.470> they<00:02:23.590> treat<00:02:23.830> large<00:02:24.099> animals

artificially<00:02:54.040> inseminate<00:02:54.160> hens<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
artificially inseminate hens and so that

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.420 
artificially inseminate hens and so that
was<00:02:56.110> all<00:02:56.319> great<00:02:56.680> experience<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.340> all

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
was all great experience and all

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.809 
was all great experience and all
different<00:02:57.910> experience<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:59.430> it<00:03:00.430> doesn't<00:03:00.700> have

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
different experience and it doesn't have

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:01.710 
different experience and it doesn't have
to<00:03:01.000> be<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.150> wealth

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
to be a wealth

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.170 
to be a wealth
I<00:03:01.750> also<00:03:02.290> shadowed<00:03:02.829> a<00:03:02.860> vet<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.220> went<00:03:03.700> around

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I also shadowed a vet that went around

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.100 
I also shadowed a vet that went around
Ontario<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.849> he<00:03:06.849> did<00:03:07.030> radiology<00:03:07.599> so<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.810> got<00:03:07.989> to

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
Ontario and he did radiology so I got to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.780 
Ontario and he did radiology so I got to
see<00:03:08.230> all<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.440> referral<00:03:08.829> cases<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.489> wasn't

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
see all the referral cases so it wasn't

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.120 
see all the referral cases so it wasn't
just<00:03:09.970> routine<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.959> all<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.410> these<00:03:11.560> different

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
just routine so all of these different

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.970 
just routine so all of these different
aspects<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:13.030> experience<00:03:13.540> are<00:03:13.900> very<00:03:14.410> key<00:03:14.769> and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
aspects of experience are very key and

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.330 
aspects of experience are very key and
just<00:03:15.609> knowing<00:03:15.970> what<00:03:16.420> happens<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.380> finding

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
just knowing what happens and finding

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.199 
just knowing what happens and finding
out<00:03:18.459> what<00:03:18.940> vets<00:03:19.299> can<00:03:19.600> do<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.910> would<00:03:21.910> strongly

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
out what vets can do I would strongly

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.180 
out what vets can do I would strongly
recommend<00:03:22.359> getting<00:03:23.079> experience<00:03:23.410> outside<00:03:24.069> of

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
recommend getting experience outside of

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.539 
recommend getting experience outside of
the<00:03:24.310> animal<00:03:24.609> industry<00:03:25.030> or<00:03:25.239> if<00:03:26.139> with<00:03:27.040> animals

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
the animal industry or if with animals

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.000 
the animal industry or if with animals
not<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:28.180> do<00:03:28.299> with<00:03:28.480> vets<00:03:28.780> because<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.829> shows

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
not to do with vets because it shows

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.759 
not to do with vets because it shows
that<00:03:30.040> you're<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.340> rounded<00:03:30.819> student<00:03:31.269> as<00:03:31.510> well<00:03:32.410> in

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
that you're a rounded student as well in

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
where I would make a handout and then we

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.979 
where I would make a handout and then we
would<00:03:44.560> go<00:03:44.709> through<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.040> material<00:03:45.639> it<00:03:46.420> helped

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
would go through the material it helped

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.050 
would go through the material it helped
my<00:03:47.109> creative<00:03:47.560> side<00:03:47.680> because<00:03:48.100> I<00:03:48.130> got<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.700> create

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
my creative side because I got to create

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.699 
my creative side because I got to create
games<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.780> different<00:03:49.870> activities<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.500> help

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
games and different activities to help

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.990 
games and different activities to help

students understand what was happening

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.520 
students understand what was happening
and<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:53.410> also<00:03:53.560> helped<00:03:54.069> me<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.870> help<00:03:55.870> students

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
and it also helped me to help students

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.009 
and it also helped me to help students
in<00:03:57.120> helping<00:03:58.120> them<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:59.889> meet<00:04:00.250> others<00:04:00.840> learn<00:04:01.840> the
