00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:44.180
 dedication at 0 47 compared to the market 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:51.410
 at least it will be that I do them so 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:57.020
 everyone will put stones have private theme 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:59.120
 that's if I have it here it's normal 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.940
 because I put everything I had 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.080
 a supervisor here in my 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.690
 inventory and I put myself a flat 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.150
 it's enough theo house so we're going 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.200
 not to piss him off 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.020
 this is his dog a little bob 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.730
 this little culture 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.000
 hey he has sainte-anne punctuated checks 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.110
 in the fleet but it's not 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.910
 So that's all I had 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.080
 the entry for the map on 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.620
 ten the gang at a small house 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.620
 I was going to see 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:36.900
 nor a port when a port and a bit like 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:40.430
 a port the port good here it is from 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.430
 the automatic harvest of the cac 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.060
 nick is against the harvest 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.980
 Automatic does not work very well 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:53.579
 because if no supply 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:04:09.449
 we finally I read nothing here we go quickly 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:11.519
 returned to the spawn tremendously I want to 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.540
 this game so we have already consulted sewing 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.359
 we are doing what 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.590
 is called a speech something like that 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:20.720
 it's chic or who had the idea of ​​the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.720
 so do dedications also to him 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:35.280
 j 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:35.280
 chisinau live my lo 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.630
 a little offbeat it's not done on purpose 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.950
 this is the beautiful thimble that 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.330
 I was showing a little more here so we 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.890
 will jump all the time to the games but very 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.320
 fast it's the highgate plugin for 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.820
 can go up there with multivers 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.950
 are few but it's a little annoying 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.900
 and that's the entry of those who go there 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.819
 here 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.530
 el papa the speech that is in the process of 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.650
 do so you'll know what it's all about 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.939

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.779
