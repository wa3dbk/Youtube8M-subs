this path that when you're on clay

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.090 
this path that when you're on clay
courts<00:01:48.600> he<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:49.840> sometimes<00:01:50.410> be<00:01:50.590> rainy<00:01:50.860> and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
courts he can sometimes be rainy and

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.550 
courts he can sometimes be rainy and
they<00:01:51.220> still<00:01:51.520> play<00:01:51.790> continued<00:01:52.479> through<00:01:52.840> or

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
they still play continued through or

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.830 
they still play continued through or
they<00:01:53.979> only<00:01:54.310> stopped<00:01:54.760> for<00:01:54.970> very<00:01:55.180> brief<00:01:55.479> periods

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
they only stopped for very brief periods

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.450 
they only stopped for very brief periods
of<00:01:55.960> time<00:01:56.140> which<00:01:56.320> really<00:01:56.590> slows<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.190> court

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
of time which really slows the court

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.250 
of time which really slows the court
down<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:57.880> that's<00:01:58.000> why<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.300> see<00:01:58.570> traditionally
