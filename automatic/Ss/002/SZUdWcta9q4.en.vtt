00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.690
 what is art and what is art allowed to do 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.400
 nothing less than that question turned 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.070
 the process against jonathan meese 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.390
 in front of the kasseler amtsgericht

 event of the mirror shortly before the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 document the arm for the Hitler salute 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.180
 elevated 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.860
 then the kasseler threw him 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.539
 Prosecutor 's office by a 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.680
 Anonymous reminder of the incident 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.699

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.170
 that use anti-constitutional 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.910
 symbols before and raised accusation 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.129
 as wrong as the Kassel district court 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.600
 now decided at the event 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.300
 it is more a look of the artist 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.829
 acted as a pure interview the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.960
 Hitler's salute is of the art freedom 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.480
 covered because the accused was not 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.800
 with the thought of the ns-time 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.370
 but it mocks him 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.290

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.469
 ideology so also the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.079
 National Socialist man must 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.710
 to submit only to art dictatorship 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:08.579
 the art he calls this idea as 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:11.549
 reaction to the judgment for the art 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.380
 a german court says jonathan 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.719

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.969
