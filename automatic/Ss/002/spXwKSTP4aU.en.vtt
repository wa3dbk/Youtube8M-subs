going to show you how to offer blend

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.999 
going to show you how to offer blend
textures<00:00:12.389> into<00:00:12.780> each<00:00:13.019> other<00:00:13.259> two<00:00:13.559> textures

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
textures into each other two textures

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.230 
textures into each other two textures
into<00:00:14.639> one<00:00:15.470> like<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.650> also<00:00:16.859> did<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.430> consider

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
into one like I also did in consider

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.179 
into one like I also did in consider
your<00:00:18.420> radiant<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.680> tutorial<00:00:19.830> I'm<00:00:20.130> going

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
your radiant for this tutorial I'm going

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.970 
your radiant for this tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:20.430> use<00:00:20.640> coffee<00:00:20.910> tea<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.420> radiant<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.680> let's

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
to use coffee tea for radiant so let's

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.480 
to use coffee tea for radiant so let's
get<00:00:23.100> started<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.960> haven't<00:00:24.960> taught<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.560> yet<00:00:26.010> how

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
get started I haven't taught you yet how

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.640 
get started I haven't taught you yet how
to<00:00:26.519> make<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> patch<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.630> quality<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.289> radiant

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to make a patch in quality for radiant

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.090 
to make a patch in quality for radiant
it's<00:00:29.460> almost<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> same<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:31.610> call<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> duty

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
it's almost the same as in call of duty

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.799 
it's almost the same as in call of duty
you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.219> defensive<00:00:35.730> radiant<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
you know defensive radiant I will do the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.160 
you know defensive radiant I will do the
same<00:00:36.840> size<00:00:37.260> again<00:00:39.020> 384<00:00:40.020> back<00:00:40.290> 384<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.960> go<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
same size again 384 back 384 and I go to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.340 
same size again 384 back 384 and I go to
patch<00:00:45.469> see<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> no<00:00:47.510> simple<00:00:48.510> tring<00:00:49.079> mesh

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
patch see there is no simple tring mesh

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.729 
patch see there is no simple tring mesh
here<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> simple<00:00:50.340> terrain<00:00:50.730> patch<00:00:51.739> but

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
here this is a simple terrain patch but

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.779 
here this is a simple terrain patch but
if<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.129> want<00:00:53.399> more<00:00:54.559> like<00:00:55.559> curves<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.219> will<00:00:56.610> use

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
if you want more like curves I will use

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.389 
if you want more like curves I will use
this<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:57.180> simple<00:00:57.570> curve<00:00:57.780> patch<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.399> which

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this one simple curve patch and which

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
this one simple curve patch and which
also<00:01:00.180> seven<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.260> eight<00:01:01.410> seven<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:03.809> fits

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
also seven and eight seven it fits

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.300 
also seven and eight seven it fits
perfectly<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:08.180> now<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.240> kept<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.869> again<00:01:10.310> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
perfectly so now we kept it again the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
same as in you know a defensive radiant

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.450 
same as in you know a defensive radiant
you<00:01:13.979> press<00:01:14.280> s<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:15.890> cap<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.560> press<00:01:19.799> Y<00:01:20.070> as

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you press s in cap so now it press Y as

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.760 
you press s in cap so now it press Y as
far<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.240> Pat<00:01:21.479> setting<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.080> units<00:01:22.350> everything

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
far as Pat setting up units everything

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.179 
far as Pat setting up units everything
is<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.920> same<00:01:23.240> batch<00:01:24.240> I'll<00:01:24.840> also<00:01:25.049> select<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.680> L

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
is the same batch I'll also select an L

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.920 
is the same batch I'll also select an L
of<00:01:26.820> such<00:01:27.030> selection<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.860> selected<00:01:28.860> Petrus

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
of such selection and selected Petrus

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:40.789 
of such selection and selected Petrus
deselected<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:32.810> height<00:01:35.299> 0<00:01:36.619> 25<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.799> turn

we're<00:02:02.370> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.610> cap<00:02:02.910> it<00:02:02.940> again<00:02:03.270> press<00:02:03.750> L<00:02:04.020> map

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
we're going to cap it again press L map

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.030 
we're going to cap it again press L map
it<00:02:04.770> will<00:02:05.430> fit<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.540> want<00:02:06.780> text<00:02:07.020> reduced<00:02:07.470> in<00:02:07.740> one

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
it will fit you want text reduced in one

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.530 
it will fit you want text reduced in one
go<00:02:08.910> cap<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.810> done<00:02:10.430> you<00:02:11.430> close<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.090> advanced

I drag this up to around two now you do

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.420 
I drag this up to around two now you do
the<00:04:13.700> same<00:04:13.880> thing<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.720> hold<00:04:14.930> alt<00:04:15.350> and<00:04:15.739> move<00:04:16.280> it

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
you will get you can also drag the outer

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.990 
you will get you can also drag the outer
edges<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.860> little<00:04:30.950> lower<00:04:31.450> like<00:04:32.450> 48<00:04:36.940> so<00:04:37.940> you

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
edges a little lower like 48 so you

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.370 
edges a little lower like 48 so you
won't<00:04:38.300> get<00:04:38.570> those<00:04:38.930> too<00:04:39.860> big<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.940> big<00:04:41.320> radius

well<00:04:52.770> we<00:04:53.550> are<00:04:53.820> about<00:04:54.210> done

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.229 

bragging<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:12.169> see<00:05:12.439> it's<00:05:12.999> blended<00:05:13.999> in

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:14.239 
bragging you see it's blended in

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:18.789 
bragging you see it's blended in
perfectly<00:05:15.519> and<00:05:16.989> if<00:05:17.989> it<00:05:18.110> isn't<00:05:18.319> bright<00:05:18.769> enough

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:18.799 
perfectly and if it isn't bright enough

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:30.150 
perfectly and if it isn't bright enough
I<00:05:19.610> can<00:05:19.939> still<00:05:22.929> use<00:05:23.929> no<00:05:24.169> texture

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.890 

going<00:05:30.820> to<00:05:31.000> blend<00:05:31.270> it<00:05:31.420> up<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:33.480> guess<00:05:34.480> my<00:05:34.630> little

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
going to blend it up I guess my little

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.770 
going to blend it up I guess my little
stones<00:05:36.120> so<00:05:37.120> yeah<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.300> hope<00:05:37.950> I've<00:05:38.950> helped<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:39.780> to
