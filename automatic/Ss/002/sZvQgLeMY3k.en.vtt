when<00:00:19.450> I<00:00:19.480> think<00:00:19.780> about<00:00:20.019> solving<00:00:20.289> problems<00:00:20.859> I

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
when I think about solving problems I

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.080 
when I think about solving problems I
think<00:00:21.010> about<00:00:21.369> stuff<00:00:21.640> like<00:00:21.730> this

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
think about stuff like this

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.070 
think about stuff like this
earpiece<00:00:22.570> my<00:00:23.380> lg<00:00:23.980> earpiece<00:00:24.759> somebody<00:00:25.750> said

earpiece my lg earpiece somebody said

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.579 
earpiece my lg earpiece somebody said
that<00:00:26.920> hey<00:00:27.099> when<00:00:27.670> people<00:00:28.000> are<00:00:28.150> driving<00:00:28.589> trying

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:29.589 
that hey when people are driving trying

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.859 
that hey when people are driving trying
to<00:00:29.740> write<00:00:30.009> trying<00:00:30.939> to<00:00:31.089> do<00:00:31.269> things<00:00:31.480> with<00:00:31.720> their

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
to write trying to do things with their

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.020 
to write trying to do things with their
hands<00:00:32.380> their<00:00:32.890> hands<00:00:33.220> need<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.400> be<00:00:33.550> hands-free

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.479 
hands their hands need to be hands-free
and<00:00:34.840> so<00:00:35.050> somebody<00:00:35.290> solved<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.950> problem

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
and so somebody solved the problem

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.340 
and so somebody solved the problem
that's<00:00:37.059> really<00:00:37.390> what<00:00:37.539> I<00:00:37.570> wanted<00:00:37.899> to<00:00:38.050> do<00:00:38.200> with

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
know what cup size her calling our

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.670 
know what cup size her calling our
uniqueness<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.239> her<00:00:43.300> purpose<00:00:43.750> I<00:00:43.930> really

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
uniqueness and her purpose I really

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.470 
uniqueness and her purpose I really
wanted<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:45.010> kind<00:00:45.219> of<00:00:45.340> answer<00:00:45.730> some<00:00:45.910> questions

you<00:00:50.350> know<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:50.649> I<00:00:50.680> think<00:00:50.739> about<00:00:51.010> it

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
you know and I think about it

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.869 
you know and I think about it
cup<00:00:52.480> size<00:00:52.719> really<00:00:52.989> does<00:00:53.320> matter<00:00:53.879> calling

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
cup size really does matter calling

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.090 
cup size really does matter calling
uniqueness<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.600> purpose<00:00:56.050> but<00:00:56.800> it's<00:00:56.949> not

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
uniqueness and purpose but it's not

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.349 
uniqueness and purpose but it's not
about<00:00:57.340> size<00:00:57.699> it's<00:00:58.600> about<00:00:58.809> significance<00:00:59.800> I

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
about size it's about significance I

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.939 
about size it's about significance I
think<00:01:01.359> about<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.989> world<00:01:02.199> in<00:01:02.440> which<00:01:02.500> we<00:01:02.739> live

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949
