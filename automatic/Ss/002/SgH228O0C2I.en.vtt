 daughter marko from honest food today 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.240
 Let's take care of shrimp 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.039
 baked shrimp is known from the north sea 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.170
 currently again at mcdonald's as 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.990
 baked like a bad one or baked 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.470
 Shrimp at home, for example, makes baked 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.769
 version in the baking dough I'll show you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.769
 in my kitchen 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.059
 for the place market in the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.730
 family home rhine 60 grams about then 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:48.180
 happen again for 25 km 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:54.170

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.170
 mix water and the whole year 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.400
 ready 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.600
 now comes for the taste so want 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:16.470
 They make a good portion of garlic 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:22.120
 granulate a teaspoon and find us 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:31.330
 a bit of fighting teaspoon and that 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:46.180
 Finally, complete the mission 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:47.680
 a little salt again with the places 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.479
 now to swell 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.479
 short ten minutes to the side 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.290
 for our shrimp or daring step 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.659
 I got here started her 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.850
 box yes I have not made any titles 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.409
 but those her this indeed already 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.760
 they are not only pre-cooked 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.360
 in the short term but only the coat 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.530
 get and they come now completely 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.880
 unspectacular brains our bowl with 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.880
 the market just completely pure 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:22.250
 and once done nicely 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:28.340
 What pond put in all of this and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.860
 now come up with Schiffer with red 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.239
 I just wanted to say green with 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.070
 breadcrumbs of course you can too 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.700

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.860
 bun and there are now our im 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.700
 Backteig are simply the shrimps 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.400
 It will take a bit longer now 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.510
 fight 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.870
 It would not have to be all the time 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.870
 look 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:11.280
 I think I got the last one 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:11.280
 yes, cover it now and shake it 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:20.260
 take care that he is daily too 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.230
 we do not save ourselves every single 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.100
 bread again and now you go 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.000

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.420
 again things now just come to 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.420
 Shrimp as pure 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.420
 as fast as possible all at once 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:18.870
 we finish everything nicely at the same time 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:20.370
 that should be all and that 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:28.320
 I have two or three 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:36.479
