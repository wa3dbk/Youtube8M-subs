 sebastiÃ¡n and years ago his participation 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.430

 country that was about to self-eliminate 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.460
 when she discovered that she was addicted to 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.879
 cocaine until four years ago that 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.879
 It seems 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.680
 cocaine 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:29.150
 still up to the man of 17 or 16 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:33.370
 until the age of 28 I went or whether it is 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.760
 it was just how I wanted to destroy myself 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.940
 But that's over four years ago because 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.150
 I approached God always and I am 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.430
 half less much 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.020
 On the other hand, the actress and model that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.540
 continues in chile- enjoying its 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.790
 great popularity in that country said that his 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.890
 strength to get ahead are your 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.350
 children and I want my children to grow up in 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.460
 God and I know that he makes them the way and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.460
 I will be there with them 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.630
 Mrs 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.490
 in exchange for doing something 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.710
 remembering some episodes of his life 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.649
 although he said that his father's absence 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.509
 when she became pregnant and marked 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.159
 I said why he had left and he told me 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.280
 that because he had a family and that he did not 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.369
 he knew how to tell me what was very young 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.780
 and it 's a pretty green Christmas embargo and 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.490
 I promised him that I would not go back to 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.819
 talk about that because I forgive him 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.759
 but my story is my life and if I 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.470
 marked too much will pass that yes a free 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.600
 Chilean public decision for its support 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.520
 He said he was about to give up the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.439
 reality but it was the backing of the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.530
 teleaudience that took her to the final 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.500
 of the program but it was very nice that the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.030
 people start voting for me because he did 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.420
 that I get up at a time when I 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.860
 It is already a point that there is no longer in 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.780
 true 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.610
 that I would have been able but I would be 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.340
 very pulls down suddenly until 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.870
 had resigned and would have lost what 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.790
 that I had already won that moment because 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.790
 I felt really frustrated
