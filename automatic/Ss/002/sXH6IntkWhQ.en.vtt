video I will show you how to spawn three
different<00:00:24.060> characters<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.840> put<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> codes

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
different characters and put the codes

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.550 
different characters and put the codes
in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> script<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.340> course<00:00:26.840> also<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:28.500> to

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
in the script of course also how to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
in the script of course also how to
replace<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:28.980> sword<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> master<00:00:30.090> sword

as young link first up is the arming
code<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.030> especially<00:00:36.780> weird<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
code this one is especially weird and I

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.299 
code this one is especially weird and I
mean<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> rule<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.410> you

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
mean it there is a rule for it if you

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.819 
mean it there is a rule for it if you
turn<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> code<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.210> inside<00:00:42.780> then<00:00:43.140> walk<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.590> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
turn the code on inside then walk out it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.970 
turn the code on inside then walk out it
will<00:00:44.190> stop<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.059> game<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.410> don't<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
will stop the game so you don't want to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.279 
will stop the game so you don't want to
do<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:48.030> want<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> restart<00:00:49.170> your

do that you want to restart your

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.970 
do that you want to restart your
emulator<00:00:50.719> after<00:00:51.719> turning<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.440> after

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
emulator after turning on this after

emulator after turning on this after
turning<00:00:53.190> off<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.489> code<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.760> start<00:00:54.120> your

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
turning off this code you start your

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180 
turning off this code you start your

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
emulator walk through the door then turn

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
emulator walk through the door then turn
it<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.489> again<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> only<00:00:57.690> way<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:58.050> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
it on again it's the only way to make it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.560 
it on again it's the only way to make it
work<00:00:58.520> now<00:00:59.520> let's<00:00:59.760> see<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.000> I'll<00:01:00.090> make<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.270> work

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
work now let's see if I'll make it work

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.980 
work now let's see if I'll make it work
sometimes<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.960> doesn't<00:01:04.379> work<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:08.780> now<00:01:09.780> i'm

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
sometimes this doesn't work so now i'm

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.219 
sometimes this doesn't work so now i'm
clicking<00:01:10.229> spawn<00:01:10.650> our<00:01:10.860> wings<00:01:14.810> see<00:01:15.810> sometimes

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
clicking spawn our wings see sometimes

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.789 
clicking spawn our wings see sometimes
this<00:01:16.619> code<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.700> glitchy<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.799> bear

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
this code is a little glitchy so bear

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:34.840 
this code is a little glitchy so bear
with<00:01:19.830> me

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:47.660 

to<00:01:35.850> try<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.060> again<00:01:39.020> there<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:46.490> there<00:01:47.490> are

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
to try this again there we go there are

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.179 
to try this again there we go there are
three<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.210> rules<00:01:48.539> there<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.770> rule

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
three more rules there are a rule

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.969 
three more rules there are a rule
there's<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> rule<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.179> each<00:01:51.539> and<00:01:51.899> every<00:01:52.590> spawn

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
there's a rule for each and every spawn

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
there's a rule for each and every spawn
code<00:01:53.220> I'm<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> give<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:56.209> our<00:01:57.209> wings

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
code I'm going to give you the our wings

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.969 
code I'm going to give you the our wings
is<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.259> outside<00:01:58.679> when<00:01:58.890> you

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
is that you have to be outside when you

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.350 
is that you have to be outside when you
turn<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.310> code<00:01:59.549> or<00:01:59.759> I'll<00:01:59.880> stop<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
turn on the code or I'll stop the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.770 
turn on the code or I'll stop the
emulation<00:02:00.720> because<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.319> an<00:02:01.409> access<00:02:01.830> error<00:02:06.500> as

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
emulation because of an access error as

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.490 
emulation because of an access error as
you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.760> they<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.849> now<00:02:12.060> spawned<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you can see they have now spawned the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.900 
you can see they have now spawned the
next<00:02:13.799> code<00:02:13.950> i'm<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> show<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:14.790> you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
next code i'm going to show you as you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.210 
next code i'm going to show you as you
can<00:02:15.060> see<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.510> spun<00:02:16.380> dark<00:02:16.739> clink<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.519> one<00:02:17.819> has

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
can see is spun dark clink this one has

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.160 
can see is spun dark clink this one has
another<00:02:20.220> rule<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:21.330> could<00:02:21.510> spawn<00:02:21.840> them<00:02:22.019> as

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
another rule you could spawn them as

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.850 
another rule you could spawn them as
much<00:02:22.319> as<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.680> want<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.040> will<00:02:23.130> always<00:02:23.310> work

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
much as you want it will always work

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.270 
much as you want it will always work
after<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.980> turn<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.340> inside<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.209> go<00:02:27.330> out

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
after you turn it on inside and go out

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.640 
after you turn it on inside and go out
this<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:29.579> well<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.750> keep<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:31.109> mind<00:02:31.170> there<00:02:31.620> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
this one well but keep in mind there is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.849 
this one well but keep in mind there is
still<00:02:31.950> something<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.350> one<00:02:34.350> Dark<00:02:34.650> Link

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
still something to know if one Dark Link

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.400 
still something to know if one Dark Link
dies<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.579> original<00:02:35.910> one<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.209> make<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:37.109> kills

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
dies the original one you make it kills

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.250 
dies the original one you make it kills
every<00:02:37.950> other<00:02:38.100> dark<00:02:38.459> link<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.570> careful<00:02:39.989> if

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
every other dark link so be careful if

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.380 
every other dark link so be careful if
you<00:02:41.100> want<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.340> battle<00:02:41.459> multiple<00:02:41.940> dark<00:02:42.150> leaks

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
you want to battle multiple dark leaks
