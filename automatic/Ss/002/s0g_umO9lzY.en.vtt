week<00:01:20.330> I<00:01:20.660> did<00:01:21.230> this<00:01:21.380> program<00:01:21.860> as<00:01:21.980> I<00:01:22.010> said<00:01:22.250> about

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
week I did this program as I said about

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.190 
week I did this program as I said about
I<00:01:22.730> think<00:01:22.910> it's<00:01:23.060> eight<00:01:23.240> years<00:01:23.270> ago<00:01:23.600> another<00:01:23.930> up

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
I think it's eight years ago another up

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.800 
I think it's eight years ago another up
done<00:01:24.620> I<00:01:24.920> can<00:01:25.280> now<00:01:25.400> go<00:01:25.640> do<00:01:25.850> whatever<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.270> want

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
and over time it all came back on but

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.860 
and over time it all came back on but
this<00:01:30.320> time<00:01:30.620> as<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:30.920> approached<00:01:31.190> I<00:01:31.220> said<00:01:31.550> no<00:01:31.970> this

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
this time as I approached I said no this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.700 
this time as I approached I said no this
is<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.410> way<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.610> living<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.360> eating<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:36.560> this

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
is a way of living and eating and this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.300 
is a way of living and eating and this
is<00:01:36.860> your<00:01:37.010> life<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.730> not<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.240> diet<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:43.070> once

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310

about<00:01:56.630> approaching<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.229> transition<00:01:57.860> phase

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
about approaching the transition phase

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.450 
about approaching the transition phase
is<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.520> plan<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.210> don't<00:02:00.110> go<00:02:00.830> into<00:02:01.159> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
is to plan it don't go into the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.690 
is to plan it don't go into the
transition<00:02:02.060> phase<00:02:02.690> with<00:02:03.530> fewer<00:02:04.070> plans<00:02:04.370> than

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
transition phase with fewer plans than

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.529 
transition phase with fewer plans than
you<00:02:04.850> had<00:02:05.060> in<00:02:05.420> phase<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:06.590> because<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:08.179> need<00:02:08.420> to

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
you had in phase one because you need to

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.330 
you had in phase one because you need to
plan<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.959> even<00:02:09.229> more<00:02:09.409> so<00:02:09.709> because

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
plan it even more so because
