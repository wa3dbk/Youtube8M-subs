transmitter
okay<00:01:18.090> here's<00:01:18.360> inside<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.929> we<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> printed

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
okay here's inside so we have a printed

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.980 
okay here's inside so we have a printed
circuit<00:01:20.009> board<00:01:20.450> here's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.539> little<00:01:21.840> power

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
circuit board here's a little power

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
circuit board here's a little power
supply<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.369> looking<00:01:23.700> around<00:01:23.819> here<00:01:24.270> at

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
supply so I was looking around here at

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
supply so I was looking around here at
first<00:01:24.569> when<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.840> opened<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:25.410> I'm

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
first when I opened it up and I'm

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.460 
first when I opened it up and I'm
looking<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.459> some<00:01:26.819> kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> an<00:01:27.179> antenna<00:01:27.780> it's

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
looking for some kind of an antenna it's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.430 
looking for some kind of an antenna it's
some<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:28.950> radio<00:01:29.369> transmitter<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:31.140> at

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
some kind of a radio transmitter so at

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.630 
some kind of a radio transmitter so at
first<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.830> looking<00:01:32.069> over<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.610> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
first I was looking over here and then I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520 
first I was looking over here and then I
realized<00:01:33.000> no<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.599> just<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.349> power

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
realized no it's just just a power

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.719 
realized no it's just just a power
supply<00:01:35.539> then<00:01:36.539> I'm<00:01:37.200> looking<00:01:37.590> around<00:01:38.069> here<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
supply then I'm looking around here on

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.130 
supply then I'm looking around here on
the<00:01:38.759> printed<00:01:39.149> circuit<00:01:39.179> board<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.780> didn't<00:01:39.989> see

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the printed circuit board I didn't see

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.570 
the printed circuit board I didn't see
anything<00:01:40.349> that<00:01:40.560> looked<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.950> radio

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
anything that looked like a radio

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.660 
anything that looked like a radio
transmitter<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:43.860> started<00:01:44.220> looking<00:01:44.550> at

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
transmitter so then I started looking at

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.020 
transmitter so then I started looking at
each<00:01:44.819> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> cables<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.910> reading<00:01:47.910> what

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
each of the cables here and reading what

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.229 
each of the cables here and reading what
the<00:01:48.149> cables<00:01:48.539> said<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.140> some<00:01:49.920> were<00:01:50.039> labeled<00:01:51.979> and

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.239 
the cables said if some were labeled and

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.889 
the cables said if some were labeled and
I<00:01:54.239> came<00:01:54.450> across<00:01:54.569> a<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.739> blue<00:01:56.130> clip<00:01:56.899> cable

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
I came across a little blue clip cable

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.109 
I came across a little blue clip cable
and<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.530> looked<00:01:58.739> like<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.009> said<00:01:59.190> Wi-Fi<00:01:59.610> module

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and it looked like it said Wi-Fi module

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.669 
and it looked like it said Wi-Fi module
above<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:02.390> here's<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.479> close-up<00:02:03.989> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.500> see

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
above it here's a close-up you can see

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.969 
above it here's a close-up you can see
indeed<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.489> says<00:02:05.670> Wi-Fi<00:02:06.179> module<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.830> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
indeed it says Wi-Fi module it's the it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.880 
indeed it says Wi-Fi module it's the it
was<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.129> only<00:02:08.429> blue<00:02:08.819> colored<00:02:09.440> clip<00:02:10.440> all<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
was the only blue colored clip all the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.839 
was the only blue colored clip all the
others<00:02:11.099> were<00:02:11.250> white

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.910 

so<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.780> refrigerator<00:02:16.290> already<00:02:16.409> off<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so with the refrigerator already off of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.920 
so with the refrigerator already off of
course<00:02:17.159> I<00:02:17.569> simply<00:02:18.829> unplugged<00:02:19.829> that<00:02:19.980> clip<00:02:20.400> just

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
course I simply unplugged that clip just

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.569 
course I simply unplugged that clip just
squeeze<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.139> little<00:02:22.409> clip<00:02:23.010> thing<00:02:23.219> and<00:02:23.400> pull

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
squeeze the little clip thing and pull

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.259 
squeeze the little clip thing and pull
it<00:02:23.700> straight<00:02:23.730> out<00:02:23.969> I<00:02:25.639> just<00:02:26.639> tucked<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:26.999> up<00:02:27.120> in

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
it straight out I just tucked it up in

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.619 
it straight out I just tucked it up in
here<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.629> fit<00:02:28.219> above<00:02:29.219> this<00:02:29.400> little<00:02:29.629> holder

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
here it fit above this little holder

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.679 
here it fit above this little holder
this<00:02:30.959> little<00:02:32.120> thing<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:33.299> holding<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
this little thing that's holding the

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.080 
this little thing that's holding the
printed<00:02:34.019> circuit<00:02:34.200> board<00:02:34.579> it<00:02:35.579> just<00:02:35.819> fit<00:02:36.000> up

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
printed circuit board it just fit up

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.129 
printed circuit board it just fit up
there<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.299> mean<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.599> could<00:02:36.780> always<00:02:36.870> use

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
there I mean you could always use

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.190 
there I mean you could always use
electrical<00:02:37.769> tape<00:02:37.980> or<00:02:38.189> something<00:02:38.609> but<00:02:38.849> on<00:02:39.599> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
electrical tape or something but on the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.909 
electrical tape or something but on the
clip<00:02:40.379> itself

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
clip itself

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.199 
clip itself
there's<00:02:41.519> no<00:02:41.730> exposed<00:02:42.769> contacts<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.919> have<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
there's no exposed contacts you have to

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.059 
there's no exposed contacts you have to
go<00:02:45.209> into<00:02:45.359> little<00:02:45.629> ways<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.079> it's<00:02:46.290> design<00:02:46.799> tap

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
go into little ways so it's design tap

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.599 
go into little ways so it's design tap
pins<00:02:47.370> insert<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.969> into<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.359> so<00:02:48.599> it's<00:02:49.500> not<00:02:49.739> not<00:02:50.579> a

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
pins insert it into it so it's not not a

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.309 
pins insert it into it so it's not not a
concern<00:02:51.030> even<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.389> did<00:02:51.599> get<00:02:51.750> loose<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.169> it's

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
concern even if did get loose but it's

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.409 
concern even if did get loose but it's
not<00:02:52.500> going<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.739> move<00:02:52.859> anywhere<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> just

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
not going to move anywhere so I just

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.800 
not going to move anywhere so I just
stuck<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.079> up<00:02:55.169> there<00:02:56.120> here's<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.209> zoom<00:02:57.449> out<00:02:57.599> of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
stuck it up there here's a zoom out of

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.050 
stuck it up there here's a zoom out of
that<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.169> can<00:02:58.319> see<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:59.010> was<00:02:59.189> as<00:02:59.370> easy<00:02:59.669> as

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
that you can see it was as easy as

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.470 
that you can see it was as easy as
unclipping<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.199> little<00:03:01.409> cable<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.040> spent

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
unclipping that little cable so I spent

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.520 
unclipping that little cable so I spent
probably<00:03:03.480> around<00:03:03.569> three<00:03:03.870> hours<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.319> phone

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
probably around three hours on the phone

probably around three hours on the phone
with<00:03:04.590> Samsung<00:03:05.280> talked<00:03:05.639> to<00:03:05.870> six<00:03:06.870> different

the refrigerator on everything works
just<00:03:36.180> as<00:03:36.599> before<00:03:36.750> everything<00:03:37.259> functions

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
just as before everything functions

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.949 
just as before everything functions
great<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.669> only<00:03:38.879> difference<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.359> there's<00:03:39.629> no

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
great the only difference is there's no

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.749 
great the only difference is there's no
microwave<00:03:40.680> radiation<00:03:41.189> emitting<00:03:41.519> from<00:03:41.609> the

microwave radiation emitting from the

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.689 
microwave radiation emitting from the
refrigerator<00:03:42.299> now<00:03:42.449> so<00:03:43.319> problem<00:03:44.220> solved<00:03:44.609> this

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699

helpful so the big thing is if you
haven't<00:03:50.220> measured<00:03:50.370> your<00:03:50.609> appliances

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
haven't measured your appliances

hf 35 C's still my favorite because of

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.520 
hf 35 C's still my favorite because of
its<00:03:59.909> directionality<00:04:00.449> but<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.169> acoustic

its directionality but the acoustic

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.409 
its directionality but the acoustic
meter<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.739> also<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.069> great<00:04:02.310> meter<00:04:02.549> that's<00:04:03.329> the
