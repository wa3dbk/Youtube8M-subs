00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.360 
it's funny the way you fish them quite
often<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.199> bites<00:00:42.440> are<00:00:42.680> quite<00:00:42.890> gentle<00:00:43.280> a

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
often the bites are quite gentle a

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.610 
often the bites are quite gentle a
couple<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.699> taps<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.150> knocks<00:00:44.470> sometimes<00:00:45.470> they

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
couple of taps and knocks sometimes they

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.280 
couple of taps and knocks sometimes they
just<00:00:45.799> smash<00:00:46.040> it<00:00:46.220> but<00:00:46.809> surprising<00:00:47.809> how<00:00:47.900> gentle

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
just smash it but surprising how gentle

a<00:00:48.379> they<00:00:48.710> do<00:00:48.890> it<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.220> I<00:00:49.250> think<00:00:49.309> that's<00:00:49.489> why

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
a they do it and I think that's why

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.369 
a they do it and I think that's why
those<00:00:49.790> small<00:00:50.089> hooks<00:00:50.299> work<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:50.750> well<00:00:50.960> they<00:00:51.260> get
