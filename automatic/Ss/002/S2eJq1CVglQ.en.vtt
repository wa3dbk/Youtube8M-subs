00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.300 

this<00:02:02.870> machine<00:02:03.260> has<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.470> very<00:02:03.770> interesting

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
this machine has a very interesting

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.969 
this machine has a very interesting
mechanism<00:02:04.520> here<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.930> can<00:02:06.110> feed<00:02:07.030> by<00:02:08.030> hand<00:02:08.979> and

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
mechanism here you can feed by hand and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.580 
mechanism here you can feed by hand and
you<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.400> also<00:02:10.520> turn<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.240> spindle<00:02:11.960> on<00:02:12.260> right

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
you can also turn the spindle on right

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.040 
you can also turn the spindle on right
here<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.160> can<00:02:13.340> get<00:02:13.490> very<00:02:14.300> close<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.960> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
here so you can get very close to the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.090 
here so you can get very close to the
work<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:16.690> very<00:02:17.690> convenient<00:02:18.350> option<00:02:19.010> I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
work and very convenient option I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.070 
work and very convenient option I
believe<00:02:20.200> good<00:02:21.200> luck<00:02:21.440> happy<00:02:21.890> bidding
