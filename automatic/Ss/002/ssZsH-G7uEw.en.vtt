up taking on my backpacking trips this
this<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.550> another<00:00:08.790> Coleman<00:00:09.690> system<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.620> was

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
this is another Coleman system this was

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.440 
this is another Coleman system this was
a<00:00:10.830> little<00:00:11.269> common<00:00:12.349> firestorm<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.849> a<00:00:14.849> little

little small system comes in half screws

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.490 
little small system comes in half screws
together<00:00:27.529> let's<00:00:28.529> screws<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.760> top<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
together let's screws into that top and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.010 
together let's screws into that top and
it's<00:00:31.500> got<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.120> little<00:00:33.120> control<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:33.780> there

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it's got a little control right there

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
it's got a little control right there
entire<00:00:34.770> cooking<00:00:35.160> system<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:35.910> so

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
entire cooking system all in one so

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.520 
entire cooking system all in one so
you're<00:00:36.210> talking<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.739> out<00:00:37.739> TSA's<00:00:38.210> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
very stable cooking surface up here will

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.119 
very stable cooking surface up here will
hold<00:00:47.129> all<00:00:47.670> your<00:00:47.700> pots<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.360> whatnot<00:00:48.829> it's<00:00:49.829> got

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
hold all your pots and whatnot it's got

a<00:00:50.160> wide<00:00:50.579> surface<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> set<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
a wide surface here you can set on the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.970 
a wide surface here you can set on the
ground<00:00:52.230> it'll<00:00:52.500> hold<00:00:53.059> very<00:00:54.059> stable<00:00:54.949> for<00:00:55.949> the

ground it'll hold very stable for the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
ground it'll hold very stable for the
probably<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.760> vast<00:00:57.180> majority<00:00:57.300> of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
probably the vast majority of

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.389 
probably the vast majority of
backpacking<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> session

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
backpacking I do this is the session

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.330 
backpacking I do this is the session
that<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.699> take<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.180> also<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.020> because

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
that I take I also like this one because

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
that I take I also like this one because
with<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.489> system<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.600> all<00:01:03.809> everything

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
with this system it's all everything

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
with this system it's all everything
collapses<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.129> fits<00:01:05.369> down<00:01:05.689> inside<00:01:06.689> my

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
collapses and fits down inside my

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.170 
collapses and fits down inside my
cooking<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.560> once<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.400> take<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> stove

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
cooking for once I take all the stove

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.330 
cooking for once I take all the stove
and<00:01:09.210> everything<00:01:09.659> apart<00:01:09.990> everything<00:01:10.770> winds<00:01:11.159> up

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and everything apart everything winds up

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.719 
and everything apart everything winds up
fitting<00:01:11.520> inside<00:01:11.909> cooking<00:01:12.510> utensils<00:01:13.729> sport

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
fitting inside cooking utensils sport

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.539 
fitting inside cooking utensils sport
and<00:01:14.939> whatnot<00:01:15.799> there<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.009> everything<00:01:17.430> all

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and whatnot there it is everything all

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.109 
and whatnot there it is everything all
in<00:01:17.580> one<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.259> quite<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:20.119> it's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
in one so I do use that quite a bit it's

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.870 
in one so I do use that quite a bit it's
one<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.420> favorite<00:01:21.750> cooking<00:01:21.990> systems<00:01:22.880> only

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
one of my favorite cooking systems only

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
one of my favorite cooking systems only
drawback<00:01:24.450> would<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.840> course<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.530> if

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
drawback would be of course is that if

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.300 
drawback would be of course is that if
you<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.570> be<00:01:27.799> backpacking<00:01:28.799> at

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you are going to be backpacking at

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.539 
you are going to be backpacking at
altitude<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> probably<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.040> system

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
altitude this is probably not the system

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300 
altitude this is probably not the system
of<00:01:32.640> choice<00:01:32.850> given<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> fact<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.189> you<00:01:35.189> will

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
of choice given the fact that you will

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
of choice given the fact that you will
start<00:01:35.549> losing<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.659> power<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
start losing some of your power on the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
start losing some of your power on the
cooking<00:01:37.680> surface<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.150> other

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
cooking surface like that the other

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.069 
cooking surface like that the other
option<00:01:39.689> again<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.549> was

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
option again is that if you use one was

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.530 
option again is that if you use one was
that<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.140> didn't<00:01:43.409> speak<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:45.329> that's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
that I didn't speak of for one that's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.460 
that I didn't speak of for one that's
similar<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.700> Coleman<00:01:48.350> systems<00:01:49.350> like

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
similar to the the Coleman systems like

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.440 
similar to the the Coleman systems like
this<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> use<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> regulator<00:01:50.670> there's<00:01:51.270> also

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
this that use the regulator there's also

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.060 
this that use the regulator there's also
the<00:01:52.020> ones<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.259> look<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.040> are

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the ones that look like this that are

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.590 
the ones that look like this that are
the<00:01:53.399> liquid<00:01:54.680> pump<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.829> types<00:01:56.149> then<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.329> fill

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the liquid pump up types then you fill

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.990 
the liquid pump up types then you fill
the<00:01:57.750> canisters<00:01:58.259> refillable<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.610> white

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the canisters refillable with like white

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.289 
the canisters refillable with like white
gas<00:02:00.619> kerosene<00:02:01.619> whatnot<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.280> those<00:02:02.790> are<00:02:02.969> very

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
gas kerosene whatnot and those are very

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.480 
gas kerosene whatnot and those are very
reliable<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.990> well<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.040> fill<00:02:05.189> those<00:02:05.310> with

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
reliable as well you can fill those with

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.320 
reliable as well you can fill those with
a<00:02:05.520> fuel<00:02:05.759> pump<00:02:06.060> them<00:02:06.270> up<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
a fuel pump them up and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.790 
a fuel pump them up and
old<00:02:07.450> flame<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:07.870> your<00:02:08.110> peer<00:02:08.560> at<00:02:08.650> higher

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
old flame is your peer at higher

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.380 
old flame is your peer at higher
altitude<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.280> puppet<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:09.940> more<00:02:10.119> pressure

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
altitude you puppet with more pressure

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.130 
altitude you puppet with more pressure
so<00:02:11.080> it's<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.260> lot<00:02:11.440> like<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:12.010> but<00:02:12.760> it's<00:02:13.140> but

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so it's a lot like this but it's but

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.140 
so it's a lot like this but it's but
it's<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.320> pump<00:02:14.530> up<00:02:14.680> style<00:02:14.980> still<00:02:15.700> again<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:15.970> like

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it's a pump up style still again I like

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's a pump up style still again I like
the<00:02:16.330> system<00:02:16.660> because<00:02:16.870> there's<00:02:17.050> no<00:02:17.170> pumping<00:02:17.560> or

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
the system because there's no pumping or

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.930 
the system because there's no pumping or
whatever<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.160> regulator<00:02:18.550> handles

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
whatever the regulator handles

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.120 
whatever the regulator handles
everything<00:02:19.210> for<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.170> liquid

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
everything for you but the liquid

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.190 
everything for you but the liquid
canister<00:02:21.730> pump<00:02:22.000> up<00:02:22.120> styles<00:02:22.510> are<00:02:22.690> also<00:02:22.840> another

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
canister pump up styles are also another

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.260 
canister pump up styles are also another
option<00:02:23.680> as<00:02:23.770> well<00:02:23.800> for<00:02:24.340> altitude<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.030> cold

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
option as well for altitude and cold

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.810 
option as well for altitude and cold
temperatures
