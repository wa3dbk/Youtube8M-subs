from North South survival and uh just

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.990 
from North South survival and uh just
here<00:00:23.410> at<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:23.560> quick<00:00:23.740> product<00:00:24.190> demo<00:00:24.460> I<00:00:24.490> probably

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
here at a quick product demo I probably

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.400 
here at a quick product demo I probably
guys<00:00:25.210> probably<00:00:25.480> heard<00:00:25.690> of<00:00:25.779> this<00:00:25.840> product<00:00:26.260> but

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
guys probably heard of this product but

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.170 
guys probably heard of this product but
I<00:00:26.470> had<00:00:26.650> an<00:00:26.830> opportunity<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.460> field-test<00:00:27.820> this

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
I had an opportunity to field-test this

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.350 
I had an opportunity to field-test this
so<00:00:28.930> I<00:00:29.470> thought<00:00:29.980> I<00:00:30.040> would<00:00:30.130> make<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.760> video<00:00:30.970> on<00:00:31.240> it

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
so I thought I would make a video on it

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.200 
so I thought I would make a video on it
it's<00:00:32.110> called<00:00:32.320> a<00:00:32.380> SteriPEN<00:00:32.920> right<00:00:33.580> here<00:00:33.820> and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
it's called a SteriPEN right here and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's called a SteriPEN right here and
it's<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.900> water<00:00:35.230> purification<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:36.720> system<00:00:37.720> and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
it's a water purification a system and

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.030 
it's a water purification a system and
it<00:00:38.110> has<00:00:39.840> an<00:00:40.840> ultraviolet<00:00:41.559> light<00:00:41.770> right<00:00:42.010> here

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
it has an ultraviolet light right here

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.270 
it has an ultraviolet light right here
that<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.640> use<00:00:42.910> to<00:00:43.590> put<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.680> in<00:00:44.769> the<00:00:44.830> water<00:00:45.040> and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
that you use to put it in the water and

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.979 
that you use to put it in the water and
you<00:00:45.400> stir<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.820> water<00:00:46.030> around<00:00:46.360> if<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:46.809> look

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
you stir the water around if you look

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.650 
you stir the water around if you look
close<00:00:47.260> right<00:00:47.530> here<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.730> got<00:00:48.940> like<00:00:49.120> sensors

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
close right here it's got like sensors

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.680 
close right here it's got like sensors
on<00:00:50.019> either<00:00:50.379> side<00:00:50.739> these<00:00:51.489> things<00:00:51.790> when<00:00:52.600> you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
on either side these things when you

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.570 
on either side these things when you
when<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.019> put<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.500> pen<00:00:53.769> into<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.159> water<00:00:54.400> they

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
when you put the pen into the water they

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.160 
when you put the pen into the water they
sense<00:00:54.909> the<00:00:55.360> water<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.409> turns<00:00:56.620> on<00:00:56.799> the<00:00:56.979> bulb

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
sense the water and it turns on the bulb

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.110 
sense the water and it turns on the bulb
it<00:00:59.170> won't<00:00:59.409> filter<00:00:59.830> out<00:01:00.010> like<00:01:00.400> heavy<00:01:00.670> metals

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
it won't filter out like heavy metals

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.810 
it won't filter out like heavy metals
and<00:01:01.299> stuff<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.830> know<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:03.250> probably

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
and stuff and you know you probably

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.719 
and stuff and you know you probably
should<00:01:04.120> kind<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.510> like<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:06.100> an<00:01:06.220> idea<00:01:06.490> where

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
should kind of like have an idea where

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.210 
should kind of like have an idea where
your<00:01:06.850> sources<00:01:07.470> most<00:01:08.470> times<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:08.890> know<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.040> I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
your sources most times you know and I

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.760 
your sources most times you know and I
guess<00:01:09.400> you're<00:01:09.610> in<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.850> field<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.619> don't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
guess you're in the field and you don't

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.950 
guess you're in the field and you don't
know<00:01:11.890> exactly<00:01:12.220> where<00:01:12.460> your<00:01:12.610> sources<00:01:13.090> but<00:01:13.390> you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
know exactly where your sources but you

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.330 
know exactly where your sources but you
know<00:01:14.080> won't<00:01:14.350> filter<00:01:14.619> out<00:01:14.680> heavy<00:01:14.890> metals<00:01:15.250> it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
know won't filter out heavy metals it

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.550 
know won't filter out heavy metals it
will<00:01:15.460> filter<00:01:15.670> out<00:01:15.790> like<00:01:16.200> it'll<00:01:17.200> kill<00:01:17.380> like

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
will filter out like it'll kill like

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.380 
will filter out like it'll kill like
Giardia<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.100> all<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.700> other<00:01:18.820> kind<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.180> stuff

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
Giardia and all that other kind of stuff

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.020 
Giardia and all that other kind of stuff
that's<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.310> water<00:01:21.520> it'll<00:01:21.760> make<00:01:21.909> it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
that's that's in the water it'll make it

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.090 
that's that's in the water it'll make it
safe<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.390> drink<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.810> takes<00:01:22.990> about<00:01:23.109> 90<00:01:23.590> seconds

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
safe to drink it takes about 90 seconds

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.420 
safe to drink it takes about 90 seconds
to<00:01:24.130> filter<00:01:24.930> liter<00:01:25.930> of<00:01:26.049> water<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.649> you're<00:01:27.250> just

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
to filter liter of water and you're just

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.740 
to filter liter of water and you're just
basically<00:01:27.880> you're<00:01:28.210> going<00:01:28.329> to<00:01:28.390> just<00:01:28.479> stir<00:01:28.719> it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
basically you're going to just stir it

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.289 
basically you're going to just stir it
around<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.409> in<00:01:30.159> 90<00:01:30.490> seconds<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.939> got<00:01:31.060> fresh

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
around and in 90 seconds you got fresh

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.020 
around and in 90 seconds you got fresh
drinking<00:01:31.659> water<00:01:31.689> I<00:01:32.109> did<00:01:32.530> bring<00:01:32.710> my<00:01:32.799> mic<00:01:33.640> added

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
drinking water I did bring my mic added

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.179 
drinking water I did bring my mic added
in<00:01:34.149> water<00:01:34.420> filter<00:01:34.869> as<00:01:35.049> well<00:01:35.109> I<00:01:35.500> mean<00:01:35.859> as<00:01:36.039> we

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
in water filter as well I mean as we

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.010 
in water filter as well I mean as we
know<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:36.729> is<00:01:36.880> an<00:01:37.000> electronic<00:01:37.509> device<00:01:37.630> it

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
know this is an electronic device it

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.399 
know this is an electronic device it
runs<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.409> battery<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.909> could<00:01:40.179> fail<00:01:40.479> in<00:01:41.170> the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
runs on a battery this could fail in the

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.639 
runs on a battery this could fail in the
field<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.909> it<00:01:43.090> does<00:01:43.299> fail<00:01:43.329> at<00:01:44.020> least<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.320> had<00:01:44.469> my

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
field if it does fail at least I had my

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.489 
field if it does fail at least I had my
cadogan<00:01:45.130> pump<00:01:45.399> to<00:01:46.390> pump<00:01:46.689> one<00:01:46.899> of<00:01:47.049> manually

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
cadogan pump to pump one of manually

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.260 
cadogan pump to pump one of manually
then<00:01:47.679> again<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:47.979> can<00:01:48.100> always<00:01:48.189> boil<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.820> too<00:01:48.999> so

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
then again you can always boil it too so

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.200 
then again you can always boil it too so
I<00:01:49.299> doesn't<00:01:50.079> see<00:01:50.229> is<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.499> key<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:51.700> let's<00:01:51.939> go<00:01:52.149> to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
I doesn't see is the key so let's go to

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.270 
I doesn't see is the key so let's go to
our<00:01:52.359> correspondent<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.499> field<00:01:53.829> on<00:01:54.159> the
