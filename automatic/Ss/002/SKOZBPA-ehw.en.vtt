00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
wide master which means there's nothing

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:50.569 
wide master which means there's nothing
in<00:00:50.430> it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
in it

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.479

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
seconds of that just to be safe then I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.810 
seconds of that just to be safe then I
had<00:00:55.410> someone<00:00:55.680> throw<00:00:56.039> off<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> skateboard<00:00:56.760> on

the<00:01:56.369> final<00:01:56.610> shot<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:57.990> right<00:01:58.170> here

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.710 

Wow<00:02:04.620> for<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.580> actual<00:02:05.940> animation<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.570> sent

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
Wow for the actual animation just sent

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.059 
Wow for the actual animation just sent
two<00:02:06.840> keyframes<00:02:07.080> from<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.560> top<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.950> hill

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
two keyframes from the top of the hill

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.650 
two keyframes from the top of the hill
to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> bottom<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:08.819> add<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> tiny<00:02:09.270> curve

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to the bottom and then add a tiny curve

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.170 
to the bottom and then add a tiny curve
if<00:02:10.380> you're<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.830> set<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> ball<00:02:11.700> grab<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
if you're on set you have a ball grab a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.460 
if you're on set you have a ball grab a
tennis<00:02:12.480> ball<00:02:12.630> or<00:02:12.660> something<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.110> check<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
tennis ball or something and check it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.930 
tennis ball or something and check it
the<00:02:13.590> same<00:02:13.920> way<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> character<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the same way you want the character to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.030 
the same way you want the character to
go<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.720> same<00:02:15.959> landing<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.890> can

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
go the same landing so that you can

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.220 
go the same landing so that you can
actually<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.400> track<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.970> ball<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.450> then

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
actually just track that ball and then

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.199 
actually just track that ball and then
do<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> curve<00:02:19.740> that's<00:02:20.640> all<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.850> learned<00:02:21.030> from

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
do the curve that's all I learned from

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.720 
do the curve that's all I learned from
physics<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.930> helped<00:02:22.050> me<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.260> filmmaking

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
physics but it helped me in filmmaking

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:31.280 
physics but it helped me in filmmaking
imagine<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:28.280> nice<00:02:30.140> skateboarding<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.200> the

can't<00:02:39.690> do<00:02:39.780> without<00:02:39.989> shoes<00:02:40.230> dude<00:02:40.709> where<00:02:41.010> was

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
can't do without shoes dude where was

can't do without shoes dude where was
the<00:02:41.220> little<00:02:41.459> gauge<00:02:41.640> did<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.239> see<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.510> gauge

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
the little gauge did you see the gauge

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.140 
the little gauge did you see the gauge
on<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.140> there<00:02:43.830> was<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.310> sticker<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.850> here

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150

on here there was like a sticker on here
that<00:02:45.209> said<00:02:45.630> advance<00:02:46.110> Pro<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.730> like

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that said advance Pro and then like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.910 
that said advance Pro and then like
amateur<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.050> went<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.350> all<00:02:49.500> down<00:02:49.769> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
amateur and it went like all down the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.100 
amateur and it went like all down the
list<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.940> very<00:02:51.120> bottom<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.540> at<00:02:51.660> level<00:02:51.930> 1

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
list and the very bottom it's at level 1

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.390 
list and the very bottom it's at level 1
and<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.470> what<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.769> board<00:02:53.010> was<00:02:53.100> for

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and that's what this board was for

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.520 
and that's what this board was for
because<00:02:54.330> we<00:02:54.480> do<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.750> love<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.140> didn't<00:02:55.350> level

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
because we do to love it we didn't level

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.480 
because we do to love it we didn't level
one<00:02:55.680> trick<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> level<00:02:56.700> 1<00:02:56.940> that's<00:02:57.209> nuts
