00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
clutch or purse when you have the little

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.290 
clutch or purse when you have the little
thing<00:04:50.030> on<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.330> so<00:04:50.980> I<00:04:51.980> really<00:04:52.400> really<00:04:52.910> liked<00:04:53.120> it

so<00:04:54.050> this<00:04:54.440> purse<00:04:55.070> cost<00:04:56.060> thirty<00:04:56.600> eight<00:04:56.930> dollars

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
so this purse cost thirty eight dollars

so this purse cost thirty eight dollars
which<00:04:58.480> personally<00:04:59.480> I'm<00:04:59.930> on<00:05:00.200> a<00:05:00.230> budget<00:05:00.500> but<00:05:00.860> I

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
which personally I'm on a budget but I

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.600 
which personally I'm on a budget but I
think<00:05:01.130> $38<00:05:01.940> isn't<00:05:02.450> bad<00:05:02.720> for<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:03.080> purse

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
think $38 isn't bad for a purse

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.010 
think $38 isn't bad for a purse
especially<00:05:04.610> when<00:05:04.760> it's<00:05:04.940> two<00:05:05.210> purses<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:05.810> one

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
especially when it's two purses in one

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.130 
especially when it's two purses in one
so<00:05:06.710> I<00:05:07.070> really<00:05:07.580> really<00:05:07.850> liked<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.450> just
