00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.570
 Photo editing applications are not 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 many but they are quite complete in the act 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.969
 and pretty route and ended up blaming the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:51.180

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:27.979

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:30.619
 I have this one that is an application already 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.319

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.380

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:39.409

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.210
 I'm going to open a photo here for a solution. 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.210

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.070

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.130
 I do not know, you can see the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.830
 my cell phone screen has a large screen 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.280
 filters here that I do not use much 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.280
 This app's filters run bland 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.750
 it has the option of you softens the skin 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.580
 But you have to watch out, otherwise I'll stay. 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.590
 appearing puppet skin has the option of 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.120
 take out the acne 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:31.780
 here is the option of you emaciated face 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.780
 so the face any part of the body is not 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.020
 also gives you to take away the dark circles 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:53.030
 here you can increase the size of 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.030
 eyes and increase eye brightness 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.670
 I have this too 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:13.440
 that this one for me is one of the applications 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:19.050
 more complete with him, I can 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:23.970
 adjust is brightness contrast is the focus of 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.410
 photo I can adjust the co 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.980
 the teeth 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.160
 it also has many filters if I open 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.250
 This app will be up tomorrow by doing 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:43.080
 a lot of combination filters then 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:45.630
 I hardly open it and it has a part 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.780
 very cool too that it is this part that 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.780
 You put lights on the photo. 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.670
 This is the part you love the most. 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.670
 app 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:17.170

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.730

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.570
 what is the cocanut 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.570
 I think that's it 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:33.140
 and this is my favorite he has a 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.740
 tumblr photo effect effects 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.740
 retroactive 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.730
 What I most use is t1 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.110
 you can also adjust the intensity 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.110
 of the filter 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:09.930
 the part from here that is the pix here that he 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.930
 also has multiple filters 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.950
 And then you can also move 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:25.480
 set up to make you that is the photo 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.960
 it also has this illegal part that the 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.240
 from the most expensive one that also has 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:38.140
 those lights but these are different 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:41.290
 the other application lets me do 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:46.080
 making a photo on high that does not give 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.080
 to see here 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:12.620
 Another cool thing about him is that part here. 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.620
 shape 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:24.810
 here you can vote heart can bounce 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:28.220

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.370

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.370
 put the whole photo in instagram 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.060
 editing the white border or the 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:07:03.370

00:06:51.060 --> 00:07:08.350

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:12.300
 shakes it has already been chosen but 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.300
 random assemblies for me is 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.070
