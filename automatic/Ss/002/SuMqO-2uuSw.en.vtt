00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.130
 discharges associates so you have a 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.960

 colors so for blonde and for day 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.880
 a customer c5 is below before our 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.970
 quest for small drawers like that with 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.150
 a mini brozat of a pawn level and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.040
 then a mini laptop and it's great 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.840
 it's very small it's very 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.579
 easy to take on a trip so it's 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.229
 perfect for the summer I wanted to buy myself 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.869
 a creamy babe did not want to take 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.030
 the one at maybelline not I wanted 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.399
 test a new one so I took the baby 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.430
 cream of her home that sense I have the all 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.110
 baby in one crime has to date 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:01.369
 get 0.2 nacho there is a spf 30 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.840
 it's great and it's too dark 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.159
 so I can only go m when I answer 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 it's because I put once and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.110
 I could not wait was not even dawn I had 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.920
 brown attack the hyper covering between 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.270
 two patients 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.730
 my best friend went to France 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.920
 with a friend not long ago and she 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.900
 knew I wanted a dry shampoo 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.370
 waste baptista she bought it from me 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.879
 I was too fashionable 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.379
 No, because we want we went to Switzerland 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.280
 and I wanted to test so much because 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.800
 a long time so these are these 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.099
 people thought in large format 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.890
 it's the floral and feminine bluff with 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.379
 the ports like that I test them a 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.090
 I have a dry shampoo 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.129
 celio csu it leaves less residue 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.739
 white as a result of you that I have so 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.129
 it's great already but I do not know that 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.459
 times so little boss talk for 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.400
 Nothing 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:58.349
 to finish I bought a minya kit 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.730
 diarrhea at nuxe because in fact we 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.500
 speaks so much of the luxury brand but 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.730
 months to buy large format that 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.120
 listen I do not know how many francs 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.030
 kind 7 quotas in real the thing I 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.260
 did not want to invest something and after 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.209
 not like it so I prefer to take a 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.129
 ticket that was not at all expensive with 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.680
 five products so there is a water 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.390
 cleanser that I do not like at all 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.080
 besides, because I was trying to 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.540
 pay everything there is an evening load antilles 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.700
 to julie are there is a cream 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.120
 moisturizing a shower gel and oil 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.700
 prodigious to the world at the time of the atc 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.590
 this one but 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.690
 I think I'll take it when I 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.129
 gone on vacation because there's 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.080
 really everything and it's super convenient 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.000
 little site to the small to the first accessory 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.629
 it's an agent I bought from 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.959
 clear's so this is a headband with some 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.250
 flowers as if so it's super pretty 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.340
 for the summer I find 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.700
 and when it's sunny all you 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.010
 put that on hair you do this 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.590
 bun behind short without playing I 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.690
 find that so much I bought in 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.400
 necklace from h &amp; m because I bought 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.319

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.519
 I did not have what the accessory and I 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.459
 so I went to get but I 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.549
 I found this necklace I find it super 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.200
 pretty brown bronze a bit like that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.180
 I bought myself a pair of 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.850
 shoes but that I wanted since 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.320
 so long I filmed it on Thursday 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.090
 I bought myself on Monday 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.729
 I know for so 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.169
 long and kind I got message 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:38.130

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.080
 it's the seals nike air force one that 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.570
 I wanted so much so much 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.030
 it's low because they're more 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.400
 easy to wear that you find for 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.780
 what you know what she looks like t 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.340
 but baby and I feel like I'm going to them 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.530
 wear kind all the time because 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.539
 I love I bought a black cocktail 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.370
 precisely to maintain birthday 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.190
 that I had to do 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.470
 I bought a simple black croc top 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.310
 basic ramonjean from at home of 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.470
 at zebra so it's really a small 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.139
 black shorts you in there is no more 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.880
 simple that I went to bershka 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.550
 eject a white cropped top t-shirt 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.110
 so here it is these people with stuff 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.419
 toyota is so good black and the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.760
 white that co here but I 'm going there 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:24.419
 very simple also it has a little wider 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.690
 than the other but it's perfect if ogier 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.160
 my dance show so in fact I 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.930
 will post the video on Sunday but 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.010
 usually show including saturday 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.410
 from before but in short 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.450
 so I had to buy another climber 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.189
 and that I bought at taleo is left 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.759
 a top group with 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.740
 he climbs a little indented like that so 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.599
 it's all a little bit all really basic 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.729
 it's great in peace all these people the 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.409
 find too comfortable with that I 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.560
 had to take a high waist leggins 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.659
 so I bought them at new yorker 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.550
 he has property if ever low in France 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.930
 he did not name them again but if you 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.300
 are in Switzerland we said well like that 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.419
 so it's a high waist leggins in 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.569
 done where the cia an elastic and where he is 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.370
 hyper tight kind but two or jean he 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.039
 really serves you and thigh at the beginning 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.589
 both take 38 pages made of 38 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.659
 but he was super tight people so I 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:19.270
 had to take 40 and he's still tight 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.159
 but so it goes when you assured 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.020
 lynch all without the 4th of july I'm going to 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.589
 concert of one direction and I wanted 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.990
 a sweater compared to them we will say 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.659
 so I finally have a friend of mine 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.509

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.370

 so I took one like that where his 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:03.189
 marks and minh hanh memories so that's 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.229
 the name of one of their songs 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.029
 but short but in fact it's the name 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.499
 of one of their songs but I can 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:10.330
