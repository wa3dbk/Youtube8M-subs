if<00:00:00.269> you<00:00:00.450> get<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.870> air-conditioning<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.680> cool

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
if you get the air-conditioning to cool

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.610 
if you get the air-conditioning to cool
down<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:03.000> around<00:00:03.270> 40<00:00:03.720> degrees<00:00:03.750> son<00:00:04.410> you've

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
down to around 40 degrees son you've

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.720 
down to around 40 degrees son you've
done<00:00:04.650> something<00:00:05.220> that's<00:00:05.279> an<00:00:05.490> air

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
done something that's an air

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.179 
done something that's an air
conditioning<00:00:06.240> right<00:00:06.359> there<00:00:06.919> and<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.099> little

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
conditioning right there and that little

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.830 
conditioning right there and that little
orifice<00:00:08.610> tube<00:00:08.790> change<00:00:09.120> will<00:00:09.330> help<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.660> with

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
orifice tube change will help you with

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.700 
orifice tube change will help you with
that<00:00:11.509> now<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.570> want<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.080> your<00:00:13.259> pressures

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
that now you want to have your pressures

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.779 
that now you want to have your pressures
right<00:00:13.980> about<00:00:14.309> 30<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.420> between<00:00:16.379> 150<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.039> 175

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
right about 30 and between 150 and 175

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.269 
right about 30 and between 150 and 175
now<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.779> got<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.140> truck<00:00:19.410> idled<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.100> little

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
now we got this truck idled up a little

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.250 
now we got this truck idled up a little
bit<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> create<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.140> little

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
bit so it's going to create a little

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.429 
bit so it's going to create a little
higher<00:00:22.529> pressure<00:00:23.570> okay<00:00:24.570> now<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> finish<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.320> we

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
higher pressure okay now to finish up we

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.839 
higher pressure okay now to finish up we
need<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> pull<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> jumper<00:00:26.430> out<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
need to pull the jumper out of the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.630 
need to pull the jumper out of the
lowest<00:00:27.330> pressure<00:00:27.660> switch<00:00:28.650> plug<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
lowest pressure switch plug here and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.659 
lowest pressure switch plug here and
reattach<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.740> low<00:00:31.890> pressure<00:00:32.219> switch

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
reattach that the low pressure switch

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.319 
reattach that the low pressure switch
actually<00:00:33.000> dictates<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.020> amount<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:35.329> running

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
actually dictates the amount of running

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.810 
actually dictates the amount of running
that<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> compressor<00:00:37.290> does<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.160> idea<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that the compressor does the idea is to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.819 
that the compressor does the idea is to
keep<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> compressor<00:00:39.690> from<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.680> know

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
keep the compressor from you know

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
keep the compressor from you know
blowing<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> hoses<00:00:41.790> apart<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.809> really<00:00:43.230> when

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
blowing the hoses apart but really when

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.190 
blowing the hoses apart but really when
the<00:00:43.559> pressure<00:00:43.800> gets<00:00:44.450> when<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.480> gets<00:00:45.840> hotter

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the pressure gets when it gets hotter

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.069 
the pressure gets when it gets hotter
outside<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.160> pressure<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.760> greater<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.420> this

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
outside the pressure is greater on this

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
outside the pressure is greater on this
switch<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> result<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.670> compressor<00:00:51.059> will

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
switch as a result the compressor will

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.650 
switch as a result the compressor will
be<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.690> more<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:53.100> hot<00:00:53.399> situation<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.420> just

sort<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> works<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.070> part<00:00:56.280> of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
sort of works out that way it's part of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.819 
sort of works out that way it's part of
the<00:00:56.430> design<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.840> very<00:00:58.079> important<00:00:58.620> that

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the design now it's very important that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.240 
the design now it's very important that
you<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.609> leave<00:00:59.850> these<00:01:00.149> caps<00:01:00.539> off<00:01:00.870> as<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you don't leave these caps off as you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.200 
you don't leave these caps off as you
unhook<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.490> loose<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> little<00:01:08.909> bit<00:01:09.000> out<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
unhook it will loose a little bit out of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.600 
unhook it will loose a little bit out of
the<00:01:09.270> hose<00:01:09.740> it's<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.010> important<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.400> put

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the hose it's very important you put

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.080 
the hose it's very important you put

these plugs back on you don't ever want
to<00:01:15.210> put<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> hoses<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.650> or<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> hoses

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to put the hoses on or take the hoses

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.280 
to put the hoses on or take the hoses
off<00:01:18.229> Quinn<00:01:20.210> there's<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> lot<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.689> pressure<00:01:21.960> on

one<00:01:58.890> had<00:01:59.310> freon<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.880> when<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.090> got<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.479> so

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
one had freon in it when we got here so

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.990 
one had freon in it when we got here so
I<00:02:00.719> know<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.469> little<00:02:01.740> pressurized<00:02:02.250> now

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
I know that it's little pressurized now

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.090 
I know that it's little pressurized now
we've<00:02:03.180> completed<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.899> repair<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
we've completed this repair and the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.560 
we've completed this repair and the
customer<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.610> go<00:02:05.880> back<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.240> carrying

customer can go back to carrying
patients<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.729> okay<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:08.970> be

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
patients with it okay so would be

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.020 
patients with it okay so would be
in<00:02:09.360> here<00:02:09.950> first<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.040> all<00:02:11.250> when<00:02:11.460> we<00:02:11.580> take<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:11.850> low

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030

letter<00:02:39.510> low<00:02:39.750> pressure<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.680> means<00:02:40.950> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
letter low pressure that means that

there's a clog in the system somewhere
usually<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.820> get<00:02:45.000> some<00:02:45.180> debris<00:02:45.420> right<00:02:46.080> here

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
usually you get some debris right here

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.860 
usually you get some debris right here
at<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.650> orifice<00:02:46.950> tube<00:02:47.370> when<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.270> get<00:02:48.510> debris

at the orifice tube when you get debris
buildup<00:02:49.140> at<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> orphanage<00:02:50.010> tube<00:02:50.310> is

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
buildup at the orphanage tube is

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.030 
buildup at the orphanage tube is
generally<00:02:51.480> an<00:02:51.570> indicator<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
generally an indicator that the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.620 
generally an indicator that the
compressor<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.820> fixing<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.300> go<00:02:54.480> away

compressor is fixing to go away

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.330 
compressor is fixing to go away
especially<00:02:55.080> if<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.620> metal<00:02:55.830> shavings<00:02:56.070> that's

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
especially if it's metal shavings that's

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.860 
especially if it's metal shavings that's
why<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.580> always<00:02:56.940> check<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.360> orifice<00:02:57.690> tube

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
why you always check the orifice tube

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.970 
why you always check the orifice tube
when<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.830> any<00:02:59.010> service<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> system

when you do any service to the system

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.410 
when you do any service to the system
when<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> compressor<00:03:02.610> starts<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.060> wear<00:03:03.180> out

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
when a compressor starts to wear out

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.300 
when a compressor starts to wear out
you'll<00:03:03.690> see<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.170> pressure<00:03:04.530> go<00:03:04.770> up<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.220> this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
you'll see this pressure go up and this

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.520 
you'll see this pressure go up and this
pressure<00:03:05.580> go<00:03:05.880> down<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.870> other<00:03:06.960> words<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.380> one

pressure go down in other words this one
is<00:03:07.620> start<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.950> creep<00:03:08.130> up<00:03:08.310> about<00:03:08.580> 50<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.330> this

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
is start to creep up about 50 and this

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.300 
is start to creep up about 50 and this
one<00:03:10.050> will<00:03:10.140> start<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.560> creep<00:03:10.770> down<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.160> about

100<00:03:11.700> 110<00:03:12.270> something<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.560> means

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
100 110 something like this that means

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.620 
100 110 something like this that means
that<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.980> compressor<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.910> no<00:03:15.060> longer<00:03:15.420> making
