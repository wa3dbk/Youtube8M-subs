00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.790

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.940
 villebon in the essonne a discipline 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.889
 which has the wind in its sails 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.440
 French athletes are pretty good 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.179
 placed in the competition the region has 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.800
 not had the jo but she welcomes the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.320
 twirling world championships stick 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.630
 in villebon en essonne we will see with 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.760
 the chairman of the departmental committee that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.949
 it's a booming discipline but 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.189
 before instead at the show with antoine 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.620
 bourdarias and jacques guilbaud a scholar 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.480
 mix of gymnastics dance and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.730
 throw away stick that's what could 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.079
 define the twirling stick grace and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.030
 flexibility are the key words of this 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.829
 artistic discipline practice solo 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 duo or team 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.450
 but be careful not to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.860
 to confuse with cheerleaders to the real 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.570
 difference is that turing is a 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.150
 sport while the cheerleaders 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.880
 it's really physical yes yes 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.610
 about the fate of a workout 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.530
 messi 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.150
 we exhaust last training for 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.210
 laurine before her free program in front of 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.190
 the jury 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.270
 the result of years of exercise and a 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.890
 millimeter training 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.899
 club in the morning you have breakfast I know that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.390
 9am kills in practice only these cases 9:10 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.770
 you running around all these cases 9:12 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.560
 who is shooting at your legs 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.210
 you're right it's extra unlike 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.939
 to the received ideas the stick twirling is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.030
 not exclusively female between 5 and 10 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.030
 % of licensees are boys remain 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.740
 a minority of licensees but they have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.610
 still an important place within 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.710
 the sport that is as 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.690
 already the competition at the championships of 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.250
 world where we are there are already three 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.140
 boys in junior and three boys in 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.700
 seniors who represent France a 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.500
 France team that excels in 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.690
 discipline especially thanks to its 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.450
 free programs by team france 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.670
 is the second nation several 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.229
 world 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.049
 there is the combined ranking of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.280
 medals and behind the Japan the 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.140
 French have until Sunday to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.820
 outsmart the prognoses and maybe 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.680
 rejected their stick since the first 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.929
 podium and we find 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.910
 Dominique Pouliquen Committee Chair 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.100
 departmental twirling stick in 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.530
 try to wait 15000 spectators 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.069
 in all in villebon this weekend how 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.569
 explain this craze 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.569
 yes good evening actually we are waiting 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.430
 15000 spectators and massively 5500 and 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.480
 5500 saturday to sunday that is already doing 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.380
 eleven thousand 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.459
 how to explain it simply 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.930
 because the roof a date one is a 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.850
 helps a sport evolving in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.160
 France at a rate of 5 to 7% increase 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.170
 license by one year at present 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.860
 so it's a real phenomenon 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.680
 develops in France 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.010
 hence the success of these championships 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.900
 world 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.730
 in the Paris region which is itself 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.049
 the biggest region of France so 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.730
 here we were a little surprised we 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.230
 same by the enthusiasm generated by these 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.819
 championships this is an opportunity to see 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.709
 the best and for once the audience 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.330
 answered present then with legion in 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.230
 this moment it's not a bit frustrating that 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.549
 discipline are not represented 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.190
 so frustrating no it's all 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.209
 simply realistic I think 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.190
 some countries are those at the level of 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.570
 Olympic sports such as Japan well 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.489
 sure the united states and france 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.709
 but there is still a lot to develop 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.790
 sport in other countries of the world and 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.859
 also to develop the structures 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.480
 adequate for that at the French level 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.299
 I think you have to take your time 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.560
 can we hope to do it through 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.359
 the world dance federation 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.620
 sports we belong to 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.910
 now since the end of the year 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.359
 last which is itself recognized by 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.150
 the cio 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.980
 France is recognized by the committee 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.049
 National Olympic and Sports Association 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.780
 this is a first such italy 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.579
 here we are realistic from here 15 10 to 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.380
 15 years old we should be able to find the 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.890
 roof of a stick at the games sport 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.180
 Olympic 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.680
 and then this weekend but what there is 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.310
 beings both Parisians who 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.209
 could become champion so that's 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.430
 always the question one is in a 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.910
 sport so uncertainty remains total 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.500
 and entire 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.090
 of course we count on the team of 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.290
 France but frankly against the aces 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.269
 pony it's always a miracle when we 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.859
 wins by the side of that we have a 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.569
 duo in the Paris region since they are from 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.519
 goussainville originally representing 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.930
 France this weekend after the half 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.969
 finals that took place 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.299
 yesterday afternoon they classified themselves for 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:10.670
 the second moment very very little behind 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.670
 Americans if I'm not mistaken and 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.420
 final and precisely to make known 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.769
 this discipline you intend 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.380
 to conquer the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.759
 exactly schools 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.770
 like any sport we would like 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.139
 structures and all to discipline and 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.430
 is a very widespread sport 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.490
 now in France through his 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.560
 structures remain to go back to school 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.449
 attract young children in there 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.070
 develop sports studies that we 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.840
 are sorely lacking at the moment 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.590
 to come to tickle a little more japan 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.660
 as we can do 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.710
 thank you dominique pouliquen for having 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.710
 answered our questions
