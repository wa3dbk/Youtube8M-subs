00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:10.650
 so today I wanted something like that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.620
 surely it interests so many above all 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:20.359
 the mothers who have children in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.359
 especially because it concerns a little 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.180
 this is an American firm and I have it 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.750
 bought from the leader not to do 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:38.890
 classically and like all 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:43.150
 microwave packs is definitely 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:47.800
 surely everyone will have happened to 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:51.260
 smooth gold product consultants 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.040
 then there is the sweet and savory product 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.200
 happened when you put in the microwave 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.030
 generally when from three and a half to four 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.940
 minutes based on microwave power 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.619
 he says it will have happened to you that in the first the 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.509
 sacchettino europa tends to swell yes 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.390
 also opens many of the gods why 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:15.770
 the first steam of peel cremano I have the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.450
 do if one is there if you have noticed 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.690
 more often than not, a part remains 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.360
 not exploded and often there are some 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.890
 burnt case to this party a 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.560
 their day side chain I was dan america 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.439
 ago I made it down the drain them 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.200
 today he had a header but nasty 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:41.229
 misery but how is it possible then I have 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.130
 discovered how not to burn them 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.970
 moreover, I also discovered in the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.540
 same way that they all open not 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.390
 not even a single grain remains 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.310
 is the point where you have to put the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.409
 bag open it move a little bit 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.189
 with your hands so as to soften up like 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.450
 then I'll introduce you to the discussion 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.939
 put it in micron and but don't put it 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.590
 immediately firing three minutes as you do 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.259
 you need to freeze for two 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.879
 minutes and 40 therefore thawing is not 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.099
 gives them 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.330
 how to say all the power of the micron e 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:20.000
 give them impulses so that the lard 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.730
 inside the bag softens yes 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.209
 warms up where I had to go home then 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.900
 cools because thawing 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.760
 it takes place at the same time increases from the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.519
 microwaves then he can then give them to her 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.110
 apple in the quarry so here's what happens 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.930
 when he has finished the cycle of the two 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.060
 minutes and a half now I say this because 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.910
 do it because having been a 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.569
 experiment not perfectly absorbed 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.380
 the timing but more or less this 22 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.500
 23240 when you when the two finished 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.540
 minutes of thawing I repeat is the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.030
 put instead of 4 because rightly 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.379
 you have already played the clots, put them on 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.630
 about two and a half minutes normal as if 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.100
 it was cooked, let's say cooked 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.430
 indirectly as before 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:16.430
 lie attractive and half or state 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:20.540
 be careful to near you almost close 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.819
 almost to the end when 4 5 6 are missing 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.790
 seconds standing behind the nick or not 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.690
 you will notice that there are no explosions 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.250
 I am more 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.920
 here is the time to take off I have 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.440
 detached five seconds before boys 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.359
 there isn't one out of place or done the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.630
 photo now you if the risk as before 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:44.419
 home page and see that this is the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.000
 solution in short, one of many 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:49.760
 nonsense that one proves on the other hand the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.989
 such great inventions came though 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.940
 mistakes don't forget about goodyear not 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.520
 forget other things that I am 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.200
 come like this 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.830
 spain ok it will not help children 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.580
 especially children 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.580
 bye Bye
