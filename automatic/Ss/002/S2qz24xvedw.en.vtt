00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
presented briefly:  Harley Benton Jackamp

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.360
Hello, I'm RenÃ©

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.080
and once again I would like to introduce you to something for your guitar

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.320
let's start with a problem ...

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.860
this is our problem:

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.280
you have a guitar

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.040
and you would like to rock as hell

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.960
without disturbing your neighbors

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.820
the issue with this sound is

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.120
it's fine for excercising but not for jamming

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.160
the solution would be using an amp

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.280
but it's not feasible sitting on the sofa with it

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.400
or moving around the room

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.800
in other words the mobility is limited even with a small amp like this

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.620
some smart guys came up with the idea to fix this by using headphones

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.740
but we will reach a technical limit soon

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.360
it's not about plugging the cable into the guitar because of the small jack

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.480
even when it  fits it you won't hear anything

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.480
what we need is

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.920
an amp so small

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.420
and barely noticable

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.880
so we can do the Chuck Berry "Duck Walk" around the house while playing the guitar

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.680
and such a solution does exist

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.780
some of you may already know

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.680
the Jackamp!

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.480
this small magical gadget works with a battery

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.900
two AAAs if I'm not mistaken

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.680
and it is pretty easy to use

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.480
plug it into your guitar

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.220
put on your headphones

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.380
plug your headphones into the Jackamp

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.040
turn it on

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.700
and rock!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.240
now the problem is you don't hear anything

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360
but I'm prepared for this

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.920
we will need this precious piece

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.420
the Jackamp has a second output here

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.820
as you can hear it is working

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.660
there are different possibilities of setting it up

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.160
you can get a pretty clean sound out of it

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.700
it is even more clean if you use headphones

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.920
the real picture is more like this

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.520
to be more precise it looks like ...

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
... like that

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.020
as I said this is a mobile thing

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.620
that's the metal version made by Harley Benton

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.920
... I guess ...

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.140
... here I'm back again ...

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.680
I guess the metal version is the only one provided by Harley Benton

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.960
that means there is some distortion included

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.760
and here on the side

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.280
you are able to controle tone and volume

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280
the price is ...

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.900
... the price is ...

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.280
what's your guess?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.900
10 Euro

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.300
well, nice thing for a ten-spot

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.580
oops

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
I would handle it with care but it's only 10 bucks

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.100
in any case it fits in every bag

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.160
well, if you carry a guitar around you could bring an amp anyway

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.080
but if you are a guitar player you know what to do with this gadget

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.940
it's recommendable

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.960
if you want to pay some more money you can get it from a different manufacturer such as VOX

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.180
in this case with different sound versions

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.360
and then it's around 40 Euro

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.280
but I'm not sure about the price, look it up in the internet by yourself

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.160
as I said

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.460
the Jackamp

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.760
in other words a ...

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.600
... a "jack amp"

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.440
well, a nice thing

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.700
Jackamp
