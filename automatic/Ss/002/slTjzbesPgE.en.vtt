00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 and all this today is my stunning could 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.839
 which will add in may micros composed 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.349
 add nothing 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.070
 he she will only intensify pork bang 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.890
 genomics of dynamics remains the same 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.210
 there is no caskelen 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:25.760
 it seems everything as usual pores the place they 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:32.060
 there are such red lines but it doesn't matter 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.960
 because this mod forest is for the lazy 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.090
 people who don't want gray mines and 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.570
 for blasting yourself to look 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.540
 faster and immediately I say no 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.850
 I give up on those and this match 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.360
 Tyr cylinder really cheater 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 because 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.950
 where you do not get along wide 10 times found 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.650
 i reserve no fire and let's 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:05.309
 but still show you what power 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:09.860
 healthy dynamics with this now under 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.500
 measuring chores will last longer 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.580
 so you can run away and the radius of it 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.580
 pretty big 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.630
 the box flew 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.720
 Iâ€™ll be fine now 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.329
 so talked pretty big 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.220
 radius is very big when I want to say 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:05.040
 if it were a portion of the map was started 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.259
 it would be very big 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.509
 but you had a sauce subscribe to 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.470
 channel put your thumbs up all thanks 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.470
 bye everyone
