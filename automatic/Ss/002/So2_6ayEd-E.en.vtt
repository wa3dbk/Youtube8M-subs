00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:04.850
 the more dangerous swimming in an unknown water can be for three weeks 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.809
 ago when a 21-year-old student from the city was seriously injured 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.829
 a dive in the paterswoldsemeer 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.479
 he later died of his injuries 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:17.539
 to make children aware of the risks of swimming in the unknown 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.539
 waters today a special swimming lesson 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.279
 Hey 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.179
 not 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.660
 her boat of reality indeed and what happens when the old situation 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.769
 to achieve it seems clear 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.039
 he jumps into a single person and naturally comes bubbling up from the bottom 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.059
 and the word dark and you come under water panic yes but what 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.569
 happens to you what do you do 

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:45.849
 and how can you still only once and therefore also have two 

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:49.379
 teeth practiced to guide each other a little 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.430
 say and to make them feel and there will be a dark swim 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.860
 after the pool was the marina of the next classroom first became the sticks 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.590
 wanted 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.110
 actually not even 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.490
 you get with sticks and 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.610
 we are still searching for state in front of me 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.140
 because it is a meter deep 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.180
 the australian 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.450
 yes then you should watch or not out tonight 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.479
 throw diving there 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.730
 Not me 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.960
 Belga adv 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 r refuse reason 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.590
 everything went very carefully 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.850
 it can be slippery on the bottom and yo, too 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.280
 but of course you don't know how deep it is so we want the kids too 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.070
 give way go feel first benefit shoes because you never know what is there 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.660
 what happens in the water watch as you safely come to the pool from empty 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.050
 then you know that it is all school and that there is no glass on the bottom 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.190
 and stuff like that but of course you just don't know it is one 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.360
 fact yes become tellers and let restore consideration 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.310
 here it is fast 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.960
 she is probably feeling at home because crossing 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.150
 the unions 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.070
 and where are the pirates 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.010
 for you in the minus this does the water to swim 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.280
