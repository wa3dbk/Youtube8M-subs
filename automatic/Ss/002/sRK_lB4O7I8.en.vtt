00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.330
 I wish you all good health today 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.690
 tell how you can identify any 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.090
 dispute the dispute that you can trumpet 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.730
 let's say a bottle to the wall there I will carry 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.900
 As clay loyalty such simply hands 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.230
 there are holes this hole can be like 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.029
 will love so here's how it is done 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.210
 does that mean as two holes go 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.450
 nail means we do it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.620
 Naturally you need to trick 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.180
 show could make and about us 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.820
 required on 101 powerful insert in 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.129
 a bottle 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.180
 we put the bottle in like a stretch 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.809
 that the bottle was hanging 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.739
 and the second we take go on a hat like that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.739
 base and where it relies 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.699
 so you have to love the pointensivnee 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.699
 it turns out the holes just well 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.500
 please we have a hole 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.189
 I do the same on the other side 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.189
 opposite and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:06.330
 perhaps we got two holes 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:09.020
 of which you can push the guest all 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.020
 all the best
