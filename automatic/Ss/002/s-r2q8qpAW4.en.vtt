quite a bump for forza motorsport 5
seriously<00:05:03.380> I<00:05:03.590> mean<00:05:03.740> Forza<00:05:04.190> Motorsport<00:05:04.280> fight

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
seriously I mean Forza Motorsport fight

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.560 
seriously I mean Forza Motorsport fight
I<00:05:05.060> think<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.449> was<00:05:05.479> near<00:05:06.229> about<00:05:07.030> 310<00:05:08.030> maybe<00:05:08.330> even

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
I think it was near about 310 maybe even

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.969 
I think it was near about 310 maybe even
under<00:05:09.110> 300<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.550> to<00:05:10.910> get<00:05:11.060> it<00:05:11.240> back<00:05:11.360> up<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.979> 450

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
under 300 so to get it back up to 450

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.040 
under 300 so to get it back up to 450
that's<00:05:13.490> kind<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:13.850> like<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.180> levels<00:05:14.600> Forza

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050
