00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
to do with the Masters return and how

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.040 
to do with the Masters return and how

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
project v13 which I believe is the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.020 
project v13 which I believe is the
canceled<00:03:08.480> fall<00:03:08.690> MMO<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.550> project<00:03:10.550> van<00:03:10.700> buren

it's<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.140> be<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> major<00:03:15.470> throwback<00:03:15.980> to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
it's going to be a major throwback to

it's going to be a major throwback to
the<00:03:16.160> original<00:03:16.610> games<00:03:16.850> but<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.660> still

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
the original games but it is still

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.870 
the original games but it is still
retaining<00:03:18.440> most<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.220> newer<00:03:19.400> fallouts

gameplay he did talk about the factions

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.560 
gameplay he did talk about the factions
very<00:03:22.190> loosely<00:03:22.520> but<00:03:22.730> from<00:03:22.880> what<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.030> gather<00:03:23.330> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
very loosely but from what I gather the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.060 
very loosely but from what I gather the
Enclave<00:03:23.960> will<00:03:24.080> not<00:03:24.230> be<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> big<00:03:24.680> appearance

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
Enclave will not be a big appearance

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.880 
Enclave will not be a big appearance
like<00:03:25.460> in<00:03:25.610> fall<00:03:25.880> two<00:03:26.180> or<00:03:26.360> three<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.870> may<00:03:27.680> not

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
like in fall two or three and may not

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.140 
like in fall two or three and may not
even<00:03:28.130> have<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.550> small<00:03:29.180> one<00:03:29.660> like<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.410> New<00:03:30.620> Vegas

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
even have a small one like in New Vegas

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.880 
even have a small one like in New Vegas
the<00:03:32.150> NCR<00:03:32.900> will<00:03:33.080> make<00:03:33.200> an<00:03:33.320> appearance<00:03:33.410> although

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
the NCR will make an appearance although

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.280 
the NCR will make an appearance although
I<00:03:34.250> don't<00:03:34.370> know<00:03:34.640> how<00:03:34.820> big<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.330> will<00:03:35.510> be<00:03:35.810> which<00:03:36.260> is

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
I don't know how big it will be which is

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.560 
I don't know how big it will be which is
very<00:03:36.680> stupid<00:03:37.160> because<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.760> NCR<00:03:38.240> will<00:03:38.420> make

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
very stupid because the NCR will make

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.880 
very stupid because the NCR will make
appearance<00:03:39.020> if<00:03:39.170> it's<00:03:39.320> in<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:39.560> territory

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
appearance if it's in this territory

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.070 
appearance if it's in this territory
because<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.910> entire<00:03:41.180> map<00:03:41.390> he's<00:03:41.630> describing

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
because the entire map he's describing

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.690 
because the entire map he's describing
is<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.620> NCR<00:03:43.420> anyways<00:03:44.560> he<00:03:45.560> also<00:03:45.710> says<00:03:46.130> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.330 
was at first but the cathedral was there
was<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.280> nuclear<00:04:29.210> bomb<00:04:29.480> detonated<00:04:30.200> below<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.710> so

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
was a nuclear bomb detonated below it so

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.030 
was a nuclear bomb detonated below it so
I<00:04:31.370> don't<00:04:32.330> think<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.810> can<00:04:32.960> really<00:04:33.170> return<00:04:33.740> I'm

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
I don't think it can really return I'm

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.210 
I don't think it can really return I'm
just<00:04:34.250> saying<00:04:34.460> um<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:36.380> NCR<00:04:36.860> we<00:04:37.040> obviously

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
just saying um the NCR we obviously

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.580 
just saying um the NCR we obviously
exposed<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:38.120> saying<00:04:38.480> that<00:04:38.660> if<00:04:38.930> it's<00:04:39.140> in<00:04:39.410> that

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
exposed that saying that if it's in that

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.140 
exposed that saying that if it's in that
region<00:04:39.890> then<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.400> NCR<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:40.910> going<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.090> be

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
region then the NCR is going to be

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.640 
region then the NCR is going to be
basically<00:04:41.330> controlling<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.050> whole<00:04:42.260> map<00:04:42.470> if

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
basically controlling that whole map if

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.500 
basically controlling that whole map if
it's<00:04:42.800> going<00:04:43.040> down<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.310> timeline<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.970> the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
it's going down the timeline and the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.630 
it's going down the timeline and the
master<00:04:44.900> lives<00:04:45.260> I<00:04:45.620> don't<00:04:46.040> know<00:04:46.190> how<00:04:46.370> he<00:04:46.400> can

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
fake although his words are convincing

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.930 
fake although his words are convincing
and<00:05:10.010> that's<00:05:10.130> why<00:05:10.280> people<00:05:10.490> are<00:05:10.640> coming<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:10.880> my

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
and that's why people are coming to my

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.790 
and that's why people are coming to my
videos<00:05:11.360> now<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.630> trying<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:11.930> prove<00:05:12.470> me<00:05:12.620> wrong
