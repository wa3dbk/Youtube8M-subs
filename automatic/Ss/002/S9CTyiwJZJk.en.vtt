00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
the crowd and that is pincer the reason

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.390 
the crowd and that is pincer the reason
I'm<00:00:13.080> saying<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.590> because<00:00:13.740> makeup<00:00:14.070> pincer

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I'm saying this is because makeup pincer

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.980 
I'm saying this is because makeup pincer
is<00:00:14.519> something<00:00:14.790> I've<00:00:15.000> yet<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.450> face

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
is something I've yet to face

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.050 
is something I've yet to face
I<00:00:16.230> have<00:00:16.590> lack<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.100> experience<00:00:17.609> against<00:00:17.850> one

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
I have lack of experience against one

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.170 
I have lack of experience against one
and<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.600> mega<00:00:19.170> pincer<00:00:19.529> stands<00:00:19.830> out

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
and for that mega pincer stands out

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.400 
and for that mega pincer stands out
amongst<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> rest<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.199> being<00:00:22.320> said

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
amongst the rest so with that being said

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.720 
amongst the rest so with that being said
let's<00:00:22.680> go<00:00:22.800> directly<00:00:23.070> into<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.400> mean<00:00:23.550> yet

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
let's go directly into it I mean yet

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.550 
let's go directly into it I mean yet
again<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.150> gonna<00:00:24.240> need<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.840> scarfs<00:00:25.350> Atta

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
again I'm gonna need with scarfs Atta

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.050 
again I'm gonna need with scarfs Atta
which<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.980> actually<00:00:26.250> becoming<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.580> fan<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> like

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
which is actually becoming a fan I like

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
which is actually becoming a fan I like
leading<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.539> scarfs<00:00:27.840> either<00:00:28.019> he<00:00:28.769> also<00:00:28.949> has<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
leading with scarfs either he also has a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.999 
leading with scarfs either he also has a
zorg<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.210> he's<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:30.990> disguise<00:00:31.349> his<00:00:31.560> smeargle

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
zorg but he's not disguise his smeargle

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.130 
zorg but he's not disguise his smeargle
so<00:00:32.369> that's<00:00:32.820> pretty<00:00:33.059> great<00:00:33.239> he<00:00:33.540> also<00:00:33.690> has<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
so that's pretty great he also has the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.690 
so that's pretty great he also has the
focus<00:00:34.410> -<00:00:34.530> which<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> fine<00:00:35.100> which<00:00:35.280> means<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
focus - which is fine which means that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.190 
focus - which is fine which means that
his<00:00:35.850> work<00:00:36.149> probably<00:00:36.420> doesn't<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
his work probably doesn't have it and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500 
his work probably doesn't have it and
I'm<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:37.950> switch<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.250> wheezing<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:39.270> he's

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
I'm gonna switch out wheezing now he's

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
I'm gonna switch out wheezing now he's
gonna<00:00:39.629> put<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> stick<00:00:40.290> web<00:00:40.469> first<00:00:40.710> then

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
gonna put up the stick web first then

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.290 
gonna put up the stick web first then
he's<00:00:41.160> gonna<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> spore<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.149> also

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
he's gonna go for the spore he also

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
he's gonna go for the spore he also
probably<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:42.989> drugs<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.040> fine<00:00:44.370> because

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
probably has drugs which is fine because

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
probably has drugs which is fine because
wheezing<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.719> pretty<00:00:46.079> much<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.379> at

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
wheezing is here to pretty much be at

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.170 
wheezing is here to pretty much be at
that<00:00:46.620> far<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:47.070> looking<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.520> team<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that far I'm looking at this team and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
that far I'm looking at this team and
I'm<00:00:48.329> looking<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> squeezing<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.530> I'm

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I'm looking at the squeezing and I'm

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
I'm looking at the squeezing and I'm
starting<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> believe<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.539> against<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.660> team

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
starting to believe that against a team

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
starting to believe that against a team
of<00:00:52.230> his<00:00:52.469> wheezing<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.460> probably<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> good

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
of his wheezing can probably be a good

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
of his wheezing can probably be a good
Fr<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.660> guess<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.050> could<00:00:55.230> preserved<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
Fr I guess I could preserved for the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.950 
Fr I guess I could preserved for the
pincer<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.390> surprised<00:00:57.780> because

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
pincer but don't get surprised because

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840 
pincer but don't get surprised because
pincer<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.590> too<00:00:59.280> good

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
pincer is too good

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.389 
pincer is too good
pincer<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.870> game<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.590> his<00:01:01.770> ability<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
pincer in this game with his ability and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
pincer in this game with his ability and
students<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.239> probably<00:01:03.600> one-shot<00:01:04.140> wheezing

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
students can probably one-shot wheezing

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.230 
students can probably one-shot wheezing
after<00:01:04.920> soda<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.519> straight<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.000> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
after soda and just straight out of that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.660 
after soda and just straight out of that
it<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.140> powerful<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> didn't<00:01:08.549> really

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it is that powerful so I didn't really

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670 
it is that powerful so I didn't really
want<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.090> mess<00:01:09.840> around<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> too<00:01:10.500> much

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
want to mess around with that too much

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
want to mess around with that too much
Seamus<00:01:11.130> will<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.760> deaf<00:01:12.030> artists<00:01:12.330> which

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
Seamus will have this deaf artists which

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
Seamus will have this deaf artists which
ought<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> start<00:01:12.960> after<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.619> inputs<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
ought to start after that as inputs of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
ought to start after that as inputs of
the<00:01:14.340> rocks<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> wheezing<00:01:15.540> comes<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.110> I'm

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the rocks and wheezing comes in as I'm

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
the rocks and wheezing comes in as I'm
gonna<00:01:16.710> switch<00:01:16.950> out<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.369> own<00:01:17.549> wheezing<00:01:18.090> I'm

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
gonna switch out to my own wheezing I'm

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.560 
gonna switch out to my own wheezing I'm
not<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.049> fan<00:01:19.890> other<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.000> absorbing<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
not to fan other of the absorbing the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.660 
not to fan other of the absorbing the
village<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.680> asleep<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.520> he's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
village but we think is asleep so he's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
village but we think is asleep so he's
probably<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.150> best<00:01:24.500> candidate<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.710> order<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
probably the best candidate in order to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.830 
probably the best candidate in order to
take<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> failed<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.600> course

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
take this but it failed of course

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.210 
take this but it failed of course
because<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.320> already<00:01:28.619> sleep<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.040> don't

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
because it's already sleep you don't
