it<00:02:46.330> or<00:02:46.510> roasting<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.730> will<00:02:51.940> take<00:02:52.180> about

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
it or roasting it this will take about

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:02.600 
it or roasting it this will take about
approximately<00:02:54.269> five<00:02:55.269> five<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.260> eight<00:02:56.470> minutes

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.210 

see<00:03:03.610> now<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.849> can<00:03:04.180> see<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:05.110> suji<00:03:05.560> has<00:03:05.769> changed

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
see now you can see the suji has changed

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.119 
see now you can see the suji has changed
its<00:03:06.400> color<00:03:06.640> it's<00:03:07.480> brown<00:03:07.930> golden<00:03:08.590> brown<00:03:08.739> and

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129

the almonds are brown too and the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.199 
the almonds are brown too and the
consistency<00:03:13.629> has<00:03:14.319> become<00:03:14.650> thick<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.970> that

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
consistency has become thick so that

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.559 
consistency has become thick so that
means<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.900> done<00:03:17.379> at<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.790> point<00:03:18.849> it's<00:03:19.359> done

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
means it's done at this point it's done

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.740 
means it's done at this point it's done
it's<00:03:19.720> not<00:03:19.900> done<00:03:20.140> done<00:03:20.410> for<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.970> next<00:03:22.269> step<00:03:22.450> I'm

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
it's not done done for the next step I'm

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:47.080 
it's not done done for the next step I'm
going<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:23.410> add<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:24.040> sugar<00:03:24.730> syrup<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.769> now

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:57.750 

and<00:03:47.660> let<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.019> cook

oh yes look at the color and it's
getting<00:04:01.959> thick<00:04:02.230> now<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.739> now<00:04:05.739> it's<00:04:06.189> at<00:04:06.519> this

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
getting thick now and now it's at this

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.500 
getting thick now and now it's at this
point<00:04:07.170> it's<00:04:08.170> totally<00:04:08.709> your<00:04:08.950> choice<00:04:09.120> how<00:04:10.120> thick

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
point it's totally your choice how thick

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.869 
point it's totally your choice how thick
or<00:04:10.720> how<00:04:11.049> runny<00:04:11.409> you<00:04:11.650> want<00:04:11.829> to<00:04:11.920> make<00:04:12.099> this<00:04:12.700> is

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
or how runny you want to make this is

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.539 
or how runny you want to make this is
the<00:04:13.000> consistency<00:04:13.629> which<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:14.170> light<00:04:14.470> not<00:04:15.280> too

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
the consistency which I light not too

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.379 
the consistency which I light not too
thick<00:04:15.849> and<00:04:16.090> not<00:04:17.019> too<00:04:17.260> runny<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.910> I'm<00:04:18.970> going<00:04:19.269> to

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
thick and not too runny so I'm going to

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:26.969 
thick and not too runny so I'm going to
lower<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.930> heat<00:04:20.139> a<00:04:20.169> little<00:04:20.289> bit<00:04:20.560> now<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:25.979> it

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
lower the heat a little bit now and it

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:36.180 
lower the heat a little bit now and it
is<00:04:27.930> done<00:04:33.990> turn<00:04:34.990> off<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.169> heat<00:04:35.530> at<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:35.889> point

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
is done turn off the heat at this point

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.279 
is done turn off the heat at this point
it's<00:04:36.520> it's<00:04:36.970> going<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.300> keep<00:04:37.479> on<00:04:37.690> cooking<00:04:37.960> as

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
it's it's going to keep on cooking as

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:47.659 
it's it's going to keep on cooking as
you<00:04:38.410> can<00:04:38.620> see<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.449> last<00:04:43.720> step<00:04:44.350> is<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:45.720> added

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
you can see so the last step is I added
