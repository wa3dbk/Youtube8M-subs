00:00:00.899 --> 00:00:05.320
 look everyone guys are j and here we are 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.510
 here at the sixth episode of the skip to 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.889
 glory episodes where no schilder I have 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.780
 practically for nothing except 34 goals 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.639
 since I have a nice afternoon when 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.619
 registered eros thought mine then 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.109
 I didn't have so much trouble distilling there 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.539
 then a contract then succeeded 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.820
 adversaries who only pressed the king 1 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.259
 for those who did not know that damn among 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.259
 the stosur goes to make a sort of car 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.650
 pressing and it is very difficult to ring 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.510
 since in any case the opposing players 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.309
 they tend to go on all the time 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.960
 to the ball 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.300
 so every time I change it anyway 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.370
 direction they respond to arrive 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.960
 hence the subject of jackson assembly 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.059
 with a goal still pretty nice 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.489
 then to pour I was other than already 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.100
 nardi rigor and try a kind of 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.030
 simulation with the attacker you are 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.859
 so thrown like a fish and then 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.750
 solid and find the goal the game 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.719
 ends 1 1 goes to penalties 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.920
 here is immediately the poor is the case 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.019
 also make mistakes a little 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.310
 demoralized for this seems sailing e 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.390
 regard ahead 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.710
 you will soon see how it has ended like 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 ends up apologizing anyway now 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.560
 I wanted to talk a little 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.840
 of the team of a next team 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.480
 which allows me to do I promised myself 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.970
 looks like I would have made a new team 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.760
 tra is fine if I haven't had time to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.250
 then probably do it in the next 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.200
 episode you will see one of you 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.440
 recommend me a team to climb 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.229
 with around 20,000 credits if possible 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.000
 with players I don't have and I'm not 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.450
 still using it since I want it anyway 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.550
 keep me the teams that the game then 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.060
 here I had thought a sort of 3 5 2 o 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.990
 however I don't know anyway teams with 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.460
 players of the well arfa type denies of con 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.050
 those players with five star abilities 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.880
 very very strong to me personally 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.550
 like them and there are several c here 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.390
 there are also the Milan there are some 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.280
 I must say this much out of there 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.550
 surely there are not as many as there are 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.230
 they were in awe 12 but unfortunately ok 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.970
 we are content with those who have i 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.769
 credits are not the problem here not 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.250
 ask me cristiano ronaldo why 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.600
 currently in you I have neither to credits for 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.940
 buy it 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.730
 maybe I could even buy it here though 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.320
 I don't want to throw everyone away 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.230
 criticism or for a player with me 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.239
 those credits are not worth the first one anyway 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.570
 I won the match on penalties decide to 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.970
 go to the silver team is this 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.630
 game will go awry because here 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.430
 really already I couldn't play by 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.680
 mineo for various problems that now do not 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.250
 I'm here to tell you then to pay anyway 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.989
 was say good I don't know how to 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.140
 it seems to me to parade with the left exterior 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.160
 however even here he earns a kick of 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.120
 rigor strange my opponent and 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.690
 he also manages to do it with 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.379
 austin and then immediately goes into 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.760
 advantage for 1 to 0 and the game here 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.620
 just did not go badly not 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.019
 i will go out play found this nice goal e 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.099
 with that bank of tyson that of paul 90 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.170
 of speed 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.530
 here I find very strange long shot with 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.700
 this game goes really bad it loses 2 a 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.980
 0 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.950
 prompt to do little or nothing I could not 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.959
 just ringing with myopic and I was 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.870
 quite demoralized for this though 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.730
 decides however not to give up try 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.069
 to do another game this will go 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.060
 better and I'll be able to do even say 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.910
 a pretty nice goal is enough 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.940
 already taken with him, he is already there 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.359
 then how soon you will see is about to do 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.099
 one euro goal, however, the usual shit pile 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.480
 must block everything therefore goes into 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.579
 advantage my opponent with this 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.170
 Quality goals a little list as you have 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.799
 could see a team where 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.030
 pretty bad rassoul question 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.109
 found beautiful land course 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.659
 rassoul boys 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.880
 buy it all really beautiful there 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.829
 that they had informed but I never have 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.840
 I had no time to try it. I don't think so 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.150
 I'll do it because the normal one is enough for me 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.669
 here is the goal of Gedah I was talking about 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.310
 first this canine water heater this goalkeeper 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.990
 did a bit of cappellata here though 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.240
 and in any case 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.889
 a nice cute and here my goalkeeper a 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.479
 make a chapel ever since a little 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.860
 stop here now the doorman must 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.960
 change I just found that it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.520
 standard liegi to another porter 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.830
 it seems much stronger than the Algerian 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.500
 shit that I have now so anyway 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.630
 I will change and here is a quincy goal a 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.940
 goal that I wanted to do because I have skill 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.280
 just made a fake and shot since 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.160
 I thought his porter came out flying 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.930
 discard them to make one of those goals 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.240
 strange that a passage r1 then a 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.800
 I fly the type of heel and here is the code 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.840
 already anyway here I am back with great spin 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.250
 very serious elastic and ciop 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.659
 here, however, the pole and then on the riveted 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.430
 I remain to score but they did 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:11.729
 pissed off having taken the post 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.409
 to think he had found the goal 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.819
 It would be another goal for the 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.430
 compilation because it wasn't bad 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.860
 however, it means the episode yes 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.569
 concludes here I hope I enjoyed it and 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.220

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.039

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.830
