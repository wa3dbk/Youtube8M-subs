00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 in today's video I'll show 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.720
 How do you change alicia from my skateboard? 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.019
 so you're going to need something 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.270
 to heat the list to melt the glue 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.270
 other than a blowtorch a blow dryer 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.340
 hair or lighter with it dropped a 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.529
 little harder but work too 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.849
 that will light up and take a break in the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.900
 car stopped a lot of time in the same place 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.060
 do not burn 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.100
 but it's just to melt the quota down 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.980
 of an heater there you get one 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.290
 stylet or a vascular knife 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 contained him completely soft now 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.820
 let's let's hairdryer right 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 it was very easy to remember that the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.750
 hair dryer is in what it does not 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.519
 it was 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.280
 It's no use, it's cold there. 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.859
 Warm up where you're going to pull that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.409
 As it gets warmer 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.869
 the glue is loosening and peeling well 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.579
 muzzle office is very good here was the 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.920
 part that we did not pass the dryer o 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.530
 The computer, too, so let's go. 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.530
 hair dryer since it takes longer 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.650
 I sometimes get out of the ufrgs one indexed to 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.720
 The hardest part to draw is the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.150
 so you go there with your source 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.640
 heat and stays well on edge until 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.509
 melt mulbanco age to have only stays 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.020
 hot and then with a knife the stylus 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.610
 It's just the cool one and it comes out really easy. 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.580
 with lighter mainly there you 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.500
 school only tackles and pulls that edge there 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.500
 which is the hardest one will be already outside 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.840
 I hope you've been able to explain 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.610
 right for more skateboard rex see here 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.090

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.460

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.369

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.880
