00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.640
 Park 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.290
 and so I have made it happen to you as if to give it a little more unfavorable 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.030
 and especially the Spanish cuisine that founded its leaders also basic 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.030
 from the kitchen is love 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.689
 I 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.489
 Another key ingredient is zaragoza franck and it was placed in that 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.209
 moment for which we are the aroma of saffron and hollandaise and the bad smell 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.429
 the characteristic Colombian much more yellowish color of 30 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.369
 that we are not putting a lot of plot very badly with the colo colo 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.129
 colo in parallel colon aganaco de maranháo is to her the saffron interest 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.229
 parallel because we let it thicken in this context we are going to deliver the 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:53.329
 pork so that it is more his voice at the time is the diner to have 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.499
 then we are going to add 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:56.749
 the pig 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:00.809
 then in that boiling moment we are going to add rice rice in Spain 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.809
 they add it imports cross 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.339
 sanz 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.369
 let's add pepper 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:22.989
 the rice in turn takes a lot of nicholas flavor adviser to the then is what 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.179
 what are we going to look for 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:27.909
 its massive, she, we hope she starts to size like the paella 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.269
 always to live game if then at the beginning to release all its flavor to 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.289
 channeling the rebate and we start to obama cap it and add it by the seas 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.919
 bush 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.190
 then we are going to tie the paella a little 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.029
 and it's a lady we have doing all the time 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.669
 and it was so close to free access the paella has a population 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.969
 approximately between 40 to 45 minutes and we are going to acquire the to see the state 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.969
 location is like in the products 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.779
 And till 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:05.129
 completely seafood in your region 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.330
 we want to add 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.940
 now white wine 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.379
 because we are going to aromatize the 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.969
 the yellow of the paella depends on the number of colonies we practice 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:15.629
 add 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.499

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:21.289
 we wait for you to take spit last style let's add women 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.830

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.639
 to the conflict without years more is valuing the problem adds women 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.470
 and we already overcome at the last moment 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.080
 so that it is completely ready to the arabiya they raised a little bit of 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.730
 liquors and until now nothing more especially land lérez aktobe lose the 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.409
 alcohol are opposed and those who make it launcher 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.139
 the flavors and aromas of sherry wine that my country feeling 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.289

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.819

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.490
 good to stop doing neither the reagents also acom-spain the 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.589
