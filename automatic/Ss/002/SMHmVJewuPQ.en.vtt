it's Zen UI you all may have seen I
guess<00:03:52.989> over<00:03:53.989> Android<00:03:54.560> 5<00:03:54.919> 5<00:03:55.280> as<00:03:55.579> I<00:03:55.730> told<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.239> so

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
guess over Android 5 5 as I told you so

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.759 
guess over Android 5 5 as I told you so
this<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:58.120> no<00:03:59.120> big<00:03:59.389> thing<00:03:59.690> to<00:04:00.319> tell<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.650> about

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.059 
this is no big thing to tell you about
the<00:04:01.129> user<00:04:01.489> interface<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.590> might<00:04:03.769> for

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
the user interface and you might for

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.210 
the user interface and you might for
example<00:04:04.099> have<00:04:04.790> these<00:04:05.739> shortcuts<00:04:06.739> here<00:04:06.950> on<00:04:07.099> the

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
example have these shortcuts here on the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.259 
example have these shortcuts here on the
screen<00:04:07.549> for<00:04:08.150> example<00:04:08.629> you<00:04:08.720> have<00:04:09.010> AC<00:04:10.010> 4<00:04:10.849> camera

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
screen for example you have AC 4 camera

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.809 
screen for example you have AC 4 camera
and<00:04:11.629> then<00:04:12.019> now<00:04:12.319> we<00:04:12.379> are<00:04:12.650> demo<00:04:12.949> mode<00:04:13.190> here<00:04:13.579> maybe

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
and then now we are demo mode here maybe

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.060 
and then now we are demo mode here maybe
with<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:14.299> one<00:04:14.540> but<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:15.109> guess<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.709> have<00:04:15.859> got

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
right is see here in standby mode and

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.219 
right is see here in standby mode and
then<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.530> camera<00:04:21.859> is<00:04:22.039> starting<00:04:22.940> see<00:04:23.300> and

cases working a little bit better or

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.370 
cases working a little bit better or
much<00:05:12.310> better<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.880> then<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:13.690> digital<00:05:14.170> ones

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.220 
much better and then the digital ones
just<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.340> compensate<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.540> little<00:05:16.780> shakings

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
just to compensate the little shakings

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.220 
just to compensate the little shakings
of<00:05:17.380> a<00:05:17.470> hand<00:05:17.710> while<00:05:17.980> especially<00:05:18.340> during<00:05:19.230> video

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
of a hand while especially during video

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.830 
of a hand while especially during video
shootings<00:05:20.830> and<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.610> course<00:05:21.970> if<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.390> have<00:05:22.600> low

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
shootings and of course if you have low

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.040 
shootings and of course if you have low
light<00:05:23.080> situations<00:05:23.980> at<00:05:24.370> night<00:05:24.660> then<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:25.810> have

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
light situations at night then you have

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.290 
light situations at night then you have
longer<00:05:26.470> exposure<00:05:27.040> time<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.670> then<00:05:28.090> these

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
longer exposure time and then these

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.570 
longer exposure time and then these
little<00:05:28.540> shakes<00:05:28.900> make<00:05:29.320> photos<00:05:30.190> a<00:05:30.250> little<00:05:30.460> bit

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
little shakes make photos a little bit

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.150 
little shakes make photos a little bit
blurry<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.720> hope<00:05:32.200> at<00:05:32.380> least<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.710> this<00:05:32.950> will

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
blurry so I hope at least that this will

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.630 
blurry so I hope at least that this will
be<00:05:33.870> shoot<00:05:34.870> better<00:05:35.140> photos<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:35.830> videos

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
be shoot better photos and videos

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.690 
be shoot better photos and videos

point out is if this is really the final
feeling<00:06:02.050> and<00:06:02.320> especially<00:06:02.620> weight<00:06:03.070> of<00:06:03.340> the

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
feeling and especially weight of the

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.520 
feeling and especially weight of the
product<00:06:03.790> this<00:06:04.450> shall<00:06:04.750> be<00:06:04.780> around<00:06:05.290> about<00:06:05.910> 185

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
product this shall be around about 185

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.530 
product this shall be around about 185
grams<00:06:08.530> this<00:06:09.160> would<00:06:09.400> be<00:06:09.580> a<00:06:09.610> very<00:06:09.880> light<00:06:10.240> weight

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
grams this would be a very light weight

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.120 
grams this would be a very light weight
for<00:06:10.960> a<00:06:10.990> device<00:06:11.410> with<00:06:12.010> a<00:06:12.040> 5.5<00:06:12.820> inch<00:06:12.850> display<00:06:13.300> and

for a device with a 5.5 inch display and
optical<00:06:15.130> zoom<00:06:15.190> so<00:06:16.000> this<00:06:16.240> would<00:06:16.420> be<00:06:16.570> kind<00:06:16.870> of

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
optical zoom so this would be kind of

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.890 
optical zoom so this would be kind of
something<00:06:17.410> I<00:06:17.650> would<00:06:17.890> laugh<00:06:18.370> to<00:06:18.730> a<00:06:18.760> review<00:06:19.630> I

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
something I would laugh to a review I

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.840 
something I would laugh to a review I
will<00:06:20.530> do<00:06:20.650> of<00:06:20.800> course<00:06:20.830> as<00:06:21.370> soon<00:06:21.400> as<00:06:21.730> I've<00:06:21.820> got
