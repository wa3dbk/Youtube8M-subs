see on the image this is a schematic of
the<00:01:00.989> robot<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> has<00:01:02.210> three<00:01:03.210> rotational

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the robot it has three rotational

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.440 
the robot it has three rotational
degrees<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> freedom<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.450> prismatic

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
degrees of freedom and one prismatic

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.929 
degrees of freedom and one prismatic
degree<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> freedom<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.130> basically<00:01:08.640> have

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
degree of freedom so basically have

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.359 
degree of freedom so basically have
theta<00:01:09.450> 1<00:01:09.750> theta<00:01:10.080> 2<00:01:10.229> D<00:01:11.100> 3<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.760> theta<00:01:12.299> 4<00:01:13.369> now

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
theta 1 theta 2 D 3 and theta 4 now

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.719 
theta 1 theta 2 D 3 and theta 4 now
coming<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> code<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.070> first<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
coming back to the code I first of all I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.289 
coming back to the code I first of all I
sell<00:01:18.270> ruler<00:01:18.600> limits<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
sell ruler limits here so I get the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.109 
sell ruler limits here so I get the
maximum<00:01:21.540> values<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.350> each<00:01:22.950> angle<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.820> for

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
maximum values for each angle and for

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.950 
maximum values for each angle and for
the<00:01:24.930> prismatic<00:01:25.530> joint<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.119> maximum<00:01:27.509> angle

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the prismatic joint so the maximum angle

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840 
the prismatic joint so the maximum angle
with<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> minimum<00:01:28.829> angle<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.700> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
with the minimum angle so on and so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.260 
with the minimum angle so on and so
forth

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
forth

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.499 
forth
I<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:31.229> also<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:32.040> work<00:01:32.520> envelope<00:01:32.970> limits<00:01:33.360> that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
I have also a work envelope limits that

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179 
I have also a work envelope limits that
will<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.750> discussed<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.259> more<00:01:34.470> details<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
will be discussed in more details in the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.969 
will be discussed in more details in the
next<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> next<00:01:35.759> video<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
next on the next video I have the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.609 
next on the next video I have the
denavir<00:01:38.520> Attenberg<00:01:39.150> parameters<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.290> i<00:01:40.350> use

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
denavir Attenberg parameters that i use

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.670 
denavir Attenberg parameters that i use
for<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> forward<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.759> inverse<00:01:42.090> kinematics

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
for the forward and inverse kinematics

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.569 
for the forward and inverse kinematics
and<00:01:44.119> then<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.450> comes<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.320> usage<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and then it comes to the usage of the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.469 
and then it comes to the usage of the
robotics<00:01:48.000> toolbox<00:01:48.590> itself<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.430> basically<00:01:51.030> we

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
robotics toolbox itself so basically we

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.740 
robotics toolbox itself so basically we
can<00:01:51.509> define<00:01:51.990> links<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> robots<00:01:53.299> as<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
can define links for the robots as you

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.380 
can define links for the robots as you
know<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.350> scalar<00:01:55.890> road<00:01:56.130> has<00:01:56.369> four<00:01:56.759> links<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
know the scalar road has four links and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.770 
know the scalar road has four links and
here<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.079> using<00:01:58.110> five<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:59.420> there's<00:02:00.420> just

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
here I'm using five because there's just

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.010 
here I'm using five because there's just
a<00:02:00.869> few<00:02:01.170> details<00:02:01.439> about<00:02:01.710> how<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> use<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.030> dinner

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
a few details about how I use the dinner

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.620 
a few details about how I use the dinner
we<00:02:04.200> had<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> bear<00:02:04.680> convention<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.909> generate<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
we had a bear convention to generate the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.490 
we had a bear convention to generate the
four<00:02:06.869> kinematics<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:08.009> using<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:09.300> L<00:02:09.629> 0<00:02:10.020> L<00:02:10.140> 0

I<00:02:22.500> show<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.640> here<00:02:27.090> five

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
I show it to you so I have here five

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.640 
I show it to you so I have here five
parameters<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.610> they<00:02:30.120> are<00:02:30.330> basically<00:02:31.110> as<00:02:31.380> you

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
parameters so they are basically as you

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.840 
parameters so they are basically as you
can<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:32.040> here<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.460> first<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:33.320> alpha<00:02:34.580> then<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
can see here the first is alpha then a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.810 
can see here the first is alpha then a
and<00:02:36.360> theta<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.380> D<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.220> these<00:02:38.580> are<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
and theta and D this is a these are the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.270 
and theta and D this is a these are the
four<00:02:39.060> parameters<00:02:39.210> from<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> denavir<00:02:40.920> heart

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
four parameters from the denavir heart

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.550 
four parameters from the denavir heart
and<00:02:41.430> barrier<00:02:41.640> conventions<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.900> last<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.350> is

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
and barrier conventions the last one is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.810 
and barrier conventions the last one is
R<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.670> D<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.450> basically<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.400> last

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
R and D so basically if on this last

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.990 
R and D so basically if on this last
runner<00:02:48.270> if<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.840> use<00:02:49.050> zero<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.680> any<00:02:50.460> case<00:02:50.760> then

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
runner if you use zero in any case then

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.390 
runner if you use zero in any case then
you<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.600> rotational<00:02:52.410> joint<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.280> you

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
you have a rotational joint and if you

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.920 
you have a rotational joint and if you
use<00:02:53.550> one<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.450> prismatic<00:02:54.780> joint<00:02:55.370> and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
use one this is a prismatic joint and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.090 
use one this is a prismatic joint and
standard<00:02:57.930> means<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.500> are<00:02:58.620> using<00:02:58.830> this

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
standard means that you are using this

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.400 
standard means that you are using this
tender<00:02:59.580> then<00:02:59.910> IV<00:03:00.120> -<00:03:00.450> very<00:03:00.630> convention<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> can

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
tender then IV - very convention you can

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.950 
tender then IV - very convention you can
also<00:03:01.560> use<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.950> modified<00:03:02.460> one<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:03.510> here<00:03:03.750> we're

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
also use the modified one but here we're

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.210 
also use the modified one but here we're
using<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.890> default<00:03:05.220> one<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.440> after<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:08.010> have

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
using the default one so after you have

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.660 
using the default one so after you have
to<00:03:08.370> find<00:03:08.580> all<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.880> links<00:03:09.090> from<00:03:09.600> your<00:03:09.840> robot

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
to find all the links from your robot

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.580 
to find all the links from your robot
you<00:03:11.670> basically<00:03:12.540> generate<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.960> roll<00:03:13.200> call<00:03:13.440> in

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
you basically generate a roll call in

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.250 
you basically generate a roll call in
tirol<00:03:13.920> function<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.690> passed<00:03:15.960> as

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
tirol function and you passed as

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.810 
tirol function and you passed as
arguments<00:03:17.130> l0<00:03:17.450> until<00:03:18.450> l4<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:20.370> get<00:03:20.580> a

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
arguments l0 until l4 and you get a

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.970 
arguments l0 until l4 and you get a
scarer<00:03:21.770> object

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
scarer object

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.580 
scarer object
I<00:03:23.390> mean<00:03:24.390> scare<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.110> name<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.470> object

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
I mean scare is the name of the object

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.040 
I mean scare is the name of the object
this<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.220> robot<00:03:26.550> object<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.540> also<00:03:27.720> set

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
this is the robot object I can also set

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.100 
this is the robot object I can also set
a<00:03:28.080> name<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.740> then<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.760> have<00:03:30.210> here<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.080> few

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
a name and then I have here just a few

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.130 
a name and then I have here just a few
settings<00:03:31.710> front<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.760> my<00:03:32.910> figure<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:34.020> will

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
settings front for my figure that will

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.980 
settings front for my figure that will
be<00:03:34.230> plotted<00:03:34.950> on<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.430> screen<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:38.340> then<00:03:39.270> here

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
be plotted on the screen and then here

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.210 
be plotted on the screen and then here
what<00:03:40.680> I'm<00:03:40.770> doing

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
what I'm doing

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.350 
what I'm doing
I<00:03:41.490> set<00:03:42.240> a<00:03:42.510> variable<00:03:43.320> time<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.950> as<00:03:44.760> time<00:03:45.030> goes

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
I set a variable time and as time goes

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.620 
I set a variable time and as time goes
I'm<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.290> animate<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.490> x<00:03:47.760> position<00:03:48.060> as<00:03:48.570> a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
I'm going to animate the x position as a

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.400 
I'm going to animate the x position as a
sine<00:03:49.080> wave<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:50.580> Y<00:03:50.790> position<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.570> my<00:03:51.810> role<00:03:51.990> will

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
sine wave the Y position of my role will

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.790 
sine wave the Y position of my role will
be<00:03:52.440> fixed<00:03:52.920> in<00:03:53.070> point<00:03:53.760> four<00:03:53.970> meters<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:55.650> Z

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
be fixed in point four meters and the Z

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.820 
be fixed in point four meters and the Z
position<00:03:55.980> will<00:03:56.400> also<00:03:57.030> be<00:03:57.240> a<00:03:57.510> scale<00:03:58.170> job<00:03:58.470> sine

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
position will also be a scale job sine

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.449 
position will also be a scale job sine
waves<00:03:59.330> I'll<00:04:00.330> show<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.200> on<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.980> animations

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
waves I'll show you on the animations

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.420 
waves I'll show you on the animations
then<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.720> do<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.200> inverse<00:04:04.440> kinematics<00:04:04.860> myself

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
then I do the inverse kinematics myself

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.510 
then I do the inverse kinematics myself
actually<00:04:06.240> these<00:04:06.570> two<00:04:06.630> box<00:04:07.080> has<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.709> function

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
actually these two box has a function

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.540 
actually these two box has a function
called<00:04:08.550> i<00:04:09.260> keaney<00:04:10.260> i<00:04:11.209> k<00:04:12.209> i<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.900> ii<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.830> deals

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
called i keaney i k i and ii this deals

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.900 
called i keaney i k i and ii this deals
with<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.940> inversion<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.690> x<00:04:15.930> for<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.260> robot<00:04:16.620> i

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
with the inversion of x for the robot i

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.220 
with the inversion of x for the robot i
didn't<00:04:17.910> really<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.420> for<00:04:18.840> me<00:04:18.989> my

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
didn't really like it for me my

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.560 
didn't really like it for me my
application<00:04:19.770> was<00:04:19.920> a<00:04:20.390> little<00:04:21.390> bit<00:04:21.479> costly

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
application was a little bit costly

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.120 
application was a little bit costly
in<00:04:22.980> computational<00:04:23.980> cost<00:04:24.430> terms<00:04:25.390> so<00:04:25.840> I'm<00:04:26.230> using

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
in computational cost terms so I'm using

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.020 
in computational cost terms so I'm using
these<00:04:28.140> pure<00:04:29.140> mathematical<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.190> geometrical

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.200 

usage<00:04:34.030> is<00:04:34.600> pretty<00:04:35.260> simple<00:04:35.650> I'm<00:04:36.610> not<00:04:36.850> I'm<00:04:37.060> not

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
usage is pretty simple I'm not I'm not

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.350 
usage is pretty simple I'm not I'm not
going<00:04:37.420> in<00:04:38.290> details<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.130> how<00:04:39.490> I'm<00:04:39.760> using<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.210> is

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
going in details and how I'm using it is

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.270 
going in details and how I'm using it is
just<00:04:40.990> for<00:04:41.170> you<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:41.380> know<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.530> I'm<00:04:41.800> doing<00:04:42.160> it

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
just for you to know that I'm doing it

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.330 
just for you to know that I'm doing it
by<00:04:42.490> myself<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:45.870> then<00:04:46.870> in<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.500> end<00:04:47.650> I<00:04:47.890> have

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
by myself and then in the end I have

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.270 
by myself and then in the end I have
here<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:48.910> function<00:04:49.240> plot<00:04:49.570> for<00:04:49.810> MATLAB<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:50.470> it

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
here the function plot for MATLAB and it

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.000 
here the function plot for MATLAB and it
can<00:04:51.490> be<00:04:51.640> used<00:04:51.880> for<00:04:52.180> this<00:04:52.480> robot<00:04:53.140> object<00:04:53.860> and

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
can be used for this robot object and

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.660 
can be used for this robot object and
then<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.430> passed<00:04:54.700> as<00:04:55.030> arguments<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:56.740> vector<00:04:57.430> that

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
then I passed as arguments a vector that

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.380 
then I passed as arguments a vector that
has<00:04:58.150> all<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.520> perimeters<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.760> need<00:05:01.150> to

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
has all the perimeters that I need to

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.950 
has all the perimeters that I need to
use<00:05:01.420> so<00:05:02.020> basically<00:05:02.860> zero<00:05:03.190> is<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:04.030> fixed<00:05:04.630> angle

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
use so basically zero is a fixed angle

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.100 
use so basically zero is a fixed angle
then<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.860> have<00:05:06.100> theta<00:05:06.370> 1<00:05:06.670> theta<00:05:06.910> 2<00:05:07.090> theta<00:05:07.270> 3<00:05:07.720> and

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
then I have theta 1 theta 2 theta 3 and

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.310 
then I have theta 1 theta 2 theta 3 and
the<00:05:08.680> last<00:05:08.920> zero<00:05:09.220> here<00:05:09.610> is<00:05:09.760> theta<00:05:10.750> 4<00:05:11.080> that<00:05:11.230> I'm

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
the last zero here is theta 4 that I'm

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.550 
the last zero here is theta 4 that I'm
setting<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:11.890> zero<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.810> can<00:05:13.810> also<00:05:13.990> do<00:05:14.530> a

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
setting to zero I can also do a

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.400 
setting to zero I can also do a
three-dimensional<00:05:15.280> block<00:05:16.020> where<00:05:17.020> I<00:05:17.050> have

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
three-dimensional block where I have

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.310 
three-dimensional block where I have
only<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.840> px<00:05:19.840> py<00:05:20.230> and<00:05:20.620> PZ<00:05:21.040> values<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.140> can

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
only the px py and PZ values so you can

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.190 
only the px py and PZ values so you can
see<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.590> trajectory<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.310> my<00:05:24.580> robot<00:05:24.990> then<00:05:25.990> I<00:05:26.020> do

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
see the trajectory of my robot then I do

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.940 
see the trajectory of my robot then I do
it<00:05:26.410> pause<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:27.040> it<00:05:27.730> goes<00:05:27.940> really<00:05:28.600> simple<00:05:29.140> so

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
it pause and it goes really simple so

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.890 
it pause and it goes really simple so
now<00:05:30.130> let's<00:05:30.430> run<00:05:30.640> it<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.000> let's<00:05:31.390> see<00:05:31.630> how<00:05:31.870> it

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
now let's run it and let's see how it

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.280 
now let's run it and let's see how it
works<00:05:35.850> so<00:05:36.850> here<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.360> have<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.660> animation<00:05:38.230> of

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
works so here you have the animation of

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.740 
works so here you have the animation of
the<00:05:38.440> robot<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.400> basically<00:05:39.820> you<00:05:40.120> have<00:05:40.330> all<00:05:40.630> the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
the robot so basically you have all the

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.890 
the robot so basically you have all the
rotational<00:05:41.260> joints<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:42.330> at<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.420> last<00:05:43.600> point

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
rotational joints and at the last point

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.140 
rotational joints and at the last point
of<00:05:44.050> Chris<00:05:44.350> Matic<00:05:44.620> joint<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.070> in<00:05:45.610> red<00:05:45.850> you<00:05:45.970> can

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
of Chris Matic joint and in red you can

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.860 
of Chris Matic joint and in red you can
see<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:46.330> points<00:05:46.990> then<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:47.740> get<00:05:48.040> blood<00:05:48.340> from

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
see the points then you get blood from

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.620 
see the points then you get blood from
the<00:05:49.870> trajectory<00:05:50.430> I<00:05:51.430> can<00:05:51.970> also<00:05:52.090> rotate<00:05:52.360> the

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
the trajectory I can also rotate the

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.860 
the trajectory I can also rotate the
screen<00:05:53.080> so<00:05:53.320> you<00:05:53.410> can<00:05:53.470> see<00:05:53.650> how<00:05:54.310> it<00:05:54.760> is<00:05:55.420> really

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
screen so you can see how it is really

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
screen so you can see how it is really
moving<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:56.920> behaving<00:05:57.270> so<00:05:58.270> this<00:05:58.510> is<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.720> up<00:05:59.470> view

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
moving and behaving so this is a up view

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.680 
moving and behaving so this is a up view
and<00:06:00.160> you<00:06:00.610> can<00:06:00.670> see<00:06:00.760> it<00:06:01.030> goes<00:06:01.210> in<00:06:01.240> a<00:06:01.540> straight

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
and you can see it goes in a straight

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.580 
and you can see it goes in a straight
line<00:06:02.110> because<00:06:02.800> Y<00:06:03.460> is<00:06:03.520> fixed<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.360> have<00:06:04.780> X<00:06:05.080> bearing

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
line because Y is fixed I have X bearing

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.680 
line because Y is fixed I have X bearing
the<00:06:05.740> sine<00:06:05.920> wave<00:06:06.130> and<00:06:06.310> also<00:06:06.490> Z<00:06:06.970> varying<00:06:07.390> a<00:06:07.480> sine

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
the sine wave and also Z varying a sine

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.800 
the sine wave and also Z varying a sine
wave<00:06:07.720> also<00:06:08.680> if<00:06:08.950> I<00:06:09.040> rotate<00:06:09.430> here<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:10.480> show<00:06:10.780> Z<00:06:12.810> you

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
wave also if I rotate here to show Z you

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.429 
wave also if I rotate here to show Z you
can<00:06:13.870> see<00:06:14.230> this<00:06:14.410> behavior

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:18.439 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.359 

okay<00:06:19.309> and<00:06:19.519> then<00:06:19.759> the<00:06:19.969> trajectory<00:06:20.569> goes<00:06:21.339> like<00:06:22.339> a

00:06:22.359 --> 00:06:22.369 
okay and then the trajectory goes like a

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:25.179 
okay and then the trajectory goes like a
triangle<00:06:23.179> this<00:06:23.989> is<00:06:24.050> pretty<00:06:24.349> simple<00:06:24.679> to<00:06:24.949> use

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:25.189 
triangle this is pretty simple to use

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:27.519 
triangle this is pretty simple to use
you<00:06:25.909> can<00:06:26.059> do<00:06:26.209> in<00:06:26.360> real<00:06:26.569> time<00:06:26.809> and<00:06:27.110> let's<00:06:27.259> pretty

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:27.529 
you can do in real time and let's pretty

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:29.949 
you can do in real time and let's pretty
phat<00:06:27.739> doing<00:06:28.009> that<00:06:28.159> and<00:06:28.459> this<00:06:29.360> is<00:06:29.509> just<00:06:29.809> to<00:06:29.899> show

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:29.959 
phat doing that and this is just to show

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:31.869 
phat doing that and this is just to show
you<00:06:30.229> the<00:06:30.469> concept<00:06:30.889> and<00:06:31.129> how<00:06:31.249> to<00:06:31.309> use<00:06:31.669> these

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879 
you the concept and how to use these

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.629 
you the concept and how to use these
robotic<00:06:32.209> toolbox<00:06:32.659> so<00:06:33.589> in<00:06:33.949> the<00:06:34.039> next<00:06:34.219> videos

robotic toolbox so in the next videos

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.609 
robotic toolbox so in the next videos
I'll<00:06:34.909> be<00:06:34.939> showing<00:06:35.209> you<00:06:35.389> how<00:06:35.539> I'm<00:06:36.080> using<00:06:36.379> it

00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:36.619 
I'll be showing you how I'm using it

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:39.669 
I'll be showing you how I'm using it
with<00:06:37.309> my<00:06:37.519> project<00:06:38.169> first<00:06:39.169> of<00:06:39.319> all<00:06:39.439> I'm<00:06:39.499> going

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:39.679 
with my project first of all I'm going

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:42.579 
with my project first of all I'm going
to<00:06:39.769> show<00:06:39.889> you<00:06:39.919> how<00:06:40.129> to<00:06:40.159> map<00:06:40.550> in<00:06:40.759> my<00:06:41.589> work

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:42.589 
to show you how to map in my work

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.089 
to show you how to map in my work
envelope<00:06:43.069> so<00:06:43.279> the<00:06:43.489> human<00:06:43.789> work<00:06:43.969> envelope<00:06:44.389> to<00:06:44.659> a

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
envelope so the human work envelope to a

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:47.679 
envelope so the human work envelope to a
working<00:06:46.099> blob<00:06:46.339> from<00:06:46.610> the<00:06:46.729> robot<00:06:47.089> and<00:06:47.269> then

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:47.689 
working blob from the robot and then

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:50.649 
working blob from the robot and then
I'll<00:06:47.899> show<00:06:48.259> how<00:06:48.529> I'm<00:06:48.830> integrating<00:06:49.269> this<00:06:50.269> code

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
I'll show how I'm integrating this code

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.709 
I'll show how I'm integrating this code
here<00:06:50.959> in<00:06:51.079> MATLAB<00:06:51.639> receiving<00:06:52.639> data<00:06:52.849> from<00:06:52.999> the

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:53.719 
here in MATLAB receiving data from the

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:55.989 
here in MATLAB receiving data from the
turo<00:06:53.899> text<00:06:54.259> module<00:06:54.619> and<00:06:54.649> then<00:06:55.069> doing<00:06:55.819> the

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:55.999 
turo text module and then doing the

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.489 
turo text module and then doing the
whole<00:06:56.149> thing<00:06:56.179> getting<00:06:56.749> the<00:06:56.839> position<00:06:56.989> of<00:06:57.319> my

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:57.499 
whole thing getting the position of my

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.739 
whole thing getting the position of my
arm<00:06:57.679> and<00:06:57.969> transmitting<00:06:58.969> that<00:06:59.149> to<00:06:59.419> the<00:06:59.539> cool

00:06:59.739 --> 00:06:59.749 
arm and transmitting that to the cool

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:02.199 
arm and transmitting that to the cool
and<00:07:00.019> then<00:07:00.139> animating<00:07:00.800> the<00:07:01.009> slope<00:07:01.579> and<00:07:01.759> not<00:07:01.879> the

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:02.209 
and then animating the slope and not the

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:04.600
