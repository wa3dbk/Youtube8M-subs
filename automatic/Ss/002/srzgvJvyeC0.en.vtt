00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
quick we don't need to worry about

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.580

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
done so let's go ahead and style outer

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.229 
done so let's go ahead and style outer
first<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.410> remember<00:03:48.130> this<00:03:48.459> was<00:03:48.670> just<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:48.970> box

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
first and remember this was just the box

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.509 
first and remember this was just the box
that<00:03:49.690> we<00:03:49.870> could<00:03:50.049> center<00:03:50.440> everything<00:03:51.040> so<00:03:51.250> set

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
that we could center everything so set

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.130 
that we could center everything so set
the<00:03:51.640> width<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:52.329> go<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.510> one<00:03:52.780> hundred<00:03:52.930> percent

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
the width you go to one hundred percent

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.729 
the width you go to one hundred percent
and<00:03:54.090> set<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.239> text<00:03:56.310> align<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:58.480> Center<00:03:58.930> what

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
and set the text align to Center what

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.229 
and set the text align to Center what
this<00:03:59.890> is<00:04:00.040> going<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.280> do<00:04:00.489> is<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:00.730> pretty<00:04:01.120> much

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
is the box that's pretty much going to

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.830 
is the box that's pretty much going to
be<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.370> message<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.030> message<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.570> going<00:04:13.750> to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
be the message the message is going to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.470 
be the message the message is going to
go<00:04:13.930> in<00:04:14.049> here<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:15.160> first<00:04:15.489> change<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.150> display

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.550 
go in here so first change the display
to

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
to

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.470 
to
inline-block<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:20.669> now<00:04:21.669> just<00:04:22.060> go<00:04:22.210> ahead<00:04:22.360> and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
inline-block and now just go ahead and

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.550 
inline-block and now just go ahead and
give<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:23.020> border<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.740> let's<00:04:24.160> say<00:04:24.340> one<00:04:24.639> pixel

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
give it a border of let's say one pixel

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
give it a border of let's say one pixel
solid<00:04:26.560> grey<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.560> now<00:04:29.560> set<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.010> width<00:04:30.310> the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
solid grey and now set the width the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.490 
solid grey and now set the width the
overall<00:04:31.210> width<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.840> website<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.470> a

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
overall width of the website is a

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.760 
overall width of the website is a
thousand<00:04:33.190> so<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.400> think<00:04:33.520> 600<00:04:34.330> pixels<00:04:34.780> will<00:04:35.560> look

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
thousand so I think 600 pixels will look

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.200 
thousand so I think 600 pixels will look
just<00:04:36.870> pretty<00:04:37.870> good<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.669> padding<00:04:39.669> might<00:04:40.150> as

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
just pretty good and padding might as

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.890 
just pretty good and padding might as
well<00:04:40.270> go<00:04:40.480> ahead<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.690> set<00:04:40.990> this<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.470> 10<00:04:42.130> pixels

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
well go ahead and set this to 10 pixels

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.500 
well go ahead and set this to 10 pixels
now<00:04:43.900> for<00:04:44.139> margin<00:04:44.830> what<00:04:45.760> I<00:04:45.790> want<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.150> do<00:04:46.240> is<00:04:46.389> I

now for margin what I want to do is I
want<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.810> set<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.139> to<00:04:47.410> 10<00:04:47.770> pixels<00:04:48.340> auto<00:04:49.090> and

WebKit so that's how we take care of the
rounded<00:05:33.669> corners<00:05:34.000> for<00:05:34.180> all<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.479> browsers<00:05:34.900> now

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
rounded corners for all the browsers now

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.960 
rounded corners for all the browsers now
the<00:05:35.200> only<00:05:35.650> other<00:05:36.070> thing<00:05:36.160> that<00:05:36.400> we<00:05:36.610> have<00:05:36.640> to<00:05:36.760> do

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
the only other thing that we have to do

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.650 
the only other thing that we have to do
now<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.390> we<00:05:38.020> want<00:05:38.289> to<00:05:38.410> add<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.590> shadow<00:05:39.190> and<00:05:39.660> just

like this little attribute whenever you

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.180 
like this little attribute whenever you
had<00:05:43.810> to<00:05:43.900> make<00:05:44.050> it<00:05:44.200> compatible<00:05:44.470> with<00:05:44.890> all<00:05:45.010> the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
had to make it compatible with all the

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.920 
had to make it compatible with all the
different<00:05:45.490> browsers<00:05:45.880> you<00:05:46.360> need<00:05:46.570> to<00:05:46.720> do<00:05:46.840> the

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
different browsers you need to do the

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.860 
different browsers you need to do the
same<00:05:46.990> thing<00:05:47.260> with<00:05:47.410> this<00:05:47.500> as<00:05:47.680> well<00:05:47.800> so<00:05:48.100> box

same thing with this as well so box
shadow<00:05:49.889> and<00:05:51.570> we'll<00:05:52.570> make<00:05:52.720> this<00:05:52.900> 5<00:05:53.320> pixels<00:05:54.180> 5

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180

WebKit<00:06:50.850> sticky<00:06:51.850> here<00:06:52.180> so<00:06:52.630> now<00:06:52.810> we<00:06:52.870> have<00:06:52.990> a

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
WebKit sticky here so now we have a

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.190 
WebKit sticky here so now we have a
border<00:06:53.620> for<00:06:53.890> internet<00:06:54.520> explorer<00:06:54.970> firefox<00:06:55.480> and

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
chrome and safari and one of these

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.660 
chrome and safari and one of these
should<00:06:59.200> probably<00:06:59.500> cover<00:06:59.680> opera<00:07:00.190> and<00:07:00.430> all<00:07:00.520> the

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670 
should probably cover opera and all the

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.050 
should probably cover opera and all the
other<00:07:00.790> browsers<00:07:01.780> too<00:07:02.020> so<00:07:02.920> there<00:07:03.430> we<00:07:03.580> go<00:07:03.610> there

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
other browsers too so there we go there

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.880 
other browsers too so there we go there
is<00:07:04.180> a<00:07:04.210> CSS<00:07:04.780> we<00:07:04.990> can<00:07:05.080> go<00:07:05.200> ahead<00:07:05.260> and<00:07:05.410> save<00:07:05.860> this

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
is a CSS we can go ahead and save this

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.460 
is a CSS we can go ahead and save this
and<00:07:06.370> close<00:07:06.970> it<00:07:07.000> because<00:07:07.600> we<00:07:07.810> are<00:07:07.900> done<00:07:08.140> with<00:07:08.290> it

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
and close it because we are done with it

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.920 
and close it because we are done with it
the<00:07:09.190> only<00:07:09.700> other<00:07:09.730> thing<00:07:10.000> that<00:07:10.240> we<00:07:10.510> have<00:07:10.630> to<00:07:10.750> do

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
the only other thing that we have to do

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.770 
the only other thing that we have to do
is<00:07:11.580> now<00:07:12.580> that<00:07:12.610> we<00:07:12.910> created<00:07:13.210> this<00:07:13.360> function

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
is now that we created this function

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.690 
is now that we created this function
create<00:07:14.320> message<00:07:14.710> we<00:07:14.890> actually<00:07:15.310> need<00:07:15.490> to<00:07:15.580> go

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
create message we actually need to go

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.910 
create message we actually need to go
ahead<00:07:15.850> and<00:07:16.240> create<00:07:16.540> the<00:07:16.720> function<00:07:17.140> which<00:07:17.770> is

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:17.920 
ahead and create the function which is

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.400 
ahead and create the function which is
basically<00:07:18.370> going<00:07:19.000> to<00:07:19.090> take<00:07:19.270> a<00:07:19.300> variable<00:07:19.840> X<00:07:20.080> and

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
basically going to take a variable X and

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.500 
basically going to take a variable X and
the<00:07:20.770> X<00:07:20.980> is<00:07:21.280> just<00:07:21.310> a<00:07:21.550> number<00:07:21.700> that<00:07:22.060> gets<00:07:22.210> passed

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.510 
the X is just a number that gets passed

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.900 
the X is just a number that gets passed
in<00:07:22.810> through<00:07:22.990> the<00:07:23.080> URL<00:07:23.560> and<00:07:23.800> depending<00:07:24.580> on<00:07:24.730> that

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.910 
in through the URL and depending on that

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.210 
in through the URL and depending on that
number<00:07:25.150> we<00:07:25.720> output<00:07:26.200> a<00:07:26.260> message<00:07:26.770> it's<00:07:26.980> going<00:07:27.160> to

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220 
number we output a message it's going to

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.140 
number we output a message it's going to
be<00:07:27.340> an<00:07:27.520> incredibly<00:07:28.210> simple<00:07:28.990> function<00:07:29.470> and

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
be an incredibly simple function and
