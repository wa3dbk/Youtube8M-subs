00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.670
 marakasi you watch the show chic 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.790
 position issue 67 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.900
 the first location is on the map 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.199
 stacks squared f3 you need 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.140
 fast tank with a strong tower for example 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.840
 object 140 on preferably of course 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.930
 use this tactic cocked 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.320
 because on extremely dangerous and alone 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.809
 of course it will be difficult though if you 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.110
 love to do everything yourself then she probably 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.809
 it suits you because here you can 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.239
 highlight enemies damage them except 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.000
 that opponents just go to 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.899
 you can not because you cover 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.989
 allies 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.239
 Art here of course gets but if you 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.390
 you will move then she will be extremely 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.660
 difficult for you to get into the whole place 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.210
 not bad and can be very good here 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.629
 shoot and do a lot of things 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.409
 useful but at the same time as there is a chance 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.119
 that you have here very quickly salt so 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.119
 think yourself to go here or not 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.690
 the next point is on the map 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.390
 northwest squared c 0 you 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.440
 will need quickly I signed up with accurate and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.750
 punching tool for example jagdpanther 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.119
 take back in here on this mountain 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.420
 and from here you can shoot 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.130
 he is ahead of the road and all opponents 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.509
 which there will glow 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.190
 will be great to take damage from you 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.080
 naturally from this distance 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.140
 it's pretty hard to light you up 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.210
 there are trees ahead and you can without 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.520
 problems shooting enemies and not 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.450
 glow which is very good for 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.610
 Fri-Sau 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.070
 the disadvantages include the fact that 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.440
 opponents do not always attack from above 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.009
 it happens that they are not here at all 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.679
 sometimes they can attack from below and then 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.019
 you can only shoot them in 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.830
 this small segment and at the same time you will 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.440
 immediately glow and it's certainly bad so 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.920
 enemies may not come here at all 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.170
 then you just have to leave 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.799
 next we have a dot on the bullfight map 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.250
 squared j0 you need fast 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.290
 fotos aus good sure of excellent 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.380
 disguise as well as you must 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.690
 push two allies I of course 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.269
 I understand that this is a big drawback but 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.480
 in principle, quite often itâ€™s just that 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.329
 stand and do nothing so sometimes 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.850
 you can try to climb here well 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.140
 from here you can shoot enemies 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.290
 who try to call for example 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.380
 he upstairs pants and so can you 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.110
 shoot through those who shine in the great 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.300
 if the enemy is near then rather 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.280
 in total they can light you but in 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.040
 Basically there is where to hide here 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.560
 for example, for this hill you also 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.770
 you can use it and poke it out 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.950
 just one turret shoot fast and again 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.820
 hiding behind her in the whole position 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.430
 great 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.980
 its biggest drawback is 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.130
 in that you need help 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.709
 allies so they pushed you as well 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.739
 from here it's very good to snipe and 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.110
 at the same time as there is a shelter then we 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.160
 is the smartest point on the map 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.560
 erlenberg squared d 0 you will need 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.100
 fast ipad south gorgeous 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.850
 disguise it is here in this place or 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.900
 drive across the river and climb on 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.750
 this island 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.660
 from here you can not only perfectly 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.170
 highlight but also shoot at enemies 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.320
 if nobody is near and it is advisable to take 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.940
 with a stereo equipment out 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.350
 and camouflage net whole place is just 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.840
 awesome thanks to the player that he 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.950
 sent this replay really really 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.230
 unusual position and most importantly 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.150
 useful you just look from here 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.750
 you can shoot through a giant 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.620
 territory both countries of this map also 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.630
 you highlight from here those who are near 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.229
 is well and light you of course here 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.630
 difficult just delightfully further with us 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.470
 is the location on the line map 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.960
 zigfried squared and h0 you will need 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.419
 inconspicuous signed with a powerful tool 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.900
 for example borschik from here you can 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.080
 sweep vast territory 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.660
 eg mall and out of town at the same time 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.129
 very often opponents do not pay 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.649
 attention that there could be someone 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:56.919
 and start to just pop out 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:59.979
 be substituted and you can perfectly 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.619
 shoot him while lightening you 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.839
 there will be just unreal for example 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:07.689
 Borsch here can stand quietly all 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:10.419
 battle shoot damage and only in the end 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:13.689
 probably someone can light it 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.509
 the whole course position is pretty simple 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:19.089
 but is it really effective? 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:21.249
 allows a lot of damage besides i 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:23.830
 very often I see players who 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:26.349
 completely unaware of how to act in 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.599
 this mode and where to get on fri sau 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.949
 so I think that this place 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:35.589
 it will be useful to someone and the last to 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:39.189
 today the position is on the map 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:42.429
 ruinberg squared f 1 you will need 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:45.419
 fast tank with a strong turret low 

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:48.369
 silhouette and here you can perfectly 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.399
 vytankovyvat damage due to the fact that your 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:53.889
 the casing is partially covered behind this fountain 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:57.219
 but be careful there what is 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.219
 shots where you can still get 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:03.629
 also you can shoot at enemies when 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:07.449
 not distracted whole tactic course 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:09.999
 unsafe but very vigorous if you 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:12.159
 confident in their abilities may well be her 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.649
 try it is also worth remembering to 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:17.649
