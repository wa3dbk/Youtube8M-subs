00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.940
 new video of me what the at the well 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.589
 Prince I'm back from London 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.120
 you also have a new happy 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.070
 hall for you and that's what I thought 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.780
 i would like to share my happy wood 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.830
 Christmas time so as 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.660
 Christmas presents do so 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.980
 christmas presents tips and the den 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.720
 I show you now 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.910
 that's so cool i saw things 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.279
 and I knew right away that's what 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.750
 my company new yakuza rubric and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.550
 That's why I want to show you this 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:35.010
 these are birdies that are so cute 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 pump dispenser but the cool thing is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.350
 that this point donate us firstly 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.110
 Second, money saves a whole new hand 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.760
 there is no need for a washing result 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.770
 only be free but I explain 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.670
 you guys, that's the whole thing 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.680
 to score points 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 those are looking to pump 90 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.420
 percent water and only ten percent 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.270
 your side filled and the whole is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 then I turn into foam 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.460
 watch 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.070
 I also buy sometimes there are 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.329
 even as finished parts but there can 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 one does not hold one's favorite one free 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.150
 and you can do that in the case of me 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.670
 For example, do stars like that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.960
 orange coast lemongrass play and that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.000
 I want to put in there and I show 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.430
 you just like the whole thing 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.979
 So it works, we have it down here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.040
 an arrow that says and which direction 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.990
 we have to perform the whole thing so then 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.250
 I have to look now and I'll do it 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.560
 just now 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.480
 I want to get in the water and I want the rest 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.090
 now easy with my favorite 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.470
 soap or your favorite shower gel 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.810
 what you have so that looks pretty cool 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 out 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.390
 then we take our pump the best 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.500
 Here is the whole in the bathroom 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.150
 on if I like me just here in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.130
 living room I'm doing this for the first time 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.260
 you can see the shower gel and that now 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.229
 you have to spread a bit like that 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.270
 you just a little bit the whole thing 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.830
 shake it to spread it better 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.330
 I'm just going to come here 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.259
 the rest of the water is what I have over 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.229
 I've tipped a bit too 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.390
 pure water but that's the cool thing 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.700
 at his live test you can do the same 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.870
 Watch how it works and can you 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.340
 Immediately give what you are looking for each 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.080
 case should definitely be avoided 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.310
 prevent it does not make the whole thing too full 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.200
 So tilts too much water conservation 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.239
 otherwise it will be the whole thing if you have it 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.030
 closes over tilt 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.950
 now I have the whole and the whole 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.910
 is really nice from the shower 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.769
 smells amazing and then here 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.590
 look sticking so it's right 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.049
 nice solid thick foam with the man 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.940
 your hands can wash and now 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.620
 I have no water what here but 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.600
 So it was the foam that really stays 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.269
 you see it liquefies 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.580
 not but stays firm and smells 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.019
 very intense so if the people 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.720
 Under you think so, yes, but if I do 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.110
 now the soap with 90% water range 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.160
 then she does not smell so much anymore 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.989
 but they are still there 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.489
 this is my happy holder to the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.100
 december goes in so be quick 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.070
 because only for this limited period 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.959
 Will this beautiful product become one 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.450
 give cheaper price than elsewhere 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.519
 we have the whole in black for the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.630
 People who like the black we like 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.160

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.860
