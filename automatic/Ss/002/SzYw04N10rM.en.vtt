G<00:00:00.299> monster<00:00:00.539> is<00:00:01.050> it<00:00:01.290> still<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.680> number<00:00:01.829> one

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
G monster is it still the number one

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.660 
G monster is it still the number one
stock<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.639> buy<00:00:03.770> absolutely<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:04.950> part<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.580> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
stock to buy absolutely and part of the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.299 
stock to buy absolutely and part of the
reason<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.509> first<00:00:06.899> half<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.410> 2013

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
reason is that the first half of 2013

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
reason is that the first half of 2013
Street<00:00:09.120> earnings<00:00:09.450> are<00:00:09.540> down<00:00:09.750> fourteen

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
Street earnings are down fourteen

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.410 
Street earnings are down fourteen
percent<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.280> back<00:00:11.550> half<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.090> think<00:00:12.300> they

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
percent in the back half we think they

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.289 
percent in the back half we think they
can<00:00:12.599> be<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:12.990> fifteen<00:00:13.799> percent<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.730> we're

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
can be up fifteen percent and so we're

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.540 
can be up fifteen percent and so we're
really<00:00:15.570> right<00:00:15.929> now<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.350> front<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.920> kind

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
really right now in front of this kind

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.099 
really right now in front of this kind
of<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> turn<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.240> june<00:00:18.420> quarter<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.840> probably

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
of the turn the june quarter is probably

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.990 
of the turn the june quarter is probably
not<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.590> great<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.760> some

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
not going to be that great but as some

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000 
not going to be that great but as some
of<00:00:21.090> these<00:00:21.150> new<00:00:21.420> products<00:00:21.960> start<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.769> roll

of these new products start to to roll

of these new products start to to roll
out<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.340> back<00:00:23.550> half<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.029> year<00:00:24.180> that's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
out in the back half of the year that's

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330 
out in the back half of the year that's
the<00:00:24.990> reason<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> own<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.710> stock<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:26.220> on

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the reason to own the stock and then on

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.460 
the reason to own the stock and then on
top<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.720> high<00:00:28.230> probability

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
top of that we have a high probability

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
top of that we have a high probability
that<00:00:28.949> they're<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> get<00:00:29.460> some<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.119> cash

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that they're going to get some more cash

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
that they're going to get some more cash
back<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.170> investors<00:00:31.710> which<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> long<00:00:32.340> overdue

was telling us yesterday we might get an
announcement<00:00:38.910> before<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.780> second<00:00:40.230> half<00:00:40.440> of

announcement before the second half of
the<00:00:40.739> year<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:41.280> investors<00:00:41.910> need<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.210> wait<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the year if investors need to wait that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.450 
the year if investors need to wait that
long<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:43.290> some<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> announcement<00:00:44.129> does

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
long for some kind of announcement does

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.740 
long for some kind of announcement does
that<00:00:44.579> mean<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> stock<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.210> stuck<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.629> neutral

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that mean the stock is stuck in neutral

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.709 
that mean the stock is stuck in neutral
until<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.940> well<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.629> going

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
until then well I think that it's going

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.420 
until then well I think that it's going
to<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.930> iller<00:00:49.110> than<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.500> our<00:00:49.680> expectation

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to be iller than that our expectation

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.220 
to be iller than that our expectation
would<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> third<00:00:51.120> week<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.510> April<00:00:52.020> when

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
would be the third week in April when

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.600 
would be the third week in April when
they<00:00:52.320> report<00:00:52.739> their<00:00:52.920> march<00:00:53.160> quarter<00:00:53.489> when

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
they report their march quarter when

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.889 
they report their march quarter when
they're<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> raise<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> dividend<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
they're going to raise the dividend it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.750 
they're going to raise the dividend it's
going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> modest<00:00:55.680> increase<00:00:55.860> based<00:00:56.489> on

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
going to be a modest increase based on

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
going to be a modest increase based on
the<00:00:56.910> cash<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.570> generate<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> US<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the cash they generate from the US so

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860 
the cash they generate from the US so
call<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.760> over<00:00:59.969> ten<00:01:00.180> dollars<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
call it just over ten dollars now and it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
call it just over ten dollars now and it
goes<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.410> over<00:01:01.530> fourteen<00:01:02.129> dollars<00:01:02.309> in

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
goes to just over fourteen dollars in

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
goes to just over fourteen dollars in
terms<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> actual<00:01:03.660> stock<00:01:04.170> though<00:01:04.409> we

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
terms of the actual stock though we

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.429 
terms of the actual stock though we
think<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.430> positive<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.659> small

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
think that that's a positive a small

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
think that that's a positive a small
positive<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> dividend<00:01:08.610> side<00:01:08.850> what's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
positive on the dividend side what's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.789 
positive on the dividend side what's
probably<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:10.229> important<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
probably going to be more important the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
probably going to be more important the
bigger<00:01:10.979> question<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.580> from<00:01:11.729> investors<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
bigger question we get from investors is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
bigger question we get from investors is
fundamentally<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.260> Apple<00:01:13.830> competing<00:01:14.250> with

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
fundamentally how Apple competing with

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.640 
fundamentally how Apple competing with
Samsung<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> how<00:01:15.810> are<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.080> competing<00:01:16.409> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
Samsung and how are they competing in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830 
Samsung and how are they competing in
the<00:01:16.740> low-end<00:01:17.189> phone<00:01:17.460> market<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.509> think

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the low-end phone market and so I think

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
the low-end phone market and so I think
if<00:01:19.080> investors<00:01:19.590> feel<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.430> feel<00:01:20.790> greater

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
if investors feel to feel greater

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.630 
if investors feel to feel greater
confidence<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.500> back<00:01:22.770> half<00:01:23.040> product

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
confidence in the back half product

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.390 
confidence in the back half product
release<00:01:24.110> schedule<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.259> think<00:01:25.799> that's<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
release schedule I think that's going to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.499 
release schedule I think that's going to
be<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> big<00:01:26.790> thing<00:01:26.970> that's<00:01:27.119> really<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
be the big thing that's really going to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
be the big thing that's really going to
drive<00:01:27.750> shares<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.380> over<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> next<00:01:28.619> year<00:01:29.070> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
drive shares here over the next year so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
drive shares here over the next year so
when<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.420> cheaper<00:01:30.810> iPhone<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
when do we get that cheaper iPhone is

when do we get that cheaper iPhone is
Apple<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> bite<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:33.079> think<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> they

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
Apple going to bite I think that they

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.590 
Apple going to bite I think that they
have<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.250> timing<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:35.970> its<00:01:36.180> still<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> little

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
have to the timing on its still a little

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
have to the timing on its still a little
bit<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.960> black<00:01:37.200> box<00:01:37.470> our<00:01:38.130> expectation<00:01:38.970> are

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
bit of a black box our expectation are

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
bit of a black box our expectation are
that<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.450> probably<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
that it's probably going to be in the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
that it's probably going to be in the
beginning<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> December<00:01:42.060> quarter<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.630> we

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
beginning of the December quarter so we

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050 
beginning of the December quarter so we
are<00:01:43.110> expecting<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:44.009> year<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.880> think

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
are expecting that this year we think

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.280 
are expecting that this year we think
it's<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.630> conjunction<00:01:46.170> with

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it's going to be in conjunction with

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660 
it's going to be in conjunction with
China<00:01:46.680> Mobile<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> largest

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
China Mobile which is the largest

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.889 
China Mobile which is the largest
carrier<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> world<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
carrier in the world and so the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
carrier in the world and so the
combination<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.590> those<00:01:49.740> two<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:50.460> make<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
combination of those two right make a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090 
combination of those two right make a

what what is the the critical piece to

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.960 
what what is the the critical piece to
this<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> TV's<00:03:11.560> one<00:03:11.799> area<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.340> we<00:03:12.760> still

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
this but the TV's one area that we still

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.820 
this but the TV's one area that we still
believe<00:03:13.239> strongly<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:13.959> second<00:03:14.590> as<00:03:14.680> you

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
believe strongly and second as you

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.500 
believe strongly and second as you
mentioned<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.370> wearable<00:03:15.700> technology<00:03:16.360> in<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
mentioned is wearable technology in the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.289 
mentioned is wearable technology in the
iWatch<00:03:16.900> that's<00:03:17.440> probably<00:03:17.799> sometime<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.400> 2014

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
iWatch that's probably sometime in 2014

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.420 
iWatch that's probably sometime in 2014
so<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.900> think<00:03:20.230> if<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.440> just<00:03:20.500> take<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.829> step<00:03:20.980> back

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
so I think if you just take a step back

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.039 
so I think if you just take a step back
and<00:03:21.609> look<00:03:21.670> at<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.850> big<00:03:21.910> picture<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.540> last<00:03:22.750> six

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
and look at the big picture the last six

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.630 
and look at the big picture the last six
months<00:03:23.109> have<00:03:23.440> not<00:03:23.590> been<00:03:23.799> very<00:03:24.010> good<00:03:24.130> for<00:03:24.280> Apple

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
months have not been very good for Apple

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.630 
months have not been very good for Apple
probably<00:03:25.570> from<00:03:25.810> kind<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.709> June<00:03:26.950> timeframe

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
probably from kind of the June timeframe

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.910 
probably from kind of the June timeframe
through<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.329> beginning<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.720> 2014<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.769> should

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
through the beginning of 2014 it should

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.699 
through the beginning of 2014 it should
really<00:03:30.340> pick<00:03:30.549> up<00:03:30.609> as<00:03:31.000> far<00:03:31.209> as<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.780> pace<00:03:32.470> of

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
really pick up as far as the the pace of

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.559 
really pick up as far as the the pace of
innovation<00:03:32.859> gene<00:03:33.579> what<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.000> your<00:03:34.180> framework

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
innovation gene what is your framework

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.110 
innovation gene what is your framework
five<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.530> ten<00:03:35.739> years<00:03:35.769> out<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.400> simply<00:03:36.880> seen

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
five and ten years out we simply seen

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.759 
five and ten years out we simply seen
the<00:03:37.269> stock<00:03:37.569> come<00:03:37.870> back<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.290> trend<00:03:38.680> line

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
the stock come back to the trend line

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.150 
the stock come back to the trend line
before<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:40.030> Apple<00:03:40.540> hysteria<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.620> recent

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
before the Apple hysteria of the recent

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.220 
before the Apple hysteria of the recent
months<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:43.269> not<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.870> be<00:03:43.989> on<00:03:44.170> that

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
months is this not going to be on that

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.699 
months is this not going to be on that
trend<00:03:45.100> line<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.639> a<00:03:45.819> higher<00:03:46.060> or<00:03:46.540> can<00:03:47.109> it<00:03:47.139> revert

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
trend line and a higher or can it revert

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.099 
trend line and a higher or can it revert
to<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:48.069> enthusiasm<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:49.739> 2011<00:03:50.739> 2012<00:03:52.079> well<00:03:53.079> I

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
to the enthusiasm of 2011 2012 well I

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.180 
to the enthusiasm of 2011 2012 well I
think<00:03:53.200> if<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.470> look<00:03:53.620> over<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.859> five-year

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
think if you look over the five-year

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.009 
think if you look over the five-year
period<00:03:54.850> there's<00:03:54.970> going<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.180> be<00:03:55.209> ups<00:03:55.569> and<00:03:55.810> downs

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
period there's going to be ups and downs

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.080 
period there's going to be ups and downs
I<00:03:56.350> think<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.889> big<00:03:57.130> picture<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:57.910> as

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
I think that the big picture is this as

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.879 
I think that the big picture is this as
consumer<00:03:58.630> technology<00:03:59.200> has<00:03:59.290> been<00:03:59.410> only<00:03:59.560> around

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
consumer technology has been only around

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.140 
consumer technology has been only around
for<00:04:00.130> 30<00:04:00.370> years<00:04:00.519> if<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:00.730> think<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.000> history

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
for 30 years if you think of the history

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.059 
for 30 years if you think of the history
of<00:04:01.329> time<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:01.930> really<00:04:02.410> hasn't<00:04:02.620> been<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.859> long

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
of time and really hasn't been a long

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.640 
of time and really hasn't been a long
that<00:04:03.459> been<00:04:03.910> around<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.329> long<00:04:04.389> and<00:04:04.750> consumers

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
that been around that long and consumers

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.110 
that been around that long and consumers
are<00:04:05.769> going<00:04:05.799> to<00:04:05.950> spend<00:04:06.160> more<00:04:06.370> on<00:04:06.400> technology

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
are going to spend more on technology

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.940 
are going to spend more on technology
and<00:04:07.150> obviously<00:04:07.510> Apple<00:04:07.930> as<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.079> pole<00:04:08.410> position

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
and obviously Apple as a pole position

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.039 
and obviously Apple as a pole position
within<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.639> so<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.239> big<00:04:10.420> opportunity

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
within that and so the big opportunity

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.080 
within that and so the big opportunity
over<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.350> next<00:04:11.620> two<00:04:11.950> years<00:04:12.190> is<00:04:12.400> this<00:04:12.579> low-end

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
over the next two years is this low-end

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.150 
over the next two years is this low-end
phone<00:04:13.359> market<00:04:13.840> but<00:04:14.290> beyond<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.650> there<00:04:15.069> are

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
phone market but beyond that there are

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.349 
phone market but beyond that there are
things<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.430> we<00:04:15.639> can't<00:04:15.880> even<00:04:16.090> think<00:04:16.209> about

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
things that we can't even think about

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.090 
things that we can't even think about
and<00:04:16.720> then<00:04:16.810> will<00:04:16.959> cannibalize<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.919> phone

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and then will cannibalize the phone

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.039 
and then will cannibalize the phone
market<00:04:18.489> with<00:04:18.609> wearable<00:04:18.940> technologies<00:04:19.600> the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
market with wearable technologies the

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.569 
market with wearable technologies the
watch<00:04:20.260> we<00:04:20.470> talked<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.799> lot<00:04:20.919> about<00:04:20.979> eventually

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
watch we talked a lot about eventually

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.120 
watch we talked a lot about eventually
it's<00:04:21.669> going<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.849> be<00:04:21.970> glasses<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.590> think<00:04:23.860> that

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
it's going to be glasses so I think that

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.589 
it's going to be glasses so I think that
it's<00:04:24.280> very<00:04:24.430> favorable<00:04:25.030> if<00:04:25.120> we<00:04:25.180> kind<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.419> take<00:04:25.539> a

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
it's very favorable if we kind of take a

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.390 
it's very favorable if we kind of take a
five<00:04:25.960> year<00:04:26.200> 10-year<00:04:26.650> window<00:04:26.800> who<00:04:27.130> knows

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
five year 10-year window who knows

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.080 
five year 10-year window who knows
that's<00:04:27.729> that's<00:04:28.210> anybody's<00:04:28.660> guess<00:04:28.690> right
