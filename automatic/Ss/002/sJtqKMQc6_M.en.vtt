00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
nicer I guess I don't know it just seems

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.960 
nicer I guess I don't know it just seems
kind<00:04:39.070> of<00:04:39.099> we<00:04:39.250> start<00:04:39.940> for<00:04:40.090> Raven<00:04:41.729> but<00:04:42.729> that's

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970

alrighty<00:06:38.590> so<00:06:39.070> I<00:06:39.310> guess<00:06:39.460> that's<00:06:39.610> going<00:06:39.850> to

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
alrighty so I guess that's going to

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.280 
alrighty so I guess that's going to
round<00:06:40.120> up<00:06:40.270> this<00:06:40.450> box<00:06:40.690> I'm<00:06:40.930> not<00:06:41.050> really<00:06:41.140> going

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
round up this box I'm not really going

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.200 
round up this box I'm not really going
to<00:06:41.350> try<00:06:41.530> and<00:06:41.560> go<00:06:42.250> through<00:06:42.280> everything<00:06:42.700> as<00:06:43.030> it

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
to try and go through everything as it

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.240 
to try and go through everything as it
looks<00:06:44.110> like<00:06:44.170> a<00:06:44.260> little<00:06:44.470> bit<00:06:44.560> of<00:06:44.650> a<00:06:44.710> mess<00:06:44.950> here

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
looks like a little bit of a mess here

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.830 
looks like a little bit of a mess here
so<00:06:45.670> in<00:06:45.820> the<00:06:45.910> comments<00:06:46.090> section<00:06:46.270> below<00:06:46.540> let<00:06:46.810> me

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
so in the comments section below let me

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.140 
so in the comments section below let me
know<00:06:46.930> how<00:06:47.050> you<00:06:47.170> think<00:06:47.290> I<00:06:47.530> did<00:06:47.680> on<00:06:47.890> my<00:06:47.920> box<00:06:48.370> and<00:06:48.670> I

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
know how you think I did on my box and I

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.640 
know how you think I did on my box and I
guess<00:06:49.330> that<00:06:49.540> did<00:06:49.750> for<00:06:49.900> now<00:06:50.050> this<00:06:50.230> is<00:06:50.290> go<00:06:50.440> out<00:06:50.500> to

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
guess that did for now this is go out to

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.310 
guess that did for now this is go out to
God<00:06:50.800> out
