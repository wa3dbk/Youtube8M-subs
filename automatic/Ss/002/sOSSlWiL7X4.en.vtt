00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
way you're gonna find a lot of material

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.970 
way you're gonna find a lot of material
and<00:00:35.460> food<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.239> need<00:00:36.510> equipment<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> more

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and food and need equipment so the more

better

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
better

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
better
you<00:00:40.980> should<00:00:41.100> also<00:00:41.250> build<00:00:41.790> yourself<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.360> bed

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
you should also build yourself a bed

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
you should also build yourself a bed
which<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.050> easy<00:00:43.290> enough<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.520> a

which is easy enough to do if you have a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.190 
which is easy enough to do if you have a
bed<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.180> will<00:00:45.360> sleep<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.750> lot<00:00:45.809> quicker<00:00:46.170> than

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
bed you will sleep a lot quicker than

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.400 
bed you will sleep a lot quicker than
with<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.559> sleeping<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> floor<00:00:48.410> trees

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
chop them from the top rather than the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.990 
chop them from the top rather than the
bottom<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> chop<00:00:53.070> them<00:00:53.219> from<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> top<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
bottom if you chop them from the top you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.430 
bottom if you chop them from the top you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
you can't bother to plant any more seeds

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
you can't bother to plant any more seeds
to<00:00:59.250> grow<00:00:59.430> another<00:00:59.609> tree<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.510> leave<00:01:00.629> one

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
to grow another tree you can leave one

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.689 
to grow another tree you can leave one
chunk<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.350> bottom<00:01:01.620> left<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.399> grow

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
chunk at the bottom left it will grow

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.490 
chunk at the bottom left it will grow
and<00:01:02.940> you'll<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.600> able<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> chop<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> down<00:01:04.049> again
