00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 good question and there is also 

00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.659
 actually the case I think we're going 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.069
 talk about yoann gourcuff 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.350
 he could have me I do not understand in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.340
 talk all the wii because I do not 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.920
 do not understand what player he has what in 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.710
 does he get hurt or not down he's 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 is a choice of coach does not know 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.500
 give up his retirement sincerely I get 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.820
 weary she chose so that's it then we 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.010
 would make his choice of the coach while 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.080
 the coach up project yeah that's it 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.119
 because contrary as rasic did it 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.580
 obviously inquired the prosecutor 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.560
 so we ask questions and we 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.490
 ask people inside a little 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.960
 outside the club 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 me what I was told is that gourcuff 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.010
 was not necessarily 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.870
 of a total exemplarity or in any case 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.160
 with a huge investment 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.480
 in recent days see these 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.040
 weeks in training and that's that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 the coach hubert fournier in his head he 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.610
 is upset 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.280
 no but thinks why I would play 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.900
 and I would start a player who does not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.370
 gives not necessarily 100% while 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.480
 others do it but hold 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.190
 most of the noise from corridors or 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.510
 three who will honor clients but 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.160
 that's what we see and that's what we see 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.480
 confirmed me before and after the coach di 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 meco finally the training we see from there 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.699
 less and less because there is more in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.230
 more in camera we say like that at 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.519
 bottom of the skirt that's true for all 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 great clubs of europe 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.300
 the training takes place at 8 kg then 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.649
 and barrot milan for example you can 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.240
 never let me see also I 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.259
 know it was okay I 'm not saying 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.640
 that it's bad but it looks like it's 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.020
 an exclusive Lyon is not a 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.910
 exclusivity but hop a small step 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.320
 the habit and the room and it's thanks to 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.520
 that but then you tell me hey you then you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.479
 have seen it now I do not see it because 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 that now it's open but 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.030
 constituent is put into play in my 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.100
 expectations I just explain that me 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.750
 surprised I can not develop so much 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.920
 on it because what we see 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.030
 now is what coaches 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.259
 who are open is when there was this 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.399
 balloon and work in front of the goal for 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.350
 judge the investment daily 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.550
 after frankly it's complicated to very 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.929
 clearly to come back so what is that 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.130
 you make phone calls and 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.509
 to return to gourcuff 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.369
 actually everyone was waiting for him 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.720
 to say he does not he has not a 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.429
 huge investment and that at wholesale 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.110
 it's a bit me, I want you 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.819
 schematic I caricature a little but 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.349
 it's I want to play to ride in 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.819
 power and on the other hand tara coach 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:49.500
 who says yes but if you show no more 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.700
 I'm not going to start because he 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 there are fewer and fewer matches and that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.970
 others who invest more and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.920
 who show more envied and ben I them 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.009
 sends a bad signal so I 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.020
 find that we're the gourcuff the up to 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.819
 its best level it has its place 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.590
 a billion times in this team of 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.360
 nose on the other hand if he does not have a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.069
 sufficient investment but it 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.020
 finds quite logical ensures altic 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.130
 is the laughing stock of not starting with 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.330
 report to the rest of the group 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.069
 it's good especially that at this moment you 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.170
 plays without him and with the exception of the match 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.300
 to pledge you come from matches so I 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.380
 mean that the coach at some point 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.490
 he plays on velvet no but it's 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.300
 consistent with the decision of the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.710
 ua panel show the 4k 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.330
 inter taxes and without any interest from 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.090
 give appointments to the 89th you are 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.830
 okay get it back the 88th and 89th 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.040
 pascal internet at nokia no interest 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.290
 after frankly psychologically 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.910
 speaking he's gone he's preparing his 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.050
 next season elsewhere very 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.880
 clearly I think he is very 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.870
 clearly we are in agreement there you have 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.640
 no info but that's what you do 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.680
 no intro but here I have to have 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.920
 rubbed several players and players 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.710
 high level here is lille who has very 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.120
 clearly he is gone already they 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.830
 prepare next season elsewhere and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.120
 I think there was not even 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.950
 hurt precisely at the end of the season 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.540
 to be able to make a good preparation 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.150
 sorry not what you say is very serious 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.620
 in view of the player's history yes 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.940
 but that's for sure at the arrival of the three 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.560
 last four months and the big parade 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.970
 but still is it that today and 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.820
 happened with ol he 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.980
 happened there is as you say there is a 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.660
 backlogged with and between yoann gourcuff and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.620
 the club today we are here if the 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.890
 part also deny is that there is a 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.710
 reason 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.120
 So here it is 24 years and a half 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.470
 is there and I have the impression that we 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.910
 not advanced an inch do not fear them 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.620
 that is to say that when we want to see 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.570
 and yes but no but when you do not play 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.520
 not you tell the world but it is still 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.020
 hurt it's annoying it's annoying to 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.090
 the training I passed 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.290
 of involvement and that's when he plays and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.970
 that he is at his level everyone there 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.390
 remedying extraordinary as one can 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.650
 to do without 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.030
 So here we are now 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.970
 saying because he's hurt who 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.100
 do not play but here in monaco we psg you 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.750
 who's playing it's probably going to like to 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.890
 every time be one of the best we go 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.209
 to say but how can a 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.980
 player like that but with him it's 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.870
 always but it will not always change 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.280
 of course does nicolas time with you 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.480
 by my side I tell myself that when he plays 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.620
 and we can not play him 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.700
 use 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.290
 invested we do not want to invest on a 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.519
 exceptional movement no worries 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.959
 sectional but I put myself on a 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.190
 guy who's not reliable but he had 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.080
 reached yet was forbidden a 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.879
 kopeck that I'm just telling you that 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.049
 every time we smoke and quézac Thursday 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.780
 but it's amazing I have nothing to 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.959
 to lose we can not sum up the defeat 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.180
 of last night not understanding the same 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.560
 interests to bring in and that just 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.340
 to finish that part of responsibility 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.600
 is shared 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.799
 it's not just they're occupying 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.199
 not bitter dances who are bilingual at 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.240
 ass because we feel the queue also be 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.350
 lucid the easy one here i am the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.830
 pilot then part of responsibilities 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.830
 this is of course
