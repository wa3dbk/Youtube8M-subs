whatsoever so that was definitely
something<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.659> impressed<00:01:43.020> me<00:01:43.200> I've<00:01:43.890> had<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
something that impressed me I've had it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
something that impressed me I've had it
out<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> heat<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.659> reason

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
out in the heat and the one reason

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.870 
out in the heat and the one reason
you'll<00:01:46.110> see<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> tan<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
you'll see that I have a tan one is I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.960 
you'll see that I have a tan one is I
don't<00:01:47.939> want<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> buy<00:01:48.570> black<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.350> OD<00:01:49.770> green<00:01:49.979> they

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
don't want to buy black or OD green they

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
don't want to buy black or OD green they
also<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> blue<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.890> tan

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.490 
also do a blue one but I like to tan

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
because it doesn't absorb the heat in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.800 
because it doesn't absorb the heat in
the<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.219> winter<00:01:56.430> time<00:01:56.670> or<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.509> winter<00:01:57.630> time

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
in the summertime so it doesn't heat up

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.880 
in the summertime so it doesn't heat up
as<00:02:00.149> much<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> Sun<00:02:01.290> move<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> the

the<00:03:13.690> way<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.079> come<00:03:14.319> down<00:03:14.500> towards<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:14.950> bottom

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
the way and come down towards the bottom

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.420 
the way and come down towards the bottom
and<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:16.239> can<00:03:16.359> get<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.690> way<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.349> that's<00:03:17.980> one

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
and it can get in the way so that's one

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.879 
and it can get in the way so that's one
small<00:03:18.880> thing<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.599> could<00:03:19.780> find<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.230> was<00:03:20.829> a

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
small thing that I could find that was a

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.949 
small thing that I could find that was a
huge<00:03:21.220> fan<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.489> but<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.299> know<00:03:22.389> it's<00:03:22.750> not<00:03:22.900> that

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
huge fan of but you know it's not that

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.900 
huge fan of but you know it's not that
huge<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.410> deal<00:03:23.620> they<00:03:23.859> do<00:03:23.919> have<00:03:24.190> an<00:03:24.310> o-ring<00:03:24.459> on

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
huge a deal they do have an o-ring on

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.089 
huge a deal they do have an o-ring on
the<00:03:25.180> valve<00:03:25.389> up<00:03:25.630> top<00:03:25.870> here<00:03:26.139> but<00:03:26.650> they<00:03:26.739> do<00:03:26.799> not

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
the valve up top here but they do not

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.280 
the valve up top here but they do not
have<00:03:27.340> one<00:03:27.609> on<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.060> inside<00:03:28.209> here<00:03:28.840> as<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.230> can

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
have one on the inside here as you can

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.770 
have one on the inside here as you can
see<00:03:29.379> this<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.400> exactly<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:31.030> same<00:03:31.239> type<00:03:31.569> of

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
see this is exactly the same type of

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.069 
see this is exactly the same type of
ring<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.530> see<00:03:32.560> on<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.919> main<00:03:34.079> closure

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
ring that you see on the main closure

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.690 
ring that you see on the main closure
here<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.069> there<00:03:36.579> is<00:03:36.669> a<00:03:37.200> ring<00:03:38.200> on<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.829> valve<00:03:39.190> but

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
here so there is a ring on the valve but

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.180 
here so there is a ring on the valve but
not<00:03:39.879> on<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> two<00:03:40.299> openings<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:41.079> fill<00:03:41.379> made<00:03:42.040> of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
not on the two openings to fill made of

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.759 
not on the two openings to fill made of
you<00:03:42.430> know<00:03:42.519> bpa-free<00:03:43.379> polymer<00:03:44.379> so<00:03:44.530> you're<00:03:44.680> not

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
you know bpa-free polymer so you're not

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.319 
you know bpa-free polymer so you're not
gonna<00:03:44.889> have<00:03:45.160> anything<00:03:45.489> leaching<00:03:46.030> into<00:03:46.180> the

with canadian-made things so they're

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.699 
with canadian-made things so they're
definitely<00:04:13.599> doing<00:04:13.959> a<00:04:14.019> good<00:04:14.139> job<00:04:14.199> with<00:04:14.379> making

definitely doing a good job with making
it<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.250> like<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.430> said<00:04:15.489> there's<00:04:15.730> lots<00:04:15.819> of

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
it and like I said there's lots of

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.779 
it and like I said there's lots of
colors<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.449> they<00:04:17.199> are<00:04:17.229> stackable<00:04:18.039> which<00:04:18.639> is

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
colors and they are stackable which is

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.330 
colors and they are stackable which is
even<00:04:19.060> better<00:04:19.180> for<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.560> know<00:04:20.650> storage<00:04:21.039> space

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
even better for you know storage space

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.980 
even better for you know storage space

if you're looking to you know use it in

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.450 
if you're looking to you know use it in
a<00:04:23.050> smaller<00:04:23.349> space<00:04:23.590> or<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.010> just<00:04:24.130> want<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.400> be

a smaller space or you just want to be

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.260 
a smaller space or you just want to be
efficient<00:04:24.909> with<00:04:24.969> your

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
face having a stackable is a huge

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.040 
face having a stackable is a huge
benefit<00:04:27.970> there's<00:04:28.270> also<00:04:28.360> another<00:04:28.569> company
