00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
trying to dictate the pace and the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.420 
trying to dictate the pace and the
momentum<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.770> don't<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> backlash

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
momentum but I don't think the backlash

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
momentum but I don't think the backlash
is<00:01:56.939> quite<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.710> harsh<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:59.009> quite<00:01:59.640> as<00:02:00.259> emotional

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
is quite as harsh or quite as emotional

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.139 
is quite as harsh or quite as emotional
as<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.710> last<00:02:01.950> year<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.399> Daniel<00:02:02.790> Bryan

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
as it was last year when Daniel Bryan

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
as it was last year when Daniel Bryan
didn't<00:02:03.540> win<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.200> Royal<00:02:04.380> Rumble<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:04.860> was

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
didn't win the Royal Rumble but was

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.350 
didn't win the Royal Rumble but was
still<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.399> main<00:02:05.549> event<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.850> Wrestlemania

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
still in the main event of Wrestlemania

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.999 
still in the main event of Wrestlemania
anyways<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:07.170> year<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.619> isn't<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
anyways this year that isn't going to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.889 
anyways this year that isn't going to
happen<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.789> Daniel<00:02:09.060> Bryan<00:02:09.090> being<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
happen I think Daniel Bryan being in the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.119 
happen I think Daniel Bryan being in the
rings<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> Intercontinental<00:02:11.099> title

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
rings for the Intercontinental title

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.990 
rings for the Intercontinental title
division<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.270> boost<00:02:12.540> up<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
division is going to boost up the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.790 
division is going to boost up the
momentum<00:02:13.390> for<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.170> think<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.500> all

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
momentum for that and I think that all

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.290 
momentum for that and I think that all
is<00:02:15.010> right<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.370> world<00:02:15.580> right<00:02:15.850> now<00:02:15.880> in<00:02:16.210> the

is right in the world right now in the
