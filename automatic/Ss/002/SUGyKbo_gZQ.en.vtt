00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.129
 hello friends today I bring you as 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.710
 change the tone to motorola motokey 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:12.290
 because since what you have are very 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.450
 Formes we are going to 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.869
 to the play store at this moment I do not have 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.779
 internet but you can download any 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.530
 file manager and I downloaded the one that 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.800
 makes me 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.800
 easier to occupy already here are the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.369
 I show 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.369
 is the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.550
 es file explorer is already here because it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.430
 it made me easier because they do not have 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.340
 a science of occupying it we get ourselves 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.960
 now the application 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.949
 we go back to the first thing to change the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.350
 rector, we are leaving here, 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.559
 appears for those who have as I do not know 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.780
 your facebook sounds and that's me 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.870
 I have this why 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.360
 I configured it as I configured it I went to 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.100
 music and select 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.110
 in any of these songs as 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.860
 so by keeping it tight there we are going to 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.260
 copy 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.550
 and we go back and we go to the language 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.800
 and here it gives us the option of pasting 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.210
 we stick it 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.200
 it's ready it was stuck successfully 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.680
 to go back we 're going to go to 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.470
 sound and tone settings 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.900
 phone already and here they will look like everything 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.380

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.730
 ring and I have them here and see how 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.470

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.980
 we give the volume to listen 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.950
 action 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.510
