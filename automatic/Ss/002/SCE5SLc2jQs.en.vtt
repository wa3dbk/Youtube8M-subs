let's<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:33.050> speed<00:00:34.050> test<00:00:34.440> app

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
let's just go with the speed test app

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.540 
let's just go with the speed test app
here<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.380> also<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.800> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> check

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
here so you can see that i'm on the same

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
here so you can see that i'm on the same
kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.430> network<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> let's<00:00:47.129> give<00:00:47.280> 46<00:00:47.910> ok

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
kind of network here so let's give 46 ok

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.220 
kind of network here so let's give 46 ok
we<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:48.870> funky<00:00:49.500> variant<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.899> see<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.110> can

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
we are funky variant here see if we can

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.700 
we are funky variant here see if we can
connect<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.399> well<00:00:54.680> connect<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
connect that here as well connect to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.240 
connect that here as well connect to
that<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.550> they<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.879> running<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> same<00:00:59.870> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
that so they are running on the same and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.200 
that so they are running on the same and
let's<00:01:02.250> pop<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.730> speed<00:01:03.239> test<00:01:03.510> app<00:01:03.690> here

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
let's pop up this speed test app here

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.149 
let's pop up this speed test app here
sweet<00:01:06.210> smell<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.740> into<00:01:08.040> settings<00:01:08.400> and
