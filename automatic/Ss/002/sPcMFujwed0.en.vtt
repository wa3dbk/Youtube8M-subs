00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.320
 start spinach recipes with chickpeas 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.059
 simple healthy and very easy 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.530
 we started churrera the first thing we're going 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.280
 to do if you want to have done I do not pass 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.470
 nothing do not worry we're going to fry bread 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 and adore garlic worth olive oil 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 extra virgin take three slices of bread 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.180
 and four cloves of garlic what we're going to 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.950
 to do is what is called a crush that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.810
 It is usually done with mortar but 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.400
 People say that with the mortar 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 it stays the same my grandmother does not have either 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.060
 mobile phone and now we use mobile 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.280
 so for that we have the blender is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.439
 a resource 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.360
 I like this section what the 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:39.899
 advisers when I cook do not shut up the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.899
 kitchen art 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.750
 super concentrated enters the kitchen 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:55.409
 concentrate these submarines that are you 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.630
 maintaining but finite 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.329
 look now just a little bread no 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.969
 it's needed even without the fried bread but 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.579
 the fried bread gives a different touch and 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.579
 the calories too 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.220
 dad I'm bored as always what 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.600
 same flame dove you will continue eating what 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.760
 same 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.430
 please more things we put oil look 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.650
 not good after the bread is not left 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.330
 do not like it but you will see now the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.330
 spinach are a very important source 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.220
 of many minerals what happens that the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.220
 iron that people think they have 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.210
 A lot is not so much a beginner because 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.310
 the money that you have to source 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.990
 vegetable is not absorbed like the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.960
 animal then good has many 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.110
 properties but that iron 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.670
 they are taking lots and for the recipe 500 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.860
 grams of fresh spinach 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.290
 practically for a serving of two 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.790
 three people that is that this loses 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.480
 It has a lot of water and nothing is left now 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.460
 to put what you want for pregnant 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.960
 if you have a lot of folic acid and it's a 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.310
 way to increase the consumption of that 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.490
 nutrient for pregnant people 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.950
 perfect look more let's do the 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.180
 balance churrera the bread we are going to put 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.000
 paprika 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.500
 a tad there a little after cum 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.780
 ground 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.820
 the spices we always say the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.920
 healthy that are in general for the 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.150
 health and then also that bread that you 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.250
 has laughed is true that you have not put 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.080
 a lot of oil there are ways to fry the bread 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.050
 because it is true that the bread when frying it 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.940
 you absorb a lot of oil if you there what 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.040
 you do with little oil that's the ration 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.790
 of bread you can have to see you know 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.500
 what is your name 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.340
 has a scientific name as it has been 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.340
 seen maddalena coffee 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.220
 a study of chocolates 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.580
 we put milk instead of water 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.569
 we use milk and we put milk here 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.549
 I'm going to put salt 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.049
 you know that salt is a condiment that 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.749
 teachers use a lot in 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:11.920
 schools for children go out daily using 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:14.319
 the most we put pepper that I like to 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.389
 me a little bit and we're going to crush chan 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.579

 what is staying in nothing like the 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.139
 churrera do not grind here 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.650
 if you see that you are very thick, 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.030
 You can add a little more milk and 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.280
 nothing happens 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.370
 it is crushed well you are making a 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.100
 recipe that is very very healthy and very 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.560
 recommended in all families by 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.170
 the least legumes twice so 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.090
 less per week and also how are you 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.370
 making cooked with vegetables is a 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.050
 very healthy dish and you know what the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.760
 great secret of these recipes really 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.980
 do it because if it does not stay the same it is 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.440
 Always put him before he is in his 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.130
 cooked point a little bit 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.130
 and this way 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.120
 do not put him 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.650
 great delicious let's go this is already 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.780
 unplugged always always the 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.729
 blenders are unplugged first for 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.580
 avoid accidents never hit the 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:22.050
 containers if they are mostly glass 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.050
 he is tapped like this is asia 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.750
 this carefully we put it here 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.360
 we keep it prepared churrera because 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:35.729
 I'll take the majado this what 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.550
 is that it prevents the formation of 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.139
 chickpeas people then go to the movies 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.840
 may have a problem then clear 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.259
 with the cumin nothing cumin without 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.990
 solution to that problem I like we put 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.759
 the mangled we will put look at the 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.169
 carbonara spinach or spinach with 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.270
 chickpeas takes in vinegar but if 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.189
 we put vinegar in the most and best takes 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.400
 Milk can we cut the milk 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.509
 then we always add the mashed 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.699
 we mix and there cooked chickpeas 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.860
 I directly match chickpeas 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.659
 cooked 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.300
 I'm going to make good use of the yogurt quoted from 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:11.279
 the churrera nothing made herrera as 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.810
 note that your children are already big 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.810
 is taking advantage of your little bit or nothing 

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:26.199
 and you know how it is you imagine how 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.829
 the miracle of the tele of 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.929
 the TV 

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:31.479
 spinach abracadabra with chickpeas 

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:32.829
 chickpeas with spinach after 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.269
 know much more time what 

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:37.239
 we would have approximately as 

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:39.219
 15-20 minutes but gentle fire and with more 

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:41.619
 spinach we would catch our father lito 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:44.619
 let's go around here with the chickpeas and 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:46.239
 cooked you have it 15-20 minutes with the 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:48.029
 chickpeas if they are cooked about 15 

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:52.419
 enough minutes to warm up 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:55.589
 but if the chickpea is not cooked 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:07:02.289
 you can take advantage of the chickpea water 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:07:04.359
 that says javier four days and look and 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.279

 Garbanzo already has proteins and that is a 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:19.329

 It is a way to flavor the dish 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.330
 Man is a unique dish in a single dish 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.889
