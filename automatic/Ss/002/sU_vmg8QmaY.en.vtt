00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 cruel thing strange to someone like 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.109
 her and a ticket to the culture of someone not, but I 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.269
 I think most would agree that 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.700
 modern saving up without it would not be 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.980
 so popular personally, I can not afford 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.410
 present a story about wolverine without puddles 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.199
 blood and a bunch of claws because all these 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.330
 moments make the story more interesting 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.880
 how do you respond to cruelty 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.430
 which goes all imaginable 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.369
 unimaginable boundaries i lesha m &amp; a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.720
 a comic that will come in all frames 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.890
 extraordinary talent for mouth rostruda 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.890
 from the company and night 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.370
 the main character of the comic is a teenager named 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.109
 Luther Straud typical lonely hoarse you 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.539
 pale nerd from american movies 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.970
 who all the time gets lyuley from 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.040
 healthy guys from his school decided in 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.930
 one day change all luther orders 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.240
 imagine a special course called 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.009
 Hercules of the method intended to make of 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.770
 goner tough guy 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.320
 able to answer something for the abuser 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.539
 little book began to actively me strictly up to his 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.030
 reaction strength and agility swiftly 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.759
 grown himself unwilling to beat luther 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.429
 his long-time offender nehilo and 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.590
 knocks the best friend with labor offers 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.810
 the former bespectacled direct his power to 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.360
 the right direction, that is to become a superhero 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.280
 oddly enough luther agrees not even 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.259
 suspecting what a terrible force and 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.840
 petroleum jelly for a moment a simple book on 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.030
 pumping up muscles and luther stroud is a character 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.630
 which immediately causes associations with 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.060
 the singer 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.369
 one appearance of a hero 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.319
 but little of this event taking place in 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.299
 comics also often resemble 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.399
 famous work melora but if in 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.619
 comic march cruelty was high and 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.350
 it looked like it was in the order of things 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.570
 blood and intestinal levels in lutere just behind 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.119
 edge but despite this story not 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.039
 It looks bad at first it seems that the whole 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.750
 cruelty is unjustified but only the end 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.789
 plot you will understand why were 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.890
 added to the mountains of bloodied corpses 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.739
 the ending is worth it to start reading 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.690
 the story is already very unexpected on 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.000
 Justin Jordan worked as a script 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.900
 which is before writing a line especially nothing 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.970
 didn't stand out 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.950
 but if the story is able to please not 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.170
 all ink believe the picture looks 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.120
 almost every gamor filter 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.340
 I have a pleasant association with 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.680
 graffiti pop culture in general all 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.959
 looks very unusual and sharp 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.480
 bright and very dynamic emotions 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.040
 characters in general cannon can spend hours 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.760
 look at comic pages 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.340
 enjoy 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.620
 armies of pictures I think you will like 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.989
 on top of that the comic has its 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.480
 part looking for his very cool colorist 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.609
 Philip Breuer with a master of his craft 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.160
 you can't say hard shadow 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.799
 chic complement picture mora gamma 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.250
 comics just higher color class warm and 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.410
 bright probably the best colorist for 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.840
 series you can not imagine that 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.150
 Regarding the publication Alex has found life with us 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.820
 thanks to the water publishing and this or 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.920
 debut work series goes out format 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.770
 characters and consists of six editions 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.070
 quality paper at a height of a good gloss 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.140
 transfer of bright colors everything is as it should be 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.180
 fonts also did not let them down since 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.820
 covers and ending with text balloons 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.890
 look very good what surprised so 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.320
 this carcass publishers did not distort 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.459
 swear words in the text I personally do not 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.290
 lover of censorship 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.660
 if the story was conceived with such 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.230
 text she should take stay and yes 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.120
 Of course the comic is strictly 18 + numbers 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.040
 comes out with a frequency of about 1 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.860
 month which is not very cool also 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.000
 upset it that our publishers have removed 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.770
 additional arts and afterwords 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.530
 authors who were in the original 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.570
 the edition is perfectly complemented it perhaps 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.820
 these are the only cons so all on 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.459
 pretty steep level if you want 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.980
 read superheroes are already tired of 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.440
 batman spiderman and other want 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.540
 something more bloody and substandard 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.930
 a lot of action and gorgeous picture 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.410
 guys this series of pit for you with you 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.709
 only and 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.709
 m and eat pray read comics to all
