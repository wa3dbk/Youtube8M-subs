a number of infant car seats on the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.060 
a number of infant car seats on the
market<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:17.020> had<00:02:17.260> problems<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.950> even

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
market that have had problems and even

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.800 
market that have had problems and even
recalls<00:02:18.640> because<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.180> what's<00:02:19.330> called<00:02:19.510> false

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
recalls because of what's called false

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.830 
recalls because of what's called false
locking<00:02:20.350> where<00:02:20.890> parents<00:02:21.280> putting<00:02:22.120> their<00:02:22.300> seat

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
locking where parents putting their seat

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.990 
locking where parents putting their seat
in<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.140> base<00:02:23.350> would<00:02:24.070> hear<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> click<00:02:24.580> thinking

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
in the base would hear a click thinking

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.550 
in the base would hear a click thinking
it<00:02:25.090> was<00:02:25.210> locked<00:02:25.390> into<00:02:25.570> place<00:02:25.720> when<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.080> wasn't

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
it was locked into place when it wasn't

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.250 
it was locked into place when it wasn't
now<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.010> key<00:02:27.430> fit<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.880> nearly<00:02:28.150> impossible<00:02:28.420> to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
now the key fit is nearly impossible to

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.410 
now the key fit is nearly impossible to
have<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.920> not<00:02:30.070> lock<00:02:30.370> into<00:02:30.670> place<00:02:30.820> as<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.240> put

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
have it not lock into place as you put

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.090 
have it not lock into place as you put
it<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:31.810> simple<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.320> slides<00:02:32.590> right<00:02:32.710> into<00:02:32.980> place

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
it so simple it slides right into place

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.330 
it so simple it slides right into place
the<00:02:33.790> second<00:02:34.270> reason<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.680> way<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.220> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the second reason is the way that the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.020 
the second reason is the way that the

simply install them on the latch in the
