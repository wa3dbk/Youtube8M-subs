00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.349
 Hello UTB catalog wobblers and I qc 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.350
 Sergey today with you I want 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.080
 conduct a test without ki nodes to see 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.779
 how knotless mounting is stronger 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.019
 nodal now we will make a small 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.660
 test as a result of which we will learn 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.009
 how different are these two installations 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.030
 help us in this here 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.829
 power pro cord is a chinese copy 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.180
 original cord 6-liter tying 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.150
 it is common to all 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.160
 famous knot I usually 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.590
 case and six flowers when using 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.750
 nodal installation will do everything according to science in order 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.630
 under friction 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.630
 temperature did not damage the cord wet it 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:20.950
 tighten the nodal month 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.950
 our ready to remove excess cord 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:37.939
 We include ours and weights and we pull 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:41.659
 we pull 4 kilograms 420 grams on this 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:46.360
 mark cord could not stand where we look 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.170
 torn on the scales nothing left 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.310
 the cord broke together nodal connections 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:59.270
 that is, the location of the nodal connection 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.220
 turned out to be the weakest right now 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.959
 same test 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:09.649
 but with the help of a nodal connection 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:18.079
 let's see how the figure on the scales will be 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:21.859
 differ nothing complicated in nodal 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.000
 mounting no she this piece of cord 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.000
 has undergone 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.810
 deformations we will remove it now for 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.840
 purity experiment this aside and so 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.870
 make a loop 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:44.030
 we take our knotless we hook on 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:47.540
 hooks do so many turns 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.390
 which you get and just 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.730
 we stretch all the knotless in the ringlet 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.010
 the installation is ready very simply quickly and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:03.590
 convenient and so interesting what 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:12.569
 the frag will now be on the scales 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:19.489
 pull we pull we pull so here about 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:25.010
 cord broke wow 6 kilograms 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:31.829
 460 grams that's the difference 4 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:36.840
 420 and 6 460 look where broke the cord 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:40.440
 and see that he broke not in the area 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.709
 installation that is not node-free installation 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.290
 lowers the strength of the cord 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:51.120
 myself successfully applying without nodes and ki all 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.659
 I advise you to have one choice without 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.930
 evil 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:04:01.190
 very very subtle nuance but very 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.129
 distressed these unconditional excellent a 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.359
 Here I bought myself such here without 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:12.599
 knots glasses and very much in them 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:15.109
 disappointed what problem am I now 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.109
 I'll show it to you 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:24.780
 the ends of the wire are cut under the sharp 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:28.320
 angle ie 1 without knots, we have ki 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.940
 two needles literally this 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:36.030
 just needles when mounting on parsing 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.090
 montage if God forbid something somewhere 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.430
 confused punched fingers to you 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:47.529
 secured now I'll show you 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:50.049
 how acute I am without any particular 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:52.449
 and breaks the package along with 

00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:55.409
 potato which is inside a 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.859
 here's no nodes to another manufacturer 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:01.419
 everything is different here and you need to apply 

00:04:58.859 --> 00:05:02.349
 some effort to knock itself 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.149
 package 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.319
 it's not easy to do because 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:11.829
 end dumb pay attention to how 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:16.629
 the cut ends of the wire did not bring 

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:20.019
 This is a bunch of punched fingers I want to say 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:23.019
 I want to advise everyone to apply 

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:27.359
 knotless mounting because knotless 

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:29.169
 mounting is something that brings real 

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:32.049
 specifications 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.809
 cord to break those numbers that 

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:37.599
 shown on the box because it is with 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:40.980
 help without node assemblies experience 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:43.800
 cord strength in the laboratory 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.880
 Here is such a test turned out all or 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.870
 tail scales 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.870
 see you soon
