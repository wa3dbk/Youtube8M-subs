through<00:04:56.780> seven<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.110> each<00:04:57.200> world<00:04:57.380> owner<00:04:57.710> shines

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
through seven of each world owner shines

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.440 
through seven of each world owner shines
do<00:04:58.039> not<00:04:58.160> count<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.520> fina<00:04:58.700> Plaza<00:04:58.970> shines<00:04:59.300> by

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
do not count the fina Plaza shines by

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.909 
do not count the fina Plaza shines by
not<00:04:59.600> you<00:04:59.720> you're<00:05:00.140> just<00:05:00.410> regarded<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.860> do

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
not you you're just regarded to do

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.260 
not you you're just regarded to do
missions<00:05:01.340> one<00:05:01.490> through<00:05:01.669> seven<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:01.970> each<00:05:02.060> world

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
missions one through seven of each world

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.110 
missions one through seven of each world
that<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.840> it

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
that is it

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.790 
that is it
go<00:05:04.540> ahead<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.780> do<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.960> usual<00:05:05.080> fast<00:05:05.440> way<00:05:05.620> down

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
go ahead and do the usual fast way down

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.770 
go ahead and do the usual fast way down
now<00:05:06.340> there's<00:05:06.520> very<00:05:06.730> easy<00:05:07.030> route<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.570> going

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
now there's very easy route to going

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.000 
now there's very easy route to going
through<00:05:07.930> this<00:05:08.020> level<00:05:08.260> basically<00:05:08.650> what<00:05:08.889> I<00:05:08.919> do

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010

be a coins of hop out of those bills why

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.510 
be a coins of hop out of those bills why
I<00:05:26.050> don't<00:05:26.380> know<00:05:26.560> but<00:05:26.860> whatever<00:05:27.160> it's<00:05:27.340> just<00:05:27.370> a

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
little extra polishing this SI thing

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
little extra polishing this SI thing
that<00:05:29.650> bugs<00:05:29.800> me<00:05:29.860> everyone<00:05:30.130> always<00:05:30.220> says<00:05:30.400> this

that bugs me everyone always says this

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.950 
that bugs me everyone always says this
game<00:05:30.699> is<00:05:30.940> like<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.090> Mario<00:05:31.360> game<00:05:31.479> with<00:05:31.750> doctor

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
game is like a Mario game with doctor

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
polish I can't disagree more honestly it

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.770 
polish I can't disagree more honestly it
really<00:05:35.020> does<00:05:35.530> have<00:05:35.740> a<00:05:35.770> lot<00:05:35.860> of<00:05:35.979> cool<00:05:39.270> just<00:05:40.270> yeah

really does have a lot of cool just yeah
the<00:05:41.380> data<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:42.040> it<00:05:44.400> if<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.490> spray<00:05:45.729> these

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
the data that it if you spray these

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.159 
the data that it if you spray these
things<00:05:46.120> with<00:05:46.210> water<00:05:46.419> you<00:05:46.570> can<00:05:46.720> change<00:05:47.050> the

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
things with water you can change the

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.629 
things with water you can change the
direction<00:05:47.290> that<00:05:47.620> the<00:05:47.710> platform<00:05:48.160> is<00:05:48.280> facing

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
direction that the platform is facing

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.920 
direction that the platform is facing
though<00:05:48.760> but<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.150> really<00:05:49.360> don't<00:05:49.450> find<00:05:49.660> it<00:05:49.780> all

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
though but I really don't find it all

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.640 
though but I really don't find it all
that<00:05:49.960> necessary<00:05:51.840> of<00:05:52.840> course<00:05:52.990> I<00:05:53.320> don't<00:05:53.380> get<00:05:53.560> the

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
that necessary of course I don't get the

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.370 
that necessary of course I don't get the
red<00:05:53.800> ball<00:05:53.979> when<00:05:54.160> I<00:05:54.190> say<00:05:54.400> it's<00:05:54.550> not<00:05:54.639> necessary

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
red ball when I say it's not necessary

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.170 
red ball when I say it's not necessary
go<00:05:56.380> back<00:05:56.500> and<00:05:56.680> get<00:05:56.770> that<00:05:56.919> again<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:58.030> course

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
go back and get that again of course

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.960 
go back and get that again of course
yeah<00:05:58.570> we're<00:05:58.780> not<00:05:58.870> going<00:05:59.080> for<00:05:59.229> speedruns<00:05:59.650> here

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
yeah we're not going for speedruns here

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.250 
yeah we're not going for speedruns here
because<00:06:00.970> I<00:06:01.180> really<00:06:01.600> am<00:06:01.690> NOT

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260

I've<00:06:03.260> heard<00:06:03.470> what<00:06:03.620> people<00:06:03.710> who<00:06:03.919> saw<00:06:04.040> my

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
I've heard what people who saw my

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.540 
I've heard what people who saw my
speeder<00:06:04.430> numbers<00:06:04.729> down

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
speeder numbers down

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.170 
speeder numbers down
let's<00:06:06.060> spray<00:06:06.389> this<00:06:06.599> and<00:06:06.960> make<00:06:07.680> it<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:08.280> made<00:06:09.150> it

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
let's spray this and make it I made it

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.490 
let's spray this and make it I made it
go<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.599> opposite<00:06:10.020> way

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
go the opposite way

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.800 
go the opposite way
whatever<00:06:11.550> anyway<00:06:11.849> that's<00:06:11.940> number<00:06:12.150> seven<00:06:12.449> and

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
whatever anyway that's number seven and

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:19.369 
whatever anyway that's number seven and
number<00:06:13.440> eight<00:06:13.740> is<00:06:14.039> right<00:06:14.099> up<00:06:14.759> here<00:06:18.080> over<00:06:19.080> and

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:19.379 
number eight is right up here over and

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.760 
number eight is right up here over and
who<00:06:19.530> did<00:06:19.830> it<00:06:19.860> I<00:06:21.020> got<00:06:22.020> hit<00:06:22.169> by<00:06:22.199> that<00:06:22.319> enemy<00:06:22.740> I

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
who did it I got hit by that enemy I

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:32.559 
who did it I got hit by that enemy I
swear<00:06:23.129> to<00:06:23.220> God<00:06:23.370> just<00:06:26.509> pause<00:06:27.509> and<00:06:27.750> random<00:06:28.020> pool

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:34.999 

and<00:06:33.569> just<00:06:33.990> jump<00:06:34.139> over<00:06:34.229> these<00:06:34.440> incredibly<00:06:34.830> easy

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:35.009 
and just jump over these incredibly easy

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:36.559 
and just jump over these incredibly easy
to<00:06:35.039> jump<00:06:35.220> over<00:06:35.400> things<00:06:35.550> and<00:06:35.879> you<00:06:36.150> get<00:06:36.330> your

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:36.569 
to jump over things and you get your

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:47.510 
to jump over things and you get your
shine<00:06:37.050> sprites<00:06:44.960> and<00:06:45.960> as<00:06:46.440> for<00:06:46.680> that<00:06:46.830> I<00:06:47.099> think

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
shine sprites and as for that I think

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.890 
shine sprites and as for that I think
we're<00:06:47.639> coming<00:06:47.759> up<00:06:47.970> on<00:06:48.120> the<00:06:48.240> time<00:06:48.419> limit<00:06:48.720> yet

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
we're coming up on the time limit yet

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.809 
we're coming up on the time limit yet
again<00:06:49.169> here<00:06:49.409> unfortunately<00:06:49.560> though<00:06:50.280> so<00:06:50.580> I
