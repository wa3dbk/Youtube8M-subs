00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.330 
totally broken or not there's no way
that<00:00:30.840> Warner<00:00:31.140> Brothers<00:00:31.439> didn't<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:32.160> about

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that Warner Brothers didn't know about

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.520 
that Warner Brothers didn't know about
the<00:00:32.579> broken<00:00:32.790> state<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> pc<00:00:33.780> port<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.350> if

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the broken state of the pc port and if

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.130 
the broken state of the pc port and if
they<00:00:34.710> didn't<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:35.969> an<00:00:36.149> excuse<00:00:36.660> anyways

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
they didn't that's not an excuse anyways

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.069 
they didn't that's not an excuse anyways
because<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.770> their<00:00:38.280> job<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:39.030> publish<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.750> good

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
because it's their job to publish a good

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
because it's their job to publish a good
product<00:00:40.680> I'm<00:00:40.920> sure<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.700> had<00:00:41.910> some<00:00:42.149> people

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
product I'm sure they had some people

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.240 
product I'm sure they had some people
test<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> pc<00:00:43.200> version<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.739> tell<00:00:44.040> them<00:00:44.190> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
test the pc version and tell them that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.670 
test the pc version and tell them that
it<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.460> broken<00:00:44.969> before<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.420> released<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.200> now

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it was broken before it released so now

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290 
it was broken before it released so now
it's<00:00:46.920> obvious<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.700> knew<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> game<00:00:48.239> was

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it's obvious that they knew the game was

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's obvious that they knew the game was
broken<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.079> why<00:00:49.530> did<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:49.739> release<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.280> why

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
broken so why did they release it why

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
broken so why did they release it why
didn't<00:00:50.730> they<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:50.850> delay<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> pc<00:00:52.079> version

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
didn't they just delay the pc version

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.490 
didn't they just delay the pc version
and<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.070> answer<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.629> money<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:55.170> course

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and the answer is money of course

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
and the answer is money of course
because<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.730> consumer<00:00:57.390> that's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
because it's not the consumer that's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
because it's not the consumer that's
important<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.649> consumers<00:00:59.399> money<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
important it's the consumers money and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.610 
important it's the consumers money and
the<00:01:00.329> reason<00:01:00.600> why<00:01:00.690> delaying<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> game<00:01:01.440> would

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the reason why delaying the game would

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
the reason why delaying the game would
cost<00:01:01.859> money<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> game<00:01:03.120> would<00:01:03.420> most

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
cost money is that the game would most

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
cost money is that the game would most
likely<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.439> ready<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.070> couple<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.640> months

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
likely be ready in a couple of months

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.969 
likely be ready in a couple of months
because<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.659> could<00:01:06.810> fix<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.470> let's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
because if they could fix this in let's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
because if they could fix this in let's
say<00:01:08.159> two<00:01:08.220> weeks<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.360> would<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.720> delay

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
say two weeks then they would just delay

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
say two weeks then they would just delay
it<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.040> wouldn't<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.340> such<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
it because then it wouldn't be such a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
it because then it wouldn't be such a
big<00:01:11.880> deal<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.869> had<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> release<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
big deal so if they had to release the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
big deal so if they had to release the
pc<00:01:13.979> version<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.580> month<00:01:14.909> or<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.570> road

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
pc version a month or two down the road

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.420 
pc version a month or two down the road
then<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.409> would<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.860> run<00:01:17.009> some<00:01:17.040> sort<00:01:17.400> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
then they would have to run some sort of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.039 
then they would have to run some sort of
marketing<00:01:17.909> campaign<00:01:18.270> again<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> remind

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
marketing campaign again to remind

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.749 
marketing campaign again to remind
people<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.040> coming<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.549> pc

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
people that it was coming out on pc

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.399 
people that it was coming out on pc
because<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> lot<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.689> happen<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.170> months

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
because a lot can happen in two months

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.380 
because a lot can happen in two months
it's<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.130> internet<00:01:23.580> something<00:01:23.939> new<00:01:24.060> catches

up for some of the triple-a titles that

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
up for some of the triple-a titles that
would<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:40.590> around<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.920> corner<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.579> I'm

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
would be right around the corner so I'm

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.310 
would be right around the corner so I'm

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that it would be more profitable to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
that it would be more profitable to
release<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.119> buggy<00:01:45.540> pc<00:01:46.049> port<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.799> patch
