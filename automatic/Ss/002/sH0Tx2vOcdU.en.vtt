00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.790 
look at the hose lock flexi spray hose
that<00:00:06.420> reference<00:00:06.899> 2<00:00:07.200> 6<00:00:07.500> 8<00:00:07.710> 3<00:00:07.880> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.030> quite<00:00:09.330> new

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
that reference 2 6 8 3 this is quite new

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.110 
that reference 2 6 8 3 this is quite new
and<00:00:10.800> obviously<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.280> been<00:00:11.400> advertised<00:00:11.880> on

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
and obviously it's been advertised on

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.740 
and obviously it's been advertised on
the<00:00:12.150> telly<00:00:12.480> recently<00:00:13.790> with<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> packaging<00:00:15.480> it

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the telly recently with the packaging it

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.900 
the telly recently with the packaging it
does<00:00:16.080> come<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.859> instructions<00:00:17.400> tell<00:00:17.730> you

does come and the instructions tell you
that<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.650> this<00:00:19.650> holding<00:00:20.130> device<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.730> be

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
that this this holding device can be

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.849 
that this this holding device can be
screw<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> wall<00:00:21.660> or<00:00:21.960> whatever<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.650> you

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
screw to a wall or whatever so that you

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.370 
screw to a wall or whatever so that you
can<00:00:23.070> safely<00:00:23.359> safely<00:00:24.359> store<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.840> product<00:00:25.230> if

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
can safely safely store the product if

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
can safely safely store the product if
you<00:00:25.500> want<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:25.890> if<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.130> dispense<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.000> for

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you want but if I dispense with that for

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.630 
you want but if I dispense with that for
now<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:28.410> look<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> Flex<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.310> spray

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
now and we look at the Flex of spray

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.430 
now and we look at the Flex of spray
itself<00:00:31.309> it's<00:00:32.309> principally<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.300> piece<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.200> hose

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
itself it's principally a piece of hose

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040 
itself it's principally a piece of hose
and<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> whole<00:00:35.070> thing<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.610> about<00:00:36.030> two<00:00:36.510> foot<00:00:36.840> or

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and the whole thing is about two foot or

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.549 
and the whole thing is about two foot or
sixty<00:00:37.469> centimetres<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.520> length<00:00:39.450> once<00:00:40.320> it's

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
sixty centimetres in length once it's

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.850 
sixty centimetres in length once it's
extended<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> principle<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.379> this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
extended but the principle is that this

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.330 
extended but the principle is that this
length<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.910> hose<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.930> ultimately<00:00:46.530> flexible

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
length of hose is ultimately flexible

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.950 
length of hose is ultimately flexible
and<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.789> flexed<00:00:48.300> into<00:00:48.480> any<00:00:48.750> particular

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and can be flexed into any particular

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.639 
and can be flexed into any particular
shape<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.950> want<00:00:50.420> for<00:00:51.420> various<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.260> various

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
shape you want for various for various

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.139 
shape you want for various for various
watering<00:00:53.610> tasks<00:00:54.149> around<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.629> garden<00:00:56.149> now

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
watering tasks around the garden now

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
watering tasks around the garden now
when<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.510> fully<00:00:57.750> extended<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> say<00:00:59.010> it's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
when it's fully extended as I say it's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
when it's fully extended as I say it's
approximately<00:00:59.250> two<00:00:59.969> foot<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.539> length<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
approximately two foot in length so it

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.520 
approximately two foot in length so it
gives<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> some<00:01:01.829> extra<00:01:01.969> reach<00:01:03.379> when<00:01:04.379> you're

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
gives you some extra reach when you're

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.420 
gives you some extra reach when you're
watering<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.189> garden<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.409> handle<00:01:07.890> itself

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
watering in the garden the handle itself

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.330 
watering in the garden the handle itself
is<00:01:08.670> nice<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.270> chunky<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.979> trigger

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
is nice and chunky it's got the trigger

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.420 
is nice and chunky it's got the trigger
there<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.900> got<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> trigger<00:01:13.470> lock<00:01:13.890> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
there and it's got a trigger lock so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.330 
there and it's got a trigger lock so
that<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.420> hose<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:16.020> stay<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.220> on

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that there the hose can stay in the on

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.450 
that there the hose can stay in the on
position<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:18.119> obviously<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> water<00:01:19.460> flowing

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
position and obviously the water flowing

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.649 
position and obviously the water flowing
throughout<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.090> hose<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> water<00:01:23.759> control<00:01:24.360> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
throughout the hose the water control is

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.289 
throughout the hose the water control is
here<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:26.009> full<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.759> will<00:01:26.909> give<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
here and at full it will give you a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
here and at full it will give you a
hundred<00:01:27.509> percent<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> water<00:01:28.710> flow

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
hundred percent of the water flow

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.109 
hundred percent of the water flow
through<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:30.390> threw<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> flexi<00:01:31.920> spray<00:01:32.310> when

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
through they threw the flexi spray when

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.840 
through they threw the flexi spray when
it's<00:01:33.270> turned<00:01:33.570> fully<00:01:33.960> down<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:35.130> will<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.610> give

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it's turned fully down it will just give

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.390 
it's turned fully down it will just give
you<00:01:35.880> fifty<00:01:36.659> percent<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.920> that's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.220> nice

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you fifty percent so that's a nice

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.609 
you fifty percent so that's a nice
useful<00:01:38.939> feature<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.049> tweak<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
useful feature in that you can tweak it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.039 
useful feature in that you can tweak it
and<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.610> much<00:01:41.820> water<00:01:42.119> flow<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.780> want

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and have as much water flow as you want

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.170 
and have as much water flow as you want
or<00:01:43.680> reduce<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.700> too<00:01:44.790> powerful

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
or reduce it if it's too powerful

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.120 
or reduce it if it's too powerful
it<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.810> spray<00:01:48.230> gun<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.830> spray

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
it is like a spray gun and the spray

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.850 
it is like a spray gun and the spray
head<00:01:49.370> itself<00:01:49.850> has<00:01:50.510> got<00:01:50.750> four<00:01:51.200> different

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
head itself has got four different

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.860 
head itself has got four different
settings<00:01:53.110> jet<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.350> one<00:01:54.850> rose<00:01:55.850> using<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.720> hog

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
settings jet is one rose using the hog

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.860 
settings jet is one rose using the hog
Rose<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.620> another<00:01:58.610> one<00:01:58.880> for<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.360> for<00:01:59.570> instance

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
Rose is another one for so for instance

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.620 
Rose is another one for so for instance
sprinkling<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.680> lawn<00:02:00.890> would<00:02:01.190> be<00:02:01.370> ideal<00:02:01.790> and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
sprinkling the lawn would be ideal and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.160 
sprinkling the lawn would be ideal and
it's<00:02:02.810> even<00:02:03.110> got<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.320> water<00:02:03.680> fill<00:02:04.930> option<00:02:05.930> so

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
it's even got a water fill option so

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.830 
it's even got a water fill option so
that<00:02:06.290> if<00:02:06.380> you're<00:02:06.500> filling<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.980> water<00:02:07.840> watering

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
that if you're filling a water watering

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.200 
that if you're filling a water watering
can<00:02:09.080> for<00:02:09.380> instance<00:02:09.610> it'll<00:02:10.610> quickly<00:02:10.850> and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
can for instance it'll quickly and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.590 
can for instance it'll quickly and
easily<00:02:11.360> do<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.020> for<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:14.030> there<00:02:14.240> see<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
see what sort of spray we get so if I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.600 
see what sort of spray we get so if I
select<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.770> spray<00:02:43.250> pattern<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.580> ESDA

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
select a spray pattern so that ESDA

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.940 
select a spray pattern so that ESDA
there's<00:02:47.570> these<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.730> define<00:02:50.720> spray<00:02:51.260> I've

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
there's these that the define spray I've

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.130 
there's these that the define spray I've
got<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.610> trigger<00:02:53.230> lock<00:02:54.340> locked<00:02:55.340> into<00:02:55.640> place

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
got the trigger lock locked into place

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.660 
got the trigger lock locked into place
and<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:58.040> can<00:02:58.370> change<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.510> flow<00:03:00.010> up<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.070> a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
and I can change the flow up to a

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.449 
and I can change the flow up to a
hundred<00:03:02.150> percent

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
hundred percent

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.890 
hundred percent
so<00:03:04.030> that's<00:03:04.329> a<00:03:04.780> very<00:03:05.769> useful<00:03:05.890> device<00:03:06.900> and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
so that's a very useful device and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.319 
so that's a very useful device and
that's<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.260> decent<00:03:08.469> sort<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.010> spray<00:03:11.340> also<00:03:12.340> just

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
that's a decent sort of spray also just

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.390 
that's a decent sort of spray also just
turn<00:03:13.569> that<00:03:13.599> off<00:03:13.810> for<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.200> moment<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.709> can<00:03:15.250> use

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
turn that off for a moment I can use

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.610 
turn that off for a moment I can use
this<00:03:15.549> as<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.819> long<00:03:16.090> reach<00:03:16.420> sprayer<00:03:17.079> so<00:03:17.439> if<00:03:17.530> I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
this as a long reach sprayer so if I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.069 
this as a long reach sprayer so if I
need<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:17.980> get<00:03:18.159> to<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.730> particular<00:03:19.510> area<00:03:19.750> that's
