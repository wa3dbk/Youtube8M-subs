on<00:00:26.810> 90<00:00:27.199> millimeter<00:00:27.500> wheels<00:00:27.710> it's<00:00:28.039> a<00:00:28.160> lot

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
on 90 millimeter wheels it's a lot

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.820 
on 90 millimeter wheels it's a lot
faster<00:00:28.550> so<00:00:29.359> it's<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:29.599> great<00:00:29.779> urban<00:00:30.050> scaped<00:00:30.380> to

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
faster so it's a great urban scaped to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.220 
faster so it's a great urban scaped to
get<00:00:30.949> more<00:00:31.130> speeds<00:00:31.460> but<00:00:32.300> with<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:32.540> GT<00:00:32.900> boot<00:00:33.110> you

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
get more speeds but with the GT boot you

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.620 
get more speeds but with the GT boot you
still<00:00:33.440> get<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.560> highly<00:00:33.710> responsive<00:00:34.630> freestyle

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
still get a highly responsive freestyle

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.330 
still get a highly responsive freestyle
slalom<00:00:35.900> type<00:00:36.230> skate<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:36.800> can<00:00:36.920> do<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.040> highly

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.280 
276 millimeter Max 90 millimeter wheel
size<00:00:55.700> so<00:00:55.880> 276<00:00:56.630> know<00:00:56.750> me<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.900> little<00:00:57.020> bit<00:00:57.110> longer

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
size so 276 know me a little bit longer

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.230 
size so 276 know me a little bit longer
lengths<00:00:57.770> that's<00:00:58.340> still<00:00:58.610> very<00:00:58.790> short<00:00:59.060> when<00:00:59.180> you

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
lengths that's still very short when you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.670 
lengths that's still very short when you
consider<00:00:59.540> at<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.720> 90<00:00:59.900> millimeter<00:01:00.200> setup<00:01:00.530> that

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
consider at a 90 millimeter setup that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.840 
consider at a 90 millimeter setup that
let's<00:01:00.860> look<00:01:00.980> that's<00:01:01.220> what<00:01:01.370> helps<00:01:01.580> give<00:01:01.760> you

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
let's look that's what helps give you

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.780 
let's look that's what helps give you
that<00:01:02.030> control<00:01:02.330> and<00:01:03.260> maneuverability<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.640> got

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
that control and maneuverability you got

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.889 
that control and maneuverability you got
ilq9<00:01:05.269> pro<00:01:06.020> bearings<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:06.759> what's<00:01:07.759> neat<00:01:08.359> on<00:01:08.600> the

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
ilq9 pro bearings and what's neat on the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.440 
ilq9 pro bearings and what's neat on the
the<00:01:09.320> GTS<00:01:09.859> 90<00:01:10.219> boot<00:01:10.399> is<00:01:10.609> the<00:01:10.670> mounting<00:01:11.210> plates

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
the GTS 90 boot is the mounting plates

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.109 
the GTS 90 boot is the mounting plates
these<00:01:12.020> are<00:01:12.229> built<00:01:12.500> into<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.009> boot<00:01:13.219> what<00:01:13.969> that

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
these are built into the boot what that

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.270 
these are built into the boot what that
does<00:01:14.359> is<00:01:14.570> give<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:14.960> lot<00:01:15.530> more<00:01:15.560> control<00:01:15.950> of

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
does is give you a lot more control of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.399 
does is give you a lot more control of
stability<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:16.909> response<00:01:17.450> because<00:01:18.229> the

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
stability and response because the

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.599 
stability and response because the
plates<00:01:18.649> have<00:01:18.799> known<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.219> shift<00:01:19.460> they're

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
plates have known to shift they're

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.039 
plates have known to shift they're
actually<00:01:19.880> mounted<00:01:20.179> within<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.719> molded<00:01:21.020> shell

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
actually mounted within the molded shell

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.830 
actually mounted within the molded shell
itself<00:01:21.499> and<00:01:21.890> you'll<00:01:22.340> also<00:01:22.490> notice<00:01:22.609> a<00:01:23.390> bunch<00:01:23.659> of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
itself and you'll also notice a bunch of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.779 
itself and you'll also notice a bunch of
holes<00:01:24.020> on<00:01:24.200> there<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.530> got<00:01:25.219> the<00:01:25.340> mounting<00:01:25.609> bolt

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
holes on there I got the mounting bolt

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:26.859 
holes on there I got the mounting bolt
in<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.909> middle<00:01:26.119> one<00:01:26.240> here<00:01:26.359> let<00:01:26.509> me<00:01:26.539> take<00:01:26.749> this

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
in the middle one here let me take this

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.569 
in the middle one here let me take this
out<00:01:27.079> so<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.259> get<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> better<00:01:27.469> shot<00:01:27.560> those<00:01:28.399> are

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
out so you get a better shot those are

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.800 
out so you get a better shot those are
all<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.880> different<00:01:29.179> positions<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.630> can

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
all the different positions you can

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.779 
all the different positions you can
mount<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.140> frame<00:01:30.380> not<00:01:31.009> only<00:01:31.249> can<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.609> mount

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
mount the frame not only can you mount

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.789 
mount the frame not only can you mount
it<00:01:31.909> move<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:32.719> from<00:01:32.899> side<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.229> side<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.710> a

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
it move it from side to side in a

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.679 
it move it from side to side in a
lateral<00:01:34.069> adjustment<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:35.240> could<00:01:35.390> literally

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
lateral adjustment you could literally

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.139 
lateral adjustment you could literally
move<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.259> frame<00:01:36.499> in<00:01:36.770> seven<00:01:37.249> different<00:01:37.759> spots

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
move this frame in seven different spots

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.179 
move this frame in seven different spots
in<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> back<00:01:38.689> plate<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.170> seven<00:01:39.770> in<00:01:39.859> the<00:01:39.920> front

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
in the back plate and seven in the front

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.200 
in the back plate and seven in the front
so<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.369> can<00:01:40.520> move<00:01:40.640> at<00:01:40.789> all<00:01:40.939> of<00:01:41.119> these
