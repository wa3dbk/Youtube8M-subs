first happened was the head gasket blew

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.129 
first happened was the head gasket blew
and<00:00:12.410> then<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:14.040> bought<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.030> off<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> family<00:00:15.599> that

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
and then I bought it off the family that

didn't want to pay pay for it to be
fixed<00:00:18.560> thinking<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.710> it'd<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:20.070> awesome<00:00:20.550> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000

everything perfect got the machines head

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.360 
everything perfect got the machines head
the<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.130> heads<00:00:32.399> machined<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.090> everything

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
the the heads machined and everything

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.639 
the the heads machined and everything
every<00:00:35.370> torque<00:00:35.640> spec<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.180> done<00:00:36.390> correctly

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649

every everything was done perfect and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.520 
every everything was done perfect and
away<00:00:40.800> stuttered<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.410> coolant<00:00:43.410> coming

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
away stuttered it up and coolant coming

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.380 
away stuttered it up and coolant coming
out<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> back<00:00:44.129> white<00:00:44.789> smoke<00:00:47.300> coolant<00:00:48.300> was

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
out the back white smoke coolant was

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.709 
out the back white smoke coolant was
getting<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.750> oil<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.879> thought<00:00:51.149> either

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
getting in the oil so we thought either

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630 
getting in the oil so we thought either
there<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> cracked<00:00:52.500> either<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
there was a cracked either one of the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
there was a cracked either one of the
heads<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.969> cracked<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> block<00:00:54.840> was

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
heads was cracked or the block was

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.260 
heads was cracked or the block was
cracked<00:00:55.550> took<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.670> all<00:00:56.760> apart<00:00:56.879> had<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.190> heads

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
cracked took it all apart had the heads

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.880 
cracked took it all apart had the heads
pressure<00:01:00.270> tested<00:01:01.190> heads<00:01:02.190> turned<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.609> perfect

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
pressure tested heads turned out perfect

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.820 
pressure tested heads turned out perfect
my<00:01:04.890> inspect<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.729> block<00:01:06.330> myself<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
my inspect the block myself and it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
my inspect the block myself and it
seemed<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.119> well<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:11.450> inspected

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
seemed really good as well I inspected

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.960 
seemed really good as well I inspected
the<00:01:12.510> cylinders<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.680> top<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.189> obviously<00:01:14.820> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the cylinders and the top I obviously I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.850 
the cylinders and the top I obviously I
couldn't<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.390> inside<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.810> didn't<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> like

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
couldn't see inside I didn't have a like

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.270 
couldn't see inside I didn't have a like
a<00:01:16.890> mini<00:01:17.250> camera<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:17.759> anything<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:19.280> anyway

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
a mini camera or anything but anyway

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
a mini camera or anything but anyway
that<00:01:20.610> coolant<00:01:21.060> could<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.540> into<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that coolant could get into the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.740 
that coolant could get into the
cylinders<00:01:22.740> from<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.280> block<00:01:23.549> would<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.509> been

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
cylinders from the block would have been

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.120 
cylinders from the block would have been
either<00:01:25.710> crack<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> cylinder<00:01:26.790> wall<00:01:26.970> or

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
either crack in the cylinder wall or

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.679 
either crack in the cylinder wall or
something<00:01:29.130> else<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.549> mean<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.150> was<00:01:30.270> blow<00:01:30.479> by

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
something else I mean if it was blow by

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.090 
something else I mean if it was blow by
from<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> Rings<00:01:32.689> um<00:01:33.689> that'd<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.740> crazy

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
from the Rings um that'd be pretty crazy

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
from the Rings um that'd be pretty crazy
but<00:01:35.460> before<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> head<00:01:36.630> gasket<00:01:37.079> blew<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.409> car

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
but before the head gasket blew the car

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.760 
but before the head gasket blew the car
didn't<00:01:37.890> burn<00:01:38.159> any<00:01:38.460> oil<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.060> anything<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
didn't burn any oil or anything so I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.850 
didn't burn any oil or anything so I
really<00:01:41.280> don't<00:01:41.970> think<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:45.680> anyways<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
really don't think it's that anyways a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.850 
really don't think it's that anyways a
lot<00:01:46.890> started<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.710> show<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.799> guys

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
lot started up here and show you guys

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:04.500 
lot started up here and show you guys
what's<00:01:50.579> happening

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:26.399 

move<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.720> key

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.300 

this<00:02:27.409> starts<00:02:27.829> up<00:02:27.980> pretty<00:02:28.219> sweet<00:02:30.219> when<00:02:31.219> it

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
this starts up pretty sweet when it

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.759 
this starts up pretty sweet when it
first<00:02:31.519> starts<00:02:31.999> when<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.329> first<00:02:32.659> starts<00:02:33.260> up<00:02:33.379> just

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
first starts when I first starts up just

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.459 
first starts when I first starts up just
like<00:02:33.889> dumps<00:02:34.340> out<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.489> bit<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.760> cool<00:02:35.349> dumps<00:02:36.349> out<00:02:36.409> a

like dumps out a bit of cool dumps out a

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.990 
like dumps out a bit of cool dumps out a
bunch<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.769> colon<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:39.579> now<00:02:40.579> it's<00:02:40.790> running

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
bunch of colon and now it's running

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.280 
bunch of colon and now it's running
actually<00:02:41.450> pretty<00:02:41.659> rough

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.050 

because<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.799> hear<00:02:48.189> there's<00:02:48.370> like<00:02:48.489> an<00:02:48.610> air<00:02:48.849> leak

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
because I hear there's like an air leak

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.059 
because I hear there's like an air leak
somewhere<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.290> guys<00:02:50.439> can<00:02:50.620> probably<00:02:50.769> hear
