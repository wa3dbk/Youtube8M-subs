 allow me to get to the bikinis 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.190
 although for some thousand subscribers 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.440
 it would only be a figure for me are 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.510
 1000 people who are there watching everything 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.580
 the content that I make my videos and everything 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.349
 the rest besides there are many many people 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.480
 kevin is that they leave me very comments 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.520
 positive in some videos and it's very 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.110
 thank also this kind of 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.820
 comments are really the ones that I 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.619
 they cheer when I'm a little low on 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.509
 encouragement to continue making more videos 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.550
 well I 'm not going to roll much more because 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.070
 I want it to be a special short for 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.050
 you get bored and that show you a little bit 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.200
 visit we will see what is happening by 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 here 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.380
 well 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.380
 this would be the microphone that I use 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.680
 it's a microphone from some old helmets 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.280
 that they brought the built-in mic 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 helmets were lousy removes the micro 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 and it's not that you listen very well 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750
 but of the size 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.270
 I put it here on a kind of 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.549
 telescope toy medium 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.329
 that is useless and that's why 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.329
 use of support 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.970
 this is the monitor from the trophy 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.980
 over here I have the tablet with which 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.960
 edited many of the miniatures of the 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.800
 videos and some of the graphics that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 I come out in some videos 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.960
 he has his pen and good 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.760
 over here I have my computer is a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.610
 pretty old casing 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.820
 and good little by little over the years 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.890
 has changed the pieces 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.750
 and recently I put a piece that I 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.430
 It cost about fifty euros a processor 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.560
 so that it was a little more powerful and 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.480
 well it's not the best computer there 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.420
 right now but it's moderately web 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.820
 carry someone 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.369
 over here I have the google letter this 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.100
 Google tram card when when you 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.790
 you partner with adsense on youtube and 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.490
 good they send it to you with a code 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.319
 for 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.150
 to verify that you are a real person 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.069
 and to make the payments of the videos 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.370
 that I have at the moment still in 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.430
 He charges nothing and when copper is going to be 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.650
 as if I had not practically charged 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.170
 so you can already get an idea of how 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.740
 the matter is going 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.870
 and well my aquariums you already know them 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.290
 this is the 60 liter aquarium I have it 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.290
 here in my room 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.310
 there I have mons 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.230
 and good filters 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.490
 I have a backpack filter that 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.470
 cover it because I have a window here 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.120
 behind the aquarium 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.319
 and so that it does not give the light and does not 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.060
 make the gas like the folder 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.670
 so it covered all of these holes that there are in 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.020
 the aquariums 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.020
 that's the backpack filter 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.299
 and let's see the other aquariums here 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.400
 you have the 360-liter aquarium that 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.080
 you know it is an aquarium that they gave me 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.560
 and that's why I have some fish that are 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.010
 incompatible but good more or less I'm going 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.069
 taking care of them 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.860
 and next door is the 40-liter aquarium 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.920
 where I have a little mole and a moment 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.370
 someone is watching me 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.670
 a man a special guest 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.360
 came the roommate hello hello 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.360
 houses 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.400
 the most tender is no relief help 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.930
 in the 40 liters we also have a 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.270
 backpack filter just like in the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.070
 aquarium of 60 and for the aquarium of 160 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.960
 liters we have a basket filter 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.900
 av of serum so that we understand each other 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.160
 yen mark and that has enough power 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.500
 well I think the fish also 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.000
 deserve to celebrate the 1000 cherubs 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.260
 let's give it a little bit of alternate 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.880
 defrosted take shot 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.700
 so as there is a lot 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.740
 we have the spoon that you can others 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.420
 days you do not know what can happen 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.910
 look at the ground as you eat it is already 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.430
 what would he say when he was sick 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.069
 a few months ago I was so thin and 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.709
 deformed 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.049
 I did not think I would survive but medicate 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.269
 the fish pays off and here you have it 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.680
 the happiest of the aquarium 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.570
 demi moore and 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.190
 for the small hall there is also art 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.140
 mine 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.970
 although this fish eats rather little 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.650
 you have to ensure a good 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.900
 feeding 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.210
 and for the rest of the fish the brine shrimp 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.979
 what's left, pass me a little bit of quantity 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.919
 but it does not matter if the 2000 is celebrated 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.780
 kervin is eating there with a couple of good 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.190
 guys and girls again thank you very much 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.720
 for having subscribed daily in the 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.100
 aquarium and since you give it so much 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.169
 importance to the channel to be 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.910
 so many in the next videos I'm going to 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.590
 try to tidy up a bit more 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.020
 aquariums and the first thing we will do 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.940
 change some plants from the site where 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.680
 be better so that you are taking note 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.830
 that's why it serves some advice from those who 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.830
 I give 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.189
 this morning
