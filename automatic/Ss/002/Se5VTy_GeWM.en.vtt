00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.200 

now<00:01:17.840> that's<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.290> Guildhall<00:01:18.710> tavern<00:01:19.400> it<00:01:20.000> was

now that's the Guildhall tavern it was

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.120 
now that's the Guildhall tavern it was
formerly<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.869> bull<00:01:21.049> hotel<00:01:21.560> it's

formerly the bull hotel it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.070 
formerly the bull hotel it's
approximately<00:01:22.610> 2/3<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.510> mile<00:01:23.720> away<00:01:23.930> from

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
approximately 2/3 of a mile away from

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.980 
approximately 2/3 of a mile away from
the<00:01:24.350> friary<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.040> inside<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:26.060> building<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.930> a

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
the friary and inside that building is a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.440 
the friary and inside that building is a
well<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.979> many<00:01:28.250> say<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.520> is<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.030> second

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
well and many say that is the second

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.610 
well and many say that is the second
access<00:01:29.810> point<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.530> tunnel

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.110 

so<00:01:36.620> this<00:01:36.800> is<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> tunnels<00:01:37.700> final

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
so this is it the tunnels final

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.080 
so this is it the tunnels final
destination<00:01:38.810> denby<00:01:39.560> castle<00:01:39.980> which<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:40.880> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
destination denby castle which as the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.910 
destination denby castle which as the
crow<00:01:41.270> flies<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.840> approximately<00:01:42.470> just<00:01:42.650> over<00:01:42.890> a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
crow flies is approximately just over a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.580 
crow flies is approximately just over a
mile<00:01:43.250> from<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.790> friary<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.290> big<00:01:45.440> question

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
mile from the friary so the big question

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.670 
mile from the friary so the big question
must<00:01:46.010> be<00:01:46.100> does<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:47.270> tunnel<00:01:47.510> really<00:01:47.960> exist

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
must be does this tunnel really exist

00:01:48.680 --> 00:02:02.110 
must be does this tunnel really exist
some<00:01:49.400> say<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:49.730> doesn't<00:01:49.760> but<00:01:50.660> many<00:01:50.960> say<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.500> does

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.180
