be the one the skaters prefer to skate
as<00:00:25.260> far<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.980> straight<00:00:26.640> keyhole<00:00:27.150> pool

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
as far as just a straight keyhole pool

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.820 
as far as just a straight keyhole pool
there<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.109> other<00:00:28.199> pools<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.619> have

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
there are other pools that have

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.769 
there are other pools that have
different<00:00:29.250> designs<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
different designs but for like a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.810 
different designs but for like a
competition<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.710> makes<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> very<00:00:32.279> easy<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
competition it makes it very easy to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.120 
competition it makes it very easy to
judge<00:00:33.090> because<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.440> blinds<00:00:34.710> aren't<00:00:35.010> so

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
judge because it the blinds aren't so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.690 
judge because it the blinds aren't so

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.150 
skater he unfortunately just took a fall
which<00:01:37.780> would<00:01:37.930> cost<00:01:38.080> another<00:01:38.260> five<00:01:38.710> points

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
which would cost another five points

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.740 
which would cost another five points
yeah<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.670> guess<00:01:39.850> there's<00:01:40.030> two<00:01:40.090> hands<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.420> few<00:01:40.479> tip

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
yeah I guess there's two hands a few tip

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.000 
yeah I guess there's two hands a few tip
well<00:01:40.869> you<00:01:41.020> can<00:01:41.140> either<00:01:41.320> start<00:01:41.650> from<00:01:41.740> the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
well you can either start from the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.650 
well you can either start from the
starting<00:01:42.310> point<00:01:42.369> again<00:01:42.790> or<00:01:42.940> just<00:01:43.060> pick<00:01:43.300> up<00:01:43.479> the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
starting point again or just pick up the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.960 
starting point again or just pick up the
board<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.860> continue<00:01:45.340> from<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.580> point<00:01:45.820> where

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
board and continue from the point where

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.030 
board and continue from the point where
you<00:01:46.060> fell<00:01:46.300> right<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.990> could<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.470> could<00:01:47.710> start

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
you fell right you could you could start

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.410 
you fell right you could you could start
and<00:01:48.190> run<00:01:48.340> up<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.520> wall<00:01:48.760> and<00:01:48.940> jump<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.270> your

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
and run up the wall and jump on your

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.850 
and run up the wall and jump on your
board<00:01:49.660> but<00:01:50.200> it's<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.380> little<00:01:50.560> more<00:01:50.710> difficult

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
board but it's a little more difficult

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.950 
board but it's a little more difficult
it<00:01:51.340> takes<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.700> little<00:01:51.820> more<00:01:51.940> time<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:52.360> most<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
it takes a little more time so most the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.840 
it takes a little more time so most the
skaters<00:01:53.350> just<00:01:53.560> go<00:01:53.710> back<00:01:53.890> out<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.399> clock<00:01:54.610> does

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
skaters just go back out the clock does

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.600 
skaters just go back out the clock does
stop<00:01:55.149> when<00:01:55.390> they<00:01:55.479> fall<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:56.590> they<00:01:57.310> don't<00:01:57.490> lose

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
stop when they fall so they don't lose

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.880 
stop when they fall so they don't lose
any<00:01:57.670> time<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.450> they're<00:01:58.780> 45<00:01:59.080> second<00:01:59.590> routine

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
any time and they're 45 second routine

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.700 
any time and they're 45 second routine

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.030 
that bowl is ten feet deep remember
right<00:06:27.600> that's<00:06:27.870> two<00:06:28.230> feet<00:06:28.470> of<00:06:28.590> sheer<00:06:28.770> vertical

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
right that's two feet of sheer vertical

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.340 
right that's two feet of sheer vertical
path<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:30.390> sure<00:06:30.630> looks<00:06:30.840> like<00:06:31.020> it's<00:06:31.170> a<00:06:31.230> lot

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
path it sure looks like it's a lot

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.110 
path it sure looks like it's a lot
deeper<00:06:31.530> though<00:06:31.800> yeah

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
deeper though yeah

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.720 
deeper though yeah
the<00:06:34.080> vertical<00:06:34.440> really<00:06:34.860> makes<00:06:35.040> it<00:06:35.160> deceiving

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
the vertical really makes it deceiving

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.490 
the vertical really makes it deceiving
if<00:06:36.120> it<00:06:36.390> doesn't<00:06:36.660> have<00:06:36.780> vertical<00:06:37.200> they<00:06:37.320> don't

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
if it doesn't have vertical they don't

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.290 
if it doesn't have vertical they don't
look<00:06:37.620> nearly<00:06:37.860> as<00:06:38.040> deep<00:06:38.310> but<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.640> does<00:06:38.790> 90

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
look nearly as deep but that does 90

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.140 
look nearly as deep but that does 90
degree<00:06:39.570> wall<00:06:39.810> mm-hmm

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150

Stevie<00:06:42.150> had<00:06:42.300> a<00:06:42.330> little<00:06:42.540> trouble<00:06:42.840> with<00:06:42.870> this

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
Stevie had a little trouble with this

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.700 
Stevie had a little trouble with this
run<00:06:43.260> but<00:06:43.410> he'll<00:06:43.560> be<00:06:43.590> back<00:06:43.710> for<00:06:43.890> his<00:06:44.100> next<00:06:44.310> one

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
run but he'll be back for his next one

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.950 
run but he'll be back for his next one
do<00:06:46.820> skaters<00:06:47.820> ever<00:06:48.000> try<00:06:48.210> to<00:06:48.240> do<00:06:48.480> this<00:06:48.600> barefoot

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
do skaters ever try to do this barefoot

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.660 
do skaters ever try to do this barefoot
I<00:06:49.410> realized<00:06:49.830> you<00:06:49.950> would<00:06:50.070> you<00:06:50.370> know<00:06:50.490> have<00:06:50.580> a

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
I realized you would you know have a

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.520 
I realized you would you know have a
chance<00:06:50.730> to<00:06:51.030> really<00:06:51.180> rip<00:06:51.390> up<00:06:51.600> your<00:06:51.750> feet<00:06:51.990> but<00:06:52.200> it

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
chance to really rip up your feet but it

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.450 
chance to really rip up your feet but it
seems<00:06:52.710> like<00:06:52.860> you'd<00:06:53.010> have<00:06:53.100> a<00:06:53.160> little<00:06:53.220> more

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
seems like you'd have a little more

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.370 
seems like you'd have a little more
control<00:06:53.850> on<00:06:53.910> the<00:06:54.150> board<00:06:54.390> right<00:06:54.960> when<00:06:55.290> the

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
control on the board right when the

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.340 
control on the board right when the
quinces<00:06:55.590> capable<00:06:56.540> there's<00:06:57.540> a<00:06:57.600> replay<00:06:57.930> Yeah

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
quinces capable there's a replay Yeah

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.900 
quinces capable there's a replay Yeah
right<00:06:59.960> when<00:07:00.960> the<00:07:01.050> sport<00:07:01.380> originated<00:07:02.070> a<00:07:02.370> lot<00:07:02.790> of

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
right when the sport originated a lot of

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.550 
right when the sport originated a lot of
skateboarding<00:07:03.330> was<00:07:03.510> done<00:07:03.750> barefoot<00:07:04.170> uh-huh

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
skateboarding was done barefoot uh-huh

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.190 
skateboarding was done barefoot uh-huh
and<00:07:04.740> but<00:07:05.190> now<00:07:05.310> they've<00:07:05.580> you<00:07:06.570> know<00:07:06.630> all<00:07:06.870> gone<00:07:07.080> to

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
and but now they've you know all gone to

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.630 
and but now they've you know all gone to
the<00:07:07.290> shoes<00:07:07.530> they've<00:07:07.710> made<00:07:07.890> better<00:07:08.130> soles<00:07:08.460> on

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
the shoes they've made better soles on

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.160 
the shoes they've made better soles on
the<00:07:08.670> shoes<00:07:08.730> and<00:07:09.120> with<00:07:09.360> the<00:07:09.450> grip<00:07:09.690> tape<00:07:09.900> that's

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.170 
the shoes and with the grip tape that's

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.180 
the shoes and with the grip tape that's
on<00:07:10.320> top<00:07:10.500> of<00:07:10.680> the<00:07:10.740> board

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
on top of the board

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.880 
on top of the board
they<00:07:11.430> really<00:07:11.700> get<00:07:11.820> good<00:07:12.000> traction<00:07:12.270> but<00:07:13.140> due<00:07:13.860> to

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:13.890 
they really get good traction but due to

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.860 
they really get good traction but due to
safety<00:07:14.190> factors<00:07:14.760> of<00:07:14.880> stuff<00:07:15.060> there<00:07:15.240> you<00:07:15.630> must

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:15.870 
safety factors of stuff there you must

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.660 
safety factors of stuff there you must
wear<00:07:16.050> your<00:07:16.200> shoes<00:07:16.350> in<00:07:16.530> the<00:07:16.560> parks<00:07:16.950> how<00:07:17.520> those
