00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.020
 hello that such friends as is so good and 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.450
 in another new video in this video the 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.910
 let's see how it connects 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.360
 mixer the interface and from there to the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.150
 computer 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.760
 and good to start, it 's all the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.760
 interface that I have is a behringer 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.560
 there it is and it connects by means of 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.020
 our 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.040
 and it connects in any hole and 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 it serves to have your computer 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.290
 that's the one that I have and well I'm going to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.970
 show them how it connects the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.970
 interface and the mixer 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.070
 well we have our mixer here 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.660
 and the interface here is 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.900
 We're going to need two cables 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:02.610
 in January 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:04.840
 is not there and well the first thing is 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.980
 from one of the sections of our cable 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.710
 bullet let's connect in the output in 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.860
 black be from the mixer why 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.040
 because the negotiated exit does not come pre 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.710
 amplified as the output they already have 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.560
 that then I recommend you use 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.549
 the output in rsa is that table outputs 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.070
 special especially for 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:35.690
 recordings and good especially because 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.369
 the ok interface is used then the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.369
 we connect we connect our cable 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.990
 Y 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.080
 the other the other end we connect it in 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.440
 the input input in our interface 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.440
 okay 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.170
 perfect 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.460
 the interface is connected by usb 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 to the computer and good the other cable 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.680
 here can vary slightly because that 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.470
 there are two ways to connect it 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.130
 is connecting 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.020
 good first is to connect the outputs of 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.340
 the interface the audio interface comes 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.940
 it will always be input and 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.200
 audio output ok for an input goes to 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.090
 be an entry for an exit 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.819
 ok here may vary a bit why 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.430
 why 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.680
 these these two cables we can 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.290
 connect in the input input of 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.660
 our mixer or we can 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.810
 connect directly to the monitors 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.830
 that is she is this and now yes she 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.060
 It is up to you 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.130
 depending on how it is that they have 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.620
 the monitors because there are monitors that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.230
 come with a preamp and not 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.030
 they need a certain signal of a 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.150
 external amplifier to power 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.760
 feed 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.030
 then this output is this output of 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.030
 Audio 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.170
 will vary in this case we are going to 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:23.300
 connect to our mixer in the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.300
 input input of the mixer 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.100
 okay 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.950
 there is 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.290
 now the external monitors that have 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.710
 we are going to connect them through these 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.710
 two cables 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.860
 we are going to connect in the output of 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.290
 headphones 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.970
 that they have to bring the mixer and it 's 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.670
 that's why I recommend the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.920
 excavators bringuier because 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.400
 because they have two external outputs 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.500
 apart from the hearing aids that come already 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.239
 be balanced or an outlet is attracted 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.150
 which is left of the thread berths 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.670
 right do not come together in one 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.069
 single exit then that's why 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.650
 let's connect our monitors there 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.040
 in that 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.540
 in those outputs ok 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.489
 and well since this is connected by usb 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.539
 to the computer at any USB input 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.160
 have your computer there connect 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.389
 then the connection would be 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.180
 it would be like that 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.090
 I repeat that the cable that comes out of 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.430
 audio of the interface if you have 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.580
 the monitors already with amplifier the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.820
 can connect directly there and good 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.770
 no problem 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.300
 Now I'm going to show you how it is 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:48.000
 configure the interface within the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.620
 computer how is that since it 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.630
 connects how is how it is for how it is 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.060
 do to configure it ok 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.280
 well let's see I'm going to show you 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.690
 and well already being here in the 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.950
 computer we are going to connect our 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.170
 Interface 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.440
 there you hear the sound that is 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.420
 connects 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.030
 we go to printer devices 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.190
 from here they have to appear here is 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.190
 this and it's going to be configured 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.970
 they are not automatically doing any 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.970
 move you 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.780
 you just have to select us 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.430
 let's go to the speaker icon here 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.600
 we give him a right click and we put him 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.600
 recording devices 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.020
 Here you will see a given interface 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.020
 veriÃ±a 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.660
 they click 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.090
 and they put properties 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.780
 and here you put the level is 1 leave 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.760
 in 7 ok 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.250
 and the volume of the mixer has to 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.500
 be at 0 decibels master volume 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.570
 mix 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:58.360
 and here they leave it in 7 ok if the recording 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:01.800
 it's very short, so simply go up 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.800
 they upload you here 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.870
 and I 'm going to leave it in this case 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.330
 7 that is already putting you accept 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.150
 and here they click and click 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.690
 right and they put you establish as 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.390
 device 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.940
 finished me here I do not give it because I'm 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.990
 He would go out right now recording and the 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.630
 microphone 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.810
 then they give it to that set as 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.330
 default device and already 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.230
 They will appear here 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.639
 example well how comfortable is this when talking 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.590
 you put these green cookies 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.879
 like when you 're getting the 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.499
 audio on an interface because it's going to 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.719
 listen you will see the realities 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.340
 green here not that you put there existed 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:45.510
 but in terms of yale in accepting it 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.689
 key and well that would be all 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.599
 and open the program they have 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:54.809
 they put him to record and then automatically 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:58.289
 will detect the audio ok 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:59.689
 here in this style because you 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:03.930
 can do with any other program 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:06.690
 they have and well that would be all 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.970
 I hope you liked the video
