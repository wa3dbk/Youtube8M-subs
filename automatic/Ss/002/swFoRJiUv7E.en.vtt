00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
so we can get idea I'm thinking I want

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.450 
so we can get idea I'm thinking I want
to<00:06:06.349> try<00:06:06.529> to<00:06:06.590> make<00:06:06.770> a<00:06:06.800> part<00:06:07.039> I<00:06:07.129> think<00:06:07.279> I<00:06:07.310> might

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
to try to make a part I think I might

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.890 
to try to make a part I think I might
try<00:06:07.580> to<00:06:07.669> make<00:06:07.819> them<00:06:07.939> all<00:06:08.090> rideable<00:06:08.719> but

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
try to make them all rideable but

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.330 
try to make them all rideable but
everything<00:06:09.259> probably<00:06:09.439> hard<00:06:09.800> so<00:06:10.039> you<00:06:10.129> said<00:06:10.279> you

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
everything probably hard so you said you

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.980 
everything probably hard so you said you
can<00:06:10.460> go<00:06:10.550> down<00:06:10.699> the<00:06:10.819> green<00:06:11.029> one<00:06:11.210> we'll<00:06:11.689> just<00:06:11.719> do

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
can go down the green one we'll just do

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.550 
can go down the green one we'll just do
it<00:06:12.849> yeah<00:06:13.849> they<00:06:14.150> go<00:06:14.330> doctor<00:06:14.840> why<00:06:15.050> don't<00:06:15.319> you

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
it yeah they go doctor why don't you

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.730 
it yeah they go doctor why don't you
kill<00:06:15.860> yeah<00:06:16.550> so<00:06:16.909> you'd<00:06:17.180> see<00:06:17.479> you'd<00:06:18.289> be<00:06:18.409> coming

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
kill yeah so you'd see you'd be coming

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.899

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
through here yeah I can see how it'd be

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:24.279 
through here yeah I can see how it'd be
difficult<00:06:23.389> to<00:06:23.509> make<00:06:23.689> it<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:23.990> where<00:06:24.110> they're
