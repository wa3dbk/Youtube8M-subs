00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.450
 hi guys today the senses the 3 gadget 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.790
 very beautiful for your iphone 5 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.670
 then let's see what gadget I'm on 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.099
 speaking the first is an amplifier for 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.779
 iphone that works without batteries 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:23.100
 then we have a 60 microscope per per 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.930
 iphone 5 and finally a bumper for iphone 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.529
 5 then we go to see the first one 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.000
 gadget or the amplifier for iphone 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.059
 5 this mari workshop will allow us to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.790
 significantly increase the volume of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.360
 our device without using 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.360
 battery 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.480
 the material is rubber we can 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.809
 also use the amplifier as 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.610
 doc as there is a bit to insert the cable 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.739
 usb and then load ours 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 device 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:08.280
 let's try a little unlike the volumes 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:15.240
 without and with the amplifier we study here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:18.320
 ahead so it is without amplifier that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.320
 I had the amp 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:38.420
 we feel the difference we feel 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.210
 really blow ok 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.870
 continue with the next accessory 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.470
 that the microscope 60 is the iPhone 5 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.720
 this is a microscope will allow us 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.610
 zooming up to 60 times the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.070
 objects 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:03.290
 then what we find inside the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:05.030
 pack a microscope a case 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:11.530
 which will allow us to hook the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:16.209
 microscope above is neither finally 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.930
 this bag that will allow us to 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:24.190
 transport everything easily 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:31.090
 then we go to insert the case 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:34.090
 of the phone and now we insert the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.090
 microscope 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:57.060
 and here they are in the microscope are 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:01.830
 present two lights this is this one 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:06.090
 light on the violet we have the application 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:10.890
 camera and take for example one 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.360
 5 euro banknote and let's see how much 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.310
 is able to enlarge this 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.349
 microscope 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.790
 we see a little bit if you can not see it 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:29.340
 we see 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:31.910
 let's take 5 here we see ad 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.680
 example some photos I took before 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:42.540
 then we have this example here that 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:47.610
 you don't see well but it's an ant then 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:51.829
 we have this hood that would be the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:57.260
 letter of a keyboard and finally we have 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.260
 these are hairs from the Rio arm 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.639
 ok 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.920
 let's move on to the latest accessory from 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.400
 accessory is this bumper we go to 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.400
 open it 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.940
 and here I would highly recommend the 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.940
 bumpers for iPhone owners 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.790
 because they do not ruin the design 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.490
 especially for the iPhone 5 with the back 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.710
 so really very nice and protect it 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:40.190
 really very well 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:41.960
 insert the belly and here is how 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.920
 we can see the thickness remains almost 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.820
 unchanged and the design of the iPhone remains 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.770
 always the nice one thanks to all for 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.260
 have looked at the wine if you are 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.450

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.210
 accessories or you want to see others there 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.780
