plastic thing with a finger and thumb

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.650 
plastic thing with a finger and thumb
and<00:00:49.550> rotate<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.700> an<00:00:50.850> eighth<00:00:50.970> of<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.210> turn<00:00:51.420> only

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and rotate it an eighth of a turn only

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.740 
and rotate it an eighth of a turn only
clockwise<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.970> just<00:00:54.120> release<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
clockwise and it will just release the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.220 
clockwise and it will just release the
bulb<00:00:54.930> pull<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.650> towards<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.130> and<00:00:57.050> you'll<00:00:58.050> see

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
bulb pull it towards you and you'll see

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.270 
bulb pull it towards you and you'll see
the<00:00:58.350> bulb<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:59.070> held<00:00:59.310> in<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.270> holder

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
the bulb was actually held in the holder

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
the bulb was actually held in the holder
I'll<00:01:02.280> show<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.820> face<00:01:03.360> on<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.720> well<00:01:03.900> because

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
I'll show you it face on as well because

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.240 
I'll show you it face on as well because
you're<00:01:04.199> probably<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> reassemble<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you're probably going to reassemble it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.700 
you're probably going to reassemble it
like<00:01:05.399> this<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:06.450> actually<00:01:06.570> offset<00:01:06.899> slightly

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
like this it's actually offset slightly

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.960 
like this it's actually offset slightly
so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.220> make<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> note<00:01:08.759> of<00:01:08.790> where<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> bulb<00:01:09.479> fits

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
so I make a note of where the bulb fits

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.450 
so I make a note of where the bulb fits
where<00:01:11.970> before<00:01:12.120> you<00:01:12.330> remove<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
where before you remove it because it is

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.630 
where before you remove it because it is
actually<00:01:14.700> direction<00:01:15.300> when<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.510> goes<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.840> way

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
actually direction when it goes one way

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
actually direction when it goes one way
once<00:01:17.640> you've<00:01:17.760> got<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.150> far<00:01:18.300> as<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.770> if

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
once you've got it out as far as this if

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850 
once you've got it out as far as this if
you<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.250> two<00:01:20.670> small<00:01:20.820> screwdrivers<00:01:21.860> hook

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you just get two small screwdrivers hook

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.020 
you just get two small screwdrivers hook
it<00:01:22.979> under<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.430> piece<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.790> metal

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it under that little piece of metal

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.750 
it under that little piece of metal
there<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.390> there's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.750> clip<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
there because there's a little clip and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.149 
there because there's a little clip and
also<00:01:26.760> flip<00:01:27.120> it<00:01:27.299> over<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> other<00:01:27.659> side<00:01:28.159> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
also flip it over the other side and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.380 
also flip it over the other side and
there's<00:01:29.280> another<00:01:29.490> clip<00:01:29.760> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> other<00:01:30.060> side

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
there's another clip on the other side

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.180 
there's another clip on the other side
if<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.810> put<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> screwdriver<00:01:31.290> into<00:01:31.740> both<00:01:32.010> of

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
if you put a screwdriver into both of

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.399 
if you put a screwdriver into both of
those<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.510> black<00:01:33.780> plastic<00:01:33.990> part

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
those and then this black plastic part

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.140 
those and then this black plastic part
if<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.710> hold<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> metal<00:01:35.280> part<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.880> hand

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
if you hold the metal part at one hand

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.359 
if you hold the metal part at one hand
the<00:01:36.810> black<00:01:37.049> plastic<00:01:37.290> part<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.920> another<00:01:38.159> hand

the black plastic part with another hand

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
the black plastic part with another hand
and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.420> pull<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> off<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.200> like

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and then you can pull it off just like

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.680 
and then you can pull it off just like
you<00:01:40.440> would<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> normal<00:01:40.860> headlight<00:01:41.430> bulb

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
you would on a normal headlight bulb

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.630 
you would on a normal headlight bulb
bear<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.229> mind<00:01:43.260> it's<00:01:43.560> got<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.400> right<00:01:44.580> way

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
bear in mind it's got go the right way

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490 
bear in mind it's got go the right way
round<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.570> actually<00:01:45.960> showing<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
round that's actually showing it the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740 
round that's actually showing it the
correct<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:46.920> around<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.580> because<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.570> can

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
correct way around there because you can

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
correct way around there because you can
see<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.290> tabs<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.890> offset<00:01:50.580> slightly

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
see the little tabs are offset slightly

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.469 
see the little tabs are offset slightly
towards<00:01:51.540> me<00:01:51.750> towards<00:01:52.049> my<00:01:52.290> body<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> anyway

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
towards me towards my body so anyway

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.210 
towards me towards my body so anyway
once<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.020> put<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> bulb<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:55.710> into<00:01:56.100> its

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
once you put the bulb back into its

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.590 
once you put the bulb back into its
holder<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.640> its<00:01:56.760> own<00:01:56.880> board<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.150> as<00:01:57.240> far<00:01:57.450> as

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
holder and its own board it as far as

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.170 
holder and its own board it as far as
that<00:01:57.920> it's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.010> simple<00:01:59.400> matter<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.670> pushing<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that it's a simple matter of pushing it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.520 
that it's a simple matter of pushing it
into<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.560> headlamp<00:02:01.560> unit<00:02:02.780> push<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.080> flush

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
into the headlamp unit push it in flush

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.580 
into the headlamp unit push it in flush
line<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.659> then<00:02:06.810> turn<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.140> 1/8<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
line it up and then turn it 1/8 of a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.429 
line it up and then turn it 1/8 of a
tonne<00:02:07.799> that's<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.840> actually<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.259> not

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
tonne that's it actually it is not

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.910 
tonne that's it actually it is not
because<00:02:10.679> I've<00:02:10.799> missed<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.099> down<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> bottom

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
because I've missed it down the bottom

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.910 
because I've missed it down the bottom
that<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.069> it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
that is it

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.650 
that is it
as<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.580> can<00:02:15.670> see<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:15.910> just<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.240> don't<00:02:16.330> need<00:02:16.569> to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
as you can see it just you don't need to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.630 
as you can see it just you don't need to
undo<00:02:16.930> those<00:02:17.110> two<00:02:17.349> screws<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.370> think<00:02:18.580> you

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
undo those two screws what you think you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.260 
undo those two screws what you think you
might<00:02:18.790> do<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.890> literally<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.610> clip<00:02:22.030> back

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
might do it literally just clip back

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.710 
might do it literally just clip back
underneath<00:02:22.810> on<00:02:23.319> either<00:02:23.680> side<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.569> that's<00:02:25.569> how

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
underneath on either side and that's how

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.600 
underneath on either side and that's how
you<00:02:25.780> change<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.080> headlamp<00:02:26.440> bulb<00:02:26.650> on<00:02:26.800> an<00:02:26.920> e<00:02:27.040> 65

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
you change the headlamp bulb on an e 65

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.790 
you change the headlamp bulb on an e 65
