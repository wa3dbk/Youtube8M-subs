00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970 

Oh

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:18.030 

we

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:01:51.050 

euro-pro<00:00:19.040> pacino<00:00:19.730> manner<00:00:20.030> from<00:00:20.210> death<00:00:20.450> mask

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.450 

I<00:01:53.000> do<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.439> foundation<00:01:56.220> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
I do you think that the foundation of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
I do you think that the foundation of
our<00:01:56.610> part<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.939> our<00:01:57.000> band<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.450> majority

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
our part of our band you know majority

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
our part of our band you know majority
of<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.439> probably<00:01:59.009> more<00:01:59.880> than<00:01:59.939> metal

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
of it probably more than metal

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.190 
of it probably more than metal
percentile<00:02:00.950> but<00:02:01.950> um<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:03.329> know<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> think<00:02:03.960> all

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
percentile but um you know I think all

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
percentile but um you know I think all
the<00:02:04.320> all<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.560> other<00:02:04.799> elements<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.369> music

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the all the other elements in the music

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.719 
the all the other elements in the music
huh<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.289> offset<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.099> definitely

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
huh you know offset it I definitely

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.190 
huh you know offset it I definitely
think<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.630> derivative<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
think that you know but a derivative of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.530 
think that you know but a derivative of
metal<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.209> done<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
metal in I just think it's done in a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.080 
metal in I just think it's done in a
different<00:02:12.840> way<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:12.989> mean<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.349> not<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.090> way

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
different way I mean it's not the way

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.720 
different way I mean it's not the way
that<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.930> metal<00:02:16.380> traditionally<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.220> done<00:02:17.700> i

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
that that metal traditionally is done i

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.360 
that that metal traditionally is done i
think<00:02:17.819> i'm<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.470> took<00:02:19.470> some<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.830> some<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
think i'm just took some of some of the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.880 
think i'm just took some of some of the
basic<00:02:20.940> idea<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
basic idea or just you know the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.400 
basic idea or just you know the
heaviness<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.140> added

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
heaviness of it and you know just added

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.699 
heaviness of it and you know just added
new<00:02:25.530> elements<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.130> made<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.819> what<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.709> do

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
new elements and made it what it is do

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.280 
new elements and made it what it is do
you<00:02:28.799> think<00:02:29.040> Deftones<00:02:29.940> fills<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.780> hole<00:02:30.989> that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
you think Deftones fills the hole that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.190 
you think Deftones fills the hole that
brunch<00:02:31.890> gift<00:02:32.299> well<00:02:33.299> a<00:02:33.540> lot<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.780> people<00:02:33.900> are

once<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.850> became<00:03:01.130> commercial<00:03:02.209> then<00:03:03.209> everybody

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
once it became commercial then everybody

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.740 
once it became commercial then everybody
thought<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.829> was<00:03:05.040> passé<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.239> was<00:03:06.510> it

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
thought it was passé and it was it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.059 
thought it was passé and it was it
lasted<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.319> couple<00:03:07.350> years<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.890> then<00:03:07.980> it

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
lasted for a couple years and then it

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.220 
lasted for a couple years and then it
was<00:03:08.190> gone<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.700> our<00:03:09.510> main<00:03:09.660> goal<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:09.989> band

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
was gone and our main goal in this band

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.800 
was gone and our main goal in this band
i<00:03:10.319> think<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.560> longevity<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:12.209> i<00:03:12.420> think<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
i think is longevity and i think the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.690 
i think is longevity and i think the
only<00:03:12.989> way<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.799> we're<00:03:13.980> going<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.190> continue<00:03:14.400> to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
only way that we're going to continue to

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.020 
only way that we're going to continue to
have<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.720> longevity<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.489> stand<00:03:17.880> on

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
have that longevity is to is to stand on

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.090 
have that longevity is to is to stand on
our<00:03:18.060> own<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.750> be<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.470> be<00:03:19.590> our<00:03:19.709> own<00:03:19.829> band

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
our own and be and just be our own band

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.160 
our own and be and just be our own band
and<00:03:20.400> try<00:03:20.910> not<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> fit<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.569> too<00:03:21.720> much<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:22.139> a
