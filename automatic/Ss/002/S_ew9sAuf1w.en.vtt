new system just drop the UHF 8900 eight

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.269 
new system just drop the UHF 8900 eight
mic<00:00:21.300> wireless<00:00:21.960> system<00:00:22.380> ships<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.769> like<00:00:22.980> this

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
mic wireless system ships just like this

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.359 
mic wireless system ships just like this
case<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> assume<00:00:24.740> go<00:00:25.740> ahead<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.189> take

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
case in all I assume go ahead and take

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.070 
case in all I assume go ahead and take
us<00:00:26.609> through<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.570> mean<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:27.960> are<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
us through it and I mean how are you

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.259 
us through it and I mean how are you
able<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.560> eight<00:00:28.740> channels<00:00:29.250> well<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> know

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
able to do eight channels well you know

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
able to do eight channels well you know
no<00:00:30.539> interference<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.289> would<00:00:31.410> expect<00:00:31.740> each

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
no interference I would expect each

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.430 
no interference I would expect each
channel<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> PLL<00:00:33.210> system<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.780> anytime<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
channel is a PLL system so anytime you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.959 
channel is a PLL system so anytime you
have<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.590> frequency<00:00:35.070> interference<00:00:35.250> you'll<00:00:35.790> see

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
have a frequency interference you'll see

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.729 
have a frequency interference you'll see
it<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.149> register<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> screen<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.590> just

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it on register on the screen you just

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.049 
it on register on the screen you just
take<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> mic<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> every<00:00:38.700> sync<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
take the mic up to every sync to a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.610 
take the mic up to every sync to a
different<00:00:39.420> channel<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.530> be

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
different channel and you would be

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.619 
different channel and you would be
cleared<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.059> goes<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.420> every

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
cleared so and that goes for every

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.690 
cleared so and that goes for every
single<00:00:43.140> channel<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.860> sync<00:00:44.250> any<00:00:44.489> one

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
single channel so you can sync any one

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.299 
single channel so you can sync any one
might<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.120> any<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.660> module<00:00:46.070> okay<00:00:47.070> fantastic

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
might to any one module okay fantastic

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.750 
might to any one module okay fantastic
so<00:00:48.090> we've<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> different<00:00:48.809> uh<00:00:49.760> wireless

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
so we've got a different uh wireless

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.250 
so we've got a different uh wireless
systems<00:00:51.149> as<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.570> there's<00:00:51.989> gonna<00:00:52.110> be

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
systems as you know there's gonna be

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.069 
systems as you know there's gonna be
eight<00:00:52.500> analog<00:00:53.039> XLR<00:00:53.670> output<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.809> know

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
eight analog XLR output so you know

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.569 
eight analog XLR output so you know
doesn't<00:00:55.410> something<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> mix<00:00:55.920> by<00:00:56.129> any<00:00:56.340> means

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
doesn't something to mix by any means

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.040 
doesn't something to mix by any means
you<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.820> eight<00:00:56.940> separate<00:00:57.329> channels<00:00:57.690> mixing

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
you get eight separate channels mixing

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.560 
you get eight separate channels mixing
out<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.579> ships<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> now

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
out and and it all ships like this now

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.080 
out and and it all ships like this now
that's<00:01:01.410> hey<00:01:01.620> we're<00:01:02.010> rolling<00:01:02.460> we're<00:01:02.699> rolling

you two guys didn't know but it's
ballistic<00:01:04.769> proof<00:01:05.010> microphones<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.909> can

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
ballistic proof microphones you can

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.000 
ballistic proof microphones you can
throw<00:01:06.240> them<00:01:06.299> around<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.080> no<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.770> going<00:01:07.950> to
