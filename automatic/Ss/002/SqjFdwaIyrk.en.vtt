00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.160
 during the last days it showed that 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 multiplayer mode of call of duty ghosts 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.630
 officially ojito because this 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.880
 video that we are seeing belongs to the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.949
 multiplayer mode that of course is the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.990
 quintessential call of duty mode in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.630
 each of your deliveries and not to be 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.029
 less in this post activision distributed 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.949
 that new trailer a trailer that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.099
 focused on showing that way 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.690
 multiplayer which was unveiled in a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.149
 He organized a special event 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.129
 activision just to present that mode 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.870
 multiplayer among its great novelties 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.820
 is the possibility of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.430
 customize the appearance of our 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.280
 soldier destructible elements in the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.800
 scenarios plus new game modules 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.110
 weapons more gusts and the possibility of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.180
 play with a female character eye 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.039
 because this last one has called a lot 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.320
 the attention and of course you want 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.850
 to tell you it seems to me the perfect 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.039
 game now will also have support 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.989
 for clans allowing us to climb 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.930
 level to our brotherhood for 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.570
 unlock new rewards 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.520
 and extras a lot of eye because between your 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.560
 new game modes we're going to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.710
 find with seven game modes 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.050
 unpublished one of them is great in which 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.270
 every time we kill someone will increase 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.160
 our agility and speed that yes 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.470
 we are going to have a time limit for 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.190
 shoot down another enemy because if you do not 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.050
 we get going to explode of course 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.479
 originality is not lacking to the new 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.729
 critical color game modes in 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.369
 its multiplayer mode on the other hand we're going 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.640
 to have a mode called search and 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.729
 rescue will be similar to set and destroy 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.310
 with the difference of the players that 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.369
 they're going to drop their sheet when they die if a 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.770
 ally the recover the downcast player goes 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.270
 to resuscitate ojito with this finally 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.800

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.470

 will happen in the case of xbox 360 and xbox 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.380

 this this is also going to be applied 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.650

 the available dlcs in the case of xbox 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.420
