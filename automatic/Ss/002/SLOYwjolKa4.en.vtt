00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.040
 yes next game still 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.009
 Saturday afternoon in the Bundesliga that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.499
 play two at night when I only have two 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:18.119
 neighbors in the geographical sense too 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:21.390
 two neighbors in the table namely vfl 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.529
 wolfsburg against Werder Bremen to the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.289
 Conversely, apology would be there 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.109
 by the bremer play at home against 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.960
 the wolfsburger that is the fourteenth 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 at home receives the 13th 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 the two teams through two points in 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.780
 The table is separate and you can too 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.570
 say klaus allofs comes back again 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.200
 to its old location 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.290
 bremen where he worked for a long time 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.290
 and yes, some successes there 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.470
 has to show with the team and yes 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.560
 so of course a game then 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.050
 something could be more explosive if you 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.860
 this past time ago 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.590
 eyes leads and yes both teams not so 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.390
 quite satisfied with the season 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.860
 Bremen with a very young team 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.830
 on the way so with the youngest 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.040
 Team in the Bundesliga this year 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.080
 the wolfsburger as always with 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.820
 a lot of money from the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.340
 vw group were able to improve performance 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.479
 of course not meet again 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.119
 That's why Dieter was also hecking 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.720
 he brought a young team 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.130
 then it should form a bit 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.750
 perspective is on the way for the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 next year he is likely 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.570
 definitely the right man if you are 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.660
 is because sometimes looks at what he in 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.160
 Nuremberg's result has performance 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.460
 Technically , as I said, not good 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.800
 on the way last eight times without 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.550
 victory 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.740
 the wolfsburger, on the other hand, what is that ? 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.570
 five times without victory from the last five 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.180
 There were four games for the wolfsburger 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.850
 a draw and defeat in the dfb 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.060
 trophy final, the six to one in the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.620
 bavaria so the teams in spite of both 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.780
 not exactly self-confidence and 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.970
 which of course is not added to the euro 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 only the manager klaus allofs earlier 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.150
 Bremer but also the two 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.050
 key player in the wolfsburger game 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.970
 naldo and diego also more extreme there too 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.110
 It has to be said that they were at their best 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.880
 But they are a lot better 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.180
 So where is a really good one? 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.900
 season played diego rather mixed 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.240
 now if one of a time 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.130
 beautiful gate against the bayern sees 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.910
 not what he actually has to do 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.310
 is able 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.990
 that looked completely atletico madrid 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.540
 different from what he played last 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.730
 season and under magath he was anyway 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.250
 never happy and the season is not 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.240
 so great on the way 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.350
 and both teams said the season 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.590
 and clearly under your possibilities 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.760
 that's why markus what's yours 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.160
 tip for the game 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.130
 You also have to mention that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:59.100
 diego said that definitely 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.700
 his jersey again next season 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.720
 he will be green so he will be next 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:11.350
 still playing season in Lower Saxony 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.480
 otherwise, no wonder 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.390
 johnston yeah that's great 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.490
 say with the two 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.569
 So if one had won most of the time 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.830
 Of course I'll give it a try here 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:34.730
 was 1 1 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:37.240
 Bayern or not 11 then still has me 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.240
 balanced 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.680
 what are you doing bavaria is pulling glasses i 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.989
 tap on a 2 2 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.230
 So I think he knows more of course stronger 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.690
 but 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.220
 bremen has the at least this whole 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.930
 lazarett again has been there a bit 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.500
 bremer many injured worries 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.760
 still from the game against bochum game against 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.819
 Duesseldorf there I think ten 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.379
 man injured 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.760
 that was already quite hull 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.959
 Eleven have taken part, they are 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.700
 at least once again hand ekici 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.739
 and heat to fritz are at least now 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.689
 ever recovered 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.239
 he does that again 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.739
 hope as long as the children, too 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.209
 I'll stay outside for a while 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.410
 with probably so open and 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.340
 definitely run out 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.340
 these two teams
