00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
put it up because I had to use my old

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.620 
put it up because I had to use my old

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
camera to do that and right now I am

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
camera to do that and right now I am
using<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.380> camera<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.820> up

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
using this camera right here right up

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.080 
using this camera right here right up
there<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:34.159> that's<00:01:35.159> why<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.520> will<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
there and that's why this will be in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.240 
there and that's why this will be in
high<00:01:36.240> quality<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> moment<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.100> only

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
high quality at the moment I'm only

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.660 
high quality at the moment I'm only
going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.549> start<00:01:38.909> off<00:01:39.229> using<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.549> believe<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
going to start off using I believe the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.630 
going to start off using I believe the
resolutions<00:01:42.829> 640<00:01:43.829> by<00:01:44.159> 480<00:01:46.340> however<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> will

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
resolutions 640 by 480 however it will

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.550 
resolutions 640 by 480 however it will
be<00:01:47.700> high<00:01:48.119> quality<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> lot

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
be high quality so it will be a lot

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.080 
be high quality so it will be a lot
better<00:01:49.740> than<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.040> everything<00:01:50.909> will<00:01:51.000> be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
better than that everything will be

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.719 
better than that everything will be
sharper<00:01:52.670> excuse<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.590> grainy<00:01:55.979> just

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
sharper excuse the if it is grainy just

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.990 
sharper excuse the if it is grainy just
because<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:58.140> my<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.280> sort<00:01:59.969> of

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
because I have my I have this sort of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120 
because I have my I have this sort of
spotlights<00:02:00.540> shining<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.619> lights<00:02:01.890> on

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
spotlights shining on this and lights on

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.469 
spotlights shining on this and lights on
this<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.759> still<00:02:02.969> might<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.119> kind<00:02:03.420> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
this but it still might be kind of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
this but it still might be kind of
grainy<00:02:03.719> because<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.530> late<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
grainy because it's late it's kind of

as<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.490> see<00:03:16.640> right<00:03:16.790> here<00:03:16.850> this<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.300> what

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
as you can see right here this is what

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.870 
as you can see right here this is what
it<00:03:17.510> looks<00:03:17.690> like<00:03:17.780> pretty<00:03:17.990> much<00:03:18.080> it's<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.980> their

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
it looks like pretty much it's the their

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.940 
it looks like pretty much it's the their
new<00:03:20.030> lithium-ion<00:03:20.750> rechargeable<00:03:20.960> batteries

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
new lithium-ion rechargeable batteries

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.380 
new lithium-ion rechargeable batteries
and<00:03:22.130> they're<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.280> lot<00:03:22.520> better<00:03:22.850> they<00:03:23.120> charge

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
and they're a lot better they charge

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.850 
and they're a lot better they charge
pretty<00:03:23.720> quickly<00:03:23.960> and<00:03:24.170> they<00:03:24.290> hold<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.590> decent

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
pretty quickly and they hold a decent

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.810 
pretty quickly and they hold a decent
charge<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:25.610> it's<00:03:25.970> pretty<00:03:26.120> nice<00:03:27.820> also

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
charge so it's pretty nice also

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.670 
charge so it's pretty nice also
something<00:03:29.330> I<00:03:29.480> wanted<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.750> mention<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.230> was

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
the I believe it's called the higher

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.370 
the I believe it's called the higher
ground<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.270> don't<00:03:53.300> know<00:03:53.540> who<00:03:53.690> makes<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.110> but<00:03:54.350> I

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
ground I don't know who makes it but I

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.170 
ground I don't know who makes it but I
think<00:03:54.830> that's<00:03:55.010> what<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.850> higher

the main purpose of this is you know
just<00:04:18.980> test<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.400> quality<00:04:21.010> if<00:04:22.010> I'm<00:04:22.700> happy<00:04:22.970> with

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
just test that quality if I'm happy with

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.610 
just test that quality if I'm happy with
this<00:04:23.240> quality<00:04:23.450> I'll<00:04:23.720> probably<00:04:23.930> leave<00:04:24.200> it<00:04:24.320> here

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
this quality I'll probably leave it here

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.790 
this quality I'll probably leave it here
just<00:04:24.980> because<00:04:25.600> videos<00:04:26.600> are<00:04:26.750> capped<00:04:27.050> at<00:04:27.290> one<00:04:27.500> at

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
just because videos are capped at one at

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.770 
just because videos are capped at one at
one<00:04:28.190> gig<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.670> sometimes<00:04:29.060> my<00:04:29.210> videos<00:04:29.570> are<00:04:29.750> a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
one gig and sometimes my videos are a

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.410 
one gig and sometimes my videos are a
bit<00:04:29.960> long<00:04:30.140> so<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:31.370> know<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.850> might<00:04:32.150> be<00:04:32.180> a

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
bit long so you know it might be a

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.900 
bit long so you know it might be a
little<00:04:32.750> bit<00:04:32.840> too<00:04:32.990> much<00:04:33.170> but<00:04:33.680> we'll<00:04:33.950> see<00:04:35.350> and

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
little bit too much but we'll see and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.500 
little bit too much but we'll see and
that<00:04:37.910> is<00:04:38.180> pretty<00:04:38.900> much<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:40.090> don't<00:04:41.090> believe

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
that is pretty much it I don't believe

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.570 
that is pretty much it I don't believe
there's<00:04:41.810> anything<00:04:42.110> else<00:04:42.380> for<00:04:42.560> me<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.710> say<00:04:42.830> so

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
there's anything else for me to say so

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.370 
there's anything else for me to say so
