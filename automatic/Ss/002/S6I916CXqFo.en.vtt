 Hey, Austin Smith here are welcome to focus species. Let's talk about vaquita. 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.370
 The vaquita, which means "small cow" in Spanish, is the smallest pig in the sea 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.840
 the world. A boar is a type of whale, a group of animals that includes dolphins and 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.989
 Whales. With only about 100 people remaining today, the vaquita is currently the most vulnerable 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:28.399
 Whales in the whole world. Vaquitas have a classic sea boar shape as seen here, however 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.010
 They are much stockier and have dark bands around their eyes and mouths. It lacks 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.690
 An elongated beak such as dolphins also have distinctly shaped teeth. Their attainment 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.330
 About 4 to 5 feet (1,2-1.5 meters) in length like adults weighs about 90 to 120 pounds (41-54 kg). Vaquitas 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.080
 There is only the very northern part of California Bay in Mexico, as 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.480
 Known as the Sea of ​​Cortez. Vaquita live shallow water near the coast, usually 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.780
 In deep water no more than 11 to 50 meters. Feed on the benthic fish and squid in these 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.649
 Areas. Unfortunately, these are the same areas where many shrimp are domestic fishing boats 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.060
 Go to send the nets to catch them. The vaquitas inadvertently get trapped in their gill nets 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.319
 As by-catch because they are mammals and must come to the surface of the air, many of the 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:26.639
 The vaquitas plunge into the process. Shrimp industry from Puerto Pinasu, Sonora, usually 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:32.840
 Known as the Rocky Point by the Americans, it has had a particularly damaging effect on vaquita. 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.270
 There have been efforts by Mexico to protect species, such as the creation of nature 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.170
 Reservation beyond the limits allowed for fishing vessels, but it is not difficult for the government to implement this 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.109
 When the shrimpers rely on their hunting to support themselves and their families. 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:51.789
 Center for Intercultural Dialogue to Study deserts and oceans, or CEDO, Puerto Pinasu, 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.289
 As well as the Discovery Marine Conservation and Marine Conservation Society, 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.200
 Or MACS, both from the University of Arizona in Tucson, and has provided educational programs 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.240
 In southern Arizona and north of Sonora in the last few years. Through their efforts, 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.190
 Awareness has grown about the plight of vaquita. Vaquita was not discovered until 1958 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.450
 She is shy, elusive, and studying his behavior. With a population of more than 500 in decline 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.450
 1997 to just over 100 in 2013, in vaquita struggle to survive is very unstable. 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.860
 If conservation efforts are not immediate succeed in protecting these species, and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.560
 vaquita can be extinct in the very near future. If you enjoyed this episode, be sure
