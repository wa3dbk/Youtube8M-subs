00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.290
 all football we always have to be 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.910
 ready for such an important event 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.240
 thanks god come I come competing 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.430
 I come very well in the middle I have started the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.359
 season very well also then that 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.359
 it is important 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.530
 permanently we remember many by 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.400
 example match with uruguay because yes yes 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.439
 yes that's what I tell you then that is said 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.579
 and a lot of surprise is spoken but as you 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.190
 I say for me it's not a surprise because 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.470
 long ago I come in contraband with the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.840
 selection if it's true he lost a 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.610
 little the way in 2013 for injuries and 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.610
 that but after it was always and not 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.130
 I was with the family with the family and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 sharing a time with my children 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.559
 so 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.860
 but it has been a very important joy 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.860
 and of great satisfaction for my family 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.770
 they received me well they are all friends video 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.050
 then he received me very well as they have 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.520
 always done what people say what 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.229
 types and be summoned equally the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.299
 done get here fast get the group 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.600
 that is, know how you can or can not do 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.850
 problem for you people sometimes 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.720
 says or repeats what he hears 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.020
 I come to do my job 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.760
 maybe many know that it is already 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.310
 quite the time that was in the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.050
 selection that I have shared in the cup 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.280
 america and friendly playoffs 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.600
 so for me it's nothing new 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.800
 what will be your work that is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.650
 exactly what he asks you without 'in 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.600
 wheel terms 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.940
 Do what you do to work 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.480
 try to be very aggressive at the time 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.820
 of recovering from delivering or passing the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.180
 ball then I basically know what 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.380
 that what always asks you to be 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.120
 aggressive to recover the ball 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 analyze the rival with what you will face 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.020
 to know to what extent it can be 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.110
 aggressive as you say safe insurance 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.330
 obviously this is not the case anymore 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.860
 Attempting to the extent that they leave 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.289
 passing the videos not to the extent that 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.140
 videos are reviewed one already 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.599
 understands and knows how to attack 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.310
 the rival when it comes to exerting pressure 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.330
 how much time is spent watching the videos or 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.000
 several here we watch pretty videos 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.040
 23 hours sometimes analyzing the rival 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.300
 important prices that's fundamental 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.140
 in order to know how the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.140
 artist
