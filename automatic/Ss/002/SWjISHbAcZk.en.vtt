00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello ladies and gentlemen cat with you and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.960
 today I will show them to you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.870
 see the difference between standard 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.719
 gta 5 and cmb 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.509
 at on here is epic screens 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.449
 flylin franklin positions about titles 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.850
 Hancock Aries is his business and so 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.320
 Generally, I would like you a little bit 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.359
 tell about that gmb 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.939
 he sharpens how you see he 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.340
 also adds color correction and a lot 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.369
 buck and honestly i like him 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.090
 play more teach that given 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.079
 mb 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.570
 just take it away literally 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.809
 one is not two frames per second all the same 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.360
 minimum fee though i am wildly sorry 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.550
 but I was interrupted by a small of mine 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 death so don't plan well in general 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.960
 given mb select only one or two 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.210
 frames this is well straight minimum fee 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.660
 for such a cool color correction for such 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.000
 steep 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.520
 the fog here looks just pompous 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.769
 compared with the usual sleep again 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.860
 of course you may not see so much 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.200
 the difference but when playing behind the monitor 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.170
 then the difference is honestly very very 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.440
 palpable and therefore specifically added 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.660
 split mapping 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.270
 you so that you make some difference 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.960
 show link to it will be in the description 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.530
 but as soon as we naberom 500 likes so 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.860
 what's up guys all you need is all on 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.440
 you and install this mb very much 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 and very simple you just need 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.680
 will give way to the stages michael's fishing pole 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.360
 Jackson cut down a good fellow you need everything 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.530
 just throw everything in the folder with 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.480
 it would be in the folder gta 5 path to the folder gta 5 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.490
 do you see in your screen 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.790
 does not know well, that apply between 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.430
 Naturally, but you may have a cd drive 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.010
 identity to him again on d and therefore 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.030
 hope but the path remains the same 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.150
 glow took 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.780
 so guys i hope you have this video 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.479
 liked this 1 mb for gta 5 on pc 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.880
 which really is nothing out of touch 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.610
 that is, dozens of cards in the top ten 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.770
 spend dozens of color corrections 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.680
 so on but they are practically nothing 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.290
 and this is the best at the moment 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.200
 doctors every bit again and so perfect 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.330
 improve schedule but play with it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.970
 much nicer and I'll probably be mud 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.670
 with him it is also worth considering that I play 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.620
 ultraset graphics so it can 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.860
 be on low on sight some 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.300
 the difference is whether it will be well in trine with my 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.130
 image and your guys but the whole thing 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.950
 After you 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.019
 download play and while I ask you 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.100
 like to put in 500 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.640
 likes I immediately add 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.590
 a link to the race given to them was given 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.780
 this I finish do not forget to put 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.610
