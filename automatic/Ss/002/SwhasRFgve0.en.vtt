a great record in terms of safety that's

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.080 
a great record in terms of safety that's
what<00:02:23.110> they're<00:02:23.260> known<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> safety

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
what they're known for but the safety

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.820 
what they're known for but the safety

the first place now all v40 our designs

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.089 
the first place now all v40 our designs
get<00:02:37.390> something<00:02:37.780> called<00:02:38.019> city<00:02:38.590> safety<00:02:39.010> as

automatically brake the car to prevent
accidents<00:02:43.030> at<00:02:43.209> low<00:02:43.360> speed<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.900> can<00:02:44.049> even

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
accidents at low speed you can even

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.680 
accidents at low speed you can even
upgrade<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:44.860> spot<00:02:45.280> cyclist<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.239> even

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
upgrade this to spot cyclist and even

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.240 
upgrade this to spot cyclist and even
pedestrians<00:02:46.840> which<00:02:47.680> i<00:02:47.799> think<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:48.099> quite

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
pedestrians which i think is quite

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.339 
pedestrians which i think is quite
important<00:02:48.730> what<00:02:48.880> do<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.030> think<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.450> think<00:02:50.290> it

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
important what do you think I think it

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.400 
important what do you think I think it
is<00:02:50.380> round<00:02:50.739> town<00:02:51.040> because<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:52.959> obviously

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
is round town because you have obviously

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.800 
is round town because you have obviously
a<00:02:53.680> lot<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.980> bike<00:02:54.610> lanes<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:55.299> London<00:02:55.690> for

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
a lot of bike lanes in London for

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.589 
a lot of bike lanes in London for
example<00:02:56.410> yeah<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:57.430> yeah<00:02:57.670> anything<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.420> can

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
example yeah so yeah anything that can

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.830 
example yeah so yeah anything that can
sort<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:58.959> look<00:02:59.950> out<00:03:00.130> for<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.610> as<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.849> driver<00:03:01.060> can

however<00:04:45.180> for<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:45.780> bit<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.350> am<00:04:46.680> going<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.100> be

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
however for this bit I am going to be

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.770 
however for this bit I am going to be
taking<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.550> D<00:04:50.849> for<00:04:51.150> model<00:04:51.450> with<00:04:51.750> a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
taking this is the D for model with a

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.010 
taking this is the D for model with a
2-liter<00:04:52.380> diesel<00:04:52.470> engine<00:04:53.160> it'll<00:04:53.700> do<00:04:53.849> 74<00:04:54.450> mpg

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
2-liter diesel engine it'll do 74 mpg

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.740 
2-liter diesel engine it'll do 74 mpg
and<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:56.010> will<00:04:56.099> emit<00:04:56.310> less<00:04:56.490> than<00:04:56.639> 100<00:04:56.940> g/km<00:04:57.419> of

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
and it will emit less than 100 g/km of

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.129 
and it will emit less than 100 g/km of
co2<00:04:57.990> so<00:04:58.950> it's<00:04:59.280> road<00:04:59.460> tax<00:04:59.700> free<00:04:59.970> yeah<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.050> the

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
co2 so it's road tax free yeah so the

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.629 
co2 so it's road tax free yeah so the
question<00:05:01.169> I'm<00:05:01.530> going<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.740> ask<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:02.160> is<00:05:02.340> whether

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
question I'm going to ask you is whether

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.450 
question I'm going to ask you is whether
you'd<00:05:02.880> expect<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.570> car<00:05:03.960> like<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.460> to

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
you'd expect a car like that to

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.899 
you'd expect a car like that to
accelerate<00:05:05.669> like<00:05:05.970> this

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:18.159 

ok<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.550> was<00:05:16.580> naught<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.090> 60<00:05:17.419> in<00:05:17.720> a<00:05:17.960> little

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
ok so that was naught to 60 in a little

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.100 
ok so that was naught to 60 in a little
over<00:05:18.409> seven<00:05:18.800> seconds<00:05:19.310> stops<00:05:19.849> for<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.120> okay<00:05:20.539> so

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110
