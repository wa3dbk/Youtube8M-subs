00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
too damn close together for me I mean to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
too damn close together for me I mean to
be<00:01:14.460> fair<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.299> much<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:16.110> better

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
be fair it's a much much better

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.380 
be fair it's a much much better
placement<00:01:16.830> than<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.280> HTC<00:01:17.909> One<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.240> my

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
placement than on the HTC One in my

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
placement than on the HTC One in my
opinion<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.409> care<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.830> say<00:01:20.159> about

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
opinion I don't care what you say about

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
opinion I don't care what you say about
HTC<00:01:20.759> putting<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> power<00:01:21.299> button<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> top

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
HTC putting the power button on the top

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
HTC putting the power button on the top
was<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> silly<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> very<00:01:23.220> inconvenient<00:01:23.909> idea

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
was a silly and very inconvenient idea

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.530 
was a silly and very inconvenient idea
for<00:01:25.290> me<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> haven't<00:01:26.580> used<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.150> device

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
for me but I haven't used this device

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
for me but I haven't used this device
long<00:01:27.930> enough<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.439> used<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> them<00:01:28.979> being<00:01:29.220> so

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
long enough to get used to them being so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.190 
long enough to get used to them being so
close<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.030> something<00:01:30.299> tells<00:01:30.420> me<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
close but something tells me I will and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.429 
close but something tells me I will and
probably<00:01:31.770> fast<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> Zen<00:01:32.729> too<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.150> ip55<00:01:34.079> /

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
probably fast so the Zen too is ip55 /

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.830 
probably fast so the Zen too is ip55 /
58<00:01:34.920> dust<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.430> water-resistant<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.360> basically

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
58 dust and water-resistant so basically

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.020 
58 dust and water-resistant so basically
it'll<00:01:37.049> withstand<00:01:37.290> 1.5<00:01:38.220> meters<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.640> water<00:01:38.670> for

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
should briefly touch base on the camera

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.009 
should briefly touch base on the camera
so<00:03:06.380> it's<00:03:06.769> a<00:03:06.890> 20.7<00:03:07.700> megapixel<00:03:08.209> camera<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.720> it's

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
so it's a 20.7 megapixel camera and it's

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.020 
so it's a 20.7 megapixel camera and it's
got<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.200> bunch<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.920> fancy<00:03:10.190> stuff<00:03:10.549> packed<00:03:10.819> and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
got a bunch of fancy stuff packed and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.699 
got a bunch of fancy stuff packed and
that<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.420> could<00:03:11.569> potentially<00:03:11.690> make<00:03:12.380> this

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
that that could potentially make this

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.620 
that that could potentially make this
one<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.489> better<00:03:13.730> cameras<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.329> be<00:03:14.420> packed

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
one of the better cameras to be packed

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.449 
one of the better cameras to be packed
into<00:03:14.810> an<00:03:14.959> Android<00:03:15.319> device<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:16.010> works<00:03:16.190> really

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
into an Android device it works really

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.520 
into an Android device it works really
well<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.060> takes<00:03:17.329> pictures<00:03:17.750> that<00:03:17.959> impress<00:03:18.319> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
well and takes pictures that impress the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.860 
well and takes pictures that impress the
hell<00:03:18.799> out<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:19.040> me<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.910> until<00:03:20.600> while

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
hell out of me that is until while

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.840 
hell out of me that is until while

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
pictures a message popped up telling me

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.470

the<00:03:24.829> camera<00:03:25.250> was<00:03:25.370> running<00:03:25.700> too<00:03:25.819> hot<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.180> then

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
the camera was running too hot and then

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.900 
the camera was running too hot and then
it<00:03:26.569> had<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.930> close<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.410> app<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.859> was<00:03:28.069> like<00:03:28.250> what

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
it had to close the app I was like what

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.000 
it had to close the app I was like what
but<00:03:29.630> as<00:03:29.810> soon<00:03:30.049> as<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.380> shut<00:03:30.620> down<00:03:30.829> I

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
but as soon as it shut down I

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.559 
but as soon as it shut down I
immediately<00:03:31.370> launched<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.970> cam<00:03:32.150> app<00:03:32.389> again

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
immediately launched the cam app again

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.870 
immediately launched the cam app again
and<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.930> fired<00:03:33.109> right<00:03:33.200> up<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.250> back<00:03:34.489> where

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
and it fired right up but the back where

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.660 
and it fired right up but the back where
the<00:03:34.910> cameras<00:03:35.420> it's<00:03:35.810> was<00:03:36.170> really<00:03:36.829> really<00:03:37.340> hot

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
the cameras it's was really really hot

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.030 
the cameras it's was really really hot
this<00:03:38.180> is<00:03:38.329> apparently<00:03:38.810> an<00:03:39.109> issue<00:03:39.410> that<00:03:39.620> Sony

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
this is apparently an issue that Sony

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.620 
this is apparently an issue that Sony
and<00:03:40.340> other<00:03:40.579> markets<00:03:40.970> around<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.269> world<00:03:41.329> are

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
and other markets around the world are

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.240 
and other markets around the world are
aware<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.410> all<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.650> can<00:03:42.859> say<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.040> that<00:03:43.190> I

aware of and all I can say is that I

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.740 
aware of and all I can say is that I
hope<00:03:43.400> Sony<00:03:43.730> can<00:03:43.850> fix<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.180> issue<00:03:44.359> with<00:03:44.720> a

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
hope Sony can fix this issue with a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.780 
hope Sony can fix this issue with a
simple<00:03:45.230> system<00:03:45.350> update<00:03:45.920> other<00:03:46.220> than<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.489> the

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
camera software is really simplistic and

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.319 
camera software is really simplistic and
easy<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.340> use<00:03:49.370> somebody's<00:03:49.880> made<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.120> really

little<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.459> no<00:03:52.489> effort<00:03:52.609> basically<00:03:53.540> you'll<00:03:53.690> be

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
little to no effort basically you'll be

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.420 
little to no effort basically you'll be
spending<00:03:53.989> most<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.470> your<00:03:54.530> time<00:03:54.650> in<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.040> modes
