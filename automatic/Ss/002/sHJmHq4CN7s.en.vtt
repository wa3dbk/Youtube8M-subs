um<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.940> just<00:02:29.390> pay<00:02:29.690> 1500<00:02:29.989> it's<00:02:30.349> a<00:02:30.410> quick<00:02:30.500> way<00:02:30.560> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
um you just pay 1500 it's a quick way I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.440 
um you just pay 1500 it's a quick way I
think<00:02:31.400> this<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.700> better<00:02:31.819> than<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.090> trap<00:02:32.299> right

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
think this is better than the trap right

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.940 
think this is better than the trap right
now<00:02:32.599> because<00:02:32.959> if<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.230> have<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.440> set<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.709> and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
now because if you have to set it and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.250 
now because if you have to set it and
get<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.130> way<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.310> turn<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.269> can<00:02:35.480> it's

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
get the way to turn and you can it's

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.300 
get the way to turn and you can it's
just<00:02:36.410> not<00:02:36.530> really<00:02:36.739> this<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.069> more<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.250> a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
just not really this is more of a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.460 
just not really this is more of a
defensive<00:02:37.459> i<00:02:37.880> guess<00:02:38.120> i<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:39.019> think<00:02:39.349> this<00:02:39.410> is

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
defensive i guess i just think this is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.600 
defensive i guess i just think this is
better<00:02:39.680> because<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.069> don't<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.459> weight

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
better because you don't the weight

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.309 
better because you don't the weight
