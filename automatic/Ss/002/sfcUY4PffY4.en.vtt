00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 sorry 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.449
 OK 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.710
 very much very much record because it's the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.000
 is crazy about lipsticks for those who do not 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.160
 I still have an obsession 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.320
 with hospitals is the things of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.480
 makeup that I like the most, I think 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 is related to that I like a lot 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.619
 the area of ​​my lips and paint on the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.530
 lips because I think they are pretty 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 and good something good that I see myself in the 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.309
 face basically this is a talent 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.440
 mixed two versions that out there 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.890
 swarming that is the American version and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.079
 the Spanish version so I know it 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.899
 merged and made the 1012 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.120
 questions you have is in total the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.309
 first question is how many lipsticks 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.589
 you have like lipstick I have chosen 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.130
 exclusively tell what they are 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.190
 lipstick 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:01.190
 lipsticks of this format 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:05.479
 basically that I have 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.630
 I have 95 lipsticks are one 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.340
 barbarity is like that or there is no excuse 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.869
 possible to have 95 lipsticks but the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.240
 I have later what is my treatment 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.399
 favorite lipstick I would certainly say that they are 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.530
 we balm them in particular this 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.090
 which is the passion fruit I think 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.149
 what is it and smells 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.549
 it smells great it smells really sweet and it tastes 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.159
 to the smell that has many times the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.509
 lipsticks have an essence 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.149
 particular but then when you 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.460
 you put and then it's inevitable you eat them 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.590
 no mouth are you talking about the output 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.630
 maybe you get the taste of such a foot 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.909
 time and he does not know anything or he has a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.979
 taste that is not the same as the smell does not 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 I know if I'm explaining creating a layer 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 above the lips that while 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.539
 moisturizes and puts on the skin 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.030
 It makes the surface very very smooth 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.759
 to apply the lipstick so I like them 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.739
 very much the more 11 of them after 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.319
 which is the best red of all that 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.909
 you have without doubt this is the first red 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.489
 that I bought and I have it for now 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.160
 many years and it is the russian network of mac 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.890
 it's matte finish and it's a super red 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.540
 super known is this color very very 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.140
 pigmented and is a red with what 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.629
 always always right I feel that I am 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.489
 very favored that it is a natural red 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.800
 that fits with my complexion and with my 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.470
 traits and 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.930
 my red ones pretty much after 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.750
 better economic skin and high-end 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.180
 without looking at the economic favorite is this 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.460
 Delhi is plus matte range and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.130
 is the tone 106 is a super natural tone 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.370
 that I have as you see very very used and is 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.530
 a perfect color for me all of lips 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.690
 I feel that it enhances the natural color of 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.970
 my lips and that simply because the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.300
 define more I do not know if it costs four euros 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.800
 to five euros this almost certainly not 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.600
 it reaches to where radial and it seems to me 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.730
 great I think this is one of the few 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.740
 lipsticks that when I run out I 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.110
 I will buy again because always 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.840
 I have some look that I do not know very 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.600
 well what lipstick to put on that can 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.940
 fit these always always right and 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.010
 After high-end we passed the luxury of 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.040
 the luxuries that is this tom ford lipstick 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.500
 what is it, it 's a past me the paper and I 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.330
 it seems the most beautiful type of 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.820
 presentation that has this mark is a 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.010
 madness and the one that I 'm going to teach you is 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.380
 in the Indian rose tone this is a bit 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.980
 darker and a little more pink does not have 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.709
 the same effect as this one without a doubt and 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.020
 these lipsticks is that they are the last 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.730
 if this is not pure and hard luxury that does not 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.890
 explain that it is because I 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.140
 I do not know then the best lipstick of 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.880
 imac sea as most of you know you have 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.890
 a number of colors finished 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.590
 and wonderful wonders of lipstick 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.630
 and I have many of this brand 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.270
 because I think it has very colorful 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.220
 unique and very special and most are 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.830
 difficult to reproduce so he chose 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.590
 the most unique color of all those that 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.100
 I have the mack brand and that color flat 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.750
 to another fabulous taboo and that he is a 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.350
 retro matte finish that is to say it's super 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.060
 super mate and it's this purple pink that 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.280
 I would train you go with this double 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.440
 put then to see is that when I wear it 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.750
 happens to me as with the rose in red that 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.900
 I feel that I fit with my features that 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.780
 it's not that it's unnatural or not 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.510
 it looks nice is this purple rose to a 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.520
 mate that is a unique color the truth or 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.800
 in person a lipstick passes me 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.860
 disappointed this lipstick was a great 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.479
 disappointment is from irsa lohan and is 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.879
 the rus box range is the will of saint 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.949
 and it's number 9 is a very natural tone 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:47.039
 and I thought it would be that this 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.349
 color on lips but it's worth if I've 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.750
 put as 5 layers of product and at 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.400
 end you get this color is a 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.740
 lipstick very very transparent that 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.229
 apply many many layers so that it 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.270
 see a color and then apart it does not last anything 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.689
 put it must be said that the packaging of 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.080
 these past so luxurious golden 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:09.270
 beautiful but the product itself but 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.680
 well at least it's nice to have it in 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.080
 the dresser you do not see it and about what 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.360
 elegant and divine music on the wifi which 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.189
 is your lipstick to obliterate them another 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.900
 sea ​​lip that has already been 5 or 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.569
 you know you're going the video can really 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.069
 be the striped sea ​​you like 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.289
 classify them and this one is with the color with 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.810
 the one that I feel powerful I do not know how 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.080
 explain it without sounding pathetic is this 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.520
 here and it's a spicy color it 's very 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.760
 special happens as with this which is a 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.490
 very very special color and it is the golf tone 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.370
 the range also retro matt its very color 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.870
 very mate and I feel that with this I go with 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.760
 the lips painted although they are not 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.790
 typical red lips or dark lips 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.370
 òmnium is not typical is a color 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.800
 special but that is not crazy either 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.020
 How can this be what is more 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.630
 special more striking but this one 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.970
 it fits very well at the moment of the fact 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:03.840
 well I look pretty I put this and I 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.950
 I feel let's go on in animal itself outside 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.630
 It's been the last lipstick you've 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.010
 bought in truth I bought two levels 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.620
 at the same time because it was my birthday 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.360
 mother and to give her the serious tone of 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.280
 imac is that you see everything is more everything more 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.350
 behind myself and just give my mother the 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.730
 break tone and where it happened then I would 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.970
 I bought also because it was very bad 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.760
 and I also bought the tweet tone this one 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.460
 is the tune tone and it is a color like this very 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.410
 pretty nice and then the break that 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.290
 it's a lot more tone 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.700
 newt so you and cyprus are the last 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.650
 two lipsticks that I bought and now 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.540
 comes the definitive question that is you 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.070
 lipstick lipstick 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.850
 or do you have a 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.610
 to the labials the word addiction is 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.490
 a very strong word I obviously 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.330
 I can live without lipstick I would live a 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.220
 unhappy little 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.590
 but more than an addiction I what 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.120
 I would say it 's an obsession so nothing else 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.190
 this is the video today I hope that you 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.050
 have liked me the truth is that I am 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.150
 obsessed with this is almost as much 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.990
 like those with the lipstick or 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.130
 I'm watching 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.380
 all the girls who have done this one 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.450
 I'm watching the video because I 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.650
 love it so nothing that I hope you 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.360
 I liked to see it as much as it has 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.590
 I liked to give it to Vienna and I also hope 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.590
 See you next video
