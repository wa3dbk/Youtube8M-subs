see what kind of an adjustment he makes
I<00:04:25.800> personally<00:04:26.310> think<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.610> he<00:04:26.790> probably

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
I personally think that he probably

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.120 
I personally think that he probably
needs<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.480> move<00:04:27.600> further<00:04:28.020> left<00:04:28.320> yet<00:04:28.620> with

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
needs to move further left yet with

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.530 
needs to move further left yet with
another<00:04:29.400> board<00:04:29.640> or<00:04:29.820> two<00:04:29.970> left<00:04:30.210> on<00:04:30.420> that

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
another board or two left on that

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.110
