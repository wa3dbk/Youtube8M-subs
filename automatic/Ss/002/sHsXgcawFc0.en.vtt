stick pan what you want to do is heat
the<00:01:07.060> pot<00:01:07.479> first<00:01:07.840> or<00:01:08.110> heat<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.560> saute<00:01:09.040> pan

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070

the pot first or heat the saute pan
first<00:01:09.549> over<00:01:10.270> high<00:01:10.479> heat<00:01:10.509> and<00:01:11.200> what<00:01:12.189> that<00:01:12.369> will

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
first over high heat and what that will

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.610 
first over high heat and what that will
do<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.799> seal<00:01:14.799> up<00:01:14.950> any<00:01:15.190> little<00:01:16.590> crevices<00:01:17.590> that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
do is seal up any little crevices that

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.740 
do is seal up any little crevices that
are<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.280> in<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.670> pan<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.360> metal<00:01:19.630> will

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
are in the in the pan the metal will

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.390 
are in the in the pan the metal will
expand<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.320> fill<00:01:20.470> in<00:01:20.620> those<00:01:20.770> little<00:01:20.860> crevices

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
expand and fill in those little crevices

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.210 
expand and fill in those little crevices
and<00:01:21.430> therefore<00:01:22.060> it'll<00:01:23.049> help<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.380> not<00:01:23.500> just<00:01:24.010> it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
and therefore it'll help it not just it

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.010 
and therefore it'll help it not just it
and<00:01:24.670> now<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:25.150> see<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.630> pan<00:01:25.840> is

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
and now that you see that the pan is

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.020 
and now that you see that the pan is
very<00:01:26.080> hot<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.590> can<00:01:26.740> see<00:01:26.950> it's<00:01:27.070> smoking<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.909> bit

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
very hot you can see it's smoking a bit

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.070 
very hot you can see it's smoking a bit
I'm<00:01:28.420> going<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.600> add<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.780> little<00:01:29.049> bit<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.380> oil<00:01:29.500> and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
I'm going to add a little bit of oil and

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.830 
I'm going to add a little bit of oil and
then<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:33.640> going<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.030> add<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.420> dumplings

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
then I'm going to add the dumplings

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.080 
then I'm going to add the dumplings
again<00:01:35.799> with<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.100> crust<00:01:36.369> side<00:01:36.580> up<00:01:38.010> and<00:01:39.090> again

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
again with the crust side up and again

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.429 
again with the crust side up and again
not<00:01:40.270> touching<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:40.960> they<00:01:41.049> don't<00:01:41.200> stick

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
not touching so they don't stick

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.219 
not touching so they don't stick
together

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.959 

and<00:01:44.530> then<00:01:44.979> immediately<00:01:45.250> you're<00:01:45.640> going<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.820> add

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
and then immediately you're going to add

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.800 
and then immediately you're going to add
some<00:01:46.270> water<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:52.149> water<00:01:52.299> should<00:01:52.630> just

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
some water and the water should just

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.899 
some water and the water should just
come<00:01:53.049> up<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.350> about<00:01:54.219> halfway<00:01:54.490> up<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
come up to about halfway up the

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
come up to about halfway up the
dumplings<00:01:55.329> and<00:01:55.600> then<00:01:56.439> I'm<00:01:56.619> going<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.829> cover<00:01:57.219> it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
dumplings and then I'm going to cover it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.200 
dumplings and then I'm going to cover it
so<00:01:59.439> basically<00:01:59.770> this<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.460> just<00:02:00.670> wait

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
so basically this is it you just wait

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.169 
so basically this is it you just wait
for<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.539> water<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.439> evaporate<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.939> water

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
for the water to evaporate and the water

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.600 
for the water to evaporate and the water
will<00:02:04.390> cook<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.750> dough<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:06.130> once<00:02:06.460> that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
will cook the dough and once that

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.779 
will cook the dough and once that
evaporates<00:02:07.210> then<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:08.140> pan<00:02:08.920> will<00:02:09.160> start<00:02:09.700> to

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
evaporates then the pan will start to

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.280 
evaporates then the pan will start to
brown<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.209> bottoms<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.840> make<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.110> nice<00:02:11.230> and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
brown the bottoms and make it nice and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.220 
brown the bottoms and make it nice and
crisp<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:13.000> when<00:02:13.180> they're<00:02:13.420> all<00:02:13.629> nearing

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
crisp so when they're all nearing

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.630 
crisp so when they're all nearing
completion<00:02:14.379> you<00:02:14.799> can<00:02:14.830> start<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.280> hear<00:02:15.489> the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
completion you can start to hear the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.970 
completion you can start to hear the
sizzle<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.690> that's<00:02:17.319> when<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.590> want<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.830> take

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
sizzle and that's when you want to take

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.880 
sizzle and that's when you want to take
off<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> lid<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:19.410> some<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.560> starch<00:02:20.830> will

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
off the lid and some of the starch will

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.470 
off the lid and some of the starch will
leach<00:02:21.220> into<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.549> water<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.180> can<00:02:22.209> see

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
leach into the water and you can see

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.759 
leach into the water and you can see
that<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:22.780> starting<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.079> brown<00:02:23.410> there<00:02:23.680> and

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
that it's starting to brown there and

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.100 
that it's starting to brown there and
that's<00:02:23.920> an<00:02:24.099> indication<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.690> bottoms

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
that's an indication that the bottoms

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.319 
that's an indication that the bottoms
are<00:02:26.230> browned<00:02:26.530> okay<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.819> at<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.000> point<00:02:28.180> you

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
are browned okay and at this point you

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.819 
are browned okay and at this point you
might<00:02:28.450> want<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.780> turn<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.110> turn<00:02:29.530> down<00:02:29.709> your

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
might want to turn it turn down your

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.710 
might want to turn it turn down your
heat<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> little<00:02:30.250> bit<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.299> don't<00:02:31.390> burn

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
heat a little bit just so you don't burn

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.410 
heat a little bit just so you don't burn
them<00:02:32.160> okay<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.060> why<00:02:34.209> they're<00:02:34.390> called

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
them okay and this is why they're called

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.270 
them okay and this is why they're called
pop<00:02:34.900> stickers<00:02:35.290> they<00:02:35.380> sort<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.650> stick<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
pop stickers they sort of stick to the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.259 
pop stickers they sort of stick to the
pot<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.390> so<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.690> want<00:02:40.989> them<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> be<00:02:41.410> nice<00:02:41.590> and
