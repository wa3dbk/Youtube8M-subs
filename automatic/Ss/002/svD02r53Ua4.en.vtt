which<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.460> does<00:00:17.670> seem<00:00:17.910> tedious<00:00:18.230> but

which really does seem tedious but

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.810 
which really does seem tedious but
that's<00:00:19.380> only<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.650> fraction<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.460> actual

amount that you would need for like a

around I've already done that
so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.570> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.320> should

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
so you can kind of see what that should

so you can kind of see what that should
look<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:12.030> would<00:01:12.150> want<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> have

look like you would want to have

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
look like you would want to have
something<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.260> bit<00:01:13.409> more<00:01:13.560> uniform<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.100> line<00:01:14.340> but

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
something a bit more uniform in line but

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.520 
something a bit more uniform in line but
I<00:01:14.700> was<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.000> using<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.689> an<00:01:15.810> example<00:01:16.049> what

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I was just using this as an example what

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.609 
I was just using this as an example what
it<00:01:16.619> would<00:01:16.740> look<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:18.049> after<00:01:19.049> that's<00:01:19.229> done<00:01:19.560> on

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it would look like after that's done on

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
it would look like after that's done on

out<00:02:58.940> took<00:02:59.150> me<00:02:59.269> three<00:02:59.510> hours<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.840> have<00:03:00.140> a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
out took me three hours to have a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.430 
out took me three hours to have a
flushed<00:03:00.470> help<00:03:01.299> with<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.420> first<00:03:02.720> frame<00:03:03.079> so<00:03:03.410> I

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
flushed help with that first frame so I

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.930 
flushed help with that first frame so I
decided<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.920> best<00:03:03.950> ones<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.670> learn<00:03:04.910> a

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
decided the best ones is to learn a

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.270 
decided the best ones is to learn a
different<00:03:05.239> way<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.540> animation<00:03:06.260> which<00:03:06.500> was<00:03:07.040> to

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
different way of animation which was to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.750 
different way of animation which was to
slide<00:03:07.519> things<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.980> after<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.190> get<00:03:10.340> washed

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760
