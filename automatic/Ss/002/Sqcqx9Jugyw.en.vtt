00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.640
 here 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 our home the earth 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.440
 the dream to conquer space is 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.100
 become reality 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.440

 biggest technology project of all time 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.280
 the outpost of humanity has been 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 already permanently inhabited in the year 2000 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.140

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.680
 unique conditions 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.350
 what fascinated me most is 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.350
 the beauty of the planet earth 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.450

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.899
 places but he is also sensitive if 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.789
 one side of the planet the black one 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.459
 of the universe and the thin atmosphere 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.459
 you can feel the vulnerability 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.469
 I am fascinated by space travel 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.229
 It is the limit that is the ultimate 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.000
 limit that we as humans have the yes 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.469
 there waiting for us out there we know 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 not what is behind that I feel 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.740
 me as probably before 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.270
 the people felt when they were at 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.950

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.970
 have looked and wondered 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.970
 what is there behind the horizon
