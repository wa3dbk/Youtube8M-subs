you hit add fingerprint it'll give you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.119 
you hit add fingerprint it'll give you
the<00:00:46.050> ability<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.379> place<00:00:46.590> your<00:00:46.739> finger<00:00:47.039> I'll

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the ability to place your finger I'll

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:56.750 
the ability to place your finger I'll
take<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.579> nice<00:00:47.930> thumbprint<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:55.579> put<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> on

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
take my nice thumbprint and put it on

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
take my nice thumbprint and put it on
the<00:00:56.879> touch<00:00:57.030> ID<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:58.350> asks<00:00:59.539> it<00:01:00.539> will

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the touch ID as it asks it will

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.539 
the touch ID as it asks it will
recognize<00:01:01.170> part<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.800> finger<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:08.280> all

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
recognize part of my finger and then all

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.859 
recognize part of my finger and then all
of<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.729> sudden<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:12.090> doesn't<00:01:12.240> even<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.659> hasn't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
of a sudden it doesn't even it hasn't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.010 
of a sudden it doesn't even it hasn't
even<00:01:12.960> noticed<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.439> lifted<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:13.770> finger<00:01:14.100> yet

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
even noticed that I lifted my finger yet

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.100 
even noticed that I lifted my finger yet
so<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.470> go

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
so there we go

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
so there we go
it<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.560> add<00:01:20.180> anymore<00:01:23.060> still<00:01:24.060> thinks<00:01:24.360> my

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it will not add anymore still thinks my

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030 
it will not add anymore still thinks my
fingers<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> reason<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
fingers there so the reason this is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
fingers there so the reason this is
happening<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.430> sweat<00:01:29.430> quite<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> bit

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
happening is that I sweat quite a bit

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.460 
happening is that I sweat quite a bit
and<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.680> my<00:01:32.100> finger<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:33.020> leaving<00:01:34.020> residue

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and I'm so my finger is leaving residue

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.280 
and I'm so my finger is leaving residue
on<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> screen<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.409> touch<00:01:37.590> ID<00:01:39.290> which

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
on the screen on the touch ID which

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.319 
on the screen on the touch ID which
means<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.950> can't<00:01:41.220> read<00:01:41.689> anymore<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:45.270> just

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
means that it can't read anymore it just

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.069 
means that it can't read anymore it just
it<00:01:45.750> will<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.200> read<00:01:46.530> eventually<00:01:47.630> if<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.780> try

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it will not read eventually if I try

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.730 
it will not read eventually if I try
enough<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:50.189> will<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.490> frustrated<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.240> me

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
enough it will get frustrated with me

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.550 
enough it will get frustrated with me
and<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.600> tell<00:01:54.810> me<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> can't

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and it will just tell me that it can't

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.219 
and it will just tell me that it can't
read<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:55.860> finger<00:01:56.479> I'll<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.630> keep<00:01:57.780> trying<00:01:57.960> til

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
read my finger I'll just keep trying til

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.709 
read my finger I'll just keep trying til
it<00:01:58.320> does<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.149> really<00:02:00.149> doesn't<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.509> we<00:02:00.600> go

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.880 

it<00:02:10.390> doesn't<00:02:10.810> make<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.049> difference<00:02:11.200> no<00:02:11.859> matter

what I do now I've gone through and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.709 
what I do now I've gone through and
tried<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.280> actually<00:02:16.709> make<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.890> work<00:02:18.189> by

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.729 

cleaning<00:02:22.719> my<00:02:22.810> finger<00:02:23.079> every<00:02:23.140> single<00:02:23.530> time

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
cleaning my finger every single time

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.819 
cleaning my finger every single time
like<00:02:24.730> washing<00:02:25.389> my<00:02:25.689> hand<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.200> taking<00:02:26.409> a<00:02:26.620> towel

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
and and that does technically work but

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.559 
and and that does technically work but
it's<00:02:32.799> really<00:02:33.069> frustrating<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.969> doesn't

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
it doesn't read my finger anymore once

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.599 
it doesn't read my finger anymore once
I've<00:02:37.959> done<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.379> yeah<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:38.829> it<00:02:38.950> gives<00:02:39.129> up<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
I've done that yeah so it gives up and

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.979 
I've done that yeah so it gives up and
that's<00:02:42.609> not<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> good<00:02:42.970> solution<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.569> how<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.750> got

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
that's not a good solution so how I got

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.629 
that's not a good solution so how I got
these<00:02:44.169> four<00:02:44.500> finger<00:02:44.799> prints<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.189> I<00:02:45.220> do<00:02:45.310> have

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
these four finger prints that I do have

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.470 
these four finger prints that I do have
in<00:02:45.790> here<00:02:45.909> is<00:02:45.970> by<00:02:46.239> cleaning<00:02:46.629> out<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:49.150> area

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
in here is by cleaning out the area

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.530 
in here is by cleaning out the area
under<00:02:49.659> my<00:02:49.870> thumb<00:02:50.230> right<00:02:50.379> in<00:02:50.439> here<00:02:51.209> which<00:02:52.209> does

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
under my thumb right in here which does

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.610 
under my thumb right in here which does
have<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.780> good<00:02:52.959> fingerprint<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.379> don't<00:02:53.500> know<00:02:53.560> if

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
have a good fingerprint I don't know if

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.770 
have a good fingerprint I don't know if
you<00:02:53.680> can<00:02:53.799> see<00:02:54.040> but<00:02:54.879> my<00:02:55.060> fingerprint<00:02:55.480> has<00:02:55.540> all

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
you can see but my fingerprint has all

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.099 
you can see but my fingerprint has all
these<00:02:55.930> ridges<00:02:56.139> across<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.769> sometimes<00:02:57.760> my<00:02:57.909> skin

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
these ridges across it sometimes my skin

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.619 
these ridges across it sometimes my skin
will<00:02:59.109> peel<00:02:59.139> on<00:02:59.620> my<00:02:59.889> finger<00:03:00.159> on<00:03:00.219> my<00:03:00.629> finger

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
will peel on my finger on my finger

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.129 
will peel on my finger on my finger
thumb<00:03:01.900> pads<00:03:02.169> and<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.450> my<00:03:04.540> finger<00:03:04.750> prints<00:03:04.989> are

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
thumb pads and so my finger prints are

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.699 
thumb pads and so my finger prints are
pretty<00:03:05.379> transient<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:08.439> way<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.620> have

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
pretty transient so the way I have

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.039 
pretty transient so the way I have
gotten<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.430> work<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.840> doubt<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.959> will

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
gotten it to work and I doubt it will

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.209 
gotten it to work and I doubt it will
actually<00:03:11.169> work<00:03:11.439> this<00:03:11.620> time<00:03:11.799> but<00:03:11.950> I'll<00:03:12.010> give<00:03:12.129> it

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:12.219 
actually work this time but I'll give it

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:12.539 
actually work this time but I'll give it
a<00:03:12.280> shot

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
a shot

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:20.309 
a shot
is<00:03:12.729> to<00:03:13.090> put<00:03:13.389> this<00:03:14.199> area<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:18.729> then<00:03:19.319> it

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
is to put this area on and so then it

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.719 
is to put this area on and so then it
gets<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.620> pretty<00:03:20.889> good<00:03:21.069> read<00:03:23.519> similar<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.639> the

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
gets a pretty good read similar to the

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.229 
gets a pretty good read similar to the
woman<00:03:25.000> using<00:03:25.269> her<00:03:25.359> nipple<00:03:26.970> tells<00:03:27.970> me<00:03:28.090> my

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
woman using her nipple tells me my

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.240 
woman using her nipple tells me my
finger<00:03:28.479> moved<00:03:28.689> too<00:03:28.870> much<00:03:29.819> really<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:33.189> you

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
finger moved too much really so now you

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.819 
finger moved too much really so now you
can<00:03:33.370> see<00:03:33.579> it's<00:03:33.909> a<00:03:34.120> lot<00:03:34.239> more<00:03:34.389> consistent<00:03:34.930> seems

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
can see it's a lot more consistent seems

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.469 
can see it's a lot more consistent seems
to<00:03:35.979> be<00:03:36.040> working<00:03:36.310> fairly<00:03:36.489> well<00:03:36.699> like<00:03:37.329> you'd

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:37.479 
to be working fairly well like you'd

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.119 
to be working fairly well like you'd
expect<00:03:37.599> from<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.169> finger<00:03:38.470> like<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.739> would<00:03:38.889> expect

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
expect from a finger like I would expect

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.030 
expect from a finger like I would expect
from<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.370> finger<00:03:40.739> still<00:03:41.739> can't<00:03:41.919> be<00:03:41.979> read<00:03:42.239> so

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
from a finger still can't be read so

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.649 
from a finger still can't be read so
like<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.159> was<00:03:45.280> saying<00:03:45.340> touch<00:03:45.729> ID<00:03:45.939> does<00:03:46.269> not<00:03:46.449> work

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
like I was saying touch ID does not work

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.759 
like I was saying touch ID does not work
for<00:03:46.900> me<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.620> doesn't<00:03:47.949> work<00:03:48.099> at<00:03:48.340> all<00:03:49.590> none<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.680> my

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
for me it doesn't work at all none of my

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.469 
for me it doesn't work at all none of my
finger<00:03:51.040> prints<00:03:51.310> some<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:51.699> them<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.000> might<00:03:52.239> get

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
finger prints some of them I might get

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.920 
finger prints some of them I might get
more<00:03:52.689> success<00:03:52.989> but<00:03:53.909> it<00:03:54.909> just<00:03:55.180> really<00:03:55.419> doesn't

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
more success but it just really doesn't

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.499 
more success but it just really doesn't
work<00:03:56.859> all<00:03:57.069> that<00:03:57.099> well<00:03:57.220> for<00:03:57.459> me<00:03:57.579> I<00:03:57.759> can<00:03:58.209> touch<00:03:58.359> it

00:03:58.499 --> 00:03:58.509 
work all that well for me I can touch it

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.899 
work all that well for me I can touch it
as<00:03:58.629> much<00:03:58.780> as<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:58.989> want<00:03:59.519> doesn't<00:04:00.519> matter<00:04:00.759> which

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
as much as I want doesn't matter which

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.629 
as much as I want doesn't matter which
finger<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.750> doesn't<00:04:04.810> work<00:04:05.319> my<00:04:06.159> fingers<00:04:06.220> have

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
finger it doesn't work my fingers have

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.020 
finger it doesn't work my fingers have
too<00:04:06.819> much<00:04:06.939> residue<00:04:07.389> and<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:09.030> fingerprints

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
too much residue and the fingerprints

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.719 
too much residue and the fingerprints
are<00:04:10.209> too<00:04:10.689> transient<00:04:11.290> if<00:04:12.159> you<00:04:12.370> had<00:04:12.549> that<00:04:12.669> kind

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
are too transient if you had that kind

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:17.479 
are too transient if you had that kind
of<00:04:12.939> experience<00:04:13.060> please<00:04:13.659> let<00:04:13.840> me<00:04:13.930> know<00:04:16.289> but

of experience please let me know but

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.000 
of experience please let me know but
that's<00:04:18.489> been<00:04:18.729> my<00:04:18.849> experience
