00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:05.090
 for my orange cream bus sure first step the latina 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.600
 soak these dried and muslims 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.660
 cold water for five to ten minutes 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.509
 stylistically, everything is only now 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.799
 and then into the cold water 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.860
 an example that takes five minutes the Canadian nature empire 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:19.640
 become 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.769
 while next I peel my oranges Pierre so 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.119
 2 oranges according to recipe 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.630
 the turks agree on both ends 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.939
 the shell off 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.070
 can go quietly into percent pulp now not too much though 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.340
 this outer skin 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 I'd like to cut it off as well 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.440
 Jan Obermowe below 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.609
 I put here on such a cut level 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.210
 an orange on round 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.740
 Amnesty with the knife 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.850
 auÃŸenrum 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.790
 cut off the disc 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 be hilarious but had a little more after you 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
 stalk 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 and then I do two oranges altogether 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.580
 and before I take her for her dashing the orange a little bit smaller 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.560
 Elton can discuss it with someone to give the vessel to the coalition 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.840
 so and before I get here now with the blender what Kate there queen I 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.200
 four tablespoons of sugar not here so that's how it is 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 Deficiencies paint recipe 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 and now I can start here with the Kyrie 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.579
 make simple kitchen ETR 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 here 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.029
 and in between 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.949
 me of course with a Latina on the stove 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.299
 This is because 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.749
 soaked to perfection 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.749
 I can now be lifted out of the water here 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.379
 pushes out a little bit of excess water 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.519
 a 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.559
 the weight is 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.409
 insofar is forgiven 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.909
 the place hit stove 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.529
 but not for a long minute then the relativized liquid 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.169
 Thanks for a long time I can be here even second pro hard 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.619
 on 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.830
 from down though everything is nice and even 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.039
 flourishes 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.559
 We could finish the goal now I can put the individual ingredients together 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:07.319
 bring 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.919
 Here is a bowl 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.919
 the blow cream 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.469
 already beaten in advance 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.159
 as I can now here 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.749
 First of all, head the Orange Pillay to do my shots 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.379
 and with that then runs relatively mixed 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.379
 I would go here 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.379
 how important is the Latina simply into it 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.250
 or how does the typical Latina begin? 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.399
 that means I have to dress a bit now 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.319
 subtle work 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.639
 I just love the cold stuff or that Katy Perry likes this cold one 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.869
 whipped cream 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.869
 I do not need to be extra careful to have one like that 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:56.439
 "If you take Podolski carefully 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.729
 Attention do not beat "I strongly beat you this cream 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.119
 but I love 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:02.529
 leave the two 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.079
 among themselves 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.049
 and I want the whole thing 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.400
 that means Pierre m taller until no Sarnen it is called that 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.349
 so possible flakes of whipped cream are all possible 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.959
 a homogeneous mix will give Susanne and Branches Kyrill are now very good 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.099
 mixed together and now I can fill the whole in glasses on the 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.370
 Best of all in the glasses I serve in the orange cream 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.940
 would like to 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.040
 in these songs 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.980
 Then put the orange cream in the fridge for one of your four hours 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.240
 posed 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.280
 she giggles at him and goes the whole movie love her characteristic 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.479
 strength 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.490
 four times 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.490
 Patrick Lindner 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.939
 Heinrich Keller 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.279
 DAPD 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.849
 then pull 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.849
 rtr 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.889
 and important here 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.889
 Fill in cream 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.579
 and now my ESA comes in the refrigerator just under four hours is the 

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:06.659
 Porsch cream ready to serve
