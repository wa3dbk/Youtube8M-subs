00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
knees I just kind of pull it down a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.200 
knees I just kind of pull it down a
little<00:01:27.960> bit<00:01:28.140> more<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.380> let<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> belt<00:01:29.009> show<00:01:29.400> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
little bit more and let the belt show so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.999 
little bit more and let the belt show so
there's<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> whole<00:01:31.110> bunch<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.500> different<00:01:31.890> ways

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
there's a whole bunch of different ways

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
there's a whole bunch of different ways
that<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.520> wear<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:33.900> it's

that you can wear this and I think it's

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.170
