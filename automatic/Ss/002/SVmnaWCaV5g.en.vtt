bleaching your hair two times in one day

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.789 
bleaching your hair two times in one day
because<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.690> could<00:03:21.930> actually<00:03:22.109> cause<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.500> lot

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
because that could actually cause a lot

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.530 
because that could actually cause a lot
of<00:03:22.829> damage<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.400> your<00:03:23.910> hair<00:03:24.060> could<00:03:24.180> fall<00:03:24.389> out

of damage and your hair could fall out

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.000 
of damage and your hair could fall out
my<00:03:24.930> hair<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.200> actually<00:03:25.319> feeling<00:03:25.680> kind<00:03:25.859> of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
my hair is actually feeling kind of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.180 
my hair is actually feeling kind of
strong<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.790> strong<00:03:27.060> now<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:28.530> my<00:03:28.739> hair<00:03:28.980> can

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
strong like strong now but my hair can

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.370 
strong like strong now but my hair can
handle<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:30.420> bleach<00:03:30.600> because<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.200> so

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
handle the bleach because it is so

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.660 
handle the bleach because it is so
healthy<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.799> I've<00:03:31.859> been<00:03:32.040> dyeing<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.519> with

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.450 
this would take a couple more
applications<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:17.760> do<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.210> you<00:05:18.840> have<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:19.230> have

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
applications to do and you have to have

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.980 
applications to do and you have to have
really<00:05:20.460> healthy<00:05:20.790> hair<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.510> do<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.750> again

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
really healthy hair to do it again

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.860 
really healthy hair to do it again
within<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.560> week<00:05:22.830> because<00:05:23.220> if<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.940> do<00:05:24.720> it

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
within the week because if you do it

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.630 
within the week because if you do it
again<00:05:25.320> in<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.770> next<00:05:25.830> couple<00:05:26.160> days<00:05:26.400> or<00:05:26.580> the

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
again in the next couple days or the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.900 
again in the next couple days or the
week<00:05:26.790> and<00:05:27.000> your<00:05:27.120> hair<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.540> not<00:05:28.520> really<00:05:29.520> healthy

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
week and your hair is not really healthy

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.580 
week and your hair is not really healthy

then guess what your hair is going to
fall<00:05:31.800> out<00:05:31.830> it's<00:05:32.580> going<00:05:32.730> to<00:05:32.790> break<00:05:33.150> it's<00:05:33.540> gonna

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
fall out it's going to break it's gonna

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.140 
fall out it's going to break it's gonna
really<00:05:34.350> be<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> mess<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.700> don't<00:05:35.850> want<00:05:36.060> that
