00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.520 
knob I have presence and treble both up
and<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:32.000> feel<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.209> little<00:03:32.300> bit<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.630> gain<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:33.290> check

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
and I feel a little bit of gain to check

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.360 
and I feel a little bit of gain to check
the<00:03:33.680> phase<00:03:33.920> here

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:57.809 

in<00:03:38.370> phase<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:40.640> here<00:03:41.640> we<00:03:41.730> go

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.259 

and<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.560> if<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.040> wanted<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.430> hear<00:04:00.610> more<00:04:00.969> of<00:04:01.000> that

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
and so if I wanted to hear more of that

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.539 
and so if I wanted to hear more of that
on<00:04:01.540> stage<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.469> can<00:04:02.650> always<00:04:02.950> just<00:04:03.159> step<00:04:03.370> on<00:04:03.519> the

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
on stage I can always just step on the

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.000 
on stage I can always just step on the
boost<00:04:03.849> switch<00:04:04.689> which<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.290> right<00:04:05.620> here<00:04:05.650> and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
boost switch which is right here and

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.640 
boost switch which is right here and
that<00:04:06.849> goose<00:04:07.090> which<00:04:07.329> I<00:04:07.510> have<00:04:07.659> set<00:04:07.900> for<00:04:08.109> about<00:04:08.200> 7

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
that goose which I have set for about 7

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:22.920 
that goose which I have set for about 7
DB<00:04:09.340> boost

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.520 

and<00:04:23.169> I<00:04:23.850> have<00:04:24.850> some<00:04:25.090> effects<00:04:25.540> which<00:04:26.020> are<00:04:26.320> going

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
and I have some effects which are going

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.180 
and I have some effects which are going
through<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.979> effect<00:04:27.340> loop<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.350> activate

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
through the effect loop so if I activate

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.760 
through the effect loop so if I activate
those<00:04:30.370> effects<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:31.120> can<00:04:31.630> get<00:04:32.020> effects<00:04:32.530> on<00:04:32.650> my

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
those effects I can get effects on my

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:46.140 
those effects I can get effects on my
