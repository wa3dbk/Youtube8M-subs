don't really care for points because you

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.580

me and saying you know let's rack up

me and saying you know let's rack up
points<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.820> will<00:03:34.180> plant<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.600> bomb<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.140> will

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
points I will plant the bomb and I will

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.810 
points I will plant the bomb and I will
win<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.650> would<00:03:35.829> much<00:03:35.980> rather<00:03:36.040> win<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.640> round

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
then simply just rack up points I do

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.470 
then simply just rack up points I do

enemy from diffusing that bomb the timer

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.990 
enemy from diffusing that bomb the timer
is<00:03:53.290> actually<00:03:53.709> quite<00:03:53.920> long<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.489> this<00:03:54.549> one<00:03:54.790> which

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
is actually quite long in this one which

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.120 
is actually quite long in this one which
you'll<00:03:55.180> see<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.870> top<00:03:56.200> left<00:03:56.560> corner<00:03:56.650> you

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
you'll see in the top left corner you

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.610 
you'll see in the top left corner you
need<00:03:57.819> to<00:03:58.000> stay<00:03:58.239> near<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.750> bomb<00:03:59.079> site<00:03:59.380> if<00:03:59.500> you

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
need to stay near that bomb site if you

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.199 
need to stay near that bomb site if you
want<00:03:59.799> to<00:03:59.889> win<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.220> round<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.609> need<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:01.030> stay

near it you know not right close to it

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.490 
near it you know not right close to it
because<00:04:03.850> you'll<00:04:04.000> just<00:04:04.180> get<00:04:04.329> fragged<00:04:04.750> but

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
because you'll just get fragged but

close<00:04:06.370> enough<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.880> can<00:04:07.000> defend<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.420> and

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
close enough that you can defend it and

you blow it up you win the round that's
it<00:04:20.919> that's<00:04:21.130> game<00:04:21.459> over<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:22.030> lot<00:04:22.479> of<00:04:22.600> people<00:04:22.750> will

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
it that's game over a lot of people will

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.200 
it that's game over a lot of people will
extend<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.680> as<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:24.580> see<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.910> timer

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
extend it as you can see the timer

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.180 
extend it as you can see the timer
before<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.840> bomb<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.139> planted<00:04:26.169> is<00:04:26.680> quite<00:04:26.950> long

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
before the bomb is planted is quite long

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.000 
before the bomb is planted is quite long
so<00:04:27.490> here's<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.360> bomb<00:04:28.510> going<00:04:28.840> off<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.350> we<00:04:29.770> win

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010

the flags or areas as long as possible
for<00:04:53.240> each<00:04:53.480> area<00:04:53.840> that<00:04:54.260> you<00:04:54.410> control<00:04:54.860> you

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
for each area that you control you

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.910 
for each area that you control you
actually<00:04:56.150> generate<00:04:56.510> points<00:04:56.990> every<00:04:57.680> few

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
actually generate points every few

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.760 
actually generate points every few
seconds<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:59.000> if<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.300> only<00:04:59.450> control<00:04:59.930> one<00:05:00.260> you

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
seconds so if you only control one you

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.680 
seconds so if you only control one you
get<00:05:00.980> 2<00:05:01.010> points<00:05:01.370> every<00:05:01.730> few<00:05:01.910> seconds<00:05:02.300> if<00:05:02.450> the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
get 2 points every few seconds if the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.020 
get 2 points every few seconds if the

two of the flags for most of the game if

two of the flags for most of the game if
you're<00:05:16.040> able<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.460> do<00:05:16.670> that<00:05:16.850> you<00:05:17.450> can<00:05:17.630> usually

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
you're able to do that you can usually

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.890 
you're able to do that you can usually
win<00:05:18.140> this<00:05:18.320> game<00:05:18.560> now<00:05:19.430> if<00:05:19.760> you<00:05:20.150> get<00:05:20.300> all<00:05:20.540> three

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
win this game now if you get all three

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.480 
win this game now if you get all three
it<00:05:21.200> makes<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.620> a<00:05:21.650> little<00:05:21.770> bit<00:05:21.920> harder<00:05:22.280> you're

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
it makes it a little bit harder you're

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.400 
it makes it a little bit harder you're
going<00:05:22.700> you<00:05:22.850> can't<00:05:23.300> always<00:05:23.510> control<00:05:23.750> all<00:05:24.170> three

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
going you can't always control all three

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.840 
going you can't always control all three
but<00:05:24.590> it's<00:05:24.620> always<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.190> thing<00:05:25.370> that<00:05:25.520> you<00:05:25.670> want

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
but it's always the thing that you want

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.010 
but it's always the thing that you want
to<00:05:25.940> do<00:05:26.030> because<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.450> shows<00:05:26.630> sort<00:05:26.930> of

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
to do because it shows sort of

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.990 
to do because it shows sort of
domination<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:28.190> will<00:05:28.400> rack<00:05:28.670> up<00:05:28.880> the

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
domination and it will rack up the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.560 
domination and it will rack up the
points<00:05:29.030> a<00:05:29.360> lot<00:05:29.540> faster<00:05:31.090> obviously<00:05:32.090> there's<00:05:32.480> a

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
points a lot faster obviously there's a

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.210 
points a lot faster obviously there's a
few<00:05:32.930> strategies<00:05:33.200> involved<00:05:33.830> in<00:05:33.920> this<00:05:34.010> we're

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
few strategies involved in this we're

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.830 
few strategies involved in this we're
not<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.580> get<00:05:34.670> involved<00:05:34.910> all<00:05:35.300> you<00:05:35.690> need

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
not going to get involved all you need

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.480 
not going to get involved all you need
to<00:05:35.960> know<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:36.230> that<00:05:36.380> you<00:05:36.590> need<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:37.100> gain<00:05:37.280> control

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
to know is that you need to gain control

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.310 
to know is that you need to gain control
you<00:05:37.940> get<00:05:38.150> points<00:05:38.360> for<00:05:38.540> gaining<00:05:38.870> control<00:05:39.140> of

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
you get points for gaining control of

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.590 
you get points for gaining control of
the<00:05:39.530> flags<00:05:39.860> but<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.730> also<00:05:40.910> get<00:05:41.180> points<00:05:41.570> for

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
the flags but you also get points for

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.630 
the flags but you also get points for
defending<00:05:42.350> flags<00:05:42.590> so<00:05:42.800> if<00:05:42.920> someone<00:05:43.250> comes<00:05:43.430> in

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
defending flags so if someone comes in

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.220 
defending flags so if someone comes in
the<00:05:43.760> area<00:05:44.060> and<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:44.330> kill<00:05:44.540> them<00:05:44.720> you<00:05:44.840> also<00:05:45.110> get

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
the area and you kill them you also get

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.770 
the area and you kill them you also get
points<00:05:45.590> for<00:05:45.620> that<00:05:45.880> for<00:05:46.880> defending<00:05:47.330> that<00:05:47.450> flag

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
points for that for defending that flag

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.860 
points for that for defending that flag
area<00:05:48.220> but<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:49.310> must<00:05:49.550> be<00:05:49.700> within<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.090> area<00:05:50.270> so

need to be in the area and you'll see

need to be in the area and you'll see
that<00:06:11.120> because<00:06:11.330> actually<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.430> position

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
that because actually the position

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.240 
that because actually the position
securing<00:06:14.560> meter<00:06:15.560> or<00:06:15.740> whatever<00:06:15.980> will

securing meter or whatever will

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.090 
securing meter or whatever will

automatically populate on the screen so

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.590 
automatically populate on the screen so

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
just get close enough that you start

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.690 
just get close enough that you start
controlling<00:06:21.020> it<00:06:21.200> once<00:06:21.470> you<00:06:21.650> do<00:06:21.830> that<00:06:21.860> you<00:06:22.490> want

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
to gain control of the game again so

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
have that big of a lead you can win the

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
game if you control all three then

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.790 
game if you control all three then
there's<00:06:35.900> a<00:06:35.960> good<00:06:36.110> chance<00:06:36.350> that<00:06:36.590> you're<00:06:36.680> going

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
there's a good chance that you're going

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.040 
there's a good chance that you're going
to<00:06:36.860> obviously<00:06:37.070> go<00:06:37.880> ahead<00:06:38.210> of<00:06:38.390> them<00:06:38.540> as<00:06:38.720> long<00:06:39.020> as

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
to obviously go ahead of them as long as

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.690 
to obviously go ahead of them as long as
you<00:06:39.260> can<00:06:39.410> get<00:06:39.530> it<00:06:39.650> long<00:06:39.830> enough<00:06:39.980> to<00:06:40.190> catch<00:06:40.400> up

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
you can get it long enough to catch up

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.610 
you can get it long enough to catch up
because<00:06:41.390> if<00:06:41.510> you<00:06:41.600> gain<00:06:41.780> all<00:06:41.960> 3<00:06:42.110> they're<00:06:42.410> not

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620
