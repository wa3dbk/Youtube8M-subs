00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.799
 hello people welcome once more alone 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.020
 for everyone today we're going to be 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.900
 teaching how to put together another game of wit 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.360
 in a very practical and very homemade way 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.190
 and you're going to have to solve it yourself 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.900
 for this we are going to be using a 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.180
 plastic bottle can be any 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.190
 plastic bottle we are going to use in this 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.530
 case two nuts but they can be also 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.289
 two washers can be two rings 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.119
 anything that resembles we're going to 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.430
 use electrical tape but can use 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.430
 also any kind of tape and we're going 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.499
 to use a cord first let's have 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.819
 to take the bottle and we're going to cut a 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.280
 approximately two ring 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:39.050
 centimeters one that we already have it 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.760
 we're going to have to talk to the 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.399
 half to the inside does not go to 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.739
 be a one centimeter ring by the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.179
 width of the bottle this we are going to do 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.800
 now it 's optional 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.569
 I'm going to take the tape and the dora and what 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.370
 I'm going to wrap everything around to give 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:54.370
 a little more firmness to our hoop 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.079
 we have everything almost ready we would miss 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.610
 one more step before you can start 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.559
 put together we are going to do the following 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.449
 let's take the length that we just 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.560
 do not matter what is formed by 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.990
 what exactly now are we going to 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.000
 deform and we will double the first 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.460
 mark a fold well over here in the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.260
 plastic 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.909
 and on this side too and now once 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.229
 so that it will serve us 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.229
 already well marked 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.040
 it would be like this now we are going to open it 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.080
 and we are going to try to form a kind 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.760
 of hollow here in the middle of this form 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.270
 come there 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.920
 I wanted that and we're going to mark it right now 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.590
 so that a square is formed here 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.450
 it has to be of a size that the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.700
 washer because in this case the nut 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.259
 I did not go there 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.259
 and this we are going to have to paste 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.950
 it would not be leaving this 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.780
 Now let's try to do the same 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.850
 with the tips we are going to mark well the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.190
 fold here and let's try to open 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.849
 a building if I also think that with a 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.650
 ring one on each side and here also what 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.689
 let's paste 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.670
 until now we have something like 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.200
 this something good homemade that nobody is going to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.269
 to say that you did it with your 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.069
 own hands and now we are already 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.739
 ready to start putting it together for that 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.189
 let's take the cord first and let's go 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.960
 to have to make a loop by passing it through 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.660
 the one in the center first 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.080
 let's go through here 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.650
 in this way and now here we are going to 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.850
 spend these two this way is going to 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.170
 to be a loop formed there 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.700
 then we are going to pass one of the nuts 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.250
 by one side in this way 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.970
 and this we are going to put here and what 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.970
 we are going to late 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.030
 this does not have to be treated is the grace 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.030
 of fire can not untie it 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.280
 and now we're going to do the same with the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.569
 another side we pass this the nut 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.569
 please here is already 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.470
 and now that we have it finished, 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.080
 I will tell you what this is 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.270
 challenge what they have to achieve is without 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.600
 untying the tips obviously is not worth 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.300
 to untie the tips is to achieve a 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.610
 of these nuts on the other side or we are 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.470
 the two nuts would be on the same side 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.020
 they can be both on this side or they can 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.900
 being both for this side is not worth 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.510
 to untie is not worth to cut, it is not worth breaking 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.240
 it's just making some movements 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.310
 they will manage to pass the nut of a place 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.560
 the other will not be the two of 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.040
 same place and if you believe more videos like 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.250
 these then go to one's page 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.490
 for all 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.490
 Y 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.260
 we had also armed another game of 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.269
 ingenuity that was very good that 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.830
 did with a letter with two washers and 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.570
 with a piece of yarn is very good you 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.580
 I'll let pass because down here 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.560
 It is also very homemade it is very easy to 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.970
 do and what anyone can do 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.860
 necessarily have to be done with 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.620
 a letter many have asked can 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.630
 being a piece of plastic can be a 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.100
 piece of cardboard cardboard can be 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.320
 anything else can replace it 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.030
 using a little imagination with what 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.070
 you want here we have another 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.320
 also what we did a lot 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.000
 long ago that is the challenge of the 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.040
 tape that can see it as a challenge 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.720
 or you can see it also as a trick of 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.160
 magic that is also good I'm going to 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.110
 leave here was one of the first 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.889
 that we recorded there when still 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.419
 we even had a background and good passes 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.160
 to visit it that is very good and without 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.590
 what to say I'll be leaving as 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.940
 I said below is the revelation that I think 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.669
 that I did not do it in the video because I already 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.669
 know and see you the next video chau
