00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
timing down once you get it down of how

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
to read that defensive end probably

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.980 
to read that defensive end probably
takes<00:01:38.759> probably<00:01:39.179> five<00:01:39.479> minutes<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.929> most

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
takes probably five minutes at the most

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.839 
takes probably five minutes at the most
to<00:01:40.289> read<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.069> now<00:01:41.190> let's<00:01:41.399> get<00:01:41.520> into<00:01:41.640> some

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
to read that so now let's get into some

and<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.819> pathway<00:01:45.119> we're<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> look<00:01:45.479> at

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
and the pathway we're going to look at

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.499

is<00:01:45.720> z<00:01:45.990> dick<00:01:46.429> setups<00:01:47.429> are<00:01:47.520> simple<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.090> got

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
is z dick setups are simple all you got

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.940 
is z dick setups are simple all you got
to<00:01:48.599> do<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.720> put<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.080> wall<00:01:49.259> receiver<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.709> a<00:01:49.740> flat

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to do is put the wall receiver on a flat

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.690 
to do is put the wall receiver on a flat

think i'm going to play this is any

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.229 
think i'm going to play this is any
coverage<00:02:20.340> right<00:02:20.519> here<00:02:20.670> i<00:02:20.700> think<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.090> man

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
coverage right here i think that was man

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.520 
coverage right here i think that was man
coverage<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.719> a<00:02:21.750> receiver<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.290> wide<00:02:22.500> open

coverage in the a receiver was wide open

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.949 
coverage in the a receiver was wide open
over<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.980> middle<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.219> the<00:02:23.280> field<00:02:23.780> here<00:02:24.780> we're

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
over the middle of the field here we're

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.540 
over the middle of the field here we're
in<00:02:24.989> zone

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
in zone

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.500 
in zone
here<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:25.790> we're<00:02:25.910> going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> read<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.300> left

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
here so we're going to read the left

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.550 
here so we're going to read the left
side<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.810> field<00:02:26.930> we're<00:02:27.050> going<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.230> read<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.800 
side of field we're going to read the a
and<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.040> X<00:02:28.670> receiver<00:02:28.820> are<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.270> first<00:02:29.480> two<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and the X receiver are the first two and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.330 
and the X receiver are the first two and
then<00:02:29.900> while<00:02:30.110> receiver<00:02:30.470> has<00:02:30.590> Alliance<00:02:31.010> read<00:02:31.220> it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
then while receiver has Alliance read it

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.010 
then while receiver has Alliance read it
through<00:02:31.490> zone<00:02:31.700> blitz<00:02:31.970> honest<00:02:32.210> as<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.630> can<00:02:32.900> see

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
through zone blitz honest as you can see

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.990 
through zone blitz honest as you can see
here<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.830> X<00:02:34.010> receiver<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.490> open<00:02:34.760> over<00:02:34.910> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.140 
here the the X receiver is open over the

you<00:02:38.150> have<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.480> make<00:02:38.600> your<00:02:38.750> reads<00:02:38.990> um<00:02:39.260> if<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.610> a

here we're going looking at the B
receiver<00:02:58.550> just<00:02:58.880> like<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.240> on<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.810> outside

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840

said<00:03:03.140> we<00:03:03.230> also<00:03:03.350> got<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.680> selenium<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.580> RB

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
receiver versus man coverage as you see

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.310

there<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.880> RB<00:03:08.120> receiver<00:03:08.390> always<00:03:08.810> runs<00:03:09.080> an<00:03:09.200> out

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
there the RB receiver always runs an out

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.460 
there the RB receiver always runs an out

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.730 
route versus man coverage and always
runs<00:03:12.710> like<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> baby<00:03:13.190> curl<00:03:13.430> vs.<00:03:13.850> zone<00:03:14.030> coverage

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.810 
runs like a baby curl vs. zone coverage
which<00:03:15.740> is<00:03:15.860> probably<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.220> one<00:03:16.460> of<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.640> most

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
which is probably the one of the most

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.050

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
the PA Reed is one of my favorite pass

the PA Reed is one of my favorite pass
plays<00:03:25.100> out<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.370> this<00:03:25.460> formations<00:03:26.110> there's<00:03:27.110> a

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
plays out of this formations there's a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.010

couple<00:03:27.350> more<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:28.190> i<00:03:28.220> love<00:03:28.670> but<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.510> PA<00:03:29.720> Reed

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020

couple more that i love but the PA Reed
is<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.200> great<00:03:30.470> pass<00:03:30.680> play<00:03:30.890> because<00:03:31.130> it

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
is a great pass play because it

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.800 
is a great pass play because it
complements<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.790> read<00:03:31.940> option<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.660> looks

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
complements the read option it looks

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.260 
complements the read option it looks
like<00:03:32.959> we're<00:03:33.200> about<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.440> hand<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.680> off<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:33.830> the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
like we're about to hand it off to the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.340 
like we're about to hand it off to the
halfback<00:03:35.270> but<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.510> actually<00:03:35.660> pull<00:03:36.050> back<00:03:36.230> to

halfback but I actually pull back to
pass<00:03:36.530> all<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.100> want<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.280> do<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.489> streak<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.880> a

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
pass all you want to do is streak to a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.240 
pass all you want to do is streak to a

put<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.459> B<00:03:40.580> receiver<00:03:40.880> on<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.060> smart<00:03:41.330> right<00:03:41.420> out

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
put the B receiver on a smart right out

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.810 
put the B receiver on a smart right out
route<00:03:41.870> or<00:03:42.080> leave<00:03:42.890> them<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.190> come<00:03:43.459> back<00:03:43.610> round

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.400 
route or leave them on a come back round
if<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.090> think<00:03:44.390> that's<00:03:44.630> more<00:03:44.870> efficient

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
if you think that's more efficient

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.229 
if you think that's more efficient
personally<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.190> think<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.640> smart<00:03:46.850> right<00:03:47.030> out

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
personally I think the smart right out

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.460 
personally I think the smart right out
right<00:03:47.390> is<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.540> more<00:03:47.750> efficient<00:03:48.080> play<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.290> beat

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
right is a more efficient play to beat

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.440 
right is a more efficient play to beat
