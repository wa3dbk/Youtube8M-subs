00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hello everyone, today I would like to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.860
 tell about yourself and you can tell by 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.500
 my efficient fridge is in place 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.080
 parking lots 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.730
 forever refrigerator at such a wear 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.660
 cannot if we donâ€™t wear it 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.910
 products are long in the heat they will deteriorate but 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.710
 so I want to show this way 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.390
 let's say we arrived at the culture beam and 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.890
 we need to save day or night 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.750
 cooked foods mean the most 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:40.960
 effective way is to just bury 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.960
 the ground is first cold water 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:52.899
 I rubbed it here I have a package 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:54.079
 no additional canned meat 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.340
 cooked 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:04.270
 some food there let's say han to the pole 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:08.149
 the puppy in the pot has cooled down 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.600
 covered turf and sod and I left because 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.860
 what is more convenient you can just take 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.880
 sand 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:21.229
 but they hit it so what are you going 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.100
 do just a bunch of sand which i 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.320
 digging up the earth you can dig it under 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.670
 stone here i have attach 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.750
 stone can be dredged from above yet the main thing 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.350
 See that there are no ants because 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.990
 that how would we want to tie our package 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:48.259
 ants will break through but one more small 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.700
 advice means how to make these 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.810
 packages 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.030
 Our two knots are easy to see many 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.640
 they knit two knots, and then they are tight 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.310
 many knit two knots and take in the office under 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.040
 knot then of course draw knots so 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.149
 what will not untie but if you take 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:15.060
 wear these tips here they do not give a knot 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:19.090
 passed on like this and we are elementary 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.650
 untie our packages and get them 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.110
 wife 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.170
 forgot to say what you can dig a hole 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.239
 just dribble with a knife i dug this i 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.690
 very many night a little sapper 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.330
 shoulder blades 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.370
 I don't have a sapper blade with me 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.320
 I generally honestly have little 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.170
 there is some kind of soviet heavy but i 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.440
 not a supporter and you can say it by yourself 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.720
 drip again with a knife 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.600
 machete to a piece of bark can drip 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.310
 home hide turf with a knife and then piece 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.570
 onions can be raked out with a piece of koran all 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.739
 Thank you all for your attention 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.120
 Well, now my wife suggested run Savako 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.780
 digging holes is very convenient with 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.780
 dogs
