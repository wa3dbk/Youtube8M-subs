00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.770
 and on we go with a little test 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.089
 Which is always interesting for me 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.730
 is and that is the high 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.290
 driving speed and now I have 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.719
 someone everything 17 24 and the 13 notebook 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.020
 here are in the 13 is the original 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.170
 1 terabyte hdd disk in there so one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.130
 normal hard drive and here in the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:32.940
 he 17 inches is a san disk 256 mb lgb 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.440
 ssd disk in it and to content 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.420
 That's one old notebook yet 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 completely configured for two years 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.930
 about everything for a single person 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.989
 data are on it and here is now 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.480
 just photoshop on it and planet and 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.219
 Crysis 3 that's pretty much the same 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.250
 new and not so much data 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.870
 scrap it and I will both now 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.489
 switch on at the same time and become one 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.230
 start the timer and then you can in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.480
 See the nice comparison how fast 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.550
 the ssd and how fast the hdd 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 starts up and you will think so too 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.449
 are still relatively surprised 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.030
 Information on both computers is 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 Windows 8.1 installs that means that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 operating system is ident the same 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 that he does not care about what he cares about others 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 times to boot or to load 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:24.540
 needed and I would say we lay 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:27.150
 Just let it go 321 now that would be complete 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.579
 nice high left still the old one 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 cityscape short windows that became here 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.280
 already no longer replaced what I completely 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.280
 nice find 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.140
 and as we can see the left jumps 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.420
 now on desktop too and like us 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.680
 can see that very well now 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.370
 the time was about 22 seconds 20 seconds 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.250
 seconds and both went up 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.810
 the notebook here with the hdd is very 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.460
 boot up very fast even a tick 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.000
 faster than natural now, too 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.280
 the already used with the ssd 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.950
 hard drive in it and that would be mine 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.400
 small test I made here now 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.520
 as far as the speed is concerned 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.290
 for booting up the various 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.320
 hard disks and that too knows for this 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.540
 video and thanks to see and continue 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.470
 Let's go with the next one the next 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.470
 few days until then
