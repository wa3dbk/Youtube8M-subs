simulate the processes of the land and
to<00:02:27.019> try<00:02:27.800> then<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.340> see<00:02:28.610> what<00:02:28.640> happens<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.540> some

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
to try then to see what happens if some

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.410 
to try then to see what happens if some
of<00:02:29.900> those<00:02:30.080> parameters<00:02:30.440> change<00:02:34.420> scientists

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
of those parameters change scientists

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.509 
of those parameters change scientists
use<00:02:36.110> these<00:02:36.350> models<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.800> increase<00:02:37.250> their

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
use these models to increase their

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.759 
use these models to increase their
understanding<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.690> complex<00:02:38.900> interaction

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
understanding of the complex interaction

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.470 
understanding of the complex interaction
between<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:40.130> earth<00:02:40.280> systems<00:02:40.820> elements<00:02:41.299> and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
between the earth systems elements and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.110 
between the earth systems elements and
then<00:02:42.200> make<00:02:42.860> improved<00:02:43.310> global<00:02:43.760> climate

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
then make improved global climate

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.810 
then make improved global climate
predictions<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:45.310> think<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> critical<00:02:46.760> thing

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
predictions I think the critical thing

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.380 
predictions I think the critical thing
about<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:48.380> NPP<00:02:48.650> VIIRS<00:02:48.799> instrument<00:02:49.390> is

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
about the the NPP VIIRS instrument is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.500 
about the the NPP VIIRS instrument is
that<00:02:50.780> we<00:02:51.019> will<00:02:51.200> get<00:02:51.470> long-term<00:02:52.459> data<00:02:52.850> records

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
that we will get long-term data records

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.120 
that we will get long-term data records
and<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.780> think<00:02:54.019> if<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.200> want<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.560> monitor<00:02:54.980> how

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
and I think if you want to monitor how

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.640 
and I think if you want to monitor how
the<00:02:55.160> Earth's<00:02:55.459> surface<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.940> changing<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.570> need

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the Earth's surface is changing we need

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.050 
the Earth's surface is changing we need
consistent<00:02:57.650> data<00:02:57.890> records<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.700> think<00:02:58.940> this

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
consistent data records and I think this

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.759 
consistent data records and I think this
is<00:02:59.209> why<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.630> so<00:02:59.780> important<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.530> NASA

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
is why it is so important for a NASA

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.340 
is why it is so important for a NASA
science<00:03:01.250> but<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.269> also<00:03:02.450> important<00:03:03.140> for<00:03:03.230> me

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
science but it's also important for me

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.710 
science but it's also important for me
personally<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.579> understand<00:03:05.060> how<00:03:05.299> we're

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
personally I can understand how we're

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.569 
personally I can understand how we're
responding<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.560> climate<00:03:06.799> change<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.459> how

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
responding to climate change and how

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.759 
responding to climate change and how
climate<00:03:07.820> change<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.390> affecting<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:09.590> Earth's

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
climate change is affecting the Earth's

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.040 
climate change is affecting the Earth's
surface
