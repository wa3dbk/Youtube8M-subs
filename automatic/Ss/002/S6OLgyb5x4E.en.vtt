00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.179
 today we have sprints and passing game 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.309
 So stop it with the players 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.380
 being spritzig in the game is sprinting a lot 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.419
 important and after that we do that 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.840
 Matching and improving the technique 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.910
 train your left right foot to do it 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.160
 getting better and better are a few steps 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.910
 automatism is to turn players 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.910
 then in the game 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.280
 there 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.280
 play 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.390
 Who in the exercise we look that the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.950
 Balancing means more works properly 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 the post is played with pressure 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:47.400
 that the players go to the ball 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:49.650
 that they should be in the over 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.750
 unfair to note that the ball the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.640
 player played so that he is the same 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.739
 this long ball can play diagonally 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.420
 if he plays him on the short foot 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.160
 then he needed two contacts so he can 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.160
 jump him directly to the player 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.170
 Simply importance 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.760
 the single ball also concentrates 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.959
 if it becomes monotonous at some point and if so 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.540
 Maybe someday, maybe 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.370
 Every ball has to get boring 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.290
 be played because in the game you have 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.730
 also some hundred passports or more 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.010
 depending on which position 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.790
 you have to go to every single ball 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.790
 focus
