this when I the reason why I put this
Jack<00:04:24.950> shaft<00:04:25.190> assembly<00:04:25.340> this

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
Jack shaft assembly this

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
housing right here that holds the two

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.100 
housing right here that holds the two
bearings<00:04:28.460> in<00:04:28.580> place<00:04:28.790> you'll<00:04:29.600> notice<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.050> I

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
bearings in place you'll notice that I

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.200 
bearings in place you'll notice that I
have<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:30.440> further<00:04:30.920> off<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.670> right<00:04:31.820> side<00:04:32.060> of

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
have it further off to the right side of

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.270 
have it further off to the right side of
the<00:04:32.270> bike<00:04:32.420> right<00:04:32.660> here<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.050> often<00:04:33.830> some

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
the bike right here and often some

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.070 
the bike right here and often some
people<00:04:34.550> will<00:04:34.670> wonder<00:04:34.790> why<00:04:35.090> why<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:35.780> far

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
people will wonder why why so far

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.530 
people will wonder why why so far
because<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:36.710> can<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.790> can<00:04:37.940> take<00:04:38.120> this<00:04:38.270> and

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
because you can you can take this and

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.660 
because you can you can take this and
Center<00:04:38.930> it<00:04:39.050> more<00:04:39.260> over<00:04:39.470> here<00:04:39.710> on<00:04:39.920> under<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
Center it more over here on under the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.670 
Center it more over here on under the
frame<00:04:40.940> but<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:42.050> doesn't<00:04:42.350> give<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.560> enough

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
frame but it doesn't give you enough

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.860 
frame but it doesn't give you enough
room<00:04:43.040> for<00:04:43.400> this<00:04:43.490> small<00:04:43.730> sprocket<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.510> fit<00:04:44.750> in
