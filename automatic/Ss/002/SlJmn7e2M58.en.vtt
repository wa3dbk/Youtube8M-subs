benefits<00:02:09.050> from<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.679> even<00:02:09.920> though<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.250> looks

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
benefits from it even though it looks

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.850 
benefits from it even though it looks
super<00:02:10.640> awesome<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.690> big<00:02:11.960> sprite<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.830> a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
super awesome and this big sprite on a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.610 
super awesome and this big sprite on a
wall<00:02:13.130> i<00:02:13.400> figured<00:02:13.940> i'd<00:02:14.090> make<00:02:14.330> these<00:02:14.690> things<00:02:15.020> for

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
wall i figured i'd make these things for

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.710 
wall i figured i'd make these things for
two<00:02:15.920> reasons<00:02:16.130> one<00:02:16.790> these<00:02:17.180> are<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> lot<00:02:17.570> easier

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
two reasons one these are a lot easier

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.720 
two reasons one these are a lot easier
to<00:02:17.990> make<00:02:18.170> even<00:02:18.560> though<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:19.280> looks<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.610> lot

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
to make even though it looks a lot

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.730 
to make even though it looks a lot
harder<00:02:19.970> these<00:02:20.570> only<00:02:21.050> took<00:02:21.290> me<00:02:21.470> 20<00:02:21.709> minutes

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
harder these only took me 20 minutes

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.410 
harder these only took me 20 minutes
whereas<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.370> wall<00:02:22.550> things<00:02:22.790> usually<00:02:22.970> take<00:02:23.300> me

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
whereas the wall things usually take me

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.350 
whereas the wall things usually take me
45<00:02:23.720> minutes<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.380> secondly<00:02:25.070> this<00:02:25.550> i<00:02:25.880> get<00:02:26.270> to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
45 minutes and secondly this i get to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.510 
45 minutes and secondly this i get to
actually<00:02:26.540> keep<00:02:26.990> well<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.650> don't<00:02:28.070> get<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.340> key

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
actually keep well I don't get the key

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.030 
actually keep well I don't get the key
you<00:02:28.910> get<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.240> keep<00:02:29.420> because<00:02:29.989> every<00:02:30.440> week<00:02:30.830> when

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
you get to keep because every week when
