00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.700
 Yes hello 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.340
 it should be a little today 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.890
 lives light in the original bands of 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 to integrate lamp 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.609
 Although there is currently not much to do 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.279
 for me on the tank because yes that is 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.480
 now for a week the first 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.890
 brown ones have already formed 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.210
 and besides watching there is currently 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.120
 not so much to do now 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.460
 That's why I thought I would integrate 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.059
 I once a reason light or night light 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 in the original band lamp I have that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.210
 Seen it somewhere on the internet because of it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.700
 unfortunately not exactly where that was 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 and yes I tried that for me 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.170
 and that's what I realized with 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.350
 help a small led band what me 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.320
 stuck in the lamp the whole 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.239
 runs over twelve volts and will 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.890
 headed over his little 12 you 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.049
 Fortunately, I still had one 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.610
 to kill me 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.619
 otherwise you can also for relative 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.159
 to earn narrow money 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.310
 i even had an adjustable trafo what 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.670
 makes a little better because 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.180
 So this led strip will be so 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.830
 12 volt is the problem for me was with 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.540
 12 volt is a bit too bright 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.360
 I fixed that down now 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.829
 I believe in 75 or 9 volts 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.560
 and certainly the stress then makes 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.930
 more the right light so that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 actually fits quite well and 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.040
 The whole thing is controlled with a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.659
 timer that when the main 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.790
 lighting just before the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.600
 main burden goes out of the led 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.180
 streak 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.670
 and he still does that at night 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.490
 twelve then it is completely dark but so 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 that in the evenings a bit 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.869
 which of 5 from this blue phase of 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.780
 This blue light has seen that 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.760
 very nice and can be relatively 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.410
 uncomplicated 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.990
 Assemble the links for those for the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.240
 I'll pack some of the components below 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.890
 in the description to the video is 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.100
 really not expensive so the led 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.010
 at konrad seven euro 20 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.940
 I think and a trafo is now too 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.590
 not so crazy expensive 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.030
 so I think that 's a relative one 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.180
 quick and easy solution for his 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.020
 son moonlight yes otherwise as I said 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.150
 The basin has been running for a week now 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.540
 is just beautiful in the crisis suffer 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 phase so everything is pretty brown right now 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.310
 the only thing left me 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.350
 a bit disturbing is the bio colator of 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.810
 the nada so the pump that is relative 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.410
 loud yet the buzzes extremely 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.090
 I already have the customer service 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.190
 have written to me and they have me 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.620
 promised to send an exchange 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.150
 I hope that completely because so correct 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.090
 it is really suitable for living room 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.900
 not yet so it is already 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.030
 very strong and yes let's see when the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.100
 new pump comes and whether the appropriate 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.830
 quietly yes now but as I said first 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.920
 to install the moonlight while doing a lot 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.920
 fun 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.539
 I hope I had small instructions 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.990
 Do you like what you guys are looking for? 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.160
 nachzubasteln as I said customer in the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.810
 video description I have again 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.520
 left for the two things so for 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.190
 trafo and for led band and yes should 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.220
 I would have accompanied you with the video 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.260
 I am very happy about a lay and jÃ¶rg 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.260
 English maybe until next time
