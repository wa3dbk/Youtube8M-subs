00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.970
 for all 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.529
 with the people how are they here bringing them 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.689
 a new revision of another tweet decided 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.930
 very good in this case I bring you a 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:28.060
 alternative tweet to the famous sbsettings 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.920
 in this case it is called nc setting 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.070
 that as we can see here what 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.120
 I have in the notification center is very 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.020
 similar but is that almost equal but to 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.110
 difference of 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.800
 dsv settings this is one more interface 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.930
 simple there are no issues neither my switch nor anything 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.970
 like the other one we simply enter here 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:58.210
 and we press lower the same volume 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.219
 same brightness we go up we lower shine 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.910
 we cancel the rotation as they can 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:07.030
 observe there gives us this tweet works 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.920
 also very well now yes that you already 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.979
 They will touch them decide if they prefer 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.310
 sbsettings or in this case in that set 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.229
 link as we will install it well 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.340
 in a very simple way as always 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.340
 You know, we went to Syria 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.520
 and we wait for him to load 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.810
 well then once you have loaded 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.960
 totally seed we will go and look for and 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.140
 in search we will write in s 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:47.680
 thirst ings as you can see where they put 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.680
 in that we will appear there is this is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.869
 well then only where 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.240
 appears to change you disappear 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.490

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.450
 which is a re because it is already in charge 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.790
 match 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.759
 well then once we install it 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.759
 we will go to configurations 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.500
 to notifications and if we want to have it 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.790
 in our notification center 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.799
 just how can you see here I would 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.230
 I have the first one that I have, that's why 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.060
 found at the top of the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.470
 notification center if you 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.239
 they want to place somewhere else 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.569
 they are simply going to edit it and how 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.939
 can you see if I lower it 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.710
 now it is below the climate and 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.200
 down the bag 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.480
 well then simply if they are put if 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.100

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.440
 outside the notification center 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.140
 they just pull it and upload it to this 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.480
 part of here 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.780
