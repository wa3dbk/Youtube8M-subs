00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.460
 m 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.870
 well it her whole world seneca 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.760
 case and we find ourselves today for 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.760
 a new adventure map is the map 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.320
 called appert kraft science sayan 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.720
 science does not really know how 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.029
 say but we'll get there anyway 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.419
 then mark the map to father kraft 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.500
 science it is inspired by a game 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.869
 some it's theirs 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.590
 some may have known the name of a 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.150
 little bit of trouble me there talking is 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.410
 because it's inspired by the portal game 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 for those who know portal game 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.859
 and portal 2 it's a really great game 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.469
 of reflection puzzle with just 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.750
 these portals that allows us to 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.199
 teleport from one place to another and 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.320
 so sealed the aperture labs 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.329
 science in the portal game who we who 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.769
 will make us a subject of 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.050
 test that make us pass several 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.660
 tests and seven map inspire so that's 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.410
 the map a father kraft science that's going 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.610
 also make us pass us 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.439
 pass several tests in fact for for 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.880
 provoke evaluate our skills then 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.170
 listen we'll read down the rules all 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.920
 immediately we will start with my part this 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.900
 side simply 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.090
 so this is a map that has been in track 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.470
 was created by prose h 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.880
 so he's the one who contacted me 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.130
 indirectly who sent me the map and 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.560
 who asked me of this is so 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.369
 of course I present it if you 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.899
 like to do like him 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.060
 do not hesitate in the description in 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.159
 all the descriptions of the videos you 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.560
 have the little link down with with the 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.750
 mail to be able to send your map if 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.579
 you have created adventure maps of 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.350
 maps fallen kingdom maps a warrior 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.000
 md map any maps you 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.560
 can send them without problem 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.369
 that I present them on the whole chain 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.469
 just then please have fun, we're going 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.659
 start by reading the rules then you 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.860
 are our subject we will test you 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.380
 to know your skills 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.920
 I do not say more about it soon this is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.070
 a test 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.390
 so that's it pretty much enough 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.460
 succinct as description but it's 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.140
 in the portal spirit for those who have 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.520
 played you'll recognize a little bit the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.260
 dialogues or how to do portal 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.690
 then at each event a chest and 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.610
 hide you will have to throw everything 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.810
 you have at each end of the test on 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.580
 your equipment evolene 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.040
 so the goal it will be to recover 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.620
 apparently wool 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.000
 on this map so just keep 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 the wool and thrown at each test to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.469
 all we could have recovered 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.299
 meanwhile so the rules for a 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.629
 player so that plays only one player this 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.579
 map 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.769
 after you can maybe do it to 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.849
 two but I think there are systems 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.010
 of redstone because there are a lot of 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.359
 redstone on the map that makes it 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.950
 usable just for one player 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.859
 you will see you can always try 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.079
 anyway well here are others are 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.340
 is built just after the circuits 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.389
 redstone do not allow the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.400
 multiplayer so normally you 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.859
 can play only one you can 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.159
 break the green so it's broken right 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.900
 green and gravel that's playing 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.639
 easy normal or difficult so me 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.169
 as usual i am in pacific 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.980
 for for for the video because 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.889
 it's much simpler 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.620
 simply that a system already to stay 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.370
 he gives here it's under the go see 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.859
 why you will be able to prevent it up 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.970
 broken broken the ice in right to break 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.739
 the ice cream and I got a little 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.329
 paper that you can see it does not 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.280
 may be useful later we'll see 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.359
 it is true that you've for 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.979
 spend the first part so we have a 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.949
 button just up so worry enough 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.180
 easy to discover 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.669
 So here we see the small system 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.900
 of redstone that is set up in 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.150
 red stone dock really everywhere 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.349
 it's really really a job 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.959
 on this table I do not know if he was 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.729
 alone for chalk anyway I 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.229
 just will go to him I'm sorry 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.519
 if there is a 2nd creator but if he has it 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.500
 does it alone frankly bravo because 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.909
 that because it must have been a job 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.889
 you really take a lot of time 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.139
 so listen here we have a bed to sleep 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.280
 So I'm going to sleep that's 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.229
 true stuffed in pacific so 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.650
 normally I say normally I 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.530
 not going to die 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.500
 after I am able to die so 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.269
 alas it's the first the first 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.430
 small test so you have to be pretty 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.750
 fast enough for this test id game 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.629
 advance so I'm not sure to make it happen 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.680
 but finally to get there if I'm going 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.090
 happen anyway from tamba you 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.680
 go see you have to be fast enough to these 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.659
 have pretty good reflexes for 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.650
 can you see that you can not 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.000
 do not tell you more we will engage 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.000
 the system right away 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.260
 we have the right to break the green here we are 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.810
 did not have a potion poet of the guinea pig 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.930
 in klein august is a little hop on 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:38.780
 gave us a watch too very a 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:40.790
 level so first then the first the 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.920
 first test I want to say who 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.950
 is the worst of trials to embrace 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.390
 the tests of 2 how to say two 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.430
 platforms in minecraft struggling to 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.530
 evaluate them to evaluate distances 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.670
 so I'll try anyway 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.430
 I am peaceful one so I can not 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.780
 to die but I will try to do it 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.830
 to do well anyway that would not be 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.380
 badly nor movie so far so I 'm going to 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.010
 focus a little bit against so that's it 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.430
 it begins 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.070
 here already I would be dead normally 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:15.440
 but hey we'll say we did not see anything 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:18.830
 we should not have gone through it 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.270
 to go across to I'll get there by 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:26.720
 more like a game it's because a 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:28.669
 only once twice 1 I would be dead 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.090
 twice but we did not see anything and so 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.010
 here we recover the van halen wool from 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.419
 first level simply we 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.430
 will then access 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.340
 finally it's the thing we have to keep 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.960
 about us on us every time at every 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.400
 test so that was the first 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.050
 test you will have many more 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.820
 but many more afterwards and 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.919
 I will not show you more 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.130
 will stop here there is a little bit 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.590
 small chips is like that there and yes so 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.620
 I will not show you 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.260
 show more one will dad to unveil a 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.610
 little everything that is done on the map is 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.180
 really just to give you give 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.380
 mouth watering 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.300
 in any case I think there is still 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.710
 it can take you a lot of time 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.930
 there are puzzles of reflection going to have to 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.030
 think a little bit about how are we 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.440
 can to do to pass this 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.450
 level as much as just past the 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.770
 quickly to see was seeing nothing already 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.840
 here me anyway I will not get there 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.379
 not spend it's simple that's 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.030
 far too fast for me 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.560
 I can not get is when we will 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.629
 leave here anyway I hope that the 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.610
 map will have pleased you if you have any 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.050
 questions to ask do not hesitate to 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.030
 ask in the comments I think that 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.500
 the author to the author of the amap of 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.729
 let us hope that the author of the mab 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.860
 will come for a ride and then can 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:40.189
 answer your questions if you have a 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.509
 little worry here he is going to listen I'm going 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:42.919
 leave you here I wish you good 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.789
 game to all and I'll see you soon 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.789
 Hello everyone
