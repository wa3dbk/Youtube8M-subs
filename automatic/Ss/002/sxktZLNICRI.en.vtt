way that the grain works and all that

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.500 
way that the grain works and all that
that's<00:00:44.160> exactly<00:00:44.730> how<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.000> looked<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> that

thing I want to talk about though in

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.260 
thing I want to talk about though in
this<00:01:25.720> before<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.290> go<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.400> gameplay<00:01:28.000> and

this before you go is the gameplay and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.450 
this before you go is the gameplay and
the<00:01:28.450> way<00:01:28.630> it<00:01:28.990> man<00:01:29.170> looks<00:01:29.440> in<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.680> picture<00:01:30.040> now

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
the way it man looks in the picture now

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
the way it man looks in the picture now
he<00:01:30.520> looks<00:01:30.790> really<00:01:31.270> thin<00:01:31.420> than<00:01:32.760> absolution<00:01:33.760> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
he looks really thin than absolution and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.540 
he looks really thin than absolution and
also<00:01:34.900> if<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:35.200> look<00:01:35.440> at<00:01:35.619> his<00:01:35.770> face<00:01:36.130> they<00:01:36.400> don't

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
also if you look at his face they don't

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.740 
also if you look at his face they don't
and<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.790> think<00:01:37.030> they're<00:01:37.150> trying<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.390> hide<00:01:37.600> this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
and I think they're trying to hide this

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.290 
and I think they're trying to hide this
to<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.650> could<00:01:38.830> tell<00:01:39.070> that<00:01:39.400> he's<00:01:39.910> obviously

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
to you could tell that he's obviously

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.300 
to you could tell that he's obviously
younger<00:01:40.869> but<00:01:41.590> his<00:01:41.650> face<00:01:42.250> model<00:01:42.760> looks<00:01:43.060> like

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
younger but his face model looks like

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.740 
younger but his face model looks like
the<00:01:45.310> older<00:01:45.670> ones<00:01:45.880> like<00:01:46.090> blood<00:01:46.330> money<00:01:46.540> and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
the older ones like blood money and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.050 
the older ones like blood money and
stuff<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:47.140> looks<00:01:47.470> like<00:01:47.680> it<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.640> have<00:01:48.970> a

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
stuff it just looks like it so I have a

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.460 
stuff it just looks like it so I have a
feeling<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.450> this<00:01:49.660> has<00:01:49.869> something<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.259> do

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
feeling that this has something to do

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.040 
feeling that this has something to do
with<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.460> know<00:01:51.580> maybe<00:01:51.820> before<00:01:52.300> absolution<00:01:53.020> or

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
with you know maybe before absolution or

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.080 
with you know maybe before absolution or
something<00:01:53.440> I<00:01:53.530> don't<00:01:53.590> know<00:01:53.800> but<00:01:54.520> he<00:01:54.729> just<00:01:54.850> looks

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
something I don't know but he just looks

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.370 
something I don't know but he just looks
younger<00:01:55.330> there's<00:01:55.630> no<00:01:55.780> way<00:01:55.930> it's<00:01:56.080> gonna<00:01:56.200> take

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
younger there's no way it's gonna take

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.840 
younger there's no way it's gonna take
after<00:01:56.740> absolutely<00:01:57.160> because<00:01:57.310> he<00:01:57.490> looks<00:01:57.670> too

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
after absolutely because he looks too

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.389

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
in the first ones and that's the thing i

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.380

want to talk about gameplay from what

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.180 
want to talk about gameplay from what
i'm<00:02:07.539> reading<00:02:07.780> up<00:02:08.200> from<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.560> post<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:09.009> i<00:02:09.039> have

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
i'm reading up from the post that i have

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.250 
i'm reading up from the post that i have
actually<00:02:09.399> got<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:09.850> leak<00:02:10.060> from<00:02:10.300> like<00:02:10.600> Elliott

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
actually got this leak from like Elliott

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
actually got this leak from like Elliott
where<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.530> all<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.800> they<00:02:12.010> posted<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:12.550> it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
where and all that they posted this it

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.000 
where and all that they posted this it
actually<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.080> think<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.470> they're<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:14.890> to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
actually I think that they're going to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.030 
actually I think that they're going to
take<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.430> game<00:02:15.670> play<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.660> they're<00:02:17.040> basically

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
take the game play and they're basically

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.860 
take the game play and they're basically
making<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> original<00:02:19.360> hit<00:02:19.510> man<00:02:19.540> so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
making it like the original hit man so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.800 
making it like the original hit man so
it's<00:02:20.019> going<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.260> be<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.269> guys<00:02:22.390> play<00:02:22.750> too

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
it's going to be it if you guys play too

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.020 
it's going to be it if you guys play too
Blood<00:02:23.260> Money<00:02:23.290> contracts<00:02:24.040> or<00:02:24.370> any<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
Blood Money contracts or any of the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.990 
Blood Money contracts or any of the
other<00:02:25.180> ones<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.530> game<00:02:26.709> plays<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.280> think

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
other ones the game plays I think

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.990 
other ones the game plays I think
they're<00:02:28.120> focusing<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.750> making<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.410> that

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
they're focusing on making it like that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.190 
they're focusing on making it like that
versus<00:02:31.000> absolutely<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.660> solution<00:02:32.110> was

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
versus absolutely that solution was

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.600 
versus absolutely that solution was
completely<00:02:32.680> different<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.160> lot<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.489> people

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
completely different a lot of people

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.240 
completely different a lot of people
didn't<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.600> just<00:02:34.930> because<00:02:35.260> they<00:02:35.560> it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
didn't like it just because they it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.890 
didn't like it just because they it
wasn't<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> original<00:02:36.910> hit<00:02:37.330> man<00:02:37.360> blah<00:02:37.780> blah

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
wasn't the original hit man blah blah

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.170 
wasn't the original hit man blah blah
blah<00:02:38.220> personally<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.280> think<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.790> was<00:02:39.940> cool<00:02:40.150> i

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
blah personally I think it was cool i

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.330 
blah personally I think it was cool i
like<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.810> gameplay<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:41.470> again<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.070> was

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
like the gameplay but again it was

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.960 
like the gameplay but again it was
really<00:02:43.239> different<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.810> wasn't<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:45.070> best<00:02:45.310> so

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
really different it wasn't the best so

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.250 
really different it wasn't the best so
that's<00:02:46.180> what<00:02:46.329> i<00:02:46.390> think<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.959> game<00:02:47.110> is

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
that's what i think that this game is

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.630 
that's what i think that this game is
going<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.799> basically<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.280> Hitman

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
going to be is basically the Hitman

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.700 
going to be is basically the Hitman
everybody<00:02:49.060> really<00:02:49.510> wanted<00:02:49.870> again

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
everybody really wanted again

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.440 
everybody really wanted again
with<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.070> original<00:02:51.250> gameplay<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.180> all<00:02:52.270> that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
with the original gameplay and all that

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.940 
with the original gameplay and all that
but<00:02:52.900> what<00:02:53.050> I'm<00:02:53.140> trying<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.410> figure<00:02:53.500> out<00:02:53.650> how<00:02:53.890> is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
but what I'm trying to figure out how is

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.070 
but what I'm trying to figure out how is

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
able to handle it i think so because

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.910 
able to handle it i think so because
absolution<00:03:28.120> actually<00:03:28.390> ran<00:03:28.770> beautiful<00:03:29.770> and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
absolution actually ran beautiful and

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.530

almost<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.220> lot<00:03:30.460> of<00:03:30.580> computers<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:31.330> one

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
almost a lot of computers so this one

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.200 
almost a lot of computers so this one
should<00:03:31.570> be<00:03:31.810> optimized<00:03:32.410> really<00:03:33.250> really<00:03:34.000> well

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210
