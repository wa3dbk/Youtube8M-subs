00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:16.550
 The game of style represents I want you 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.919
 very thin nose 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.320
 interstellar infantrymen were to become 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.439
 first-class action movie with role 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.079
 elements of a tactical cooperative and not 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.720
 linear gameplay in the world of the future 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.140
 approximately as half-life, and which 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.440
 crossed out of systems shock and rainbow six yes 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.199
 also in space 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.750
 far away 2005 we first heard about the game 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.079
 with the working title project am. 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.800
 several screenshots with a shiny robot 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.680
 armor on the soldiers and the engine unreal engine 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.649
 in 2008 beautiful gameplay appeared 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.239
 rollers on which the soldiers 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.780
 shootin with someone like a shark 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.780
 dogs 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.030
 at the end of 2012, developers got 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 green light on steam greenlight and immediately 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.030
 tried to raise money on a kickstarter 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.090
 but the attempt failed 150 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.460
 thousand dollars instead of 600 and all 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.930
 returned back to the players since 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.000
 the amount has not been collected in full 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:30.180
 elevator sheets quickstart for a while 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.970
 the team developed the game on their own but 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.259
 In early July, decided to look again at our 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.750
 wallets with you 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.750
 right now anyone can 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.090
 spend 300 rubles in the incentive and get 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.780
 early access to the working version of the project 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.789
 we decided to support independent 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 developers and at the same time took a look at their 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.060
 practice your own game here for now 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.030
 no engine in terms of game moved to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.369
 unity several test levels with 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.190
 demonstration of graphic technology and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.569
 small trump up this trump 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.179
 quite working multiplayer network mode 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.730
 too far from complete but has 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.400
 a certain charm no leadership 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.400
 before the fight there is no therefore every player 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.040
 chooses tactics on their own and battle 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.500
 come out quite original here let's say 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.000
 man first entered the game and not 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.710
 having sorted out on the run shoots at his 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.650
 to top the picture on levels 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.420
 lighting is constantly changing 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.720
 sunny day suddenly gives way to night 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.730
 and opponents abruptly merge with darkness 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.790
 surprise at any moment have the opportunity 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.030
 turn on the flashlight or laser sight on 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.950
 that you will quickly respond thanks to the player with 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.070
 flashlight can be clearly seen 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.790
 and if he also shines a laser 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.960
 it can be from the other end of the card 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.720
 separate button allows you to shoot 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.630
 stupid helmet that closes itself 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.380
 part of the screen is not entirely clear which one 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.900
 that makes sense 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.900
 but both helmet and becomes already audible 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.510
 whole multiplayer brings the sea 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.510
 positive emotions in many ways 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.730
 due to its incomplete release 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.550
 there will surely add variety to 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.310
 voice set many trunks soundtrack 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.990
 solo campaign but everything else 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.360
 what the developers promise 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.720
 but is it worth buying a game today 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.480
 to support the team and not to shoot 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.120
 completed multiplayer issue is open and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.970
 because if we have everything that we have done for 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.960
 eight years how much more time will it take 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.960
 completion 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.700
 he
