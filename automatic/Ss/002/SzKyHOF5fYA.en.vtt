00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.980
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.910
 new video with the microsoft lumia 535 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.299
 with windows phone 8.1 ddr2 so the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.010
 update 2 which happened yesterday 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.720
 was basically distributed 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.130
 Yesterday I tried the windows 10 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 to install on this smartphone 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
 but through all the problems, etc has 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.150
 I'm delayed this morning 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.090
 the update then you have to do it 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.270
 just here this windows insider app 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.360
 in the windows store download and there can 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.460
 you unlock yourself here for the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.040
 for the almost ring where then stop 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.140
 Updates do not really come 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.710
 directly as update should come for 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.660
 normal user special for test users 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.860
 and that worked out yesterday 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.629
 after the first update I thought 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.719
 yes well now installed windows 10 but 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.030
 it has been - 10 windows 8.1 updates 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.710
 which one of the some installed 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.969
 changes brings you actually has 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.100
 no longer counting on this 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.549
 update still for windows phone 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.290
 8.1 devices will be published because with 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.390
 windows 10 is already in the summer the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.520
 Next version then clearly 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.450
 more innovations brings in principle 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.490
 Let us now here in this 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 video times so the new function 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.560
 watch or 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 the change compared to windows 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.509
 phone 8.1 and that are quite a few 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.430
 demian noticed on the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.659
 homescreen you see no first 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 different continue this 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.680
 transparent background image at the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 with some tiles 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.439
 but if you scroll all the way down 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.369
 For example , you have to stand here now 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.130
 all apps so all the apps you put on it 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 has that before the son was free 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 with circled case because knew 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.140
 probably also the normal users 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.100
 or 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.110
 the beginners and not something with it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.390
 to start is clicked on it now 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.009
 then all apps are displayed and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.479
 he has basically then nothing 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.250
 changed by the sorting and so on 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.700
 everything stayed as it was 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.380
 should then be the next point of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.729
 really very good because I think so too 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.829
 very good you hopefully 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.049
 windows 10 will also install is under 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.240
 Setting the grouping fire department 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.530
 is so everything just that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.110
 was listed with each other so 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.490
 just any functions that 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.650
 sometimes not heard together 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.360
 then arranged one below the other now 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.950
 you finally get a grouping here 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.710
 example networks and perplexed were halt 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.210
 really only the function has how one 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.770
 she knows, for example, data 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.750
 optimization if, for example, the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 and the cinema can consume in the month 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.040
 then with his mobile sim card can 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.510
 you just stop here as normal 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.380
 otherwise just stuff like that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.209
 Personalization and then it is here 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.730
 the indication of the things then 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.620
 come over and you get stop 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.970
 better overview what was one example 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.070
 personalization remains the Date 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.650
 jesus stand until you really all 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.090
 personalization settings 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.800
 the passage is then coming 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.440
 system time language input of the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.230
 privacy update security extras 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.000
 So it really seems easy overall 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.709
 cleaned up because you better the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.690
 Overview has where the individual 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.810
 could be functions and that one 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.430
 now would not have to scroll when like 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.580
 at the windows phone 8.1 before to the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.540
 innovation introduced here 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.350
 is also included for example 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.030
 data protection 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.320
 the app authority now you can 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.920
 example the calendar will be here 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.739
 below 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.600
 then all the apps are listed 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.190
 just access the calendar 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.110
 now this is nothing I was here in the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.519
 I have a new device without big 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.430
 attitude but important for example 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.920
 if you have contacts and such 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.820
 facebook or whats app has installed 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.380
 then you can single those apps 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.239
 withdraw eligibility 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.760
 So it can then, for example, no 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.459
 apps more on this windows on this 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.500
 contacts in windows phone 8 with 142 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.200
 update to grab that very interesting 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.000
 if the apps then defend against it 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.160
 that they denied access 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.140
 I do not ever again to choose 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.610
 but basically it is important that 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.180
 the privacy in the view 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.090
 is improved further can be seen in 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.700
 the settings now determined 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.230
 Settings easy on the homescreen 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.340
 pack let's take easy 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.350
 what do we take here for example 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.299
 internet release if you then longer 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.100
 then hold on to these attitudes then 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.240
 you can give you the under further point 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.919
 click on home page and then the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.900
 attitude here on the home page 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.580
 that is good if you can 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.030
 quickly to certain settings 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.360
 wants to access frequently principle 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.710
 But this feature is not completely up to it 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.720
 So, if you're here now 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.840
 for example the lifestyle in the size 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.250
 changes to small then just stop 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.550
 still this gear if you are here now 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.449
 six different settings 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.250
 has placed then you just do not know 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.560
 which settings but which is so 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.380
 that works pretty well and 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.220
 you can, for example, with most of it 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.770
 quite with the text stop see which 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.669
 settings are meant 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.949
 maybe it would be wise 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.010
 if the symbols could change or 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.150
 other but that is yes I do not know 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.330
 how far the development of windows 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.070
 phone 801 update 2 is if there maybe 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.169
 even more to come at first or whether 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.360
 you really the one the developments 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.830
 Leave and then really stop 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.889
 Windows 10 works the way it does 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.810
 was meant 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.240
 still has microsoft with the windows 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.889
 phone 8 and 1 update 2 the support 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.030
 so introduced for bluetooth keyboard 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.810
 you can then for example a 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.830
 bluetooth keyboard enter outlook the 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.720
 Write mails with the bluetooth 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.910
 keyboard is certainly not wrong 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.110
 especially if you really have a lot now 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.849
 So if you really write it now 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.099
 It is up to you to decide for yourself 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.330
 there is further optimization in the 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.210
 Bluetooth connection when listening to music 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.860
 transfers time as this typical 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.570
 Do not give interruption like it does 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.370
 for example in the car the case is when 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.680
 one drives by car then I have that 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.110
 with my made 7 for example that if 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.520
 i play music at amazon i 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.800
 bought on amazon offline on the 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.389
 mobile phone via bluetooth then comes stop 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.430
 such a small interruption that should 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.169
 in this case, no longer be there 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.940
 otherwise no functions 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.220
 added and continues to be 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.210
 the multitouch is present in the bug so 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.810
 if I finger here with two 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:22.289
 go on and approach is then 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.640
 it just can not be that this yes that 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.580
 age does not work so the 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.729
 touchscreen 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.330
 Buck is still with the young 535 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.060
 available 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.599
 in this windows phone 8.1 update 2 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.199
 version 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:39.189
 that was the overview of the windows update 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:41.050
 two updates on the lumia 535 now 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.460
 I will then count windows because that 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.669
 is also available for download if you want 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.740
 here this is almost low so if 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.650
 one the windows phone 8 and as up de 2 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.900
 has installed again in the 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.669
 windows insider would have again 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.039
 unlock and then will only be in the 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.449
 Settings the windows 10 update 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:03.250
 displayed when you go down here then 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.650
 as this one, this multi touch pack 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.759
 is really partially really annoying so 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.250
 First I show you that we are here 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:12.190
 really have windows phone 8 and 1 2 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:21.490
 is the largest version remaining and if 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:23.080
 So we now so the times 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.759
 So I mean this multi touch pack 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.190
 is really extremely annoying so why 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:32.969
 the display ads are still moving here 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:36.789
 I do not know so this is extreme here 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:38.409
 annoying and here it is already 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:40.360
 the windows ten technicians beating for 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:42.099
 I'm ready for what I'm here now 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.810
 will install right after the video 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:45.279
 and then I can relax 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.050
 then of course there is in 

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:49.300
 shortly a second video if the mobile phone 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.339
 no longer around is crazy that was the 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.620
 impression of windows phone 8.1 update2 

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:55.419
 unfortunately with some bugs but with 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.110
