00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
always kind of straight line with it and

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.990 
always kind of straight line with it and
this<00:04:33.270> will<00:04:33.510> probably<00:04:33.750> be<00:04:34.110> your<00:04:34.260> back<00:04:34.880> cuz<00:04:35.880> the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
that then you could trace and cut

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.440 
that then you could trace and cut
another<00:04:44.340> piece<00:04:44.580> if<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:44.910> want<00:04:45.380> what<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.710> will<00:04:47.070> do

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
you could I'm sure you can find the

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:25.940 
you could I'm sure you can find the
measurements<00:05:16.290> online<00:05:16.740> or<00:05:16.980> something<00:05:24.950> you're

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
measurements online or something you're

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.350 
measurements online or something you're
gonna<00:05:26.100> want<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.460> make<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.760> bottom<00:05:27.120> piece<00:05:27.330> a

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
gonna want to make the bottom piece a

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.110 
gonna want to make the bottom piece a
little<00:05:27.780> bit<00:05:27.870> smaller<00:05:28.230> so<00:05:28.560> maybe<00:05:29.400> trace<00:05:29.790> this

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
little bit smaller so maybe trace this

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.430 
little bit smaller so maybe trace this
out<00:05:30.530> three<00:05:31.530> times<00:05:32.000> this<00:05:33.000> piece<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.419> cut<00:05:33.720> then

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
out three times this piece you cut then

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.350 
out three times this piece you cut then
cut<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.800> bottom<00:05:35.160> piece<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.580> you<00:05:35.760> have<00:05:35.940> in

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
half because you're vetoes not that

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.740 
half because you're vetoes not that
thick<00:05:39.690> this<00:05:40.530> one<00:05:40.590> as<00:05:40.890> thick<00:05:41.100> as<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.490> oh<00:05:41.750> wait

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
thick this one as thick as this oh wait

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.940 
thick this one as thick as this oh wait
about<00:05:43.020> half<00:05:43.140> that

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
about half that

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.659 
about half that
not<00:05:44.820> even<00:05:45.090> half<00:05:45.300> of<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:45.480> but<00:05:46.250> you<00:05:47.250> guys<00:05:47.430> get

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
not even half of that but you guys get

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.300 
not even half of that but you guys get
what<00:05:47.790> I<00:05:47.820> mean<00:05:47.910> so

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.360 

you're<00:05:52.150> gonna<00:05:52.270> trace<00:05:52.930> your<00:05:53.320> visa<00:05:53.560> I<00:05:53.980> mean<00:05:54.160> here

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
you're gonna trace your visa I mean here

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.160 
you're gonna trace your visa I mean here
cut<00:05:55.180> out<00:05:56.970> so<00:05:57.970> and<00:05:58.240> I<00:05:58.330> think<00:05:58.389> this<00:05:58.780> is<00:05:58.930> one<00:05:59.139> of

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
cut out so and I think this is one of

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.930 
cut out so and I think this is one of
