00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.759
 Good day, dear fishermen 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.969
 I want in this video in more detail 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:14.530
 talk about fishing tackle on 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:18.869
 foam means the most important thing 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.939
 I want to start this fishing line main and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.340
 The main sticky for this very Nastya 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:30.730
 on which this entire gear is attached 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.430
 diameter is 1 millimeter but you can do 08 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:39.989
 millimeter in order for it to be more 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 durable because on it is always more 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 increased friction sorts 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.160
 movements of the sinker there this one 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.850
 spring i'm all here these basics to she herself 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.070
 constantly moving in and out of it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.940
 when you impose porridge there therefore 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.320
 she wears increased then fishing line 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.420
 main fishing line which are coiled 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.900
 coils are undesirable to use for 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.320
 this goal because it is more subtle but 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.659
 no one is worth 0-4 but this one is the line 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.689
 me one millimeter is like working 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.090
 You are the main horse from Alaska 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:23.110
 should be better protected 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.640
 here are all the sizes here what's on this one 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.530
 picture shown visible means 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.590
 take a closer look separate 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.720
 I want to focus on rubber 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.530
 compensators here these nipple gum 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:47.729
 which are needed to soften the blow 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.729
 so as not to break the fishing line knots 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.390
 means tied on a ring or on 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.710
 swivels on the other side of this line 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:04.630
 which means connects it with the main 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:08.379
 fishing line for which goes well 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.180
 she also protects the load 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:15.400
 from having a hole 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.640
 discontent right here means you can see how 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.319
 This bar is arranged on which hook 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.060
 attached here in general, everything is very simple 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.480
 just what was better seen now 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:36.360
 does this hook and fishing line mean 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:40.959
 connect means hook and barbell size 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.599
 this is understandable and the carts were punished there 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.610
 somewhere around half a centimeter is the 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.370
 the main thing here is to catch the end 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.970
 fishing line because it turns out a lot 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.010
 often true enough it turns out so 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.310
 that with hooks and with catching large 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.340
 fish this knot close untied even 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.290
 it is thin pulls here shown 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:09.519
 means how to look on water because 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.940
 they are raised here are these sticks 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.280
 our 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:18.209
 and stand up vertically here more clearly 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.370
 It shows how I mean all this is a schoolboy and 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.390
 how it all moves and something like this 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.060
 length this is a leash or not a leash 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.370
 the main line I call it 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.739
 this is millimeter right here you can see 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.900
 as she swivels connected see 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.909
 five building rubber compensator 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.299
 who misses first strikes 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:44.739
 so as not to break the nodule and secondly 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.989
 then protects in the other direction where 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.739
 him on the metal part of the bar 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:54.189
 hits 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:58.260
 it protects it from damage and 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.260
 good luck to you goodbye
