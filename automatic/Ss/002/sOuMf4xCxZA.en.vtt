00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.269
 well all jtf clan guys are jtf 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 we are back with boys today 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.410
 this new fantastic of air play 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.160
 made of our black silver jack 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.150
 in land battle nine against nine 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.490
 obviously I know if you have already understood the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.279
 born but these are turbines 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.219
 beautiful map of shit though though 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.350
 boys in land war really 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.969
 fantastic because it's the map I think more 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.600
 open the game and then between pescia 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.579
 Meccano assault drone as he did 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 really make disaster 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.899
 the problem is that they are found if 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.579
 he wrote difficult war, however 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.649
 find them not here as you have them 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.960
 obviously found our dear silver 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.370
 October 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.469
 then among other things done my favor in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 comments write him silver with and senate 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.609
 of shit because lately he got caught 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.469
 also the optical fiber 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.300
 I'm really gnawing at a mess 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.489
 because here in padova sleazy than that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.680
 bitch they don't want to put it maybe 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.030
 they will put it there will be 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280
 so even between stews to play then 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.380
 oh well let's leave these alone 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.950
 details, however, write it in 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.890
 comments 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.710
 silver code has followed and le 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.900
 bullshit boys live talking 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.700
 quickly dwarf air or e 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.380
 I'm sure that network is worth a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 other that talks about advanced we have 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.329
 pissed off with the boys he foresaw 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.880
 tried the games week that was held 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.180
 last Saturday and Sunday also Friday 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 for only one state approved after type 2 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.880
 2 hours straight and second guys never is a 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.369
 game that really deserves a lot 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.840
 I will be honest that initially there is not 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.470
 I found it so good at first sight 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.149
 he could n't find me much because of it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 also with the story of the double jump then 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.040
 however with is moving to the right and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.380
 left we do 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.230
 a kind of scarpino just when 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.150
 you will also find you will understand then for 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.040
 these things I could n't find myself 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.650
 but very well we say after the first one 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.210
 minute the first two minutes is really it 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.150
 seemed to me to have played it from a 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.130
 annetto two armchairs are found there 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.810
 really very very good here second 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.940
 we guys deserve so much too 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.130
 precisely because history just double 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.020
 jump you will be much faster in 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.210
 certain movements but that if you want to enter 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.790
 in a building you don't have to be made 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.330
 of the climbs ladder of the cabbage that there 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 they only waste time and therefore 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.450
 I think he really deserves it 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.459
 very much we hope it is worth it 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.950
 to buy this codec that is not 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.600
 the usual heated soup I note 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.390
 I tell you mine is really worth to me 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.150
 so much for the problem is that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.550
 last year I practically told the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.770
 same thing because also my ghost 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.920
 gasperi had inspired me then it seemed 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.190
 even of life that was normal is not 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.830
 as if he were not a veteran here then 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.420
 finding it from my console yes 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.340
 one thing is revealed completely 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.250
 different so I do not imbalance myself and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.760
 I say for me it is a game that is worth hopefully 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.549
 for good that's why precisely if it was a 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.760
 another another flop of the saga of god 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.590
 it would really go down so much and 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.660
 nothing these are my impressions 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.810
 you also have themes if maybe you are 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.459
 been to gamesweek what or others 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.010
 fairs if you've already tried it 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.980
 think if you think why why? 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.510
 precisely I want to know yours now 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.489
 come back a moment on the gameplay because 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.830
 maybe you already have agreements too 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.140
 who cut some of it somewhere 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.420
 and wool cut silver because precisely 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.390
 we want to show the breakfast 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.900
 part where he does so many kills moves 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.049
 vast feuds and the part where the trains me 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.540
 they seem to be found even pure only 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.280
 go to the enemy spawn not 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.400
 in short, we always keep the parts 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.959
 the best were bothering me 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.640
 the obsessive I have already said that among other things 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.280
 he was also playing in groups with others 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.570
 his eight friends because he warns 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.510
 it is played in nine against nine 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.800
 so I thank them not me 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.630
 because they were really very kind and 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.849
 thank you guys too if we 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.700
 we can do these gameplay 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.080
 by the way if you want to add me that 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.760
 I want to do some inter game 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.900
 play off write your id too 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.709
 psn because I just play on ps3 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.800
 unfortunately lately I'm playing it 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.040
 very much because precisely I don't have time 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.590
 that is, they leave even in the fifth year 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.210
 lots of things to do so i'm not 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.470
 all day attached to the play indeed 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.030
 but anyway if you want to maybe help me 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.430
 do a little something when I play when 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.650
 I turn on the play maybe away successes 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.350
 what the fuck you say but we add you and 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.430
 let's do some little parties together 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.740
 no guys the gap is about to 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.190
 finish enjoy the ending because I leave 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.889
 this is more than a drug 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.270

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.100

 ways to keep it active and that we are all 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.160

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.169
 unfortunately we tell you guys there too 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.060
 series of victories that cut us off 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.520
 legs but in short we try to 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.530
