00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.839 
each wannabes is a two hit kill on a
zombie<00:05:34.150> so<00:05:35.080> that's<00:05:35.259> pretty<00:05:35.530> cool<00:05:35.620> now<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.610> have

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
zombie so that's pretty cool now I have

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.850 
zombie so that's pretty cool now I have
learned<00:05:37.419> that<00:05:37.629> some<00:05:37.960> of<00:05:38.110> these<00:05:38.259> can<00:05:38.650> become

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860

learned that some of these can become
one<00:05:39.430> hit<00:05:39.610> kills<00:05:39.879> but<00:05:40.120> you<00:05:40.240> just<00:05:40.419> got<00:05:40.569> to<00:05:40.599> get<00:05:40.750> a

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
one hit kills but you just got to get a

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.390 
one hit kills but you just got to get a
critical<00:05:41.199> on<00:05:41.319> them<00:05:41.530> now<00:05:42.039> it's<00:05:42.219> not<00:05:42.340> a

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
critical on them now it's not a

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.969 
critical on them now it's not a
guaranteed<00:05:43.180> one<00:05:43.870> hit<00:05:44.020> kill<00:05:44.229> even<00:05:44.560> if<00:05:44.770> it's

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
guaranteed one hit kill even if it's

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.980 
guaranteed one hit kill even if it's
critical<00:05:45.400> but<00:05:45.759> I<00:05:45.969> have<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.419> chance<00:05:46.599> of<00:05:46.810> having

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
critical but I have the chance of having

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.709 
critical but I have the chance of having
one<00:05:47.139> hit<00:05:47.469> kill<00:05:47.680> so<00:05:47.919> it's<00:05:48.789> up<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.030> you<00:05:49.300> to<00:05:49.330> go<00:05:49.599> and

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
one hit kill so it's up to you to go and

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.629 
one hit kill so it's up to you to go and
find<00:05:49.960> out<00:05:50.169> which<00:05:50.379> ones<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:51.009> can<00:05:51.159> get<00:05:51.310> one<00:05:51.490> hit

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
find out which ones you can get one hit

find out which ones you can get one hit
kills<00:05:51.849> with<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.210> so<00:05:52.500> that's<00:05:53.500> pretty<00:05:53.740> awesome

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830
