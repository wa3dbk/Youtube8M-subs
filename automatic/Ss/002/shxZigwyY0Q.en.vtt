00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.170
 Greetings to all be where you are today is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.910
 May 31 we are already on the last day 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.100
 May, although it may seem a lie, but 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.670
 time flies by and there I have 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:28.170
 a new yellow fork and here they come 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.250
 that has 1 2 3 4 5 buttons 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.710
 and it's amazing 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.660
 let's go over here 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.200
 here I have 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.230
 1 2 3 buttons on this good orchid that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.120
 that I have it a while ago 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.000
 that was the one I took to pollinate 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.550
 and then 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.430
 in this part where I pollinate that 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.030
 agreement that if there was and still there is a 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.820
 that is half drying because it is already 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.790
 coming out 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.360
 a little button 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.350
 so here I also pollinate but 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.439
 what he has is like a fat little tube 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.330
 and it does not leave flower or anything I do not know about 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.770
 flowers of the fell had two flowers 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.680
 very pretty in pink but I the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.010
 polinices with this one 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.740
 Well I remember that was in April 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.610
 ok let's go up 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 here I have my other orchids that are 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.500
 new 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.220
 those are new 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.220
 a little bit 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.229
 but here they have enough buttons 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.620
 and here is another one that also 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.300
 how do you want to go out 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.370
 it's trying to april 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.930
 and I do not know if you remember 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.600
 when I did 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.570
 the video of pouring water better than 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.190
 see and other this orchid I was going to 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.560
 chop the floral bars 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.890
 and then I regretted the last 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.920
 moment and I said no no no no no and what 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.590
 best thing that could happen was that not value 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.590
 the flower poles because I look 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.180
 is incredible 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.990
 and even there it brings 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.990
 enough buttons 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.760
 and well I'm very happy because it gives 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.860
 result what work one does 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.170
 throwing the fertilizer by throwing the water 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.440
 every fifteen days taking care of the orchids 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.100
 I am very happy indeed that and 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.530
 here I will show you another little thing 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.530
 well look at this hairpin that is here 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.210
 that rent was an ad that I put 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.050
 in the newspaper good not in the newspaper 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.000
 it was an ad that I posted on the internet 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.560
 for anyone who had their 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.930
 Orchids could not care for them 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.870
 so they gave them to me 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.659
 and a lady answered 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.110
 that she's good at the text she wrote 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.970
 she said that she had an orchid but 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.610
 Unfortunately, he no longer had a hand 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.250
 green and I understood what he already meant 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.170
 that is, if you do not have green hands 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.540
 it means that you do not like anything that 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.170
 you want it to have to do with plants etc 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.550
 but you do not get good, that's what 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.840
 is here I chop it and I did all this 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.790
 is the second as they see there 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.230
 that 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.989
 that part of the leaf has already turned yellow 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.450
 and there are leaves that fell and came out 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.219
 those new ones that are there 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.670
 well the plant this plant was very 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:57.980
 Malita when I went to look for a 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.459
 I was actually looking for my friend and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.590
 the lady sent me one floor but 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.010
 the plant was in very bad condition and I 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.810
 What I did was that I planted the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.200
 separate because you were 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.680
 I wanted him to take strength from 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.829
 different 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.109
 from different roots or one root 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.240
 so bad then he will not give me 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.850
 no good flower or any plant 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.760
 good what I did strong I separated it to 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:33.009
 see which of the two took more strength 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.499
 Well, so far 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.139
 that's the new things that have 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:39.419
 stepped out 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.099
 here I have a little more 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.099
 hairpins that I'm going to show you 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:49.080
 here too 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.840
 I have pink orchids 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.289
 here I have the yellow ones that he gave me 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.849
 my friend little thing 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.849
 They're really nice 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.890
 Here I have another one that my friend gave me 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:09.890
 I also had a strong pink color and 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.890
 and casually brings three buttons 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.970
 this is new 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.879
 until it is here 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.589
 let's see if it looks good 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.480
 until this new one is here 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:25.580
 practically 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.920
 because all those buttons came out 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.600
 little bit 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.550
 i also have this 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.470
 that they were it was him 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.470
 falling this part of here he was 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.569
 falling all the flowers 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.270
 but I wait patiently 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.740
 the truth that yes 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.740
 and good in relation 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.990
 this is the obvious inside 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.509
 the inside saw has dried up and has 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.249
 dried and dried and already 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.289
 practically what he has left is 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.900
 those two flowers that are practically 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.750
 dry 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.090
 and they already have a period of time 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.830
 bloom then I put it here in the 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.830
 floor to leave quiet 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.380
 to put your information again 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:18.160
 and then good then 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:23.110
 out there I have my balcony flowers 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.110
 Today it's a sunny day 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:30.219
 I have enough flowers there 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.120
 and well at another time another day then 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:35.830
 I will make another video 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.200
 update or follow my flowers of 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.260
 balcony because at this moment I just wanted to 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.260

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.360

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.590
