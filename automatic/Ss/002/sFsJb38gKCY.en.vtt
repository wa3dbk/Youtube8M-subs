00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
below as well this is like three dollars

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.800 
below as well this is like three dollars
but<00:03:07.919> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.459> find<00:03:08.669> a<00:03:08.700> cracked<00:03:08.970> version<00:03:09.090> it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
but you can find a cracked version it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.119 
but you can find a cracked version it
doesn't<00:03:10.079> work<00:03:10.169> as<00:03:10.319> well<00:03:10.349> though<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.889> has

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
doesn't work as well though it has

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.580 
doesn't work as well though it has
glitches<00:03:11.819> in<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.359> back<00:03:12.540> version<00:03:12.930> but<00:03:13.439> it's

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
glitches in the back version but it's

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.649 
glitches in the back version but it's
called<00:03:13.769> i<00:03:13.950> got<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.639> what<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.239> does<00:03:15.299> this

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
called i got you and what this does this

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.509 
called i got you and what this does this
is<00:03:15.810> really<00:03:16.049> cool<00:03:16.379> although<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:16.889> does<00:03:17.099> drain<00:03:17.489> a

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
is really cool although it does drain a

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.770 
is really cool although it does drain a
lot<00:03:17.669> of<00:03:17.790> battery<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.209> does<00:03:18.449> slow<00:03:18.599> your

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
lot of battery and it does slow your

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.530 
lot of battery and it does slow your
phone<00:03:18.900> down<00:03:19.019> drastically<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.650> it's<00:03:19.799> worth<00:03:20.010> it

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
phone down drastically but it's worth it

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.520 
phone down drastically but it's worth it
essentially<00:03:21.540> what<00:03:21.659> it<00:03:21.750> does<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.109> if<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.349> type

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
essentially what it does is if you type

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.860 
essentially what it does is if you type
in<00:03:22.620> your<00:03:22.709> passcode<00:03:23.129> wrong<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:24.540> takes<00:03:24.750> a

in your passcode wrong it takes a
picture<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.500> person<00:03:25.709> who<00:03:25.919> typed<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.220> in<00:03:26.340> wrong

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
