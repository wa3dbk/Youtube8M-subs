00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
alright guys we are getting ready to cut

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.730 
alright guys we are getting ready to cut
a<00:00:04.620> jig<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.490> help<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.270> place<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.470> blocks

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
a jig to help you place the blocks

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.790 
a jig to help you place the blocks
together<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.429> build<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.760> wheel<00:00:09.590> you'll<00:00:10.590> need

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
together to build the wheel you'll need

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.310 
together to build the wheel you'll need
just<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.190> little<00:00:11.219> scrap<00:00:11.849> block<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.690> lumber<00:00:13.290> from

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
just a little scrap block of lumber from

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.070 
just a little scrap block of lumber from
either<00:00:14.160> anyone<00:00:14.820> by<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.630> come<00:00:15.929> up

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
either anyone by that you can come up

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.560 
either anyone by that you can come up
with<00:00:16.520> or<00:00:17.520> there<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.850> enough<00:00:18.270> left<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
with or there is enough left on the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.700 
with or there is enough left on the
10-foot<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.750> by<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.260> you're<00:00:22.350> making<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
10-foot one by that you're making the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.279 
10-foot one by that you're making the
wheel<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.519> make<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.880> jig<00:00:24.150> as<00:00:24.300> well<00:00:24.510> so

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
wheel out of to make this jig as well so

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.200 
wheel out of to make this jig as well so
you'll<00:00:25.500> need<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.769> take<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.160> piece<00:00:26.430> because

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you'll need to take your piece because

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.359 
you'll need to take your piece because
not<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.810> pieces<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.260> gonna<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.590> cut<00:00:28.800> exactly

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
not all pieces are gonna be cut exactly

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
not all pieces are gonna be cut exactly
the<00:00:29.490> same<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> you're<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.899> need

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the same so you're gonna actually need

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
the same so you're gonna actually need
to<00:00:34.350> measure<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.980> off<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.489> blocks<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to measure this off of blocks that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.770 
to measure this off of blocks that
you've<00:00:36.180> already<00:00:36.360> cut<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> wheel<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
you've already cut out for the wheel and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.470 
you've already cut out for the wheel and
for<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.820> these<00:00:41.820> blocks<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.360> actually

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
for this one these blocks are actually

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660 
for this one these blocks are actually
three<00:00:43.140> inches<00:00:43.530> long<00:00:43.800> instead<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> four<00:00:44.520> inches

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
three inches long instead of four inches

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
three inches long instead of four inches
long<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.480> should<00:00:45.809> help<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:46.110> prove<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
long so that should help me prove the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.840 
long so that should help me prove the
point<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.660> tailored<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.850> actual

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
point that it's tailored to the actual

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.119 
point that it's tailored to the actual
wheel<00:00:51.059> blocks<00:00:51.390> itself<00:00:51.899> right<00:00:52.680> off<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> bat

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
wheel blocks itself right off the bat

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.970 
wheel blocks itself right off the bat
you<00:00:53.579> need<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> measure<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:55.699> far<00:00:57.530> it<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.770> from

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you need to measure how far it is from

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.599 
you need to measure how far it is from
the<00:00:59.280> bottom<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> blocks<00:01:00.300> until<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:02.309> lower

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the bottom of the blocks until the lower

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.200 
the bottom of the blocks until the lower
edge<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.300> taper<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.880> one

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
edge of this taper and so on this one

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.130 
edge of this taper and so on this one
we've<00:01:06.750> got<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:08.900> one<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.110> half

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
we've got just about one and a half

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.940 
we've got just about one and a half
inches<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> check<00:01:13.710> your

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
inches and so you want to check your

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
inches and so you want to check your
other<00:01:14.070> blocks<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:15.000> they're<00:01:15.180> all<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.540> one

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
other blocks but they're all about one

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.920 
other blocks but they're all about one
and<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> half<00:01:16.259> inches<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.240> means<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and a half inches and so that means that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.080 
and a half inches and so that means that
you're<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.200> need<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.590> take<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.909> half

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you're gonna need to take one and a half

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.039 
you're gonna need to take one and a half
inches<00:01:24.600> off<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.890> block<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.930> make<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
inches off of this block to make the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.910 
inches off of this block to make the
template<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.909> mark<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.150> off<00:01:30.180> along<00:01:31.110> one

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
template so you mark that off along one

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.789 
template so you mark that off along one
and<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> half<00:01:32.250> inches<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.500> next

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and a half inches and then your next

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.120 
and a half inches and then your next
measurement<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.670> need<00:01:36.439> is<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.710> need<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> see

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
measurement you need is you need to see

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.730 
measurement you need is you need to see
how<00:01:38.369> long<00:01:38.729> exactly<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.810> blocks<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
how long exactly the blocks are and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.370 
how long exactly the blocks are and
you'll<00:01:40.890> want<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> check<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.600> them<00:01:42.780> but

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you'll want to check all of them but

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.859 
you'll want to check all of them but
these<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.399> right<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.180> about<00:01:45.479> three

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
these are all right at about three

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
these are all right at about three
inches<00:01:46.310> now<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
inches now what you're going to want to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
inches now what you're going to want to
do<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.780> measurement<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:50.159> going

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
do with that measurement is you're going

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
do with that measurement is you're going
to<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> mark<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.090> off<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.570> well<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to want to mark it off as well and the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.060 
to want to mark it off as well and the
trick<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.820> need<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> take<00:01:57.299> off<00:01:58.070> just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
trick is there you need to take off just

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.330 
trick is there you need to take off just
about<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.909> eighth<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.390> an<00:02:00.509> inch<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.070> you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
about an eighth of an inch so that you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.420 
about an eighth of an inch so that you
can<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:03.450> room<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.259> both<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.710> corners<00:02:04.979> of

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
can have room for both of the corners of

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.309 
can have room for both of the corners of
the<00:02:06.000> other<00:02:06.990> two<00:02:07.350> blocks<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.920> overlap<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.319> so

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the other two blocks to overlap but so

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.710 
the other two blocks to overlap but so
these<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.920> three<00:02:11.160> inches<00:02:11.900> we<00:02:12.900> want

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
these are at three inches we want

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.230 
these are at three inches we want
you<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:14.050> 2<00:02:14.110> inches<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:14.980> 7/8<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.760> should

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
you know 2 inches in 7/8 and that should

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.770 
you know 2 inches in 7/8 and that should
help<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.780> get<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.320> block<00:02:21.300> cut<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.630> right

inches<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.510> 7/8<00:02:29.050> wide<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:30.940> marked<00:02:31.360> off

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
inches and 7/8 wide and then marked off

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.230 
inches and 7/8 wide and then marked off
at<00:02:32.050> an<00:02:32.350> inch<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.890> half<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:35.230> way<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:36.520> go<00:02:37.060> in

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
at an inch and a half this way you go in

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.750 
at an inch and a half this way you go in
here<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.260> wanna<00:02:38.470> mark<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:39.040> 30<00:02:39.520> inch

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
here and you wanna mark a 30 inch

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.110 
here and you wanna mark a 30 inch
diagonal<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:42.160> angle<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.820> have

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
diagonal and this angle that I have

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.410 
diagonal and this angle that I have
right<00:02:43.720> here<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.200> actually<00:02:44.680> 30<00:02:44.950> exactly<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.390> I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
right here is actually 30 exactly so I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.080 
right here is actually 30 exactly so I
would<00:02:46.720> hold<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.560> then<00:02:48.130> I'd<00:02:48.280> mark<00:02:48.700> here

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
would hold this and then I'd mark here

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.230 
would hold this and then I'd mark here
on<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.420> side<00:02:49.720> I'd<00:02:50.440> flip<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.160> over<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.790> I

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
on this side I'd flip it over and I

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.340 
on this side I'd flip it over and I
would<00:02:52.450> mark<00:02:52.750> here<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.730> side<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.959> that

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
would mark here on this side and that

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.250 
would mark here on this side and that
would<00:02:56.530> give<00:02:56.770> me<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> trapezoid<00:02:57.820> that<00:02:58.260> perfectly

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
would give me a trapezoid that perfectly

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.860 
would give me a trapezoid that perfectly
makes<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.890> jig<00:03:00.160> for<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.550> wheel<00:03:00.820> so<00:03:01.690> we're

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
makes the jig for this wheel so we're

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.510 
makes the jig for this wheel so we're
gonna<00:03:01.990> cut<00:03:02.260> out<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:02.530> trapezoid<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.400> then

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
gonna cut out this trapezoid and then

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.190 
gonna cut out this trapezoid and then
we're<00:03:03.610> gonna<00:03:03.700> come<00:03:04.030> back<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.630> show<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.930> how

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
all right guys here we are I've cut out

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.620 
all right guys here we are I've cut out
my<00:03:13.120> jig<00:03:13.360> piece<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.680> way<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.270> match<00:03:16.270> it<00:03:16.300> up

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
my jig piece and the way you match it up

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.130 
my jig piece and the way you match it up
to<00:03:16.780> make<00:03:16.959> sure<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.530> works<00:03:17.739> okay<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.959> go

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
to make sure it works okay is you go

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.080 
to make sure it works okay is you go
ahead<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.190> see<00:03:21.489> if<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.489> same<00:03:24.790> with

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
ahead and you see if it is the same with

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.220 
ahead and you see if it is the same with
top<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.720> bottom<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:26.550> one<00:03:27.550> of<00:03:27.580> these<00:03:27.760> pieces<00:03:28.230> at

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
top to bottom as one of these pieces at

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.500 
top to bottom as one of these pieces at
the<00:03:29.410> bottom<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.800> their<00:03:29.980> taper<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.580> this<00:03:31.330> one

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the bottom of their taper and this one

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.990 
the bottom of their taper and this one
is<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:32.890> really<00:03:33.100> check<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.640> against

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
is and you can really check it against

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.100 
is and you can really check it against
all<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.330> them<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:35.110> make<00:03:35.320> sure<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:36.989> you're<00:03:37.989> not

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
having a problem with one piece being

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.870 
having a problem with one piece being
smaller<00:03:42.269> but<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:45.280> what<00:03:45.519> you're<00:03:45.700> looking

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.719 
right with the top of that jig so on
both<00:04:40.300> sides<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:41.110> want<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.889> make<00:04:42.099> sure<00:04:42.129> that

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
both sides you want to make sure that

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.779 
both sides you want to make sure that
the<00:04:42.939> rest<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.449> that<00:04:43.689> ramp<00:04:44.259> is<00:04:45.189> sticking<00:04:45.669> out

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
the rest of that ramp is sticking out

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.450 
the rest of that ramp is sticking out
above<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:46.300> jig<00:04:46.569> if<00:04:47.379> that<00:04:47.620> makes<00:04:47.860> sense

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
above the jig if that makes sense

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.499 
above the jig if that makes sense
so<00:04:49.120> you<00:04:49.210> want<00:04:49.539> to<00:04:49.659> have<00:04:49.840> one<00:04:50.199> line<00:04:51.060> up<00:04:52.060> this

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
so you want to have one line up this

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.779 
so you want to have one line up this
wedge<00:04:52.840> across<00:04:53.499> here<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:53.860> down<00:04:54.099> this<00:04:54.520> wedge

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
wedge across here and down this wedge

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.080 
wedge across here and down this wedge
and<00:04:55.120> once<00:04:55.960> you've<00:04:56.139> got<00:04:56.319> those<00:04:56.560> in<00:04:56.590> place

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
and once you've got those in place

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.450 
and once you've got those in place
you'll<00:04:58.090> lay<00:04:58.330> this<00:04:58.629> block<00:04:58.990> right<00:04:59.349> down<00:05:00.009> on<00:05:00.189> top

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
you'll lay this block right down on top

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.390 
you'll lay this block right down on top
of<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.819> but<00:05:01.120> it'll<00:05:01.330> actually<00:05:01.599> line<00:05:02.319> up<00:05:02.400> the

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
of it but it'll actually line up the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.790 
of it but it'll actually line up the
bottom<00:05:03.669> of<00:05:04.060> this<00:05:04.389> block<00:05:04.840> will<00:05:05.349> line<00:05:05.560> up<00:05:05.590> with

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
bottom of this block will line up with

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.850 
bottom of this block will line up with
the<00:05:06.099> bottom<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.669> that<00:05:07.389> jig<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.169> you'll<00:05:08.650> see

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
the bottom of that jig and you'll see

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.200 
the bottom of that jig and you'll see
that<00:05:09.090> overlaps<00:05:11.189> that<00:05:12.189> is<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.490> exact<00:05:12.909> right

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
that overlaps that is the exact right

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.839 
that overlaps that is the exact right
placement<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.620> if<00:05:15.129> you've<00:05:15.310> put<00:05:15.520> that<00:05:15.550> on

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
placement and if you've put that on

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.490 
placement and if you've put that on
there<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.360> hammer<00:05:16.629> it<00:05:16.750> down<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:17.319> will

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
there and you hammer it down you will

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.709 
there and you hammer it down you will
have<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:18.129> quarter<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.819> wheel<00:05:19.029> done<00:05:19.419> and

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
have a quarter of the wheel done and

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.740 
have a quarter of the wheel done and
this<00:05:20.289> is<00:05:20.469> what<00:05:20.620> you're<00:05:20.740> supposed<00:05:20.889> to<00:05:21.189> do<00:05:21.750> four

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
this is what you're supposed to do four

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.439 
this is what you're supposed to do four
times<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.439> once<00:05:24.039> you've<00:05:24.189> got<00:05:24.430> these<00:05:24.909> three

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
times and once you've got these three

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.519 
times and once you've got these three
sets<00:05:26.430> together<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.999> you<00:05:28.270> have<00:05:28.449> four<00:05:29.050> groups

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
sets together and you have four groups

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.309 
sets together and you have four groups
of<00:05:29.830> these<00:05:30.219> three<00:05:30.520> blocks<00:05:30.839> it's<00:05:31.839> a<00:05:31.930> lot<00:05:32.110> easier

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
of these three blocks it's a lot easier

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.920 
of these three blocks it's a lot easier
to<00:05:32.680> nail<00:05:32.889> your<00:05:33.129> wheel<00:05:33.610> together<00:05:33.879> straight<00:05:34.569> but

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
to nail your wheel together straight but

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.779 
to nail your wheel together straight but
they'll<00:05:35.560> all<00:05:35.740> be<00:05:35.860> at<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.069> right<00:05:36.189> angles<00:05:36.669> to

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
they'll all be at the right angles to

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.839 
they'll all be at the right angles to
begin<00:05:37.150> with<00:05:37.300> anyways<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:38.409> can<00:05:38.589> even<00:05:38.889> use<00:05:39.610> this

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
begin with anyways you can even use this

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.559 
begin with anyways you can even use this
jig<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:41.229> put<00:05:41.409> the<00:05:41.650> four<00:05:41.889> pieces<00:05:42.400> together

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
jig to put the four pieces together

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.139 
jig to put the four pieces together
later<00:05:43.569> on<00:05:43.719> but<00:05:44.259> a<00:05:44.710> lot<00:05:45.370> of<00:05:45.399> people<00:05:45.580> can<00:05:45.879> do<00:05:45.969> that

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
later on but a lot of people can do that

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:49.499 
later on but a lot of people can do that
without<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.569> jig<00:05:46.810> so<00:05:47.110> I<00:05:47.729> hope<00:05:48.729> this<00:05:48.939> helps<00:05:49.330> and

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
without the jig so I hope this helps and

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.829 
without the jig so I hope this helps and
if<00:05:49.599> you<00:05:49.689> have<00:05:49.870> any<00:05:50.020> questions<00:05:50.620> just<00:05:51.389> ask<00:05:52.389> me<00:05:52.719> on

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:52.839 
if you have any questions just ask me on

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:57.120 
if you have any questions just ask me on
that<00:05:53.110> ask<00:05:53.349> me<00:05:53.500> anything<00:05:53.710> thread<00:05:54.129> Thanks
