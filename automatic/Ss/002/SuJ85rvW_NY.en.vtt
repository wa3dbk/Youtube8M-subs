00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:04.489
 So, guys, I'll ask you something. 

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:06.657
 - What the hell am I on my head now? - Bugsy. 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:10.229
 - Why do you call him Bugsy? - Because of those eyes. 

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:12.910
 They would be big for the cow. 

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:15.858
 - Skeeter? - Ségro. 

00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:18.721
 I'm out of work. I have a couple interview in Arizona. 

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:20.943
 - I need you to take care of the kids. - I can handle it. 

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:24.218
 But you have to say Skeeter is great, I'm boring. 

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:26.523
 - Skeeter is great, I'm boring. - You are! 

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:29.690
 - All right, guys. - Tell us a bedtime story. 

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.395
 Okay, let's do it. 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.409
 Once upon a time, the greatest of all heroes ... 

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.437
 ... was Skeeterkus. 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.473
 You can't do this! 

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:47.541
 - And then ... - ... chewing gum started to rain. 

00:00:49.843 --> 00:00:52.548
 Chewing gum began to rain. That's weird. 

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:55.369
 WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW THE STORY ... 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.787
 ... AND NEXT DAY REALLY STAL? 

00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:09.107
 FROM WALT DISNEY PICTURES 

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:12.112
 Last night I told my sister's children a good night's tale and she became. 

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:13.593
 - This is a gold mine. - Yeah. 

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.703
 Maybe he found a way ... 

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:17.476
 A new fairy tale occurred to me. 

00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:18.574
 No! 

00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.813
 ... how to solve your family's problems forever. 

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:24.813
 - How can I thank you? - I'll take a hundred million dollars. 

00:01:25.793 --> 00:01:27.186
 But nobody says ... 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.593
 And then an angry dwarf kickes him. 

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:32.513
 ... how the stories turn out. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.130
 Where's the one hundred million dollars? 

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:36.251
 Those kids control the fairy tales. 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.083
 Daily... 

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:40.926
 ... is a new adventure. 

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:43.936
 Don't you think we should go out of the rain? 

00:01:44.193 --> 00:01:47.208
 What rain? Damn, where did it come from? 

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.204
 I don't know, isn't it amazing? 

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:51.394
 - But it's not over. - What do you mean? 

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:53.705
 Someone throws a fireball at Skeet. 

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:55.763
 Do you want me to start burning? 

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:57.742
 Hořím! 

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:00.813
 Fire and fire! 

00:02:01.216 --> 00:02:03.706
 Somebody's saying a fool, a fool! 

00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:05.134
 ADAM SANDLER 

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.912
 Would like to prepare. Fire resistance spray. 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.755
 Sir, it's a Christmas tree. 

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:13.750
 Sorry. Come on, it doesn't hurt so much. 

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:16.961
 Áááá! You're right, it hurts! 

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:19.806
