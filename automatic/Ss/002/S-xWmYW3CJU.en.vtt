percent<00:00:10.800> extra<00:00:11.519> battery<00:00:12.030> as<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.389> see<00:00:12.780> here

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
percent extra battery as you see here

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.770 
percent extra battery as you see here
and<00:00:13.469> from<00:00:14.370> what<00:00:14.639> I've<00:00:14.790> seen<00:00:14.820> actually<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.690> had

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
and from what I've seen actually you had

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 
and from what I've seen actually you had
fifteen<00:00:16.170> hundred<00:00:16.440> milliamps<00:00:16.710> inside<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.580> this

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
fifteen hundred milliamps inside of this

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.540 
fifteen hundred milliamps inside of this
case<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:19.109> iphone<00:00:19.650> five<00:00:19.949> comes<00:00:19.980> with

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
case and the iphone five comes with

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.370 
case and the iphone five comes with
almost<00:00:21.060> fifteen<00:00:21.779> hundred<00:00:22.109> milliamps

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
almost fifteen hundred milliamps

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.939 
almost fifteen hundred milliamps
built-in<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.600> if<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.930> would<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.320> some<00:00:25.529> after

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
built-in so if we would do some after

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.470 
built-in so if we would do some after
that<00:00:26.189> would<00:00:26.279> mean<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.820> will<00:00:26.970> get<00:00:27.119> 100

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that would mean that you will get 100

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839 
that would mean that you will get 100
extra<00:00:28.140> battery<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:28.710> if<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.460> company<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
extra battery but if the company is

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.580 
extra battery but if the company is
setting<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.300> tips<00:00:30.510> an<00:00:30.630> extra<00:00:30.929> battery<00:00:31.109> then<00:00:31.500> of

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
setting a tips an extra battery then of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.250 
setting a tips an extra battery then of
course<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.579> will<00:00:33.239> listen<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.899> here

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260

is of course the case which has a 15 mm
mm<00:00:48.090> built-in<00:00:48.570> battery<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.640> some

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
mm built-in battery and you do get some

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.450 
mm built-in battery and you do get some
other<00:00:51.210> awesome<00:00:51.660> things<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:52.199> first<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:53.340> do

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
one in and then also you get some quick

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.289 
one in and then also you get some quick
instructions<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.210> will

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
instructions here I don't think we will

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
instructions here I don't think we will
need<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.689> though<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
need that though because this is this is

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
need that though because this is this is
pretty<00:01:29.579> straightforward<00:01:29.909> how<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.869> will

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
pretty straightforward how this will

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.300 
pretty straightforward how this will
work<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.060> want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
work so what we want to do right now is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.499 
work so what we want to do right now is
see<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.579> that's<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.060> mophie<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
see here that's the mophie here so to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.920 
see here that's the mophie here so to
put<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.200> how<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
put this one on how you do it is you

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.980 
put this one on how you do it is you
just<00:01:42.930> take<00:01:43.560> off<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.790> back<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.540> but

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
just take off this little back here but

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
just take off this little back here but
let's<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.409> over<00:01:46.560> some<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.220> design

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
let's just go over some of the design

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.609 
let's just go over some of the design
first<00:01:47.880> first<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.540> an<00:01:48.630> LED<00:01:49.079> indicator

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
first first you have an LED indicator

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.490 
first first you have an LED indicator
here<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.159> four<00:01:50.460> four<00:01:51.270> LEDs<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> have

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
here with four four LEDs here you have

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.810 
here with four four LEDs here you have
bucked<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:53.250> how<00:01:53.340> much<00:01:53.520> battery

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
bucked in here to see how much battery

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
bucked in here to see how much battery
you<00:01:54.180> having<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.600> out<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.899> case<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.380> if

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
you having it's out of this case and if

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the back for the camera and then also we

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.430 
the back for the camera and then also we
do<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.030> Foley<00:02:51.360> be<00:02:51.750> power<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.410> button

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440

and also for the volume up of keys and
also<00:02:56.220> i<00:02:56.280> think<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.490> mute<00:02:56.880> switch<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.370> if<00:02:59.730> we

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
also i think the mute switch so if we

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.730 
also i think the mute switch so if we
want<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.150> put<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:00.420> one<00:03:00.600> on<00:03:00.810> what<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.410> use<00:03:01.530> do
