00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.900 
and today i'll be doing a tutorial on
the<00:00:15.059> rubik's<00:00:15.360> clock<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.670> many<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.820> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
the rubik's clock so many of you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.230 
the rubik's clock so many of you
probably<00:00:18.029> don't<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:19.350> i<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.789> so<00:00:20.789> for

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
probably don't have this but i do so for

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.790 
probably don't have this but i do so for
the<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.689> those<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.050> who<00:00:22.350> want<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.650> know

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the for those of you who want to know

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800 
the for those of you who want to know
how<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.949> solve<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.340> here<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> tutorial<00:00:24.630> for

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
how to solve one here the tutorial for

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.720 
how to solve one here the tutorial for
you<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> basically<00:00:29.130> they're<00:00:29.310> four<00:00:29.519> pegs

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
you so so basically they're four pegs

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.139 
you so so basically they're four pegs
one<00:00:30.090> two<00:00:30.300> three<00:00:30.330> four<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.140> four<00:00:31.710> dials<00:00:32.040> 12<00:00:32.489> 34

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
one two three four and four dials 12 34

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.139 
one two three four and four dials 12 34
always<00:00:33.899> hold<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.160> text<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
always hold it so that the text is you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.650 
always hold it so that the text is you
know<00:00:36.270> upright<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:37.460> Rubik's<00:00:38.460> clock<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.210> then

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
know upright like Rubik's clock and then

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.950 
know upright like Rubik's clock and then
Chinese<00:00:40.410> characters<00:00:40.710> anyways<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.870> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
Chinese characters anyways so what you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.639 
Chinese characters anyways so what you
want<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.320> step<00:00:44.070> by<00:00:44.160> step<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.360> edges<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
want to do step by step is the edges the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.560 
want to do step by step is the edges the
edges<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.070> opposite<00:00:47.520> side<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.030> then

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
edges on the opposite side and then

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.600 
edges on the opposite side and then
corners<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> don't<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
corners and you don't have to do the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.010 
corners and you don't have to do the
forums<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> opposite<00:00:51.360> side<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:51.840> when

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
forums on the opposite side because when

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.630 
forums on the opposite side because when
you<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.440> side<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.890> automatically

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
you do it on one side and automatically

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.790 
you do it on one side and automatically
does<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> other<00:00:54.090> side<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.199> let's<00:00:55.410> start<00:00:55.710> with

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
does the other side so let's start with

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.270 
does the other side so let's start with
a<00:00:55.860> light<00:00:56.070> blue<00:00:56.250> side<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.980> what<00:00:58.980> you're<00:00:59.160> going

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
a light blue side so what you're going

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670 
a light blue side so what you're going
to<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.789> you're<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> match<00:01:00.660> up<00:01:00.690> each

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
to do is you're going to match up each

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.310 
to do is you're going to match up each
edge<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.210> center<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
edge with the center in a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.710 
edge with the center in a
counterclockwise<00:01:04.710> formation<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.150> this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
counterclockwise formation so this

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.899 
counterclockwise formation so this
Center<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> match<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.729> this

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
Center is going to match up with this

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.570 
Center is going to match up with this
and<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.950> then

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and this and this and then that and then

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.300 
and this and this and then that and then
flip<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.790> over<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> again<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.950> match

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
flip it over do it again so to match

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.170 
flip it over do it again so to match
these<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.750> only<00:01:15.990> bring<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:16.890> up

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
these two up you only bring this one up

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.289 
these two up you only bring this one up
and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:19.080> use<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> dial<00:01:19.979> that's<00:01:20.549> Jason

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and then use use the dial that's Jason

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.590 
and then use use the dial that's Jason
to<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to it so like that and then you have to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
to it so like that and then you have to
turn<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.140> much<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.530> need<00:01:25.770> too<00:01:26.369> much

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
turn this as much as we need too much

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
turn this as much as we need too much
stuff<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.380> matched<00:01:28.590> up

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
stuff with this so that is matched up

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.149 
stuff with this so that is matched up
with<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> sink<00:01:29.640> ten<00:01:29.790> o'clock<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.770> then<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
with that sink ten o'clock and then the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.929 
with that sink ten o'clock and then the
next<00:01:32.189> part<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.270> part<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.350> edge

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
next part is this part for this edge

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
next part is this part for this edge
will<00:01:35.939> call<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> edge<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.619> not

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
will call it edge because it's not

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
will call it edge because it's not
really<00:01:38.009> much<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.400> anyways<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.479> dial<00:01:39.720> up

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
really much but anyways that dial up

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.710 
really much but anyways that dial up
it's<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> adjacent<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.340> dial<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.939> match<00:01:42.689> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it's the adjacent the dial and match it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.460 
it's the adjacent the dial and match it
up<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.140> mess<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.350> bring<00:01:46.350> this

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
up with that mess up and then bring this

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.590 
up with that mess up and then bring this
one<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:47.790> matching<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.299> this

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
one up now you're matching up with this

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.630 
one up now you're matching up with this
but<00:01:48.840> actually<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.320> already<00:01:49.619> solved<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.579> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
but actually it's already solved so you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
but actually it's already solved so you
don't<00:01:50.970> need<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:52.020> an<00:01:52.140> example

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
don't need to do that but for an example

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.569 
don't need to do that but for an example
as<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:52.979> only<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.520> three

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
as you can see that only these three

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.940 
as you can see that only these three
edges<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.240> move<00:01:54.420> together<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.560> matches<00:01:55.710> up

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
edges to move together so it matches up

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.039 
edges to move together so it matches up
with<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> last<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
with that and then for the last one you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.490 
with that and then for the last one you
actually<00:01:58.259> bring<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.740> east<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.880> both<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.390> them

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
actually bring up east to both of them

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.020 
actually bring up east to both of them
both<00:02:01.500> left<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.979> then<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.579> match<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.969> with

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
both left and then you match it up with

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.179 
both left and then you match it up with
this<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.259> use<00:02:04.590> either<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.130> or

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this and you can use either this one or

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.440 
this and you can use either this one or
this<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.270> seems<00:02:06.780> more

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
this one but this one seems more

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.479 
this one but this one seems more
you<00:02:08.110> know<00:02:08.259> more<00:02:08.619> convenient<00:02:08.920> for<00:02:09.039> me<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.399> I'll

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
you know more convenient for me so I'll

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.869 
you know more convenient for me so I'll
use<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.720> those<00:02:10.989> two<00:02:11.140> are<00:02:11.200> matched<00:02:11.410> up

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
use that so those two are matched up

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.550 
use that so those two are matched up
then<00:02:12.879> what<00:02:13.060> you're<00:02:13.209> supposed<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.480> do<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.900> bring

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
then what you're supposed to do is bring

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.110 
then what you're supposed to do is bring
all<00:02:14.800> four<00:02:15.069> up<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:16.180> match<00:02:16.360> them<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.629> 12<00:02:17.019> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
all four up and to match them to 12 and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.990 
all four up and to match them to 12 and
now<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.290> slip<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.620> over<00:02:20.709> do<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.459> again<00:02:21.670> so

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
now you just slip it over do it again so

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.110 
now you just slip it over do it again so
let's<00:02:22.510> do<00:02:22.599> this<00:02:22.660> quickly<00:02:22.989> this<00:02:23.950> one<00:02:24.130> ouch<00:02:24.880> it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
let's do this quickly this one ouch it

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.440 
let's do this quickly this one ouch it
up<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:26.140> one<00:02:26.489> bring<00:02:27.489> this<00:02:27.640> one<00:02:27.790> up<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:28.120> jump

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
up this one bring this one up I jump

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.740 
up this one bring this one up I jump
with<00:02:28.569> this<00:02:28.720> one<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:30.459> one<00:02:30.700> matched<00:02:31.180> up<00:02:31.420> with

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
with this one this one matched up with

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.559 
with this one this one matched up with
the<00:02:32.019> bottom<00:02:32.319> one<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:34.060> one<00:02:34.299> is<00:02:34.330> already

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
the bottom one this one is already

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.960 
the bottom one this one is already
matched<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.650> one<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.340> then<00:02:36.640> bring

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
matched up with this one and then bring

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.119 
matched up with this one and then bring
it<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.180> 12<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.629> now<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.379> have<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.590> do<00:02:38.709> corners

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
it to 12 and now we have to do corners

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.289 
it to 12 and now we have to do corners
so<00:02:39.549> corners<00:02:39.940> are<00:02:40.120> relatively<00:02:40.599> easy<00:02:42.209> when<00:02:43.209> you

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
so corners are relatively easy when you

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.789 
so corners are relatively easy when you
do<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.569> one<00:02:43.690> side<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.170> going<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.380> do<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.680> on

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
do it on one side it's going to do it on

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.470 
do it on one side it's going to do it on
the<00:02:44.890> other<00:02:44.920> side<00:02:45.220> automatically<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.209> don't

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
the other side automatically so don't

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.839 
the other side automatically so don't
worry<00:02:46.540> about<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.739> what<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.190> do<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.519> bring

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
worry about that so what you do is bring

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.650 
worry about that so what you do is bring
all<00:02:49.090> four<00:02:49.420> up<00:02:49.630> ok<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.709> then<00:02:51.480> depending<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.599> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
all four up ok and then depending on the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.839 
all four up ok and then depending on the
corner<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.019> want<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.260> do<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.890> Orient's

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
corner you want to do like Orient's

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.120 
corner you want to do like Orient's
correctly<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.870> will<00:02:56.019> need<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.530> bring<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.950> peg

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
correctly you will need to bring the peg

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.770 
correctly you will need to bring the peg
down<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.489> if<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.670> wanted<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.420> corner

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
down so if you wanted to do this corner

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.900 
down so if you wanted to do this corner
I<00:02:58.959> bring<00:02:59.410> this<00:02:59.590> peg<00:02:59.829> down<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.579> want<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.849> do

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
I bring this peg down if I want to do

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.580 
I bring this peg down if I want to do
this<00:03:01.120> corner<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.569> bring<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:01.900> pic<00:03:02.140> down<00:03:02.349> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
this corner I bring this pic down and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.900 
this corner I bring this pic down and
always<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.970> have<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.569> move<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.079> top<00:03:05.560> down<00:03:05.910> so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
always you have to move a top down so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.740 
always you have to move a top down so
that's<00:03:07.150> alright<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:09.370> tricky<00:03:09.819> part<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.150> not

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
that's alright but a tricky part is not

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.960 
that's alright but a tricky part is not
really<00:03:10.989> tricky<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.560> when<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.280> move<00:03:12.459> this

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
really tricky but when you move this

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.430 
really tricky but when you move this
dial<00:03:13.299> down<00:03:13.480> you're<00:03:13.690> not<00:03:13.810> allowed<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.019> use<00:03:14.260> this

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
dial down you're not allowed to use this

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.410 
dial down you're not allowed to use this
dial<00:03:14.880> but<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.000> can<00:03:16.299> use<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:16.780> dial<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:19.239> let's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
dial but you can use this dial so let's

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.240 
dial but you can use this dial so let's
start<00:03:19.630> with<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:19.930> corner<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.980> I'm<00:03:21.040> going<00:03:21.220> to

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
start with this corner so I'm going to

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.830 
start with this corner so I'm going to
move<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.670> one<00:03:21.880> down<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.269> I'm<00:03:22.480> going<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.690> move

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
move this one down and I'm going to move

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.800 
move this one down and I'm going to move
this<00:03:23.109> dial<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:24.220> one<00:03:24.430> over<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.600> let's

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
this dial this one over here so let's

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.410 
this dial this one over here so let's
just<00:03:26.019> match<00:03:26.769> them<00:03:26.980> up<00:03:27.130> sometimes<00:03:27.910> hard<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.180> do

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
just match them up sometimes hard to do

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.490 
just match them up sometimes hard to do
because<00:03:29.040> mine<00:03:30.040> isn't<00:03:30.280> really<00:03:30.730> lubed<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:32.380> it's

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
because mine isn't really lubed so it's

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.979 
because mine isn't really lubed so it's
pretty<00:03:32.620> bad<00:03:32.859> but<00:03:33.310> that's<00:03:33.489> ok<00:03:33.670> match<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:34.840> up

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
pretty bad but that's ok match that up

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.559 
pretty bad but that's ok match that up
bring<00:03:35.560> all<00:03:35.650> four<00:03:35.859> up<00:03:36.010> again<00:03:36.340> we<00:03:37.150> want<00:03:37.329> to<00:03:37.420> match
