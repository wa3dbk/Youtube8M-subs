00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:12.560 

I<00:00:09.830> want<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.920> pull<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.309> light<00:00:11.639> down<00:00:12.240> behind

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
I want to pull this light down behind

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.270 
I want to pull this light down behind
this<00:00:12.960> figure<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.500> I'm<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.769> clean<00:00:14.070> out

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
this figure and I'm going to clean out

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.800 
this figure and I'm going to clean out
this<00:00:14.639> area<00:00:15.000> right<00:00:15.300> here<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:17.360> take<00:00:18.360> it<00:00:18.419> out

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
this area right here and take it out

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.630 
this area right here and take it out
back<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.590> white<00:00:19.860> paper<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.340> reason

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
back to the white paper and the reason

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
back to the white paper and the reason
for<00:00:23.759> doing<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.149> is<00:00:24.360> from<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.899> from<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
for doing that is from it from a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.620 
for doing that is from it from a
structural<00:00:26.099> point<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> view<00:00:26.579> what<00:00:27.180> that'll<00:00:27.480> do

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
structural point of view what that'll do

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
structural point of view what that'll do
that'll<00:00:27.869> that'll<00:00:28.079> open<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.739> shape<00:00:29.040> up<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that'll that'll open that shape up and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.670 
that'll that'll open that shape up and
turn<00:00:29.730> bring<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.899> lock<00:00:31.079> it<00:00:31.259> in<00:00:31.410> around

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
turn bring it in and lock it in around

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.650 
turn bring it in and lock it in around
there<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> same<00:00:32.790> time<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.270> notice<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
there at the same time now notice that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.799 
there at the same time now notice that
this<00:00:34.140> whole<00:00:34.350> light<00:00:34.649> area<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> being<00:00:36.239> pretty

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
this whole light area is being pretty

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.709 
this whole light area is being pretty
much<00:00:36.989> kept<00:00:37.289> in<00:00:37.469> position<00:00:38.039> on<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.210> side<00:00:39.449> of<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
much kept in position on one side of the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.360 
much kept in position on one side of the
page<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.289> I<00:00:40.350> would<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.679> to<00:00:40.859> just<00:00:41.070> sort<00:00:41.280> of

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
page and I would like to just sort of

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.279 
page and I would like to just sort of
introduce<00:00:42.179> another<00:00:42.539> part<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.199> I'm

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
introduce another part of it and I'm

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.419 
introduce another part of it and I'm
gonna<00:00:43.469> remember<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.859> talked<00:00:44.070> about<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:44.429 
gonna remember we talked about the

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:45.979 
gonna remember we talked about the
teapot<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.969> that's<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.929> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
teapot and that's what I'm going to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
teapot and that's what I'm going to
introduce<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.859> I'm<00:00:46.949> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.100> draw<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
introduce here and I'm going to draw it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
introduce here and I'm going to draw it
in<00:00:47.579> first<00:00:48.379> right<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.339> and<00:00:54.679> we<00:00:55.679> have<00:00:55.859> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
in first right about here and we have a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.329 
in first right about here and we have a
teapot<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.749> would<00:00:58.019> be<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.440> probably<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
teapot here that would be a probably a

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.220 
teapot here that would be a probably a
very<00:00:59.640> interesting<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.420> shape<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.079> work

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
very interesting little shape to work

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.299 
very interesting little shape to work
with<00:01:01.499> and<00:01:01.679> when<00:01:01.769> you're<00:01:01.890> working<00:01:02.069> with

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
with and when you're working with

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.660 
with and when you're working with
something<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.909> a<00:01:02.940> teapot<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:04.670> probably

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
something like a teapot it probably

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330 
something like a teapot it probably
wouldn't<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.360> much<00:01:06.829> advantage<00:01:07.829> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.159> did

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
wouldn't do to much advantage to be did

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
wouldn't do to much advantage to be did
this<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:09.270> probably<00:01:09.630> would<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:09.990> more

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
this it probably would be do more

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
this it probably would be do more
advantage<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> make<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> teapot<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.759> you<00:01:11.850> did

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
advantage to make a teapot if you did

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
advantage to make a teapot if you did
something<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.380> that's<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:14.009> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
something like that so that's kind of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.499 
something like that so that's kind of
and<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:14.700> asking<00:01:15.030> myself<00:01:15.149> about<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and so I'm asking myself about a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.179 
and so I'm asking myself about a
question<00:01:15.750> which<00:01:16.200> way<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.560> point<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
question which way would I point it and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.120 
question which way would I point it and
and<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.210> think<00:01:18.450> because<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.259> spout<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.829> kind

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and I think because the spout has a kind

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.550 
and I think because the spout has a kind
of<00:01:20.159> Aero<00:01:20.460> quality<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.479> would<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.750> defeating<00:01:22.350> in

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
of Aero quality it would be defeating in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
of Aero quality it would be defeating in
a<00:01:22.799> sense<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.369> pushing<00:01:23.909> off<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> page

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
a sense to have it pushing off the page

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.050 
a sense to have it pushing off the page
as<00:01:24.780> opposed<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> pointing<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> inward<00:01:26.909> Lee

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
as opposed to pointing it inward Lee

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330 
as opposed to pointing it inward Lee
toward<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> inwardness<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> page<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
toward the inwardness of the page so

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
toward the inwardness of the page so
what<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:30.240> going

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
what I'm going to do here is I'm going

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.779 
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to<00:01:30.450> use<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.780> logic<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:32.520> way<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
to use that logic and the way this

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.969 
to use that logic and the way this
teapot<00:01:33.360> happens<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.079> constructed<00:01:34.770> it's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
teapot happens to be constructed it's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
teapot happens to be constructed it's
basically<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.820> spear<00:01:37.520> right<00:01:38.520> through<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
basically a spear right through here and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.539 
basically a spear right through here and
on<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.289> pose<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.799> see<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
on you pose you see you can do this

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.450 
on you pose you see you can do this
really<00:01:41.850> very<00:01:42.149> simply<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.560> almost<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.280> an

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
really very simply and and almost as an

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.459 
really very simply and and almost as an
afterthought<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.299> nevertheless<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.350> you

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
afterthought but nevertheless it if you

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.170 
afterthought but nevertheless it if you
see<00:01:46.649> I've<00:01:46.770> immediately<00:01:47.670> set<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:47.909> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
see I've immediately set up that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:02:01.980 
see I've immediately set up that
position<00:01:48.450> for

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.760 

now<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> long<00:02:03.650> time<00:02:03.950> ago<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.220> learned<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.530> is

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
now a long time ago I learned that it is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.520 
now a long time ago I learned that it is
not<00:02:07.040> always<00:02:07.490> necessary<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.210> have<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.050> teapot

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
not always necessary to have the teapot

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.040 
not always necessary to have the teapot
logically<00:02:10.100> sitting<00:02:10.910> on<00:02:11.030> their<00:02:11.210> something<00:02:11.390> but

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
logically sitting on their something but

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.170 
logically sitting on their something but
you<00:02:12.410> can<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.220> don't<00:02:13.520> have<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.940> but<00:02:14.150> you

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
a table I'm going to paint just a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.100 
a table I'm going to paint just a
gestural<00:02:22.850> mark<00:02:23.240> then<00:02:23.660> I'm<00:02:23.720> going<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.930> load

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
gestural mark then I'm going to load

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.810 
gestural mark then I'm going to load
this<00:02:24.320> up<00:02:24.530> with<00:02:24.590> paint<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.250> I'm<00:02:25.400> gonna<00:02:25.490> see<00:02:25.730> if

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
this up with paint and I'm gonna see if

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.940 
this up with paint and I'm gonna see if
I<00:02:25.910> can<00:02:26.090> drag<00:02:26.450> something<00:02:26.990> like<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> credit<00:02:27.710> card

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
I can drag something like a credit card

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.870 
I can drag something like a credit card
through<00:02:28.190> there<00:02:30.130> woah<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.550> was<00:02:31.580> kind<00:02:31.850> of

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
through there woah that was kind of

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.030 
through there woah that was kind of
interesting<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.510> got<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> nice<00:02:32.870> dot<00:02:33.230> out<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.560> it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.860 

what<00:02:37.040> I'm<00:02:37.130> looking<00:02:37.430> for<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.820> just<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.240> gestural

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
what I'm looking for is just a gestural

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.020 
what I'm looking for is just a gestural
mark<00:02:39.230> for<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.770> table<00:02:40.130> there's<00:02:40.850> some

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
mark for the table there's some

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.370 
mark for the table there's some
indication<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.630> it's<00:02:41.900> sitting<00:02:42.230> on

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
indication that it's sitting on

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.830 
indication that it's sitting on
something<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.000> same<00:02:44.209> way<00:02:44.450> if<00:02:44.690> this

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
something and in the same way if this

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.660 
something and in the same way if this
little<00:02:45.050> teapot<00:02:45.530> now<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.190> reason<00:02:46.340> for

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
little teapot now you see the reason for

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.880 
little teapot now you see the reason for
cleaning<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.150> out<00:02:47.300> with<00:02:47.510> White's<00:02:47.810> first<00:02:48.170> was

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
cleaning it out with White's first was

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.449 
cleaning it out with White's first was
that<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.130> gives<00:02:49.280> me<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.430> very<00:02:49.910> resonant<00:02:50.510> surface

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
that it gives me a very resonant surface

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.790 
that it gives me a very resonant surface
to<00:02:52.459> paint<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:52.940> little<00:02:53.320> silhouette<00:02:54.320> on<00:02:54.530> and

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
to paint this little silhouette on and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.949 
to paint this little silhouette on and
then<00:02:55.760> when<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:55.940> lift<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:58.660> it'll<00:02:59.660> go<00:02:59.750> back<00:02:59.930> to

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
then when I lift it it'll go back to

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.290 
then when I lift it it'll go back to
light<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.680> because<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.250> wanted<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.670> very<00:03:02.030> light

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
light and because I wanted a very light

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.060 
light and because I wanted a very light
was<00:03:02.540> I'm<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.690> gonna<00:03:02.959> burnish<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.890> make

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
was I'm just gonna burnish this and make

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.780 
was I'm just gonna burnish this and make
it<00:03:04.250> lighter<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:06.430> think<00:03:07.430> I'll<00:03:07.519> put<00:03:07.670> another

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
it lighter I think I'll put another

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.250 
it lighter I think I'll put another
gestural<00:03:08.570> marks<00:03:08.930> from<00:03:09.110> here<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:15.019> was<00:03:15.140> my

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
gestural marks from here that was my

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.570 
gestural marks from here that was my
finger<00:03:15.320> going<00:03:15.860> through<00:03:16.010> there<00:03:16.160> but<00:03:16.280> again<00:03:16.459> you

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
finger going through there but again you

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.880 
finger going through there but again you
see<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.880> gestural<00:03:17.269> mark<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.780> how<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:17.989> gives

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
see the gestural mark of how that gives

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.740 
see the gestural mark of how that gives
that<00:03:19.040> impression<00:03:19.160> but<00:03:19.970> now<00:03:20.120> can<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.600> see<00:03:20.720> why

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
that impression but now can you see why

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.420 
that impression but now can you see why
the<00:03:21.080> reason<00:03:21.470> for<00:03:21.590> putting<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:21.950> there<00:03:22.010> and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
the reason for putting that there and

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.460 
the reason for putting that there and
now<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.180> begins<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.720> create<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.050> sense<00:03:24.350> of

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
now it begins to create a sense of

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.250 
now it begins to create a sense of
passage<00:03:25.010> over<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:26.000> Center<00:03:26.510> medium<00:03:26.959> or<00:03:27.110> that

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
passage over that Center medium or that

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.470 
passage over that Center medium or that
physical<00:03:27.769> division<00:03:28.519> that<00:03:28.790> runs<00:03:29.090> up<00:03:29.269> through

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
physical division that runs up through

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.210 
physical division that runs up through
the<00:03:29.600> middle<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:29.989> page<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.590> comes

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
the middle of the page and comes

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.220 
the middle of the page and comes
together

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
together

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.290 
together
you
