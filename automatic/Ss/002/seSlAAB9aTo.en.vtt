very very typical complaint it's a fully
insulated<00:00:39.660> house<00:00:40.079> though<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.829> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
insulated house though so how do you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.290 
insulated house though so how do you
kind<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> get<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> root<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> problem

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
kind of get to the root of the problem

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000 
kind of get to the root of the problem
luckily<00:00:42.750> we've<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> diagnostic

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
luckily we've got the diagnostic

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.590 
luckily we've got the diagnostic
equipment<00:00:44.250> such<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.879> infrared<00:00:45.239> thermal

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
equipment such as this infrared thermal

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.010 
equipment such as this infrared thermal
camera<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.440> right<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:50.449> I'll<00:00:51.449> show<00:00:51.660> exactly

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
camera all right so I'll show exactly

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.680 
camera all right so I'll show exactly
what's<00:00:52.379> how<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.699> utilize<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.270> take<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
what's how we can utilize this take a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.420 
what's how we can utilize this take a
look<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> house<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.039> we've<00:00:56.160> got

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
look at the house and see what we've got

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.200 
look at the house and see what we've got
so<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.050> taking<00:00:58.379> pictures<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
so if it's taking pictures of

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.060 
so if it's taking pictures of
temperature<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.780> hot<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.530> coal<00:01:01.739> for

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
temperature what is hot what is coal for

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
temperature what is hot what is coal for
example<00:01:02.489> we'll<00:01:02.730> start<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.180> window<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
example we'll start on this window you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.890 
example we'll start on this window you
can<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:03.989> cold<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> represented<00:01:05.760> by<00:01:05.790> black<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
can see cold is represented by black so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
can see cold is represented by black so
this<00:01:07.140> big<00:01:07.350> black<00:01:07.619> patch<00:01:07.979> right<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.340> right

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
this big black patch right there right

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.450 
this big black patch right there right
all<00:01:09.000> low<00:01:09.810> temperature<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.680> opposed<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.250> course

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
all low temperature as opposed of course

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.190 
all low temperature as opposed of course
the<00:01:11.640> warmth<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.240> hand<00:01:12.479> oh<00:01:12.659> yeah<00:01:12.960> nice

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the warmth of my hand oh yeah nice

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.570 
the warmth of my hand oh yeah nice
bright<00:01:13.560> white<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.460> really

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
bright white all right really

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
bright white all right really
straightforward<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.780> easy<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.350> interpret

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
straightforward very easy to interpret

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.580 
straightforward very easy to interpret
you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.090> pan<00:01:18.420> over<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.020> studying

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you can see as I pan over the studying

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.219 
you can see as I pan over the studying
the<00:01:19.770> woods<00:01:19.979> studying<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> vertical<00:01:22.049> lines

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the woods studying so the vertical lines

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.840 
the woods studying so the vertical lines
the<00:01:22.530> darker<00:01:22.950> lines<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.369> represent<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the darker lines here represent the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120 
the darker lines here represent the
studs<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.570> between<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.560> whiter<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
studs and in between it it is whiter so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
studs and in between it it is whiter so
that's<00:01:26.280> warmer<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> insulation

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that's warmer because of the insulation

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.270 
that's warmer because of the insulation
right<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.290> insulation<00:01:28.829> has<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> higher

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
right the insulation has a higher

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.090 
right the insulation has a higher
r-value<00:01:29.579> than<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> adjacent<00:01:30.479> studs<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.650> let's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
r-value than the adjacent studs so let's

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
r-value than the adjacent studs so let's
start<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> audit<00:01:32.880> well<00:01:33.420> I've<00:01:33.570> been<00:01:33.720> through

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
start the audit well I've been through

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.359 
start the audit well I've been through
the<00:01:33.960> whole<00:01:34.110> first<00:01:34.259> floor<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.220> should

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the whole first floor I think we should

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.710 
the whole first floor I think we should
go<00:01:35.430> upstairs<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.909> find<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.210> what's<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.600> on

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
go upstairs to find out what's going on

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.510 
go upstairs to find out what's going on
okay

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
okay

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.280 
okay
so<00:01:38.520> around<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> corners<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.020> gets<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
so around the corners there it gets a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.660 
so around the corners there it gets a
little<00:01:40.380> dark<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:41.369> because

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
little dark and you think that's because

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.100 
little dark and you think that's because
that<00:01:41.880> what<00:01:42.210> does<00:01:42.299> fiberglass<00:01:42.810> insulation

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that what does fiberglass insulation

okay<00:03:29.260> one<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.560> first<00:03:29.590> steps<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.100> want<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> do

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
okay one of the first steps I want to do

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.670 
okay one of the first steps I want to do
is<00:03:30.550> just<00:03:31.420> create<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.840> little<00:03:32.140> bit<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.380> backer

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
is just create a little bit of a backer

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.580 
is just create a little bit of a backer
just<00:03:33.580> using<00:03:33.850> some<00:03:34.000> random<00:03:34.590> unfaith

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
just using some random unfaith

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.960 
just using some random unfaith
fiberglass<00:03:36.160> material<00:03:36.960> this<00:03:37.960> just<00:03:38.730> works<00:03:39.730> as<00:03:39.940> a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
fiberglass material this just works as a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.140 
fiberglass material this just works as a
temporary<00:03:40.450> stop<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.520> not<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.970> air

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
temporary stop this is not the air

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.820 
temporary stop this is not the air
barrier<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:43.900> definitely<00:03:44.230> not<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.680> air

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
barrier this is definitely not the air

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.250 
barrier this is definitely not the air
barrier<00:03:45.250> because<00:03:45.580> we<00:03:45.700> know<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.810> fiberglass

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
barrier because we know that fiberglass

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.530 
barrier because we know that fiberglass
by<00:03:47.620> itself<00:03:47.950> will<00:03:48.250> not<00:03:48.430> stop<00:03:48.880> air<00:03:49.150> movement

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
by itself will not stop air movement

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.990 
by itself will not stop air movement
with<00:03:50.440> our<00:03:50.560> fiberglass<00:03:50.890> backer<00:03:51.310> now<00:03:51.610> in<00:03:51.760> place

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
with our fiberglass backer now in place

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.510 
with our fiberglass backer now in place
I<00:03:52.270> can<00:03:52.570> seal<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.320> with<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.620> foam<00:03:53.830> let<00:03:54.460> me

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
I can seal this with the foam let me

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.430 
I can seal this with the foam let me
show<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.730> how<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.030> works

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.210 

and<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.670> expands<00:04:00.240> as<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:00.930> applied<00:04:01.230> right<00:04:01.710> it

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and it expands as it's applied right it

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.160 
and it expands as it's applied right it
takes<00:04:02.430> about<00:04:02.550> 20<00:04:03.030> seconds<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.570> really<00:04:03.840> cure

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
takes about 20 seconds to really cure

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.760 
takes about 20 seconds to really cure
it's<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.220> fairly<00:04:05.520> rapid<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:07.380> once<00:04:07.590> this

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
it's a fairly rapid and so once this

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.380 
it's a fairly rapid and so once this
sets<00:04:08.070> up<00:04:08.310> that's<00:04:08.490> gonna<00:04:08.610> make<00:04:08.850> an<00:04:09.000> airtight

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
sets up that's gonna make an airtight

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.480 
sets up that's gonna make an airtight
barrier<00:04:09.630> that'll<00:04:10.200> stop<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.830> chimney<00:04:11.220> or

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
barrier that'll stop this chimney or

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.080 
barrier that'll stop this chimney or
stack<00:04:11.520> effect<00:04:11.940> that's<00:04:12.570> exactly<00:04:13.140> right<00:04:13.170> Kevin

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
stack effect that's exactly right Kevin

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.070 
stack effect that's exactly right Kevin
look<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.240> then<00:04:15.390> at<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.630> point<00:04:15.690> we're<00:04:15.990> gonna

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
look and then at that point we're gonna

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.170 
look and then at that point we're gonna
put<00:04:16.290> our<00:04:16.410> fiberglass<00:04:16.769> back<00:04:17.160> down<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
put our fiberglass back down the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.430 
put our fiberglass back down the
fiberglass<00:04:18.510> will<00:04:18.780> now<00:04:18.930> do<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.140> good<00:04:19.380> job

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
fiberglass will now do a good job

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.570 
fiberglass will now do a good job
because<00:04:19.830> it's<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.280> an<00:04:20.400> airtight

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
because it's in an airtight

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.880 
because it's in an airtight
configuration<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:22.170> Bruce<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.470> lot<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.800> these

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
configuration so Bruce a lot of these

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.950 
configuration so Bruce a lot of these
holes<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.430> we<00:04:23.610> found<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.270> plug<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.570> sort

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
holes that we found and a plug to sort

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.570 
holes that we found and a plug to sort
of<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.200> center<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.620> this<00:04:25.770> attic<00:04:26.100> area<00:04:26.250> or

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
of in the center of this attic area or

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.580 
of in the center of this attic area or
railing<00:04:26.970> below<00:04:27.300> but<00:04:27.900> we<00:04:27.930> looked<00:04:28.350> at<00:04:28.440> that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
railing below but we looked at that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.320 
railing below but we looked at that
thermal<00:04:29.070> image<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.400> little<00:04:29.520> earlier<00:04:29.910> on<00:04:29.970> all

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
thermal image a little earlier on all

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.270 
thermal image a little earlier on all
the<00:04:30.810> dark<00:04:31.020> black<00:04:31.260> spots<00:04:31.620> were<00:04:31.830> around<00:04:32.100> the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
the dark black spots were around the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.590 
the dark black spots were around the
edges<00:04:32.640> here<00:04:32.670> so<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:33.030> think<00:04:33.150> that's<00:04:33.390> where<00:04:33.540> the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
edges here so I think that's where the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.360 
edges here so I think that's where the
heat<00:04:33.720> loss<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.020> as<00:04:34.140> well<00:04:34.320> we<00:04:34.530> also<00:04:34.770> had<00:04:35.160> heat

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
heat loss is as well we also had heat

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.640 
heat loss is as well we also had heat
loss<00:04:35.550> out<00:04:35.730> near<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.180> eave<00:04:36.450> area<00:04:36.840> let<00:04:37.410> me<00:04:37.500> show

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650

that but it also has this vertical
component<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.540> what<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.720> does<00:05:16.140> it

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
component to it and what that does it

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.190 
component to it and what that does it
blocks<00:05:17.130> that<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.640> don't<00:05:17.850> watch<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.200> soffit

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
blocks that and don't watch that soffit

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.680 
blocks that and don't watch that soffit
air<00:05:19.350> on<00:05:19.950> top<00:05:20.280> of<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.610> fiberglass<00:05:21.060> so<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.570> air

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
air on top of the fiberglass so the air

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.909 
air on top of the fiberglass so the air
is<00:05:21.720> still<00:05:22.110> allowed<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.380> come<00:05:22.590> up<00:05:22.710> through<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
is still allowed to come up through the

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.130 
is still allowed to come up through the
soffit<00:05:23.400> but<00:05:23.730> instead<00:05:24.240> of<00:05:24.360> coming<00:05:24.690> this<00:05:24.930> way

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
soffit but instead of coming this way

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.930 
soffit but instead of coming this way
underneath<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.710> fiberglass<00:05:26.040> or<00:05:26.490> through<00:05:26.820> the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
underneath the fiberglass or through the

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.730 
underneath the fiberglass or through the
fiberglass<00:05:27.300> it's<00:05:27.720> actually<00:05:28.080> blocked<00:05:28.440> and

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
fiberglass it's actually blocked and

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.680 
fiberglass it's actually blocked and
diverted<00:05:29.130> up<00:05:29.280> into<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.820> rafter<00:05:30.210> Bay<00:05:30.360> where<00:05:30.600> it

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
diverted up into the rafter Bay where it

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.870 
diverted up into the rafter Bay where it
is<00:05:30.810> supposed<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.290> be<00:05:31.380> right<00:05:31.860> very<00:05:32.490> simple

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
is supposed to be right very simple

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.310 
is supposed to be right very simple
solution<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.480> then<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.660> just<00:05:33.810> put<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:34.140> in

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
solution and then you just put that in

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.230 
solution and then you just put that in
the<00:05:34.440> rafter<00:05:34.770> bays<00:05:34.950> all<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.430> way<00:05:35.550> around<00:05:35.910> okay

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
the rafter bays all the way around okay

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.060 
the rafter bays all the way around okay
right<00:05:36.720> then<00:05:36.960> we<00:05:37.080> can<00:05:37.230> push<00:05:37.410> off<00:05:37.590> fiberglass

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
right then we can push off fiberglass

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.980 
right then we can push off fiberglass
all<00:05:38.370> the<00:05:38.580> way<00:05:38.669> out<00:05:38.820> to<00:05:39.000> where<00:05:39.150> it<00:05:39.180> should<00:05:39.240> be

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
all the way out to where it should be

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.050 
all the way out to where it should be
