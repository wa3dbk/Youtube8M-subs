00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
stronger bigger pounds have been a

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.980 
stronger bigger pounds have been a
little<00:03:34.800> faster<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.700> mean<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.390> don't<00:03:36.600> really<00:03:36.780> I

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
little faster I mean I don't really I

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.030 
little faster I mean I don't really I
was<00:03:37.860> value<00:03:38.310> right<00:03:38.460> I<00:03:38.490> was<00:03:38.700> pretty<00:03:38.880> fast

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
was value right I was pretty fast

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.980 
was value right I was pretty fast
one<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.100> my<00:03:41.190> few<00:03:41.460> skills<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.000> had<00:03:42.210> in<00:03:42.360> college<00:03:42.570> I

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
one of my few skills I had in college I

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.930 
one of my few skills I had in college I
learned<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.740> throw<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.070> ball<00:03:44.250> just<00:03:44.280> barely<00:03:44.730> in

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
learned to throw the ball just barely in

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.720 
learned to throw the ball just barely in
time<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.300> play<00:03:45.420> at<00:03:45.600> BYU<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:46.740> I<00:03:46.950> think<00:03:47.430> more

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
time to play at BYU but I think more

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.700 
time to play at BYU but I think more
than<00:03:47.760> anything

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
than anything

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.010 
than anything
Taysom<00:03:49.710> has<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.150> inner<00:03:51.450> stand<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.960> I

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
Taysom has the the the inner stand and I

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.170 
Taysom has the the the inner stand and I
think<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.290> game<00:03:52.470> has<00:03:52.500> gotten<00:03:52.920> more<00:03:53.180> dynamic

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
think the game has gotten more dynamic

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.300 
think the game has gotten more dynamic
and<00:03:54.390> what<00:03:55.170> quarterbacks<00:03:55.620> can<00:03:55.950> do<00:03:56.160> and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
and what quarterbacks can do and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.800 
and what quarterbacks can do and
accomplish<00:03:56.490> with<00:03:56.760> these<00:03:56.880> offenses<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.630> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
accomplish with these offenses and and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.440 
accomplish with these offenses and and
and<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.310> think<00:03:59.370> tason's<00:03:59.820> just<00:04:00.210> looks

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
and and and I think tason's just looks

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.990 
and and and I think tason's just looks
like<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.660> guy<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:01.110> can<00:04:01.370> extend<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.580> whatever<00:04:02.910> I

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
like a guy that can extend on whatever I

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.090 
like a guy that can extend on whatever I
was<00:04:03.300> able<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.600> accomplish<00:04:04.140> but<00:04:04.560> he's<00:04:04.740> got<00:04:04.950> it

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
was able to accomplish but he's got it

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.100 
was able to accomplish but he's got it
you<00:04:05.640> know<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:06.030> got<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.300> do<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.480> do<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.930> from<00:04:07.050> the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
you know you got to do it do it from the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.930 
you know you got to do it do it from the
pocket<00:04:07.470> okay<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.160> rest<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.520> will<00:04:08.640> will<00:04:08.820> do

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
pocket okay the rest of it will will do

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.060 
pocket okay the rest of it will will do
but<00:04:09.240> from<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.720> pocket<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.320> think<00:04:10.530> if<00:04:10.890> he

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
but from the pocket and I think if he

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.500 
but from the pocket and I think if he
can<00:04:11.220> do<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.670> team<00:04:11.880> really<00:04:12.300> and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
can do that this team really and

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.870 
can do that this team really and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
we did that I got off the air and I

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.110 
we did that I got off the air and I
thought<00:04:58.919> oh<00:04:59.009> I<00:04:59.039> should<00:04:59.370> have<00:04:59.430> mentioned<00:04:59.910> and

thought oh I should have mentioned and

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.939 
thought oh I should have mentioned and
maybe<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.419> can't<00:05:01.320> remember<00:05:01.440> for<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.770> did<00:05:01.889> it

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
off the air you know it's a stores is

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.610 
off the air you know it's a stores is
