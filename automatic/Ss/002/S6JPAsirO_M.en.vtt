the<00:05:49.669> robots<00:05:50.060> were<00:05:50.180> actually<00:05:50.570> a<00:05:50.599> piece<00:05:50.810> of<00:05:50.960> the

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
the robots were actually a piece of the

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.960 
the robots were actually a piece of the
game<00:05:51.289> they<00:05:51.560> had<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.830> be<00:05:51.949> charged<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.729> do<00:05:52.789> all

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
game they had to be charged and do all

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.330 
game they had to be charged and do all
that<00:05:53.000> kind<00:05:53.300> of<00:05:53.659> stuff<00:05:53.810> now<00:05:54.590> in<00:05:54.800> this<00:05:55.039> they

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
that kind of stuff now in this they

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.460 
that kind of stuff now in this they
don't<00:05:55.580> need<00:05:55.759> any<00:05:56.030> of<00:05:56.210> that<00:05:56.330> so<00:05:56.870> basically

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
don't need any of that so basically

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.060 
don't need any of that so basically
they're<00:05:58.039> they're<00:05:58.280> like<00:05:58.520> Sims<00:05:58.940> but<00:05:59.810> they<00:06:00.530> love

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
they're they're like Sims but they love

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.100 
they're they're like Sims but they love
cleaning<00:06:01.340> they're<00:06:01.639> great<00:06:01.880> cooks<00:06:02.150> all<00:06:02.659> that

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
cleaning they're great cooks all that

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.290 
cleaning they're great cooks all that
kind<00:06:03.380> of<00:06:03.440> stuff<00:06:03.560> goes<00:06:04.220> into<00:06:04.520> play<00:06:04.759> so

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
kind of stuff goes into play so

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.330 
kind of stuff goes into play so
basically<00:06:05.960> let's<00:06:06.320> get<00:06:06.500> started<00:06:06.949> by<00:06:07.280> getting

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
basically let's get started by getting

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.460 
basically let's get started by getting
the<00:06:07.669> computer<00:06:08.000> in<00:06:08.210> this<00:06:08.330> house<00:06:08.599> so<00:06:09.110> we<00:06:09.199> can<00:06:09.320> see

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
the computer in this house so we can see

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.140 
the computer in this house so we can see
how<00:06:09.560> these<00:06:09.740> these<00:06:10.130> things<00:06:10.340> kind<00:06:10.639> of<00:06:10.759> program

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
how these these things kind of program

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.240 
how these these things kind of program
these<00:06:11.360> these<00:06:11.720> things<00:06:12.080> let's<00:06:12.889> see<00:06:13.039> how<00:06:13.099> they

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
these these things let's see how they

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.950 
these these things let's see how they
let's<00:06:13.490> study<00:06:13.789> these<00:06:14.000> things<00:06:14.060> how<00:06:14.630> do<00:06:14.690> they<00:06:14.900> do

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
let's study these things how do they do

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.270 
let's study these things how do they do
things<00:06:15.560> okay<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:16.460> let's<00:06:16.759> get<00:06:16.849> a<00:06:16.909> desk<00:06:17.240> here<00:06:17.539> um

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
things okay so let's get a desk here um

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.890 
things okay so let's get a desk here um
just<00:06:19.280> whatever<00:06:19.550> works<00:06:20.330> I<00:06:20.570> guess<00:06:20.599> this<00:06:20.870> little

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
just whatever works I guess this little

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.580 
just whatever works I guess this little
red<00:06:21.289> one<00:06:21.530> a<00:06:22.330> computer<00:06:23.330> pretty<00:06:24.110> good<00:06:24.380> one<00:06:24.560> I

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
red one a computer pretty good one I

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.680 
red one a computer pretty good one I
want<00:06:24.800> to<00:06:24.889> get<00:06:24.979> like<00:06:25.159> alright<00:06:25.759> yeah<00:06:25.909> the<00:06:26.000> $4000

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
want to get like alright yeah the $4000

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.010 
want to get like alright yeah the $4000
one<00:06:26.930> and<00:06:27.440> then<00:06:28.250> a<00:06:28.280> chair<00:06:28.639> so<00:06:29.030> let's<00:06:29.599> just<00:06:29.840> get

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
one and then a chair so let's just get

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.770 
one and then a chair so let's just get
this<00:06:30.289> bad<00:06:30.500> boy

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
this bad boy

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.400 
this bad boy
and<00:06:32.310> perfect<00:06:33.570> um<00:06:34.570> we<00:06:34.810> should<00:06:34.960> probably<00:06:34.990> get

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
and perfect um we should probably get

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.560 
and perfect um we should probably get
that<00:06:35.470> little<00:06:35.920> programming<00:06:36.520> lamp<00:06:36.880> to<00:06:37.150> oh<00:06:37.180> wait

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
that little programming lamp to oh wait

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.880 
that little programming lamp to oh wait
we<00:06:37.690> I<00:06:37.720> won't<00:06:38.080> have<00:06:38.230> those<00:06:38.380> on<00:06:38.560> here<00:06:38.620> cuz<00:06:38.800> this

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:38.890 
we I won't have those on here cuz this

we I won't have those on here cuz this
is<00:06:39.010> my<00:06:39.130> laptop<00:06:39.370> let's<00:06:40.210> go<00:06:40.360> back<00:06:40.510> to<00:06:40.630> live<00:06:40.810> mode

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
is my laptop let's go back to live mode

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.530 
is my laptop let's go back to live mode
now<00:06:41.230> so<00:06:41.830> let's<00:06:42.520> go<00:06:42.640> to<00:06:42.700> practice<00:06:43.120> programming
