this gap
every<00:01:42.770> day<00:01:42.950> of<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.250> few<00:01:43.520> hours<00:01:43.640> where<00:01:43.970> I<00:01:44.000> don't

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
every day of a few hours where I don't

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.510 
every day of a few hours where I don't
necessarily<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:45.140> something<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.679> I<00:01:45.890> need

necessarily have something that I need

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.729 
necessarily have something that I need
to<00:01:46.549> be<00:01:46.759> doing<00:01:46.909> Pam<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.349> was<00:01:48.439> really<00:01:48.590> quite

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:48.739 
to be doing Pam and it was really quite

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.279 
to be doing Pam and it was really quite
easy<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:49.340> approach<00:01:50.299> them<00:01:50.539> in<00:01:50.630> volunteer<00:01:51.140> what

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
easy to approach them in volunteer what

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.000 
easy to approach them in volunteer what
my<00:01:51.709> time

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.080 

voluntary<00:01:55.010> feeding<00:01:55.280> society<00:01:55.700> seemed<00:01:55.910> to<00:01:56.000> be

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
voluntary feeding society seemed to be

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.990 
voluntary feeding society seemed to be
the<00:01:56.210> next<00:01:56.690> logical<00:01:56.810> step<00:01:57.080> away<00:01:57.440> -<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:58.280> guess

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
the next logical step away - I guess

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.450 
the next logical step away - I guess
connect<00:01:59.300> with<00:01:59.420> more<00:01:59.540> people<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.370> you<00:02:01.370> know

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
connect with more people and you know

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.460 
connect with more people and you know

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
spread the the bigger message - a little

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.650 
spread the the bigger message - a little
bit<00:02:03.620> further<00:02:03.830> it's<00:02:04.820> really<00:02:05.090> helped<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.420> build

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
bit further it's really helped to build
