hook it straight down the center of the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.920 
hook it straight down the center of the
bait<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.770> other<00:00:52.980> words<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.180> your

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
hook to be perfectly in line with the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970 
hook to be perfectly in line with the
center<00:00:57.090> line<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.750> bait<00:00:57.960> throughout<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
center line of that bait throughout the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.380 
center line of that bait throughout the
whole<00:00:59.129> process<00:00:59.370> okay

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
whole process okay

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.640 
whole process okay
now<00:01:01.039> two<00:01:02.039> different<00:01:02.280> ways<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.550> hook<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.650> first

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
now two different ways I hook it first

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.710 
now two different ways I hook it first
of<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.760> my<00:01:05.909> video<00:01:06.450> about

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
of all just like in my video about

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.230 
of all just like in my video about
fishing<00:01:07.260> or<00:01:07.439> putting<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> hook<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> worm<00:01:08.580> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
fishing or putting a hook in a worm you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880 
fishing or putting a hook in a worm you
want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> lay<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.659> hook<00:01:10.080> alongside<00:01:10.409> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
want to lay that hook alongside that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399 
want to lay that hook alongside that
fluke<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:12.450> angle<00:01:12.930> everything<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
fluke and see what angle everything is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.740 
fluke and see what angle everything is
going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.159> okay<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.420> I'm<00:01:15.509> doing<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
going to go in at okay and I'm doing a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
going to go in at okay and I'm doing a
lousy<00:01:15.900> job<00:01:16.140> doing<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.070> camera<00:01:17.460> anyway

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
lousy job doing it to this camera anyway

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.359 
lousy job doing it to this camera anyway
and<00:01:18.479> you'll<00:01:19.170> notice<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and you'll notice that with a with a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.580 
and you'll notice that with a with a
round<00:01:20.670> bin<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.750> offset<00:01:21.930> round<00:01:22.380> bin<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
round bin with an offset round bin that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.859 
round bin with an offset round bin that
hook<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.580> section<00:01:26.970> between<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.450> hook<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
hook I the section between that hook I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.230 
hook I the section between that hook I
and<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.979> band<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.909> at<00:01:30.030> an<00:01:30.119> angle

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and that band is going to be at an angle

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.670 
and that band is going to be at an angle
so<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:30.720> where<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.079> want<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> start<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
so that's where you want to start and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
so that's where you want to start and
one<00:01:31.770> start<00:01:32.040> off<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.280> putting<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.759> at<00:01:32.939> an

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
one start off with putting it in at an

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.380 
one start off with putting it in at an
angle<00:01:33.799> okay

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
angle okay

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.149 
angle okay
so<00:01:38.030> instead<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:40.110> a

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
so instead of like you do with a with a

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.620 
so instead of like you do with a with a
extra<00:01:41.159> wide<00:01:41.310> gap<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.759> extra<00:01:41.939> wide<00:01:42.090> gap<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.450> go

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
extra wide gap of extra wide gap you go

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.870 
extra wide gap of extra wide gap you go
straight<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:44.759> an

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
straight down this one you go in at an

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
straight down this one you go in at an
angle<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.360> come<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.439> make<00:01:46.649> sure

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
angle and come out and you make sure

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.920 
angle and come out and you make sure
that<00:01:47.040> yours<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.119> into<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> center<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that yours you go into the center of the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.120 
that yours you go into the center of the
bait<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.290> come<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.909> center<00:01:51.240> line

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
bait and come out on the center line

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.620 
bait and come out on the center line
okay<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.549> looks<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.329> it's

like that lift it up and pull it down it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.800 
like that lift it up and pull it down it
goes<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.360> that

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
goes just like that

fluke some people put them into the head

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.690 
fluke some people put them into the head
of<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.560> fluke<00:03:58.829> some<00:03:59.069> people<00:03:59.280> put<00:03:59.430> them<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.609> the

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
middle some people put them the tail I

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.860

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
like putting it in the tail when I do it

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.520 
like putting it in the tail when I do it
because<00:04:04.019> it'll<00:04:04.380> cause<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.920> float<00:04:06.530> it'll

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
because it'll cause it to float it'll

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.900 
because it'll cause it to float it'll
cause<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.829> to<00:04:07.920> float<00:04:08.130> down<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.579> like<00:04:08.670> this

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
cause it to float down just like this

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.559 
cause it to float down just like this
okay

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
okay

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.720 
okay

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
it depending on the size of the nail I

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.309 
it depending on the size of the nail I
don't<00:04:12.090> like<00:04:12.239> using<00:04:12.420> lead<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.780> feel<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.140> it's

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
don't like using lead I feel like it's

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.690 
don't like using lead I feel like it's
too<00:04:13.530> heavy

before you put the hook and back into
the<00:05:02.010> bait<00:05:02.270> okay<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:06.360> it<00:05:06.510> swings<00:05:06.810> freely<00:05:07.080> on<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
hook alright so when you cast it out

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.020 
hook alright so when you cast it out
it'll<00:05:10.860> fall<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.250> lowest<00:05:11.460> part<00:05:11.789> of<00:05:11.910> that

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
it'll fall to the lowest part of that

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.340 
it'll fall to the lowest part of that
hook<00:05:12.210> which<00:05:12.449> is<00:05:12.479> right<00:05:12.750> there<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.169> it'll

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
hook which is right there and it'll

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.560 
hook which is right there and it'll
cause<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:13.889> the<00:05:14.190> fluke<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:14.940> fall<00:05:15.120> just<00:05:15.360> like

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
cause it the fluke to fall just like

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.770 
cause it the fluke to fall just like
that<00:05:16.130> alright<00:05:17.130> other<00:05:17.910> modifications<00:05:18.630> are
