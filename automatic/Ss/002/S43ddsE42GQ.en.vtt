we<00:00:00.240> go<00:00:00.420> on<00:00:00.599> three<00:00:01.250> one<00:00:02.330> two<00:00:03.680> three

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.459 

what<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.840> so<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:12.929> were<00:00:13.080> shooting<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
what was that so we were shooting the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.880 
what was that so we were shooting the
mind<00:00:13.710> class<00:00:15.049> they've<00:00:16.049> shipped<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.410> camera

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
mind class they've shipped the camera

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.230 
mind class they've shipped the camera
and<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.160> had<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.400> pretend<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> ground

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and we had to pretend that the ground

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.609 
and we had to pretend that the ground
was<00:00:18.390> shaking<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.840> then<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.020> had<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> fall<00:00:19.410> down

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
was shaking and then we had to fall down

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.710 
was shaking and then we had to fall down
it<00:00:20.100> works<00:00:20.340> cuz<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.820> really<00:00:21.090> think<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
it works cuz you really think it's a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.529 
it works cuz you really think it's a
real<00:00:22.500> earthquake<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.580> mine<00:00:23.789> collapse<00:00:24.150> but

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
real earthquake in mine collapse but

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.660 
real earthquake in mine collapse but
ultimately<00:00:25.170> as<00:00:25.500> actors<00:00:26.039> we're<00:00:26.279> standing

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
ultimately as actors we're standing

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.679 
ultimately as actors we're standing
pretending<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> shake<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.599> they're

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
pretending the shake and they're

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.169 
pretending the shake and they're
throwing<00:00:28.109> styrofoam<00:00:28.619> rocks<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:29.070> us<00:00:29.099> when<00:00:30.090> they

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
throwing styrofoam rocks at us when they

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.910 
throwing styrofoam rocks at us when they
were<00:00:30.269> shooting<00:00:30.420> my<00:00:30.660> coverage<00:00:31.109> Jim<00:00:31.410> Murray<00:00:31.650> was

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
were shooting my coverage Jim Murray was

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.250 
were shooting my coverage Jim Murray was
off-camera<00:00:32.120> heckling<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.510> making<00:00:34.020> fun<00:00:34.230> of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
off-camera heckling me and making fun of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.729 
off-camera heckling me and making fun of
me<00:00:35.360> it<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.750> hard<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> keep<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.440> straight

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
me it was so hard to keep a straight

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.479 
me it was so hard to keep a straight
face<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.750> pretend<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.649> were<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.160> in

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
face and pretend that we were really in

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.729 
face and pretend that we were really in
the<00:00:41.610> mind<00:00:41.850> collapse<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:43.200> back<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.590> him

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the mind collapse and I got back at him

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.080 
the mind collapse and I got back at him
though<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:44.250> time<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.430> his<00:00:44.700> coverage

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
though and it was time for his coverage

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
though and it was time for his coverage
I<00:00:45.360> stood<00:00:45.690> off-camera<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.320> heckled<00:00:46.680> him<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
I stood off-camera and heckled him and I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.069 
I stood off-camera and heckled him and I
think<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.399> even<00:00:47.670> threw<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.940> styrofoam<00:00:48.660> rock<00:00:48.870> at

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
think I even threw a styrofoam rock at

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.850 
think I even threw a styrofoam rock at
his<00:00:49.200> head<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.920> purpose<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:51.770> can't<00:00:52.770> imagine

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
to Ernie by this point and as much as

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.910 
to Ernie by this point and as much as
I'd<00:02:34.250> love<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.880> say<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:36.350> know<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.500> don't<00:02:36.770> think

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
I'd love to say you know I don't think

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.090 
I'd love to say you know I don't think
she<00:02:37.100> meant<00:02:37.130> any<00:02:37.490> of<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.910> think<00:02:38.150> she<00:02:38.390> she<00:02:38.780> does

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
but she's not herself and I think it's

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.080
