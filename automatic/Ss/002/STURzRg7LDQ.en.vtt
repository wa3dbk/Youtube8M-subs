00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.949 
T and the specific heat of liquid water
will<00:03:43.799> plug<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.250> mass<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.730> specific<00:03:45.660> heat

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
will plug in the mass and specific heat

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.470 
will plug in the mass and specific heat
of<00:03:46.200> water<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:47.400> final<00:03:47.790> temperature<00:03:47.940> minus<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.060 
initial which in this case is 100 minus
zero<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.940> we<00:03:51.600> get<00:03:51.750> 52<00:03:52.260> thousand<00:03:52.769> three

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070

now<00:03:55.230> finally<00:03:55.650> we'll<00:03:56.040> calculate<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.579> heat<00:03:56.730> of

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.610 
now finally we'll calculate the heat of
vaporization<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.600> water<00:03:57.810> with<00:03:58.500> the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
joules or 380 kilojoules but what does a

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.630

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
number like that even mean it's not

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.440 
number like that even mean it's not

really in
million<00:04:27.720> terms<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.740> let's<00:04:29.010> put<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.310> in<00:04:29.430> terms

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
remember but calories with the lowercase

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.010 
remember but calories with the lowercase
C<00:04:41.610> aren't<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.000> calories<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:42.630> see<00:04:42.840> on

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
C aren't the calories that you see on

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.870 
C aren't the calories that you see on
the<00:04:43.080> back<00:04:43.200> of<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.440> food<00:04:43.620> carton<00:04:44.010> those<00:04:44.580> are

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
the back of a food carton those are

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.790 
the back of a food carton those are
kilocalories<00:04:45.720> or<00:04:45.990> calories<00:04:46.440> with<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
kilocalories or calories with the

kilocalories or calories with the
capital<00:04:47.160> C<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:48.150> we'll<00:04:48.360> use<00:04:48.570> some<00:04:48.810> dimensional

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
capital C so we'll use some dimensional

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.350 
capital C so we'll use some dimensional
analysis<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:50.010> see<00:04:50.160> how<00:04:50.370> many<00:04:50.550> kilocalories<00:04:51.240> it

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
analysis to see how many kilocalories it

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.480 
analysis to see how many kilocalories it
would<00:04:51.450> take<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.810> turn<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.080> 125<00:04:52.890> grams<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.280> ice

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
would take to turn the 125 grams of ice

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.230 
would take to turn the 125 grams of ice
into<00:04:54.330> vapor<00:04:54.540> we<00:04:55.140> calculated<00:04:56.030> 380,000<00:04:57.030> joules

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
into vapor we calculated 380,000 joules

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.750 
into vapor we calculated 380,000 joules
so<00:04:57.870> we'll<00:04:58.050> convert<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.620> joules<00:04:58.890> to<00:04:59.520> calories

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
so we'll convert the joules to calories

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.240 
so we'll convert the joules to calories
then<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.540> calories<00:05:00.990> into<00:05:01.350> kilocalories<00:05:02.010> and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
then the calories into kilocalories and

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.390 
then the calories into kilocalories and
we<00:05:02.910> get<00:05:03.060> 91<00:05:03.720> kilocalories<00:05:04.590> which<00:05:05.130> is<00:05:05.280> the

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
we get 91 kilocalories which is the

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.560 
we get 91 kilocalories which is the
calories<00:05:05.730> you<00:05:05.820> see<00:05:05.940> on<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.120> back<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.390> food

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570

we<00:05:59.550> can<00:05:59.700> say<00:05:59.880> that<00:06:00.030> there<00:06:00.180> are<00:06:00.270> actually<00:06:00.630> 260

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
we can say that there are actually 260

twenty seven point five minus twenty two
point<00:06:10.620> three<00:06:10.830> degrees<00:06:11.220> our<00:06:12.150> total<00:06:12.510> therefore

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
point three degrees our total therefore

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.940 
point three degrees our total therefore
is<00:06:13.940> 5700<00:06:14.940> joules<00:06:15.240> now<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:16.050> water<00:06:16.320> absorbed

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
is 5700 joules now the water absorbed

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.640 
is 5700 joules now the water absorbed
heat<00:06:17.310> which<00:06:17.910> means<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.690> reaction<00:06:19.020> gave<00:06:19.470> off

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
heat which means the reaction gave off

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.160 
heat which means the reaction gave off
heat<00:06:20.130> so<00:06:20.700> we'll<00:06:20.910> make<00:06:21.060> this<00:06:21.270> a<00:06:21.510> negative

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
heat so we'll make this a negative

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.240 
heat so we'll make this a negative
number<00:06:22.320> for<00:06:22.890> the<00:06:22.980> Q<00:06:23.160> of<00:06:23.280> the<00:06:23.310> reaction<00:06:23.400> now<00:06:25.250> we

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
number for the Q of the reaction now we

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.710 
number for the Q of the reaction now we
want<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.580> know<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:26.760> heat<00:06:26.910> of<00:06:26.940> dissolution<00:06:27.420> in

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
want to know the heat of dissolution in

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.870 
want to know the heat of dissolution in
joules<00:06:27.990> per<00:06:28.140> mole<00:06:28.500> so<00:06:28.800> what<00:06:29.430> we<00:06:29.520> have<00:06:29.640> to<00:06:29.790> do

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
joules per mole so what we have to do

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.180 
joules per mole so what we have to do
now<00:06:30.090> is<00:06:30.330> divide<00:06:30.720> by<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.050> number<00:06:31.290> of<00:06:31.470> moles<00:06:31.830> and

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
now is divide by the number of moles and

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
now is divide by the number of moles and
we<00:06:32.420> get<00:06:33.420> negative<00:06:34.070> 17<00:06:35.070> thousand<00:06:35.640> joules<00:06:35.940> per

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
we get negative 17 thousand joules per

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.740 
we get negative 17 thousand joules per
mole<00:06:36.600> or<00:06:36.810> negative<00:06:37.770> 17<00:06:38.310> kilojoules<00:06:39.060> per<00:06:39.270> mole

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
mole or negative 17 kilojoules per mole

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.300 
mole or negative 17 kilojoules per mole
