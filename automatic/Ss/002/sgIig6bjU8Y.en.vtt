these<00:00:12.210> stray<00:00:12.630> fairies<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.320> dungeon<00:00:13.530> at

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
these stray fairies in this dungeon at

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.499 
these stray fairies in this dungeon at
the<00:00:13.830> same<00:00:14.040> time<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.639> should<00:00:15.089> be<00:00:15.240> doing<00:00:15.360> that

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the same time I should be doing that

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.740 
the same time I should be doing that
with<00:00:15.750> every<00:00:16.020> dungeon<00:00:16.880> because<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.390> usually

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
with every dungeon because it's usually

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.689 
with every dungeon because it's usually
easiest<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.650> do<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.920> strength<00:00:20.460> varies

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
easiest just to do the strength varies

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.220 
easiest just to do the strength varies
at<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> same<00:00:21.090> time<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.449> doing<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> actual

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
at the same time as doing the actual

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.679 
at the same time as doing the actual
dungeon<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.369> only<00:00:23.580> exception<00:00:24.060> might<00:00:24.420> be<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
dungeon the only exception might be the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.970 
dungeon the only exception might be the
third<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.140> because<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> third<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
third one because the third one is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.370 
third one because the third one is
actually<00:00:26.099> pretty<00:00:26.519> hard<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.689> sigh<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> lot

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
actually pretty hard they sigh at a lot

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.019 
actually pretty hard they sigh at a lot
harder<00:00:28.680> time<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.400> than<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.640> did<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
harder time with it than I did with the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.770 
harder time with it than I did with the
fourth<00:00:30.410> but<00:00:31.410> that's<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.859> me<00:00:32.780> there's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
fourth but that's just me there's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.850 
fourth but that's just me there's
actually<00:00:34.110> nothing<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.469> beehive<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:36.860> down

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
actually nothing in that beehive so down

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.170 
actually nothing in that beehive so down
there<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.399> probably<00:00:38.579> hear<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> battle

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
there you can probably hear the battle

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.990 
there you can probably hear the battle
music<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:40.530> down<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.579> little

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
music a little down there is the little

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
music a little down there is the little
black<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:43.290> black<00:00:43.530> spheres<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> evilness

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
black little black spheres of evilness

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
black little black spheres of evilness
he<00:00:45.300> fall<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:45.570> there<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.200> pretty<00:00:46.410> much<00:00:46.440> have

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
he fall down there you pretty much have

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.080 
he fall down there you pretty much have
to<00:00:46.710> avoid<00:00:47.070> them<00:00:47.309> where<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> could<00:00:47.700> fight<00:00:47.879> them

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
to avoid them where you could fight them

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.869 
to avoid them where you could fight them
if<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.500 
know maybe you do this first room is
pretty<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.940> fly<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.289> end<00:00:59.510> the

that<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.070> obvious<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.640> can't<00:01:57.850> get

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
that kind of obvious that you can't get

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:14.640 
that kind of obvious that you can't get
up<00:01:58.090> there<00:01:58.330> and<00:02:12.989> that's<00:02:13.989> how<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.200> kill<00:02:14.470> those

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
up there and that's how you kill those

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.290 
up there and that's how you kill those
stupid<00:02:15.069> turtle<00:02:15.370> things<00:02:15.610> which<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:16.000> believe<00:02:16.239> are

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
stupid turtle things which I believe are

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.880 
stupid turtle things which I believe are
called<00:02:16.600> snappers<00:02:17.140> or<00:02:17.380> something<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.860> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890

called snappers or something to that
effect<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.630> apparently<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.170> can't<00:02:20.440> lure

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
effect and apparently you can't lure

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.390 
effect and apparently you can't lure
them<00:02:20.830> over<00:02:21.100> by<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.570> flower<00:02:23.220> I'll<00:02:24.220> just

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
remove those lily pad things in that

have to point out it's not really about
being<00:04:08.490> hard<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.030> much<00:04:09.150> as<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.450> about<00:04:09.540> being

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
being hard so much as it is about being

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.440 
being hard so much as it is about being
really<00:04:10.260> cheap<00:04:11.030> puzzles<00:04:12.030> aren't<00:04:12.210> really

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
really cheap puzzles aren't really

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.690 
really cheap puzzles aren't really
difficult<00:04:12.990> it's<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.500> most<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.430> them<00:04:14.580> are

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
difficult it's just most of them are

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.370 
difficult it's just most of them are
based<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.120> glitches<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.930> stuff<00:04:16.170> like<00:04:16.320> that

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
based on glitches and stuff like that

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.000 
based on glitches and stuff like that
it's<00:04:16.799> not<00:04:16.920> very<00:04:17.040> fair<00:04:18.140> it<00:04:19.140> starts<00:04:19.500> out<00:04:19.620> sort<00:04:19.920> of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
it's not very fair it starts out sort of

it goes down through a bottomless pit
and<00:04:52.140> then<00:04:52.380> comes<00:04:52.590> back<00:04:52.710> up<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.190> other<00:04:53.310> side

and then comes back up the other side
somehow<00:04:54.620> it's<00:04:55.620> like<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.490> said<00:04:56.520> it's<00:04:56.820> based<00:04:57.000> on

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
somehow it's like I said it's based on

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.540 
somehow it's like I said it's based on
glitches<00:04:57.750> it's<00:04:58.020> stupid<00:04:58.470> that's<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.310> glitch

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
glitches it's stupid that's a glitch

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.060 
glitches it's stupid that's a glitch
anyway<00:04:59.990> not<00:05:00.990> really<00:05:01.170> a<00:05:01.200> glitch<00:05:01.530> more<00:05:01.830> like<00:05:02.040> a

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
anyway not really a glitch more like a

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.650 
anyway not really a glitch more like a
stupid<00:05:02.790> oversight<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.630> still

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
stupid oversight but still

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.140 
stupid oversight but still
anyway<00:05:06.440> back<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.800> this<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.580> bunny<00:05:07.730> hood<00:05:07.940> make

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
anyway back to this the bunny hood make

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.870 
anyway back to this the bunny hood make
this<00:05:08.330> not<00:05:09.320> really<00:05:09.500> any<00:05:09.650> easier<00:05:10.040> it's<00:05:10.400> not<00:05:10.700> that

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
this not really any easier it's not that

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.130 
this not really any easier it's not that
hard<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.120> do<00:05:11.300> this<00:05:11.450> without<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.750> money<00:05:11.930> hood

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
hard to do this without the money hood

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.710 
hard to do this without the money hood
but<00:05:12.380> it's<00:05:12.580> less<00:05:13.580> teased<00:05:13.880> with<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.330> bunny<00:05:14.540> hood

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
but it's less teased with the bunny hood

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:25.120 
but it's less teased with the bunny hood
shall<00:05:14.960> i<00:05:14.990> say<00:05:15.320> i<00:05:22.480> prefer<00:05:23.480> to<00:05:23.900> put<00:05:24.800> away<00:05:24.920> my

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
shall i say i prefer to put away my

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.730 
shall i say i prefer to put away my
stick<00:05:25.460> after<00:05:25.640> each<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:27.050> know<00:05:27.080> after<00:05:27.350> I<00:05:27.530> light

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
stick after each you know after I light

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.200 
stick after each you know after I light
each<00:05:27.890> tour<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.490> way<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:28.610> can<00:05:28.790> relight<00:05:29.180> it

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
each tour so that way I can relight it

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.970 
each tour so that way I can relight it
on<00:05:29.420> that<00:05:29.570> torch<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.110> there's<00:05:30.410> less<00:05:30.590> chance<00:05:30.620> of

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
on that torch and there's less chance of

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.420 
on that torch and there's less chance of
it<00:05:31.100> burning<00:05:31.370> out<00:05:32.560> but<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.740> got<00:05:34.010> hurt<00:05:34.160> by<00:05:34.310> those

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
it burning out but I got hurt by those

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.790 
it burning out but I got hurt by those
moths<00:05:34.700> there<00:05:35.090> if<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:36.050> let<00:05:36.170> the<00:05:36.290> mods<00:05:36.470> touch

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
moths there if you let the mods touch

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.260 
moths there if you let the mods touch
you<00:05:37.010> they're<00:05:37.190> attracted<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.820> fire<00:05:38.030> it

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
you they're attracted to the fire it

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.080 
you they're attracted to the fire it
will<00:05:38.390> it'll<00:05:38.630> hurt<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:39.580> I'm<00:05:40.580> not<00:05:40.820> really<00:05:40.970> sure

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
will it'll hurt you I'm not really sure

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.580 
will it'll hurt you I'm not really sure
why<00:05:41.330> they<00:05:41.480> chose<00:05:41.510> to<00:05:41.690> do<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:42.110> in<00:05:42.230> this<00:05:42.350> game

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
why they chose to do that in this game

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.080 
why they chose to do that in this game
but<00:05:42.860> as<00:05:42.980> far<00:05:43.130> as<00:05:43.190> i<00:05:43.310> remember<00:05:43.340> it's<00:05:43.790> only<00:05:43.880> in

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
but as far as i remember it's only in

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.350 
but as far as i remember it's only in
this<00:05:44.210> dungeon<00:05:44.450> I<00:05:45.730> probably<00:05:46.730> wrong<00:05:47.060> on<00:05:47.330> that

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
this dungeon I probably wrong on that

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.090 
this dungeon I probably wrong on that
but<00:05:47.510> I<00:05:47.720> don't<00:05:48.200> remember<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.740> in<00:05:48.860> any<00:05:49.010> other

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
but I don't remember it in any other

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.650 
but I don't remember it in any other
dungeons<00:05:49.340> so<00:05:49.790> maybe<00:05:50.120> it<00:05:50.270> is<00:05:52.240> if<00:05:53.240> I<00:05:53.420> sound

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
dungeons so maybe it is if I sound

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.980 
dungeons so maybe it is if I sound
slightly<00:05:53.900> congested<00:05:54.200> that's<00:05:54.710> because<00:05:55.010> I<00:05:55.040> am

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
slightly congested that's because I am

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.260 
slightly congested that's because I am
or<00:05:56.990> it<00:05:57.170> could<00:05:57.320> be<00:05:57.350> because<00:05:57.530> it's<00:05:58.240> ten<00:05:59.240> o'clock

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270

or it could be because it's ten o'clock
in<00:05:59.660> the<00:05:59.690> morning<00:06:00.020> I<00:06:00.080> don't<00:06:00.230> know<00:06:00.290> ten<00:06:00.710> o'clock
