00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
phone you don't need the the car it's

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.320 
phone you don't need the the car it's
not<00:05:04.840> obligatory<00:05:05.169> no<00:05:06.130> but<00:05:06.610> what<00:05:06.819> could<00:05:07.000> happen

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
not obligatory no but what could happen

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.159 
not obligatory no but what could happen
with<00:05:07.449> the<00:05:07.569> car<00:05:08.220> because<00:05:09.360> so<00:05:10.360> it's<00:05:10.479> an<00:05:10.599> LTE<00:05:10.900> one

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
with the car because so it's an LTE one

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.430 
with the car because so it's an LTE one
it's<00:05:11.440> not<00:05:11.970> about<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.180> urbane<00:05:13.630> not<00:05:14.199> the<00:05:14.289> urban

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
it's not about the urbane not the urban

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.110 
it's not about the urbane not the urban
but<00:05:14.710> any<00:05:14.949> in<00:05:15.190> theory<00:05:15.430> there'll<00:05:15.699> be<00:05:15.759> a<00:05:15.849> bunch<00:05:16.030> of

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
but any in theory there'll be a bunch of

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:25.909 
but any in theory there'll be a bunch of
things<00:05:16.180> with<00:05:16.509> Android<00:05:16.870> wear<00:05:16.900> what<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.860> can

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.460 

from<00:05:26.919> the<00:05:27.039> LTE<00:05:27.460> variation<00:05:28.449> right<00:05:28.599> cool

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
from the LTE variation right cool

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.010 
from the LTE variation right cool
so<00:05:29.620> there's<00:05:29.919> a<00:05:30.039> lot<00:05:30.159> of<00:05:30.190> interest<00:05:30.900> for<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
so there's a lot of interest for the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.469 
so there's a lot of interest for the
Android<00:05:32.349> wear<00:05:35.610> now<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.669> trick<00:05:36.970> is<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.270> price
