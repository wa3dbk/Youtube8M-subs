00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.280
 Hello. It is a baby channel 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.300
 This time I would like to eat "Sagaso! Yotsuba Clover!" 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.780
 Soft candy. Cream soda taste 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.640
 Yotsuba clover. How many can you find? 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.140
 You can also clover. 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.300
 When we play together 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.940
 Clover hunt 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.360
 Close your eyes and shake the tray to move the candy! 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.860
 Open your eyes with "Se-no!" And find the "Yotsuba" clover. 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.380
 Lucky zone play 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.260
 While closing your eyes, squeeze the tray and put the "Yotsuba" clover into the lucky zone! 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.980
 The winner of the person who was full! 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 When playing alone. Divination play. 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.960
 Close your eyes and get one! 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.180
 How many "Yotsuba" clover can you grasp? 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.240
 Let's do it with the number of clover of "Yotsuba" in the hand! 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.840
 Let's open it 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.180
 Yotsuba clover 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.060
 There is a ladybird here 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.280
 Here also 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.140
 Inside the bag is a pattern of clover 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.800
 Oh, I'm connected. 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.560
 Preparation. Cut the lid and tear the clover soft candy into three. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.500
 Mix candy well 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.240
 One clover is attached to one clump. 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.100
 "Mitsuba" is 18 pieces. There are 9 "Yotsuba" 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.800
 If you close your eyes, you will win by the one that is "Yotsuba" 

00:01:49.813 --> 00:01:50.813
 Good start! 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.180
 Are you angry? 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.900
 Awake 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.480
 I will eat this first. You will receive it! 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.660
 Delicious! Delicious! 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.740
 Delicious like Haichu 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.900
 It is as hard as Haichu 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.740
 Delicious 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.440
 Let's do the next 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.700
 Let's do it one more time 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.760
 After mixing 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.960
 Take 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.220

 Ahh 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.900
 Do it once more 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.460

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.980

 How many "Yotsuba Clovers" are in it? I'll try. 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.593
 Good start! 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.680
 Ah. One or two. 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.500
 Eh? There is no Yotsuba. 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.460
 Yotsuba clover, 0 pieces 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.560
 It is a pity because there were 0 clover. 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.040
 Eat the clover of Yotsuba, let's get well! 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.620

 Friendship 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.760
 Because it was five. It might be good to be talked from the child who was worried about!
