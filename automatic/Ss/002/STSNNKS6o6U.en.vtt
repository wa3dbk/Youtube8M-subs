of<00:01:38.810> left<00:01:39.810> feeling<00:01:40.759> coated<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.450> just

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
of left feeling coated and it's just

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
of left feeling coated and it's just
obvious<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> put<00:01:43.680> powder<00:01:43.920> over<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.490> makeup

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
my makeup in the rearview mirror of my

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.819 
my makeup in the rearview mirror of my
car<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.549> always<00:02:43.239> notice<00:02:43.599> just<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.989> slight<00:02:44.440> you

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
can kind of see where I don't have any

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.539 
can kind of see where I don't have any
highlighter<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:47.019> today<00:02:47.319> whatsoever<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.400> you

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
highlighter on today whatsoever but you

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.979 
highlighter on today whatsoever but you
can<00:02:48.670> just<00:02:48.819> see<00:02:49.000> kind<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.480> slightest

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
can just see kind of the slightest

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.630 
can just see kind of the slightest
little<00:02:50.290> bit<00:02:50.470> where<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.799> light<00:02:51.010> bounces<00:02:51.519> off

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
little bit where the light bounces off

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.009 
little bit where the light bounces off
your<00:02:51.790> skin<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.269> think<00:02:52.480> that's<00:02:52.660> really

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
your skin and I think that's really

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.650 
your skin and I think that's really
pretty<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:54.069> enjoy<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.450> lot

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
pretty and I enjoy that a lot

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.240 
pretty and I enjoy that a lot
so<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:55.959> think<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.530> powder<00:02:56.739> does<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.010> really

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
so I think that the powder does a really

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.680 
so I think that the powder does a really
good<00:02:57.459> job<00:02:57.519> on<00:02:57.940> those<00:02:58.660> two<00:02:59.019> fronts<00:02:59.590> um<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
good job on those two fronts um the the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.530 
good job on those two fronts um the the
only<00:03:02.290> two<00:03:02.620> issues<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.160> have<00:03:03.340> with<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.670> are<00:03:04.030> it's

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
only two issues I have with it are it's

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.650 
only two issues I have with it are it's
a<00:03:04.690> little<00:03:04.930> bit<00:03:05.049> expensive<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:07.329> know<00:03:07.480> that

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
a little bit expensive you know that

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.940 
a little bit expensive you know that
going<00:03:07.840> in<00:03:08.109> though<00:03:08.260> right<00:03:08.500> when<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.769> walk<00:03:08.920> up

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
going in though right when you walk up

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.940 
going in though right when you walk up
to<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.220> Chanel<00:03:09.609> counter<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.620> real

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
to the Chanel counter so the real

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.020 
to the Chanel counter so the real
problem<00:03:12.579> that<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:13.359> have<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:15.069> shade<00:03:15.310> range<00:03:15.579> I

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
problem that I have is the shade range I

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.930 
problem that I have is the shade range I
picked<00:03:16.870> up<00:03:17.049> number<00:03:17.500> 20<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.669> there<00:03:18.790> was

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
picked up number 20 I think there was

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.470 
picked up number 20 I think there was
one<00:03:18.970> shade<00:03:19.660> lighter<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.650> about<00:03:21.030> four<00:03:22.030> shades

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
one shade lighter and about four shades

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.690 
one shade lighter and about four shades
darker<00:03:23.410> maybe<00:03:23.919> five<00:03:24.340> possibly<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:27.160> really

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
darker maybe five possibly and I really

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.759 
darker maybe five possibly and I really
am<00:03:27.880> in<00:03:28.120> between<00:03:28.269> number<00:03:29.019> twenty<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:29.500> number

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
am in between number twenty and number

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.699 
am in between number twenty and number
thirty<00:03:30.099> and<00:03:30.750> since<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.870> was<00:03:32.019> only<00:03:32.169> planning<00:03:32.440> on

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
thirty and since I was only planning on

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.220 
thirty and since I was only planning on
picking<00:03:32.889> up<00:03:33.220> one<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.730> them<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.269> went<00:03:34.599> with<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
picking up one of them I went with the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.050 
picking up one of them I went with the
shade<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.859> was<00:03:36.010> slightly<00:03:36.220> lighter<00:03:36.669> than<00:03:36.790> my

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
shade that was slightly lighter than my

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.080 
shade that was slightly lighter than my
skin<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:38.440> whenever<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.889> apply<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.609> just<00:03:39.669> have

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
skin but whenever I apply it I just have

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.879 
skin but whenever I apply it I just have
that<00:03:40.299> feeling<00:03:40.540> like<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:41.049> just<00:03:41.109> wish<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.620> was<00:03:41.859> a

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
that feeling like I just wish it was a

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.900 
that feeling like I just wish it was a
tad<00:03:42.220> bit<00:03:42.599> deeper<00:03:43.599> just<00:03:44.079> a<00:03:44.380> little<00:03:45.010> bit<00:03:45.130> but<00:03:45.819> I'm

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
tad bit deeper just a little bit but I'm

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.670 
tad bit deeper just a little bit but I'm
afraid<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.389> thirty<00:03:46.660> would<00:03:46.900> have<00:03:46.989> been<00:03:47.169> too

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
afraid the thirty would have been too

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.650 
afraid the thirty would have been too
deep<00:03:47.919> and<00:03:48.220> then<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.849> would<00:03:49.060> be<00:03:49.180> obvious<00:03:49.630> that

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
deep and then it would be obvious that

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.580 
deep and then it would be obvious that
I'm<00:03:49.959> wearing<00:03:50.319> a<00:03:50.500> darker<00:03:51.310> powder<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:53.019> that's

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
I'm wearing a darker powder so that's

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.379 
I'm wearing a darker powder so that's
really<00:03:54.040> my<00:03:54.549> biggest<00:03:55.079> beef<00:03:56.849> with<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.000> product

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
really my biggest beef with the product

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.800 
really my biggest beef with the product
is<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.950> I'm<00:03:59.950> really<00:04:00.669> in<00:04:00.849> between<00:04:01.209> two<00:04:01.480> shades

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
is that I'm really in between two shades
