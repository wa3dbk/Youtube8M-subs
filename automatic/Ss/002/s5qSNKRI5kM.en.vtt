him<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> WrestleMania<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.829> he's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
him to get the WrestleMania but he's

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.400 
him to get the WrestleMania but he's
given<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> WB<00:00:42.210> before<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.260> think

given up on the WB before and I think

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.690

easy<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.829> again<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> one

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
easy to do it again I think the one

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.760 
easy to do it again I think the one
reason<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.270> he's<00:00:45.420> back<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.780> adobe<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.440> money

he<00:01:48.930> needs<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> make<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.439> money<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
he needs to make that money right now I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.389 
he needs to make that money right now I
think<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.180> once<00:01:51.329> he<00:01:51.479> finds<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.399> you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
think that once he finds out on this you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.429 
think that once he finds out on this you
know<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.060> guess<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.659> say<00:01:54.810> contracted

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
know this I guess you can say contracted

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.899 
know this I guess you can say contracted
he's<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.460> worth<00:01:56.700> what

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
he's on that it's not really worth what

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.550 
he's on that it's not really worth what
he's<00:01:57.000> doing<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.540> he<00:01:57.780> will<00:01:57.930> pack<00:01:58.170> his<00:01:58.320> bags

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
he's doing I think he will pack his bags

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
he's doing I think he will pack his bags
and<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.829> home<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.040> wish<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> dream<00:02:00.180> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and go home I wish it was a dream that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.289 
and go home I wish it was a dream that
he<00:02:00.719> would<00:02:00.869> face<00:02:01.079> rock<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.770> WrestleMania<00:02:02.340> but

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
he would face rock at WrestleMania but

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.580 
he would face rock at WrestleMania but
I'm<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.719> those<00:02:03.780> guys<00:02:03.840> betting<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
I'm one of those guys betting that I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.660 
I'm one of those guys betting that I
don't<00:02:04.740> think<00:02:04.860> easy<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.159> make<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> way

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
don't think easy to make it all the way

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.410 
don't think easy to make it all the way
through<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:07.129> I<00:02:08.129> think<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.119> need<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
through so I think that you need to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.570 
through so I think that you need to
build<00:02:09.599> off<00:02:09.959> what<00:02:10.289> WrestleMania<00:02:11.190> was

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
build off what WrestleMania was
