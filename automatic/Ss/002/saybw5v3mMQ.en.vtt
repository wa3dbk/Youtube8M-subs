00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:21.769
 At the Axel Wegener Institute I have two tasks that have to be put into words that way 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.640
 one i am a scientist 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.679
 in physical oceanographer and maker of the investigation 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.380
 about the polar oceans and the lap of honor in the climate system 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.350
 on the other hand, yes, I also have an administrative organizational 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.370
 Role I am the coordinator of Polarstern and responsible 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 the polar star is used roundish 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.410
 I was 16 times on Polarstern 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.340
 Number so that 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.820
 now always in 1 1 86 was on the Polarstern 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.000
 and since 1900 Euro a 2 90 Fahrig actually as a leader 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.570
 I am from 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.810
 my education is a physicist 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 In the course of my studies of physics South, I have physical oceanography 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.750
 Percent crashed because I thought that so 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.619
 For example, the physics team is closer than four percent 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.120
 Particle physicists can operate 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.760
 and percent that was in the 70s 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.450
 So there was and life from the bread Ciano life in the ocean like food from moz 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.370
 to her 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.900
 the emergence of the oceans on plate tectonics and Jan was so one 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.800
 very big topic and I thought there 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.020
 to find a vocation that would be special 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.020
 As a child, I was interested in Lake Constance and becoming one 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.370
 therefore immediately as 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.460
 born in Stuttgart Benan percent but then then the relatively early 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.570
 Developed relationship to the water 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.010
 but always has such a small weakness for the oceans but 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.319
 that this is a serious science 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 that's what I've learned about it, it would have been my study of physics 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:27.839
 the fascination with DM first and foremost is experienced in nature 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:28.769
 asked 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.899
 I do not want to miss him and the trips are exactly what I am 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:37.289
 has been working in casting and is keeping in this profession so if only I have 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.309
 sitting at the door would have to evaluate this data 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.969
 Maybe I would change my mind again but 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.859
 the experience of nature and that is of course especially for the 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.029
 Polar regions 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.249
 and he is very difficult in conditions 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.269
 his data must be that for example so 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:59.889
 only in the case of grievances break the victory in these areas 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:00.869
 get 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.179
 by taking my measurements 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:07.759
 every time a son is a new facet to an exciting new experience 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.259
 that I do not want to miss that and the polar regions Singer 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:17.189
 in their natural appearance, whether this is the ice, the sea ice, or the icebergs 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.469
 or the animals you meet are always so fascinating that that 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.469
 So it makes a very deep impression 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:33.070
 Of course MÃ¶hn wants us to do that today 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.889
 the Knauer one of the advances to Gerald Meder 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.879
 Achieved Polarstern 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.139
 this is no longer there the adventurousness of the pioneers represents but that it 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.359
 very specifically the investigation 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.489
 and of course without any risk to the life and limb of the researchers 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.169
 We're today, that's the same kind of comfort 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.179
 that's why you do not really like the old pioneer who really is 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:04.899
 having your own life in play to come to their conclusions 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:06.549
 I want to be with the people 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.549
 fortunately not compare 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:16.719
 GAL the habitat 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.059
 and of course his dangers that's right 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.319
 the polar bears with him at his is the smallest danger 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.419
 my percent 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.039
 have partly bad weather and percent 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.129
 Damon has now seen many an even iceberg on Kreisky today 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.439
 To bring ship to the bottom 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.659
 to bring another reason 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.419
 so you can not deny the danger 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.620
 but it is so we know the dangers pretty well 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.260
 and that we are on one side with the construction of the ship with the construction 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.689
 with the property 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.930
 This ship is already an ICE has taken very far-reaching precaution 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.199
 So that's what it's all about, for example 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.700
 what a cruise ship 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.040
 This can happen with the Polarstern under normal circumstances 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.529
 not happen and of course I want to say 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.219
 We have always attached great importance to it 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.830
 to have a high-quality crew 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.559
 that much of what is normal in Sievert's stories 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.869
 simply can not take place with us because they are a very good one 

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:14.749
 Have crew
