left side from our perspective is in
darkness<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:55.780> as<00:01:56.050> in<00:01:56.320> light<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.190> right

mean<00:02:01.630> anything<00:02:01.899> in<00:02:02.140> outer<00:02:02.290> space<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:05.700> here<00:02:06.700> we

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
mean anything in outer space so here we

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.870 
mean anything in outer space so here we
have<00:02:06.909> these<00:02:07.299> things<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:09.310> problem<00:02:09.519> is

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
have these things now the problem is

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.600 
have these things now the problem is
these<00:02:10.239> things<00:02:10.539> are<00:02:11.019> just<00:02:11.580> bought<00:02:12.580> a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
these things are just bought a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.170 
these things are just bought a
terminator<00:02:13.510> where<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.780> starts<00:02:14.110> getting<00:02:14.170> dark

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
terminator where it starts getting dark

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.710 
terminator where it starts getting dark
3somes<00:02:16.180> angle<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.320> very<00:02:17.590> low<00:02:18.570> from<00:02:19.570> our

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
3somes angle is very low from our

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720 
3somes angle is very low from our
perspective<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.470> sun's<00:02:20.769> coming<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.430> from<00:02:21.610> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
perspective the sun's coming in from the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:30.650 
perspective the sun's coming in from the
left<00:02:23.519> snow<00:02:24.519> nice<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:25.239> not<00:02:26.700> repeat<00:02:27.700> they<00:02:28.269> do<00:02:28.330> not

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.140 

reflect<00:02:31.660> sunlight<00:02:31.959> like<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.880> they<00:02:33.880> just

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
reflect sunlight like that they just

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.970 
reflect sunlight like that they just
don't<00:02:34.360> not<00:02:35.050> one<00:02:37.050> not<00:02:38.050> when<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.440> sun's<00:02:38.680> very

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
don't not one not when the sun's very

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.509 
don't not one not when the sun's very
low<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.480> series<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:40.900> only<00:02:41.230> 600<00:02:41.590> miles<00:02:42.010> cross

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
low the series is only 600 miles cross

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.550 
low the series is only 600 miles cross
so<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:47.230> not<00:02:47.940> one<00:02:48.940> on<00:02:49.200> certain<00:02:50.200> when<00:02:50.350> there's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
so I'm not one on certain when there's

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.610 
so I'm not one on certain when there's
some<00:02:50.860> be<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.269> small<00:02:52.660> disk<00:02:52.989> on<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.380> rise

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
some be just a small disk on the rise

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.319 
some be just a small disk on the rise
and<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> point<00:02:56.230> here<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:58.090> will

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
and but the point here is that this will

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.940 
and but the point here is that this will
snow<00:02:58.630> nice<00:02:59.549> they<00:03:00.549> would<00:03:00.760> not<00:03:00.910> be<00:03:00.970> reflecting

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
snow nice they would not be reflecting

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.170 
snow nice they would not be reflecting
light<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.220> way<00:03:03.370> they're<00:03:03.579> saying<00:03:06.180> nothing

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
light the way they're saying nothing

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.740 
light the way they're saying nothing
that<00:03:07.390> are<00:03:07.510> stunning<00:03:08.109> out<00:03:08.290> seeing<00:03:08.590> clouds

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
that are stunning out seeing clouds

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.890 
that are stunning out seeing clouds
around<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:10.959> planet<00:03:11.230> anyway<00:03:12.750> fortunately<00:03:13.750> be

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
around this planet anyway fortunately be

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.050 
around this planet anyway fortunately be
even<00:03:14.709> suggesting<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.400> these<00:03:15.519> are<00:03:15.760> small<00:03:16.030> and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
even suggesting that these are small and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.650 
even suggesting that these are small and
ice<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:21.430> what<00:03:21.820> is<00:03:21.850> my<00:03:22.090> point<00:03:22.359> well<00:03:23.880> again<00:03:24.880> whole

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
ice so what is my point well again whole

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.140 
ice so what is my point well again whole
certainly<00:03:26.170> are<00:03:26.290> not<00:03:26.320> snow<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:26.950> ice<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:28.060> I

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
certainly are not snow and ice so I

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.130 
certainly are not snow and ice so I
asked<00:03:28.450> me<00:03:28.600> something<00:03:28.840> else<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.440> reflecting

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
asked me something else that reflecting

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.289 
asked me something else that reflecting
light<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.920> I'm<00:03:33.070> possibly<00:03:33.579> giving<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.060> light

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
light and I'm possibly giving a light

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:43.590 
light and I'm possibly giving a light
off<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:36.370> fact<00:03:39.870> take<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.049> down<00:03:42.180> click<00:03:43.180> tryna
