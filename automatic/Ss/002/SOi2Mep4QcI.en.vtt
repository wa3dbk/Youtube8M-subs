bonfire<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.510> think<00:04:13.810> he<00:04:13.989> he<00:04:14.500> nailed<00:04:14.739> me<00:04:14.829> for

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
bonfire I think he he nailed me for

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.310 
bonfire I think he he nailed me for
seven<00:04:15.370> when<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.180> had<00:04:16.329> four<00:04:16.630> guys<00:04:16.810> on<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.079> board

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
seven when I had four guys on the board

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.870 
seven when I had four guys on the board
so<00:04:17.530> if<00:04:17.769> any<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.070> those<00:04:18.160> guys<00:04:18.370> was<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.669> blood

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
so if any of those guys was a blood

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.699 
so if any of those guys was a blood
artist<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.359> could<00:04:19.840> have<00:04:19.930> kept<00:04:20.109> my<00:04:20.169> life<00:04:20.350> total

artist I could have kept my life total
up<00:04:20.829> at<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.430> same<00:04:21.579> time<00:04:21.760> hitting<00:04:22.030> him<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.419> then

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
up at the same time hitting him and then

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.260 
up at the same time hitting him and then
I<00:04:22.990> wouldn't<00:04:23.289> you<00:04:23.500> know<00:04:23.550> what<00:04:24.550> wouldn't<00:04:25.120> just

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270
