I had did it for like at least five
minutes<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.700> without<00:01:45.210> someone<00:01:45.570> getting

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
minutes I think without someone getting

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.330 
minutes I think without someone getting
an<00:01:45.869> area<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.290> didn't<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.680> around<00:01:46.920> fifty<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
an area and I didn't get around fifty to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.249 
an area and I didn't get around fifty to
