of my list of priorities it was more

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.589 
of my list of priorities it was more
about<00:00:28.810> finding<00:00:29.810> some<00:00:30.019> quick<00:00:30.259> fix<00:00:30.939> some<00:00:31.939> pills

some<00:00:33.230> gadget<00:00:33.860> that<00:00:34.160> would<00:00:35.150> make<00:00:35.839> you<00:00:35.989> all<00:00:36.140> go

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
some gadget that would make you all go

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.390 
some gadget that would make you all go
away<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:37.269> make<00:00:38.269> me<00:00:38.390> feel<00:00:38.540> well<00:00:38.750> again<00:00:39.400> but

away and make me feel well again but

away and make me feel well again but
then<00:00:40.610> this<00:00:41.330> was<00:00:41.629> understandable<00:00:42.350> because

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
then this was understandable because

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.820 
then this was understandable because
I've<00:00:42.769> never<00:00:43.010> had<00:00:43.659> anything<00:00:44.659> like<00:00:44.869> this<00:00:45.110> before

taking a week off school when I was
working<00:00:59.600> in<00:00:59.689> London<00:00:59.869> I<00:01:00.379> might<00:01:00.830> have<00:01:01.070> had<00:01:01.250> an

working in London I might have had an

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.539 
working in London I might have had an
odd<00:01:02.269> day<00:01:02.570> or<00:01:02.629> two<00:01:03.019> in<00:01:03.500> all<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.860> years<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.309> worked

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
odd day or two in all the years I worked

odd day or two in all the years I worked
there<00:01:05.020> off<00:01:06.020> work<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:08.060> here<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.420> was<00:01:08.830> with

there off work and here I was with

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.669 
there off work and here I was with
clearly<00:01:11.380> something<00:01:13.929> pretty<00:01:14.929> fundamentally

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
clearly something pretty fundamentally

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.819 
clearly something pretty fundamentally
wrong<00:01:15.829> with<00:01:15.890> me<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:16.990> only<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.200> was<00:01:18.500> on<00:01:18.679> my

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
wrong with me and only that I was on my

own because the medical establishment

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.989 
own because the medical establishment
not<00:01:23.179> only<00:01:23.509> did<00:01:23.689> they<00:01:23.869> not<00:01:23.899> offer<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.499> solution

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
not only did they not offer a solution

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:28.419 
not only did they not offer a solution
they<00:01:25.999> didn't<00:01:26.390> even<00:01:26.509> recognize<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:28.219> my

they didn't even recognize that my

they didn't even recognize that my
condition<00:01:28.999> existed<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.909> when<00:01:32.509> I<00:01:32.539> did<00:01:32.840> my<00:01:32.990> first

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
condition existed so when I did my first

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.300 
condition existed so when I did my first
cleanse<00:01:34.749> my<00:01:35.749> first<00:01:36.109> detox<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.429> I<00:01:38.090> felt<00:01:38.450> this

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
cleanse my first detox and I felt this

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.300 
cleanse my first detox and I felt this
immediate<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:41.119> short-lived<00:01:42.159> improvement<00:01:43.159> in

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
immediate but short-lived improvement in

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.090 
immediate but short-lived improvement in
my<00:01:43.490> condition<00:01:43.759> I<00:01:44.590> knew<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.619> was<00:01:45.920> on<00:01:46.069> to

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
my condition I knew I was on to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.870 
my condition I knew I was on to
something

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
something

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.020 
something
I<00:01:47.109> knew<00:01:48.189> that<00:01:49.189> toxins<00:01:49.939> had<00:01:50.179> a<00:01:50.210> role<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.780> play<00:01:50.810> in

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
I knew that toxins had a role to play in

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.919 
I knew that toxins had a role to play in
how<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.060> was<00:01:53.299> feeling<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.229> started<00:01:58.009> to

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
how I was feeling and so I started to

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.749 
how I was feeling and so I started to
make<00:01:59.929> dietary<00:02:00.289> improvements<00:02:01.249> I<00:02:01.429> started

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
make dietary improvements I started

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.039 
make dietary improvements I started
being<00:02:01.880> careful<00:02:02.329> about<00:02:02.509> when<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.719> was<00:02:02.869> eating

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
being careful about when I was eating

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.590 
being careful about when I was eating
rather<00:02:03.560> than<00:02:03.709> just<00:02:03.889> eating<00:02:04.100> when<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.090> felt<00:02:05.420> like

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
rather than just eating when I felt like

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.919 
rather than just eating when I felt like
eating<00:02:05.990> what<00:02:06.679> most<00:02:06.920> people<00:02:07.249> do<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:07.929> started

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
eating what most people do I started

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.360 
eating what most people do I started
looking<00:02:09.259> at<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.830> nutritional<00:02:10.459> angle<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.370> I

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
looking at the nutritional angle and I

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.740 
looking at the nutritional angle and I
started<00:02:13.790> eating<00:02:13.970> more<00:02:14.480> whole<00:02:16.090> organic<00:02:17.090> and

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
started eating more whole organic and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.930 
started eating more whole organic and
foods<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:21.660> also<00:02:23.180> noticed<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:25.580> how<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> was

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
foods and I also noticed that how I was

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.830 
foods and I also noticed that how I was
feeling<00:02:28.130> also<00:02:29.130> had<00:02:29.640> an<00:02:29.730> impact<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.390> my

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
feeling also had an impact on my

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.610 
feeling also had an impact on my
symptoms<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.980> that's<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.250> say<00:02:32.460> on<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> given<00:02:33.000> day

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
symptoms so that's to say on a given day

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.100 
symptoms so that's to say on a given day
if<00:02:34.620> my<00:02:35.370> symptoms<00:02:36.030> were<00:02:38.600> normal<00:02:39.600> my<00:02:39.780> sense<00:02:40.020> of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
if my symptoms were normal my sense of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.760 
if my symptoms were normal my sense of
electrical<00:02:40.650> sensitivity<00:02:40.920> were<00:02:41.510> normal<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.770> I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
electrical sensitivity were normal and I

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.630 
electrical sensitivity were normal and I
would<00:02:44.730> maybe<00:02:45.570> get<00:02:45.900> some<00:02:46.050> bad<00:02:46.230> news<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.860> have<00:02:47.490> an

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
would maybe get some bad news or have an

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.570 
would maybe get some bad news or have an
argument<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:49.410> would<00:02:49.560> start<00:02:50.160> feeling

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
argument and I would start feeling

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.530 
argument and I would start feeling
irritable<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.630> upset<00:02:51.989> then<00:02:52.920> my<00:02:53.550> symptoms<00:02:54.150> of

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
irritable and upset then my symptoms of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.790 
irritable and upset then my symptoms of
electrical<00:02:55.290> sensitivity<00:02:55.560> would<00:02:56.160> deteriorate

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
electrical sensitivity would deteriorate

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.220 
electrical sensitivity would deteriorate
and<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.980> made<00:03:02.310> me<00:03:02.489> realize<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.110> was

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
and this made me realize that there was

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
and this made me realize that there was
more<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> two<00:03:05.489> toxins<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:07.110> than<00:03:07.709> what<00:03:08.040> went

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
more to two toxins that than what went

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.360 
more to two toxins that than what went
past<00:03:08.580> my<00:03:08.730> lips<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.560> idea<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:13.370> my

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
past my lips and the idea that my

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.290 
past my lips and the idea that my
emotional<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.480> mental<00:03:15.780> state<00:03:19.340> had<00:03:20.340> some<00:03:20.820> sort

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
emotional and mental state had some sort

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.190 
emotional and mental state had some sort
of<00:03:21.420> influence<00:03:21.980> over<00:03:22.980> my<00:03:23.690> condition<00:03:24.690> over<00:03:24.930> my

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
of influence over my condition over my

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.430 
of influence over my condition over my
electrical<00:03:25.799> sensitivity<00:03:26.690> began<00:03:27.690> bit<00:03:28.200> by<00:03:28.410> bit

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
electrical sensitivity began bit by bit

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.410 
electrical sensitivity began bit by bit
to<00:03:29.100> gain<00:03:29.730> credence

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
to gain credence

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.770 
to gain credence
so<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.780> started<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.590> research<00:03:34.519> this<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:36.390> this

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
so I started to research this this this

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.220 
so I started to research this this this
concept<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.519> came<00:03:38.730> across<00:03:38.970> some<00:03:39.330> work<00:03:39.540> by<00:03:39.840> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
concept and I came across some work by a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.220 
concept and I came across some work by a
Nobel<00:03:40.920> prize-winning<00:03:41.930> psychiatrists<00:03:42.930> called

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
Nobel prize-winning psychiatrists called

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.180 
Nobel prize-winning psychiatrists called
dr.<00:03:43.709> David<00:03:44.010> Hawkins<00:03:44.900> who<00:03:45.900> developed<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.920> means

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
dr. David Hawkins who developed a means

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.610 
dr. David Hawkins who developed a means
of<00:03:48.620> calibrating<00:03:50.299> emotions<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.690> processes

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
of calibrating emotions and processes

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.860 
of calibrating emotions and processes
and<00:03:53.180> he<00:03:54.180> calibrated<00:03:55.579> peace<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.820> love<00:03:56.970> he

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
and he calibrated peace and love he

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.420 
and he calibrated peace and love he
found<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.350> was<00:03:58.620> calibrated<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
found that that was calibrated in the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.380 
found that that was calibrated in the
five<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.970> six-hundred<00:04:00.269> range<00:04:01.400> while<00:04:02.400> other

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
five to six-hundred range while other

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.830 
five to six-hundred range while other
feelings<00:04:03.930> like<00:04:04.340> apathy<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.610> despair<00:04:06.120> were

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
feelings like apathy and despair were

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.729 
feelings like apathy and despair were
calibrated<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:08.390> around<00:04:09.390> 50<00:04:09.780> mark<00:04:09.989> has<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.560> say

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
calibrated in around 50 mark has to say

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.979 
calibrated in around 50 mark has to say
ten<00:04:11.160> times<00:04:11.489> less<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:13.410> really<00:04:13.829> reading<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:14.370> I

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
ten times less so really reading this I

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.800 
ten times less so really reading this I
realized<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.579> lower<00:04:18.560> calibrated<00:04:19.560> feelings

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
realized that lower calibrated feelings

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.920 
realized that lower calibrated feelings
combined<00:04:21.810> with<00:04:22.290> an<00:04:22.620> existing<00:04:23.930> tolerable

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
combined with an existing tolerable

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.089 
combined with an existing tolerable
level<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:26.100> electrical<00:04:26.820> sensitivity

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
level of electrical sensitivity

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.090 
level of electrical sensitivity
could<00:04:29.960> the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
could the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.920 
could the
up<00:04:31.750> into<00:04:32.750> full-blown<00:04:34.330> unbearable<00:04:35.330> electrical

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
up into full-blown unbearable electrical

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.610 
up into full-blown unbearable electrical
sensitivity<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:37.420> so<00:04:38.420> it<00:04:38.750> became<00:04:39.110> clear<00:04:39.590> that

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
sensitivity and so it became clear that

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.100 
sensitivity and so it became clear that
the<00:04:40.100> causes<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:41.120> my<00:04:41.860> electrical<00:04:42.860> sensitivity

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
the causes of my electrical sensitivity

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.070 
the causes of my electrical sensitivity
was<00:04:45.340> toxins<00:04:46.360> but<00:04:47.360> toxins<00:04:49.150> in<00:04:50.150> in<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.840> broadest

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
was toxins but toxins in in the broadest

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.670 
was toxins but toxins in in the broadest
sense<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:55.130> also<00:04:55.340> became<00:04:55.820> clear<00:04:56.620> by<00:04:57.620> the

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
sense and it also became clear by the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.450 
sense and it also became clear by the
same<00:04:58.010> note<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.710> electromagnetic

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
same note that the electromagnetic

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.450 
same note that the electromagnetic
fields<00:05:02.120> were<00:05:02.750> not<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:03.110> sole<00:05:03.500> and<00:05:03.830> unique

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
fields were not the sole and unique

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.700 
fields were not the sole and unique
cause<00:05:05.300> of<00:05:06.200> my<00:05:07.150> electrical<00:05:08.150> sensitivity<00:05:08.840> but

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
cause of my electrical sensitivity but

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.860 
cause of my electrical sensitivity but
were<00:05:10.040> rather<00:05:10.810> a<00:05:11.810> trigger<00:05:12.380> mechanism<00:05:13.720> as<00:05:14.720> to

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
were rather a trigger mechanism as to

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.600 
were rather a trigger mechanism as to
say<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.080> bit<00:05:15.320> like<00:05:15.530> a<00:05:15.560> a<00:05:16.070> load<00:05:16.460> of<00:05:16.610> gum<00:05:16.880> where<00:05:18.610> you

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
say a bit like a a load of gum where you

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.100 
say a bit like a a load of gum where you
have<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.970> carthage<00:05:20.480> in<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.560> chamber<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.110> the

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
have the carthage in the chamber and the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.220 
have the carthage in the chamber and the
trigger<00:05:24.740> detonates<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.760> cartridge<00:05:26.600> which

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
trigger detonates the cartridge which

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.710 
trigger detonates the cartridge which
fires<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.710> gun<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:28.370> here<00:05:29.150> we<00:05:29.360> can<00:05:29.570> equate<00:05:30.100> the

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
fires the gun and here we can equate the

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.850 
fires the gun and here we can equate the
cartridge<00:05:32.720> with<00:05:33.560> toxins<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:35.570> EMFs<00:05:36.170> with

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
cartridge with toxins and the EMFs with

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.130 
cartridge with toxins and the EMFs with
the<00:05:37.040> trigger<00:05:37.310> so<00:05:38.000> it's<00:05:38.120> only<00:05:38.270> when<00:05:38.540> you<00:05:38.810> put

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
the trigger so it's only when you put

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.780 
the trigger so it's only when you put
the<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:40.090> ems<00:05:41.090> with<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:41.990> toxins<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.800> you<00:05:43.550> get

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
the the ems with the toxins that you get

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.710 
the the ems with the toxins that you get
the<00:05:44.000> electrical<00:05:44.510> sensitivity<00:05:45.670> and<00:05:46.720> this

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
the electrical sensitivity and this

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.650 
the electrical sensitivity and this
explains<00:05:48.380> why<00:05:48.790> beating<00:05:49.790> electrical

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
explains why beating electrical

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.300 
explains why beating electrical
sensitivity<00:05:51.220> is<00:05:52.220> so<00:05:52.700> difficult<00:05:53.000> because

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
sensitivity is so difficult because

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.550 
sensitivity is so difficult because
unless<00:05:55.310> you<00:05:55.640> embrace<00:05:56.360> this<00:05:56.630> idea<00:05:57.310> that<00:05:59.560> it's

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
unless you embrace this idea that it's

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.610 
unless you embrace this idea that it's
electrical<00:06:01.490> sensitivities<00:06:02.180> caused<00:06:02.630> by<00:06:03.080> all

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
electrical sensitivities caused by all

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.230 
electrical sensitivities caused by all
these<00:06:04.070> toxins<00:06:05.110> then<00:06:06.110> any<00:06:07.030> attempts<00:06:08.030> at

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
these toxins then any attempts at

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.170 
these toxins then any attempts at
treating<00:06:08.870> your<00:06:09.140> condition<00:06:09.620> is<00:06:10.280> doomed<00:06:10.880> for

treating your condition is doomed for

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.310 
treating your condition is doomed for
for<00:06:11.900> failure<00:06:12.260> and<00:06:12.520> this<00:06:13.520> is<00:06:13.790> the<00:06:14.320> paradigm

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
for failure and this is the paradigm
