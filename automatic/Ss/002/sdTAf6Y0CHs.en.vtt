00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.480 
hammer and this craft was originally
created<00:00:19.539> for<00:00:20.539> my<00:00:21.169> understanding<00:00:21.829> to<00:00:22.460> help

created for my understanding to help
children<00:00:23.449> with<00:00:23.480> their<00:00:23.869> colors<00:00:24.259> their<00:00:24.679> shapes

and<00:00:25.900> their<00:00:26.900> motor<00:00:27.349> skills<00:00:27.739> so<00:00:28.519> they<00:00:28.699> could

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
and their motor skills so they could

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.330 
and their motor skills so they could
build<00:00:29.329> the<00:00:29.539> shapes<00:00:29.779> with<00:00:30.199> little<00:00:30.769> beads<00:00:33.340> so

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
build the shapes with little beads so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.780 
build the shapes with little beads so

as quickly so maybe put a piece of felt
or<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:16.970> piece<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.360> cloth<00:01:17.630> underneath

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
or a piece of cloth underneath

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.620 
or a piece of cloth underneath
now<00:01:21.220> with<00:01:22.220> these<00:01:22.370> peg<00:01:22.729> boards<00:01:23.090> they<00:01:23.210> come<00:01:23.420> in<00:01:23.540> a

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
now with these peg boards they come in a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.010 
now with these peg boards they come in a
wide<00:01:23.810> variety<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.470> shapes<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.100> sizes<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:26.020> as

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
wide variety of shapes and sizes and as

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.500 
wide variety of shapes and sizes and as
you<00:01:27.110> can<00:01:27.200> see<00:01:27.260> this<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.979> star<00:01:28.400> but<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.120> opted

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
you can see this is a star but I opted

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.469 
you can see this is a star but I opted
to<00:01:29.540> try<00:01:30.020> make<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.590> letter<00:01:30.860> V<00:01:31.159> this<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:31.909> my<00:01:32.090> second

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
to try make a letter V this is my second

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.070 
to try make a letter V this is my second
attempt<00:01:32.900> my<00:01:33.890> first<00:01:34.130> attempt<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.690> over<00:01:35.690> ironed

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
attempt my first attempt I over ironed

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.270 
attempt my first attempt I over ironed
it<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:38.150> there's<00:01:38.810> no<00:01:39.080> holes<00:01:39.409> on<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.830> other<00:01:39.860> side

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
it so there's no holes on the other side

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.240 
it so there's no holes on the other side
and<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:41.120> would<00:01:41.180> I<00:01:41.659> really<00:01:41.930> need<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.740> holes<00:01:42.950> on

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
and I would I really need the holes on

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.940 
and I would I really need the holes on
both<00:01:43.310> sides<00:01:44.260> because<00:01:45.260> I<00:01:45.440> have<00:01:45.650> some

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
both sides because I have some

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.850 
both sides because I have some
reflective<00:01:46.760> string<00:01:47.350> then<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.380> would<00:01:48.590> like<00:01:48.740> to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
reflective string then I would like to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.000 
reflective string then I would like to
weave<00:01:49.100> through<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:51.020> make<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.260> night<00:01:51.500> reflector

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
weave through and make a night reflector

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.789 
weave through and make a night reflector
because<00:01:53.000> where<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:53.210> live<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.540> Finland<00:01:53.930> it<00:01:54.590> can

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
because where I live in Finland it can

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.899 
because where I live in Finland it can
start<00:01:55.100> very<00:01:55.369> quickly<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:57.520> very<00:01:58.520> early

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
start very quickly and very early

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.550

throughout the fall and all through the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.280 
throughout the fall and all through the
winter<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:02.030> it's<00:02:02.270> mandatory<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:03.080> wear

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
winter so it's mandatory that we wear

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.410 
winter so it's mandatory that we wear
these<00:02:03.470> on<00:02:03.799> our<00:02:04.130> jackets<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:04.760> purses<00:02:05.240> or

as<00:04:01.050> one<00:04:01.230> piece<00:04:01.730> now<00:04:02.730> I'm<00:04:03.030> going<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:04.700> carefully

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
as one piece now I'm going to carefully

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.250 
as one piece now I'm going to carefully
I<00:04:10.130> suppose<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.250> could<00:04:11.310> peel<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.820> off<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.330> iron

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
I suppose I could peel it off and iron

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.870 
I suppose I could peel it off and iron
it<00:04:13.470> again<00:04:13.739> with<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.010> parchment<00:04:14.400> paper<00:04:14.430> but

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.610 
it again with the parchment paper but
because<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.239> already<00:04:15.330> folded<00:04:15.630> my<00:04:15.870> paper<00:04:16.079> in

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
because I already folded my paper in

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.470 
because I already folded my paper in
half<00:04:18.560> I'm<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.890> going<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.220> open<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.940> up<00:04:21.060> and

half I'm just going to open it up and

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.560 
half I'm just going to open it up and
then<00:04:21.600> fold<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.019> on<00:04:22.230> top<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:23.760> be<00:04:24.090> careful

that<00:04:24.810> I<00:04:24.840> do<00:04:24.960> not<00:04:25.230> pull<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.070> iron<00:04:26.460> like<00:04:26.730> I<00:04:26.760> did

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
that I do not pull the iron like I did

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.580 
that I do not pull the iron like I did
the<00:04:27.090> first<00:04:27.240> time<00:04:32.540> so<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.720> is<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:33.960> relatively
