back he makes it basically impossible to
get

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
get

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.209 
get
pass<00:02:16.359> because<00:02:16.540> his<00:02:16.750> pace<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.620> then<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:18.069> go<00:02:18.189> into

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
pass because his pace so then we go into

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.069 
pass because his pace so then we go into
another<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.670> them<00:02:18.879> Pacey<00:02:19.420> sent<00:02:19.750> about<00:02:19.870> and

it costs the person 415 k i'm not too

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.360 
it costs the person 415 k i'm not too
sure<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.900> what<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> actual<00:02:26.709> prices<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:27.219> him

I'd<00:02:28.150> I'm<00:02:28.269> not<00:02:28.390> sure<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.599> it's<00:02:28.659> a<00:02:28.780> team<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:29.079> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
I'd I'm not sure if it's a team of the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.770 
I'd I'm not sure if it's a team of the
year<00:02:29.170> one<00:02:29.409> of<00:02:29.439> a<00:02:29.650> normal<00:02:29.890> F<00:02:30.819> normally<00:02:31.450> full<00:02:31.659> I

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
year one of a normal F normally full I

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.099 
year one of a normal F normally full I
think<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.049> might<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.489> team<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.579> week<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.109> he

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
think it might be a team the week so he

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.490 
think it might be a team the week so he
his<00:02:35.829> stats<00:02:36.329> ridiculous<00:02:37.329> yeah<00:02:37.959> he's<00:02:38.170> one<00:02:38.349> that

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
his stats ridiculous yeah he's one that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.050 
his stats ridiculous yeah he's one that
I<00:02:38.530> think<00:02:38.709> he's<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.859> third<00:02:39.159> door<00:02:39.430> joint<00:02:39.760> third

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
I think he's a third door joint third

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.479 
I think he's a third door joint third
and<00:02:40.389> most<00:02:40.629> fast<00:02:40.989> sent<00:02:41.650> back<00:02:41.829> on<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.069> game<00:02:42.280> and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.479 
defendants so overall not too bad and
costing<00:03:22.840> 2.7<00:03:23.409> cake<00:03:23.590> pregame<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.040> lot<00:03:24.190> cheaper

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
costing 2.7 cake pregame a lot cheaper

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.460 
costing 2.7 cake pregame a lot cheaper
that<00:03:24.609> now<00:03:24.790> see<00:03:25.419> ya<00:03:25.510> he<00:03:25.629> doesn't<00:03:25.900> seem<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.260> bad
