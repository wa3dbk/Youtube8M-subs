00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:11.519
 with eflow is actually a program around 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.500
 to learn to move better 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.019
 It's really about trying 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.319
 Movement of the individual fight 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:25.800
 to understand positions and for yourself in 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:27.109
 to implement the gymnastics so that you can 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.789
 oneself 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.360
 Just coordinate this exercise for now 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.350
 Before you can partner with one 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.330
 he also works in addition 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.330
 with dimension for itself 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.070
 The partner work is generally that way 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.000
 I still have someone of the cr-z 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.390
 also around me 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.460
 I saw him around and that's it again 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.310
 an unknown in the whole equation 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.440
 Of course it is nice if you are 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.329
 trained and can first on the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.950
 actual movement and the actual 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.540
 focus on the movement principle 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.920
 the program which flowed so structured 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.840
 that the individual movements only 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.420
 can train and also really 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.140
 Understands what you are in the application for 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.990
 that means we have again and again 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.299
 single examples where you insert 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.530
 can see how that applied in the fight 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.530
 what is being trained right now 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.520
 in the end, it should be like that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.549
 you fight this movement 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.659
 really can feel too and with one 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.659
 partner can then implement 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:44.789
 from the single exercise of the single of 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 the individual movement should be 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.399
 it will be able to be later on too 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.109
 to combine this movement 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:58.319
 meaningful contiguous 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:02:00.990
 small choreographies of creativity 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.859
 is actually no no in native low 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.889
 limit set 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.749
 So what we offer here on the dvd 

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:08.190
 or what I show here is 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.100
 actually an excitation forms with 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 basis for these fighting moves too 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.460
 understand and be quite own 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.800
 thoughts to 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.260
 which movements you additionally in 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.900
 would like to install his gymnastics 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.420
 gymnastics matic flow is actually 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.760
 ideal if you do not have one 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.140
 training partner has with himself 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.390
 to train, so to speak 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.430
 to be even better in the ground fight 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.560
 be in grappling in the elm and the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.060
 gymnastics mat flow is above all things 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.620
 good for a warm-up too 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.470
 For example, in the group 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.510
 group exercises and warms up 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.560
 You can practice these exercises 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.560
 wonderful to incorporate
