00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
 Gunpra Kitt Review of the Memories Heavy Duty Machine L Gaim 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.410
 Base machine works 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.880
 Works will appear in the anime heavy fighter L Gaim 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:18.140
 On the launching rail at the top of the machine that is the base machine for heavy metal 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.630
 It is possible to carry heavy metal and carry it and there are 4 floating units at the bottom of the aircraft 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.810
 Land and sea thanks to the system 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.120
 A stable high school while floating is possible 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.330
 As a chain unit with high maintenance ability and habitability 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:35.190
 Oh Daa of was quite finished machine 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.540
 The weapon is the power launcher for escorts and the power of the minister laser cannon L 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.430
 It's being housed in the rear of the aircraft launchers and binder is Gaim and spiral 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.540
 Doing Nante docking center stand up to the flashy soil safely to N Which of the flow 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.700
 I did not give you 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:56.170
 The hero of Dabamairodo and everyone received the planet core 6, which was the beginning of the stage it is in the play 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:01.000
 We have but a country I think I was riding at the time came to do from the village Amu garter of fore 6 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.960
 There will be almost no turn after coming , but until then, with the support mechanism of Ale Takeru 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.860
 And it was a big success 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.890
 Surely the price is 600 yen, I feel like a little smaller 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.409
 It is sure that the kit itself is really good 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.570
 The biggest selling of this kit is the ability to store 1/144 Elgeim's ankle 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.040
 It is that parts are attached 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.930
 Just because there is this part , the combined scene with Land Booster Spirits also has an expression 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.250
 It feels good 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:34.409
 Why a thing that you or I thought of how the Urameshiku did not put the parts from the beginning 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.130
 Because I'm already glued, I have to buy a new L-Gaim or break parts and start over 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.600
 Because there is no way 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:46.909
 Works is what was bought to everyone usually Nde there was a surprisingly popular 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.020
 It feels good to remodeling of the classic is modified so as to be able to run reproduce it by crane cockpit 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.820
 What 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:57.500
 There are a lot of people who want to reproduce the combined scene of Ikubu which is after all spiral flow and plastic lumber 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.940
 I'm forced to stand with a wire or something, but there is a way to fix El Gaim 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.260
 It 's something I was at a loss for sure . 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:10.240
 If you changed the harmful 6 of the high complete model and the super high complete model 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.920
 It was a kit to make it handy as a pedestal. Even now with high grade version of El Gaim 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.220
 You can use it 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.560
 Figure of early arm Ya was in the Gaim of Super High Complete model 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.500
 Spiral flow is also attached 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:26.820
 It was a good feeling to put it on the work , but the guy who bought it is yeah yeah 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.950
 Sunge higher was Nde I Nante Octopus or game bocce I'm could not buy 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.230
 It was echoing that I bought by force. 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.400
 Tohoho 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.849
 Of course, Octopus played down and the battery cost also sounded like a wallet 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.849
 I met you
