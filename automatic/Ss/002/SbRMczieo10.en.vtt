00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hi, I'm Manuel HernÃ¡ndez , double your 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.990
 reading speed I want now 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.080
 show you in this video 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.920
 and make you a little reflection about 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.930
 of reading about books 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.410
 because we have to read you've 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.439
 asked once remember that of 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.439
 boy 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.400
 Many times they asked you something to read 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.400
 one chapter one page 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.610
 or several sheets 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.430
 they were responsible for reading 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.910
 several sheets of a book and you felt 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.540
 bad because they never taught you to read 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 tastefully with passion with joy 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.030
 then now you need to read 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.750
 because you have a need to read 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.360
 because you have to submit a thesis 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.680
 or you have to do a thesis or you have 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.530
 have to take an exam and you have to 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.920
 study and you have to read and you have left 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.680
 little time to do it good for that 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.800
 now there are reading techniques 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.860
 fast these techniques are applicable in 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.990
 a traditional book like this one but 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.909
 see what I want to tell you 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.850
 only in a traditional book 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:28.200
 you can also apply it in 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.030
 a tablet 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 you do not necessarily have to have a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.890
 tablet to be able to read fast by 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.200
 course but that is an option that is 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.020
 happening and maybe you have one or 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.479
 have more than one tablet or a cell phone 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.869
 where you can handle the images 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.000
 make them bigger or smaller 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.600
 according to your need and you can see the text 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.140
 or the letters of a form 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.130
 more comfortable to your liking and notice that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.890
 you can do this read it more comfortably 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.830
 or more elegantly as you wish 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.920
 but you will read faster now if you 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.680
 questions really I will be able to 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.690
 read faster on a tablet 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.600
 Clear 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.570
 You will be able to apply the same techniques 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.320
 it's true that in my course I speak 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:30.010
 only from the use of techniques 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.320
 in a book but soon I'm going to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.040
 update that information and then 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.630
 I'm going to tell you that the difference is that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.640
 this is a paper 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.640
 and this is 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.880
 an electronic equipment where you go to 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.790
 use the screen as if it were the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.370
 page of a book the screen as if 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.580
 out a page and you're going to apply the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.430
 same techniques that you are going to learn in 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.599
 my course you are going to apply each technique 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.269
 reading capturing the information 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:13.330
 exactly in the same way as in a 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.490
 traditional book 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.430
 only here you are going to have more 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.620
 comfort so that's why I wanted 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.200
 show you this and tell you that from 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.630
 any way if you apply the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.760
 techniques in a traditional book 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.760
 you can apply it in the same way 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.760
 a tablet or on a computer like 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.450
 is where I'm recording what's important 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.390
 is that you learn quick reading 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.650
 fast looking for information and 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.409
 Finding it quickly you realize 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.920
 that's the difference between reading from a 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:56.360
 slow bored traditional way are you going to 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.739
 learn to read fast fun and you're going to 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.159
 find more information 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.040
 quick for that I wanted to remind you that 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:08.330
 if you are interested in this topic of reading 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.270
 fast enter the link below 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.460
 I'm going to give you an initial guide pdf 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.489
 where you can start to apply the 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.070
 techniques that are going to take you to that 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.290
 quick reading path so 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.290
 take advantage of it later
