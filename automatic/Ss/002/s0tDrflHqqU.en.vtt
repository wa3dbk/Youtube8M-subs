going to affect the game there all right

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.600 
going to affect the game there all right
so<00:03:06.600> let's<00:03:06.750> say<00:03:06.870> we're<00:03:06.990> going<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.170> do<00:03:07.580> when<00:03:08.580> I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
so let's say we're going to do when I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.030 
so let's say we're going to do when I
use<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:09.150> commands<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.050> command<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.590> turn<00:03:10.830> off

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.490 
use do commands the command to turn off
the<00:03:11.280> full<00:03:11.520> screen<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:13.050> command<00:03:13.380> to

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the full screen and the command to

the full screen and the command to
restart<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.070> game<00:03:14.100> now<00:03:14.820> why<00:03:15.090> are<00:03:15.270> we<00:03:15.360> doing

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
restart the game now why are we doing

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.320 
restart the game now why are we doing
these<00:03:15.690> commands<00:03:16.080> well<00:03:17.000> because<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> go<00:03:18.270> to
