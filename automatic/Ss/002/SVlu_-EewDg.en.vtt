00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.019
 last night game of the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.999
 ending season in beauty with the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 derby between milan and inter cathay lo 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.200
 applies the turnover causes the birds to rest 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.390
 and farmer sends panucci e 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.250
 simone with regard to inter 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.949
 novelties are represented by orlando in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.990
 field with shirt number 3 and berti 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.570
 deployed from the beginning 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.340
 at the 11th minute touch of york for 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.170
 bear camp the right is central of the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.600
 stuck without problems from red two 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.820
 minutes later there is a contrast between berti and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 maldini berti stays on the ground will ask for the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 replacement in its place enters maximum 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.969
 paganin in the twentieth minute one more 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.300
 punishment for the inter manicone touches to 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.910
 nothing there is a deviation of the barrier 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 then the first goal ball of the match 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.829
 burke and very fast it snaps forward 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.449
 exceeds the Rossoneri defense but fails 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.400
 to take advantage of it at the fortieth minute 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.020
 big chance on the other side for the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.509
 milan from panucci to donadoni shooting 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.509
 and there is a big parade of walter zenga 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.970
 we are at the second time after 50 seconds 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:26.040
 the Milan goes ahead in this way 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.040
 savicevic there is a throw a direction of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.630
 Bergodi 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.640
 we have the possibility to also review 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.580
 these images are battistini e 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.130
 bergomi but now we will see the touch is 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.200
 of bergomas 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:44.770
 milan, therefore, in the tenth position 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.960
 Albertini minutes to savicevic forward 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.619
 serves simone great shot just outside 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.110
 and then there is another boban roll 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:02.490
 of zeng commits zeng to the quarter of an hour 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.100
 massaro enters boban da's place 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.680
 maldini to simone insidious shooting of the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.030
 Milan number 11 Milan 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.760
 he is practically the owner of the field 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.270
 on the other side there is only one shot 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.300
 weak 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.730
 from record burke 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.650
 the half hour we saw Fontolan 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.640
 limp from the beginning and leave the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.640
 place to squelch totò 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.190
 the inter wakes up but maybe it's a bit 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.470
 late three minutes later by bert kancheli 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.300
 move diagonal left out to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.100
 fortieth minute corner kick of 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.410
 york orlando corrects head and 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.230
 opportunistic shit like the old ones 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.420
 times puts on the net 1 to 1 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.510
 also in this case we have the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.170
 chance to review the goal of totò 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590
 schillaci 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.670
 seems over but there is the usual farmer 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.480
 inadequate the Milan back in advantage 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.239
 there is probably a deviation of 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.280
 manicone then amedeo goria will show us 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.010
 if there is this deviation 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.840
 there is still room to applaud 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.959
 savicevic but also walter zenga 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.160
 the game ends 2 1 and now for the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.150
 technical comment 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.150
 let's hear sandro ciotti
