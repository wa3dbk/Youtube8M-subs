00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
that stop people creating images that

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.670 
that stop people creating images that
are<00:03:31.000> exciting<00:03:31.510> creating<00:03:31.840> images<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.560> are<00:03:32.650> a

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
are exciting creating images that are a

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
you and there's something else we're

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.260 
you and there's something else we're
trying<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:39.040> communicate<00:03:39.700> when<00:03:39.880> we<00:03:40.000> take<00:03:40.240> a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
trying to communicate when we take a

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.930 
trying to communicate when we take a
photograph<00:03:40.600> because<00:03:41.230> inherently<00:03:41.940> something

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
photograph because inherently something

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.030 
photograph because inherently something
in<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.510> scene<00:03:43.990> that<00:03:44.320> we<00:03:44.440> photographed

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
in that scene that we photographed

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.890 
in that scene that we photographed
whenever<00:03:45.520> it<00:03:45.700> happens<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.240> be<00:03:46.270> whether<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.780> be

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
whenever it happens to be whether it be

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.449 
whenever it happens to be whether it be
a<00:03:46.930> landscape<00:03:47.560> whether<00:03:47.740> it<00:03:47.920> be<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> macro

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
a landscape whether it be a macro

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.949 
a landscape whether it be a macro
photograph<00:03:48.880> whether<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.240> be<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.360> portrait<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.870> a

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
photograph whether it be a portrait of a

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.560 
photograph whether it be a portrait of a
person<00:03:50.040> there<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.070> something<00:03:51.640> there<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.180> we

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
person there is something there that we

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.199 
person there is something there that we
want<00:03:52.870> other<00:03:53.200> people<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:53.980> see<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
want other people to see and the

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.840 
want other people to see and the
question<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.750> what<00:03:56.260> is<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.920> in<00:03:57.220> order<00:03:57.640> to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
question is what is that in order to

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.210 
question is what is that in order to
really<00:03:58.209> explore<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.320> we<00:03:59.590> have<00:03:59.860> to<00:04:00.100> be

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
really explore that we have to be

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.449 
really explore that we have to be
willing<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.700> turn<00:04:00.970> off<00:04:01.360> our<00:04:01.780> brain<00:04:02.350> filter<00:04:02.950> now

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
willing to turn off our brain filter now

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.340 
willing to turn off our brain filter now
our<00:04:03.730> brain<00:04:04.000> filter<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.720> something<00:04:05.140> that<00:04:05.260> we

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
our brain filter is something that we

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.320 
our brain filter is something that we
all<00:04:05.560> have<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:06.160> it's<00:04:06.520> something<00:04:06.700> that<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:07.030> use

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
all have and it's something that we use

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.500 
all have and it's something that we use
to<00:04:07.959> manage<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.340> deal<00:04:09.610> with<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:10.000> world<00:04:10.209> around

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
to manage and deal with the world around

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.510 
to manage and deal with the world around
us<00:04:10.750> because<00:04:11.290> we<00:04:11.440> are<00:04:11.560> constantly<00:04:12.250> bombarded

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
us because we are constantly bombarded

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.990 
us because we are constantly bombarded
with<00:04:13.120> stimuli<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.200> our<00:04:14.950> brain<00:04:15.370> in<00:04:15.700> order<00:04:15.790> to

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
with stimuli and our brain in order to

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.599 
with stimuli and our brain in order to
cope<00:04:16.239> with<00:04:16.420> that<00:04:16.510> stimuli<00:04:17.430> categorizes<00:04:18.430> it

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
cope with that stimuli categorizes it

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.340 
cope with that stimuli categorizes it
and<00:04:18.760> files<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.450> away<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:19.690> that<00:04:19.840> we<00:04:20.020> don't<00:04:20.200> have

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
and files it away so that we don't have

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.350 
and files it away so that we don't have
to<00:04:20.500> deal<00:04:20.709> with<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.190> try<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.400> understand<00:04:22.150> it

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
to deal with it and try to understand it

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.900 
to deal with it and try to understand it
all<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:23.050> time<00:04:23.290> an<00:04:23.560> example<00:04:24.340> is<00:04:24.460> right<00:04:24.610> here

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
all the time an example is right here

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.650 
all the time an example is right here
okay

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
okay

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.330 
okay
I've<00:04:25.870> got<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.080> chair<00:04:26.440> that<00:04:26.830> I'm<00:04:26.919> holding<00:04:27.220> in<00:04:27.310> my

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
I've got a chair that I'm holding in my

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.990 
I've got a chair that I'm holding in my
hand

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
hand

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.700 
hand
and<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.330> see<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.750> chair<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.350> your<00:04:29.530> brain

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
and you see this chair and your brain

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.190 
and you see this chair and your brain
recognizes<00:04:30.160> this<00:04:30.730> as<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.910> chair<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.990> says

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
recognizes this as a chair and it says

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.650 
recognizes this as a chair and it says
that's<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.560> chair<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.220> sit<00:04:33.250> in<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.000> then

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
that's a chair you sit in it and then

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.990 
that's a chair you sit in it and then
your<00:04:35.080> brain<00:04:35.320> shuts<00:04:35.590> off<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.130> ignores<00:04:36.700> this

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
your brain shuts off and ignores this

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.150 
your brain shuts off and ignores this
chair<00:04:37.420> because<00:04:38.230> you<00:04:38.410> have<00:04:38.560> understood<00:04:39.100> what

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
chair because you have understood what

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.740 
chair because you have understood what
it<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.790> you<00:04:39.850> know<00:04:40.030> its<00:04:40.180> function<00:04:40.600> you

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
it is and you know its function you

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.270 
it is and you know its function you
don't<00:04:40.930> have<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.200> worry<00:04:41.470> about<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.950> or<00:04:42.070> deal

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
don't have to worry about it or deal

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.870 
don't have to worry about it or deal
with<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.670> but<00:04:43.240> if<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:44.890> were<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.130> take<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.460> moment

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
with it but if you were to take a moment

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.530 
with it but if you were to take a moment
