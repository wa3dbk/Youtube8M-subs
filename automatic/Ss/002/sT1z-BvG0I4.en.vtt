that<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.850> finally<00:01:00.329> got<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> spawn<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:02.039> route

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250

I<00:01:02.460> ran<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.510> core<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> Ariat<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.680> act<00:01:05.040> 3<00:01:05.540> the

I ran was the core of Ariat in act 3 the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
I ran was the core of Ariat in act 3 the
reason<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.930> chose<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.350> core<00:01:07.530> area<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.100> because

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
reason I chose the core area is because

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.260 
reason I chose the core area is because
it<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.850> small<00:01:09.390> area<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> linear

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
keep running by all the monsters and I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.960 
keep running by all the monsters and I
would<00:01:43.380> only<00:01:43.530> stop<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> couple<00:01:44.520> reasons

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
would only stop for a couple reasons

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.200 
would only stop for a couple reasons
first<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.259> find<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.590> goblin<00:01:47.030> obviously<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
first if I find a goblin obviously I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
first if I find a goblin obviously I
would<00:01:49.020> kill<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> goblins<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.640> the

then<00:01:57.570> odds<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:58.049> there's<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
then odds are there's not going to be a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.370 
then odds are there's not going to be a
second<00:01:59.159> goblin<00:01:59.490> spawn<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.939> simply<00:02:00.299> remake<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
second goblin spawn so simply remake and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
second goblin spawn so simply remake and
hopefully<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> next<00:02:02.009> game<00:02:02.280> will<00:02:02.430> also<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
hopefully the next game will also have a
