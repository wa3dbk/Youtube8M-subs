00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.990
 Prizes of hard winners of the national 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.730
 3 times 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.870
 over for her now so first 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.150
 impression here on the guitar like 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.050
 do you like it here very much 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.940
 I know the equitana already 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.519
 many years 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.460
 today I was here for the first time 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.610
 hall was very well visited we have 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.170
 had a course together 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.129
 I enjoyed it very much 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.850
 you have a lesson here 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.559
 given 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.089
 with three riders and their horses 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.519
 they train with you too 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.620
 stall makes many young riders 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.510
 There is a big difference there 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.070
 she's her rider her teams to those 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.909
 who know each other here on the spot 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.170
 have learned to do the big one 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.570
 difference or is the everyday 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.009
 working for her is commonplace 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.640
 work but of course a great one 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.009
 difference 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.020
 I have just got the three riders here 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.690
 only got to know we have ten 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.940
 minutes slightly pulled together before 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.920
 the lesson and next to it 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.240
 Half an hour in the hall there you can 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.009
 Naturally 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.369
 See the problems and of course 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.799
 but also to cut valuable tips 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.619
 give but really fix and and 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.520
 you need to get along really well 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.259
 of course a bit longer 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.820
 but you can already do that now 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.020
 have already given the job tips in the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.130
 What can they do now ? 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.679
 in the aftermath maybe with on the way 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.899
 give 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.750
 with all three it was similar that the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.000
 control is not there as it is 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.710
 should be that we already there 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.950
 have parted in a few exercises 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.190
 have tried to improve and that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.360
 then all three should go home 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.640
 take part in the daily work 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.200
 let in and then I think 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.759
 that they are on a good way 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.590
 that was also the talking hours here 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.030
 sponsored also supported by le gets 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.299
 we feel the cooperation with you 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.819
 Leo is with our cooperation 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.870
 first very, very pleasant and 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.000
 accordingly we all use 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.489
 leopard products and therefore washes 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.299
 one hand the other and a very good one 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.069
 collaboration 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.480
 good cooperation good partnership 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.980
 then thank you at this point 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.299
 leopard we thank you for that 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.739
 you have found the time brings us 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.820
 briefly to lead the interview and 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.209
 Wish you for the coming season 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.829
 all the best for you in such a hall 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.950
 under such conditions to 1 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.600
 first of all totally imposing in such a big one 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.180
 otherwise I'll come to the hall too 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.280
 only from the audience knew that was 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.660
 really cool then of course that one 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.190
 big audience then you are 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.650
 of course, everything wants to be twice as nervous 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.299
 do it right and thought it was great 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.100
 Christian Ahlmann as a trainer also real 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.420
 Great tips given by you too 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.560
 already say what you take with you or have to 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.299
 you also only a little bit number video 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.819
 look over it oversleeping 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.340
 So I think so of one 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.049
 experienced rider in the largest 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.640
 Rider has ridden in the world and also 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.660
 has won the biggest prizes 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.359
 it is still a bit something 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.950
 other than normal trainer 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.840
 So there you have already distinguished 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.370
 noticed that teaching was very 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.049
 high quality that's right 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.859
 So I have a lot with exactly that 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.389
 was definitely a great one 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.580
 opportunity here in the great 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.320
 the atmosphere 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.460
 but for the course and so many 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.990
 Just watch one 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.580
 to ride a training session 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.010
 so that in the course then too 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.659
 can repeat times 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.340
 to improve the opportunity 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.629
 It's not so common and I think so 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.110
 has me and my horse already on 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.970
 brought 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.140
 what can you take with you now or 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.400
 it still has to process after 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.680
 sleep over it and at home yet 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.150
 bit trying to work on it yes 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.129
 she was nervous but this one too 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.110
 getting nervous is just out of her 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.549
 ambition naturally results in 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.349
 the exam situation just everything 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.150
 to do it right and that's what it does to me 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.060
 of course a bit too 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.489
 difficult yes my goals so a bit 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.319
 to implement and take control 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.269
 keep and just a great one now 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.519
 opportunity in the atmosphere simply 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.720
 a training round for a so 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.370
 the horse can also say 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.440
 okay we are not in three minutes 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.090
 out again but I can 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.659
 relax and can get to know the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.659
 was a great thing
