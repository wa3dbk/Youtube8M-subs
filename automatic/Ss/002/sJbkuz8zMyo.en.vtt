00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
impressive way on this album still with

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.870 
impressive way on this album still with
the<00:06:06.350> amount<00:06:06.800> of<00:06:06.890> production<00:06:07.280> and

with<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.210> project<00:06:14.810> that<00:06:15.200> is<00:06:15.520> conceptually

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
with a project that is conceptually
