00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.700
 miriam baigorrí we are speech therapists 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.420
 Speech therapists and speech therapists 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.900
 language the goal of these videos is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.420
 teach strategies and techniques for 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.380
 improve the speech of people with palate 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.910
 cleft operated this is only one 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.150
 specific area of the audiology area 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 logopedia is not the entire discipline go 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.090
 to learn to perceive associated sounds 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.750
 with the cleft palate also go to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.460
 acquire strategies to stimulate 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.160
 production of different sounds 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.730
 they will know the strategies of 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.149
 treatments and how to use them for sounds 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.870
 are finally going to learn 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.460
 how to believe a treatment plan 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.180
 appropriate for the patient 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.500
 now let's talk about autonomy and 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 physiology of facial structures 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.990
 in the mechanism of the pharynx or 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.800
 autonomy includes the nose lips mouth 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:31.050
 Bone palate veil to stop talking 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:34.860
 of the throat and muscles company 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.910
 physiological door palate 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.720
 includes the occlusion but fariña that 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.119
 process occurs with three movements 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.630
 the talking father moves towards the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.880
 back wall of the throat the wall 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.880
 posterior already the throat moves 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.909
 towards the pay talking walls 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.340
 laterals of the throat move towards 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.340
 the panel talking 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.340
 or 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.710
 yes 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.950
 patients with cleft palate not 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.370
 they can close the door between the nose and 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.120
 the mouth with the soft palate the wall 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.870
 back and side walls 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.810
 before receiving speech therapy 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.560
 must have them urged to close the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.739
 father sold after that emerged 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.730
 some patients may be at the door 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:41.620
 speak clearly, others need 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.860
 another surgery and others speak very well 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.069
 after speech therapy before 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.799
 surgery the child learns to produce 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.310
 sounds incorrectly because 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.760
 has a gap in the palate after 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.690
 the surgery may be retained by the child 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.109
 those bad habits to get rid of 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.959
 those bad habits you have to teach the 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.870
 child how the sounds of 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.450
 right way 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.930
 the child's speech does not improve although 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.599
 practice frequently 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.599
 surely need a surgery 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.599
 secondary
