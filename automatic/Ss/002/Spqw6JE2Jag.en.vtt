00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.269
 the council has its seat on the very 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.960
 highly populated planet chores 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.350
 he included 12 of the masters among them 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.949
 were five for life 4 in the long run 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.810
 and 3 for a short time in the council 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.289
 the chairman of the council so the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 Grandmaster was for now if you have the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.710
 but his wrestle gave way to a Jew and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.260
 many members I now have the pda 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 punkt.de therefore it can be used by 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.090
 Some pages may differ slightly 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.430
 but I still pull on and that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.780
 the members were ahead at 44 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:58.670
 proposed the avignon the window to poor 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.670
 this easy-going sharapowa championesse 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:11.010
 Team soap the as you castano and apple 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.010
 So early 19 almost eight years in about 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.009
 at the beginning of the second episode were the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.759
 five members for life jutta it 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.640
 if you want the wan kenobi cocoon and kid 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:31.320
 festo was the four long-term members 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.890
 the mundi mp and pulls him and the three 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.579
 short members were strong that is 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.590
 Hall ii and iv 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.360
 her job was to advise 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.060
 prepared as the peace again 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.530
 can and what just action 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.530
 to do it next 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 and as a little extra I'm doing now 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.600
 a little quiz on test.de so times 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.460
 which one do I ever see? 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.460
 would be from the media council 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.050
 so now if we are on the side 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.369
 arrived on test.de dich.de I can 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.950
 Everyone recommends the wall a bit 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.650
 I'm bored and I'm so sorry about that 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.690
 the advertising here but I use stop 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.980
 google chrome and not mozilla firefox 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.250
 but it does not matter which one 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.230
 you are the board member you need here 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.110
 you answer ten questions and at the end 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.440
 gets with an evaluation which idea 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.110
 Best fits your report 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.510
 with the first question what this idea 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.440
 is the favorite teddy kwan jin opti wan 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.000
 kenobi masters or or mails if you 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.360
 there are three people and one 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.780
 unknown species but I find then 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.340
 still master or coolest with his 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.750
 talk sword and its size then what 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.550
 star wars episode was your opinion 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:03.420
 after the best episode 1 2 3 or 4 to 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.230
 6 and my absolute favorite movie of 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.350
 star wars is just the second episode 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.750
 because a lot is happening, for example 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:17.370
 geological arena then at the end of the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.920
 fight against doku and yes what color 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.100
 that is, your lightsaber would be on 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.000
 every case also green than poison green 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.000
 also my favorite color 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.440
 which one of those lightsaber battles was 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.310
 in your opinion the best 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.980
 if you oppose st-etienne against citius 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.010
 balcony, on the other hand , or if we were 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.230
 against doku is a bit more difficult 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:49.150
 but is not master or against davos 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:54.500
 from seppi so de 3 where it is in the senate building 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:57.019
 he fought is his favorite 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.459
 I'm only on the last Monday a video 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:03.140
 over it have so beautiful may 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.730
 helios imaged that would be mine 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.730
 favorite ship but here are neither 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:15.769
 document cdu to the option but my 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:19.639
 third ship's some games do 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.950
 if only I am going to bring you 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.050
 bring him to the advice of the idea me 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.510
 hide me in professions gain me 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.160
 Greetings him or I fight against him 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:35.139
 I find the second choice on 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.139
 most practical or logical 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.719
 which do not want to grab away you want 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:46.400
 that if you jutta obi wan obi wan it 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:48.559
 too simple but too small and me 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.050
 I also have my top 5 lightsaber 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:55.999
 video mentions that maze windows with 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:59.379
 best think because so noble is which 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.379
 this spacehunter wants to own it 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.129
 league two or three 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:12.349
 because the tiger of the tiger of tosca 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.509
 or xvi I think there is either the tea 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.529
 or dick swing 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.270
 I'm a better tip here 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.669
 which faction from the movie do you find 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.939
 best the gr 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:31.610
 the gps or rebels alliance alliance 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:33.529
 So I think it's really right 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.099
 good of the series then I'll take 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.479
 stop the galactic republic and 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.889
 which rank do you want if you have 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:45.620
 would be partners knight or knight 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:48.069
 what does that mean then I take this one 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.069
 master 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.000
 and we are 50 percent viola you have 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.530
 master yoda 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.720
 you are certainly wise and always have one 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.340
 ass in the sleeve you have a lot 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.380
 experience gathered around so far powerful 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:10.620
 this really only 22 per fourth 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.620
 percent is still included 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.219
 nope 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.739
 could have been natural that here 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.509
 still the other possibilities confessed 

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:24.679
 had 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.649
 but that would mean that we were ours 

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:30.439
 character i will rather kit 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:31.879
 you have been but that fits 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:37.449
 not quite fit i think i would have 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:39.949
 then have to wave to the sith lord 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.599
 but that was a bit strange 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:43.069
 would 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:46.479
 So where do I thank you for 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.479
 see you and see you next time
