00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and then it can get thicker in a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.560 
and then it can get thicker in a
launcher<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.850> glitch<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
not going to be as good as this one the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.819 
not going to be as good as this one the
other<00:01:39.600> method<00:01:39.780> will<00:01:40.049> take<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> long<00:01:40.500> time<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
