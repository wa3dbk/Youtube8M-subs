that a lot of people have had to do this

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.539 
that a lot of people have had to do this

over ten times and I figured out why it
didn't<00:01:42.920> actually<00:01:43.070> work<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.970> because<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.299> saw

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
didn't actually work it's because I saw

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.359 
didn't actually work it's because I saw
some<00:01:44.869> videos<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.439> everyone<00:01:45.710> out<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.100> diet
