so<00:00:01.780> we<00:00:01.899> had<00:00:02.080> a<00:00:02.250> nominal<00:00:03.250> countdown<00:00:03.699> right

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.120 
so we had a nominal countdown right

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.990 
so we had a nominal countdown right
until<00:00:04.420> about<00:00:04.600> t<00:00:04.840> minus<00:00:05.019> 2.5<00:00:05.470> seconds<00:00:06.000> engine

in<00:00:09.910> engine<00:00:10.360> five<00:00:11.279> software<00:00:12.279> did<00:00:12.459> what<00:00:12.639> it<00:00:12.730> was

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:12.789 
in engine five software did what it was

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.990 
in engine five software did what it was
supposed<00:00:12.850> to<00:00:13.240> do<00:00:13.389> abort<00:00:13.959> it<00:00:14.109> aborted<00:00:15.039> engine

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
supposed to do abort it aborted engine

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.490 
supposed to do abort it aborted engine
five<00:00:16.180> that<00:00:16.420> we<00:00:16.480> went<00:00:16.660> through<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.109> remaining

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
five that we went through the remaining

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.089 
five that we went through the remaining
engines<00:00:17.650> shut<00:00:18.009> down<00:00:18.509> so<00:00:19.949> what<00:00:20.949> we're<00:00:21.070> doing

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
engines shut down so what we're doing

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.480 
engines shut down so what we're doing
now<00:00:21.310> is<00:00:21.460> we<00:00:21.970> are<00:00:22.119> detaining<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:23.019> vehicle

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
now is we are detaining the vehicle

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.359 
now is we are detaining the vehicle
safing<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:25.179> flight<00:00:25.570> termination<00:00:26.079> system

safing the flight termination system
doing<00:00:27.369> what<00:00:27.519> we<00:00:27.609> call<00:00:27.730> it<00:00:27.880> t<00:00:28.029> Ted<00:00:28.259> sweeps<00:00:29.259> which

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
doing what we call it t Ted sweeps which

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.519 
doing what we call it t Ted sweeps which
basically<00:00:30.279> clears<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:31.050> ignition<00:00:32.050> fluid<00:00:32.380> and

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
basically clears the ignition fluid and

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.280 
basically clears the ignition fluid and
we<00:00:33.400> should<00:00:33.610> have<00:00:33.820> some<00:00:34.090> technicians<00:00:34.450> up<00:00:34.870> into

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
we should have some technicians up into

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.280 
we should have some technicians up into
that<00:00:35.440> engine<00:00:35.620> about<00:00:35.920> noon<00:00:36.160> today

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.850 

next<00:00:40.070> attempt<00:00:40.460> assuming<00:00:41.270> whatever<00:00:42.050> we<00:00:42.380> see<00:00:42.620> is

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
next attempt assuming whatever we see is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.810 
next attempt assuming whatever we see is
is<00:00:43.730> repairable<00:00:44.300> we<00:00:45.290> will<00:00:45.440> go<00:00:45.590> in<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.100> try

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
is repairable we will go in and try

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.240 
is repairable we will go in and try
another<00:00:47.200> another<00:00:48.200> day<00:00:48.410> on<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.620> twenty-second

another another day on the twenty-second
we're<00:00:49.730> looking<00:00:49.970> at<00:00:50.060> a<00:00:50.120> backup<00:00:50.450> day<00:00:50.630> on<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
we're looking at a backup day on the

we're looking at a backup day on the
twenty-third<00:00:51.200> as<00:00:51.410> well<00:00:51.590> nASA<00:00:52.340> has<00:00:52.490> already

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
twenty-third as well nASA has already

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.540 
twenty-third as well nASA has already
taken<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.270> look<00:00:53.360> at<00:00:53.480> that<00:00:53.600> day<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:54.710> go<00:00:54.950> we

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
taken a look at that day and it's go we

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.590 
taken a look at that day and it's go we
need<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.760> make<00:00:55.910> sure<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.150> range<00:00:56.330> is<00:00:56.480> available

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
need to make sure the range is available

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.330 
need to make sure the range is available
though<00:00:57.020> we<00:00:57.230> don't<00:00:57.380> currently<00:00:57.500> have<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.890> 23rd

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
though we don't currently have the 23rd

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
though we don't currently have the 23rd
with<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.580> range

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.460 

is<00:01:01.860> not<00:01:02.010> failure<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:03.149> aborted<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:04.050> purpose

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
is not failure we aborted with purpose

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
is not failure we aborted with purpose
it<00:01:05.309> would<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> failure<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.240> were<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.750> have

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it would be a failure if we were to have

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570 
it would be a failure if we were to have
lifted<00:01:07.260> off<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.800> engine<00:01:08.100> trending<00:01:08.520> in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
lifted off with an engine trending in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
lifted off with an engine trending in
this<00:01:08.729> direction

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020 

looking<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> additional<00:01:14.820> launch

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
looking at the additional launch

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
looking at the additional launch
opportunities<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.500> twenty-second<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
opportunities this twenty-second of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.590 
opportunities this twenty-second of
course<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.729> looks<00:01:18.090> good<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.479> was

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
course was looks good that was

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.800 
course was looks good that was
pre-planned<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.320> 23rd<00:01:20.360> looks<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pre-planned the 23rd looks like it's a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.030 
pre-planned the 23rd looks like it's a
good<00:01:22.049> date<00:01:22.290> from<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> trajectory<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.899> the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
good date from the trajectory and the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.109 
good date from the trajectory and the
station<00:01:26.040> crew<00:01:26.220> says<00:01:26.520> they're<00:01:26.729> ready<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
station crew says they're ready to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
station crew says they're ready to
support<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.920> believe<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.789> have<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:30.000> good

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
support so we believe will have a good

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.580 
support so we believe will have a good
day<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> twenty-third<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.289> then<00:01:31.380> there's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
day on the twenty-third and then there's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
day on the twenty-third and then there's
a<00:01:31.680> couple<00:01:31.830> days<00:01:32.100> after<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.759> look<00:01:32.970> like

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
a couple days after that that look like

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.279 
a couple days after that that look like
that<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.110> good<00:01:34.259> phasing<00:01:34.649> period<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:36.289> we're

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
that it's a good phasing period so we're

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.020 
that it's a good phasing period so we're
ready<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> support<00:01:37.920> when<00:01:38.189> when<00:01:38.490> SpaceX<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
ready to support when when SpaceX is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.390
