in<00:00:49.410> drier<00:00:49.710> soils<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> plant<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> up

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
in drier soils I like to plant it up

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.439

I'm here at Highland Hill Farm and I'm a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.890 
I'm here at Highland Hill Farm and I'm a
stick<00:01:20.520> right<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.210> old<00:01:21.390> tree<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> died<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
stick right here as an old tree I died a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
stick right here as an old tree I died a
little<00:01:22.140> bit<00:01:22.290> ago<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.640> were<00:01:23.759> looking<00:01:24.090> at

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
little bit ago but we were looking at

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
little bit ago but we were looking at
this<00:01:24.509> stick<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.140> had<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:26.009> was

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this stick that we had and there was

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.350 
this stick that we had and there was
something<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.549> interesting<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.090> saw

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
something really interesting that we saw

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
something really interesting that we saw
all<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.829> take<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> look<00:01:29.220> at

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
all on it and if you take a look at

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.999 
all on it and if you take a look at
there's<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:30.030> major<00:01:30.390> root<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.110> here<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
there's is one major root right here it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.789 
there's is one major root right here it
kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> goes<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.079> comes<00:01:34.439> back

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
kind of goes down and then it comes back

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.460 
kind of goes down and then it comes back
up<00:01:35.280> into<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.049> kind<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.320> go

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
up into back out where it's kind of go

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.450 
up into back out where it's kind of go
so<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.549> call<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.329> J<00:01:40.049> root<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
so we call that a J root because of the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.410 
so we call that a J root because of the
shape<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:43.070> root<00:01:44.070> growing<00:01:44.340> back<00:01:44.729> upwards

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
shape of the root growing back upwards

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.380 
shape of the root growing back upwards
there's<00:01:46.259> usually<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.890> sign<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.939> not

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
there's usually a sign out like not

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.780 
there's usually a sign out like not
really<00:01:48.600> planted<00:01:49.140> correctly<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> field<00:01:50.130> so

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
really planted correctly in the field so

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.859 
really planted correctly in the field so
that<00:01:50.820> might<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> reasons<00:01:51.570> why

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that might be one of the reasons why

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.060 
that might be one of the reasons why
this<00:01:51.930> tree<00:01:52.380> eventually<00:01:53.100> became<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
this tree eventually became like that

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
this tree eventually became like that
but<00:01:56.070> yet<00:01:56.310> planting<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> trees<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> pit

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
but yet planting the trees in the pit

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.389 
but yet planting the trees in the pit
are<00:01:58.020> important<00:01:58.740> planning<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> roots

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
are important planning the roots

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.179 
are important planning the roots
correctly<00:02:00.149> art<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:00.750> good<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.469> long

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
correctly art is very good for long
