00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.309
 hello everyone, welcome to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.049
 my channel today speech my video will go 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.379
 about nail polishes and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.000
 in fact, the topic is quite interesting 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.189
 I think many of you have come across this 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 a problem when the varnish dries quickly 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.279
 thickens and it turns out so that the varnish 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.779
 serves me for a very long time and today I want 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 tell you how to extend life 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.859
 nail polish so that the varnish does not dry out and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.559
 not thickened 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.770
 in fact everything is very very simple and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.829
 I will begin to show on explicit try on my 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.690
 Golden Rose's favorite polish number 48 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.660
 since he has thickened me 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.030
 purchased a new bottle of the same Lakota 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.379
 very same shade and let's 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.879
 I'll tell you why he thickened me 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.649
 firstly because now i will open 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.649
 look at how the neck looks like a varnish 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.080
 it accumulates a very very large 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.220
 the amount of lacquer that dries up and 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.740
 actually because of this and happens 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.920
 varnish thickening because on the neck 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.770
 varnish accumulates varnish which dries 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.530
 because of this, the cap closes 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.280
 loosely and let me tell you what 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.900
 need to do we need a cotton pad 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.960
 it is desirable to use of course without you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.630
 it and cover the disks but I usually 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.530
 cotton pads and i take liquid for 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:41.370
 varnish remover wetted cotton pad 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:43.860
 liquid cleaning brush 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.760
 and moistened with a cotton pad wipe 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.910
 lacquer neck and now I 've rubbed 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.490
 see the neck of the tube with varnish 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.490
 became clean and now you can 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.980
 close the lacquer lid tight 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.800
 no air can get to the tube 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.920
 he actually kept much longer 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.200
 thickens and does not dry out and start 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.100
 actually also handle all varnishes 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.260
 I also process the new varnish 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.420
 handle varnish properly after each 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.210
 use so that no 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.500
 dry areas on the neck I 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.900
 lacquer new one time 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.630
 took advantage therefore also wipe 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.630
 after i finish all the varnishes they 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.300
 it will also be easier to open me 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.390
 it happened and that I could not open 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.990
 any lacquer because on the neck 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.050
 there was a lot of dried varnish he 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.600
 froze and the cap stuck to the tube and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.670
 generally recommends in this way 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.680
 use after each use but 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.830
 I don't have after each use 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.470
 opportunities to wipe the bottle 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.800
 since i'm afraid to hurt and manicure i 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.170
 just doing it a few at a time 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.739
 lacquer fo30 here is a mint shade it is very 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.900
 opened a very thick neck 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.540
 although not so long ago I wiped 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.810
 and here you see this dried varnish 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.470
 which passes air and from which 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.140
 proper 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.140
 thickens and dries lacquer 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.490
 Well, that's all I already processed huskies and 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.620
 it gives me even a purely aesthetic 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.770
 enjoy every time how to use 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.560
 as if the new varnish tubes are very easy 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:23.110
 open and also very light and tight 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.820
 are closing and I hope this video 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.470
 you liked it the same way you were 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.690
 useful if it is necessary 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.120
 put your fingers up necessarily 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.280
 write your comments maybe you 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.370
 You know , maybe some more 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.040
 ways I still know a way how to 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.460
 loosen up thickened varnish it's like me 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.770
 there acetone but this action is enough 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.770
 only one use i am such a way 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.840
 I do not like and therefore maybe there is more 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.760
 maybe some secrets 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.250
 if you know these soviets 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.260
 be sure not to write to all of you 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.570
 I really, really, thank you all for 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.570
 see you in the next video bye
