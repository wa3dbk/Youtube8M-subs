here<00:02:34.890> demo<00:02:35.160> Sony<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:36.510> most<00:02:36.750> people<00:02:37.110> will

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
here demo Sony like most people will

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.340 
here demo Sony like most people will
probably<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.830> they<00:02:38.070> are<00:02:38.240> worth<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.840> bit<00:02:40.260> of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
probably know they are worth a bit of

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.030 
probably know they are worth a bit of
money<00:02:41.450> more<00:02:42.450> than<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.960> average<00:02:44.180> mbuna<00:02:46.040> so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
money more than the average mbuna so
