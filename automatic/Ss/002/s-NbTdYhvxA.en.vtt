first<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> find<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.469> base<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
first we got to find a base this is the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.490 
first we got to find a base this is the
unedited<00:00:44.399> clip<00:00:44.579> by<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:44.910> unedited<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.750> base

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
unedited clip by the way unedited a base

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.990 
unedited clip by the way unedited a base
with<00:00:46.649> lots<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> dark<00:00:47.100> elixir<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.910> was

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
with lots of dark elixir this one I was

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.369 
with lots of dark elixir this one I was
too<00:00:48.120> little<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.870> pretty<00:00:49.020> hard<00:00:49.200> base

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
too little and it's pretty hard base

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.709 
too little and it's pretty hard base
anyway<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.309> centralized<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.270> wouldn't

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
anyway it it's centralized so I wouldn't

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.910 
anyway it it's centralized so I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.030> this<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.360> has<00:00:54.739> 2,000<00:00:55.739> dark

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
recommend it and this one has 2,000 dark

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.040 
recommend it and this one has 2,000 dark
elixir<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.730> yeah<00:00:57.210> we're<00:00:57.480> gonna<00:00:57.570> drop<00:00:57.870> our

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
then go for the pump which they do of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
then go for the pump which they do of
course<00:01:27.509> because<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> Tesla<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.340> know

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
course because of that Tesla you know

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.310 
course because of that Tesla you know
slows<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.939> progress<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.990> those

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
slows down progress and that those

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.640 
slows down progress and that those
motors<00:01:31.890> these<00:01:32.130> two<00:01:32.280> motors

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
dark elixir pump keep forgetting that's

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.850 
dark elixir pump keep forgetting that's
called<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.330> yeah<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.290> takes<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.590> few<00:02:00.620> tries

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
called and yeah it takes you a few tries

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.410 
called and yeah it takes you a few tries
have<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.220> use<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.550> bunch<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.910> my<00:02:02.000> goblins

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
have to use a bunch of my goblins

have to use a bunch of my goblins
there's<00:02:02.840> already<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.230> hole<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.710> wall

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
there's already a hole in the wall

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.520 
there's already a hole in the wall
didn't<00:02:04.610> see<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.820> earlier<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:05.870> get<00:02:06.140> all<00:02:06.350> the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
didn't see that earlier so I get all the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.690 
didn't see that earlier so I get all the
stuff<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:08.770> all<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.979> stuff<00:02:10.220> all<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.520> dark

last-ditch<00:02:30.650> effort<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.430> use<00:02:31.640> my<00:02:31.820> clown<00:02:32.030> Castle

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
last-ditch effort I use my clown Castle

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.120 
last-ditch effort I use my clown Castle
tree<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.660> do<00:02:32.780> nothing<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.590> then<00:02:33.680> finally<00:02:34.070> I

tree to do nothing and then finally I
use<00:02:34.250> my<00:02:34.370> barb<00:02:34.640> King<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.120> also<00:02:35.450> does<00:02:35.570> nothing

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
use my barb King which also does nothing

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.510 
use my barb King which also does nothing
I<00:02:36.020> probably<00:02:36.530> should've<00:02:36.860> used<00:02:36.980> him<00:02:37.100> earlier<00:02:37.370> he

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
I probably should've used him earlier he

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.820 
I probably should've used him earlier he
gets<00:02:37.670> or<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.120> three<00:02:38.630> seconds<00:02:39.020> because
