run let's say if you were doing a hotel

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.060 
run let's say if you were doing a hotel
or<00:02:19.180> casino<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.900> there<00:02:20.320> was<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> traffic<00:02:20.890> lane

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
or casino and there was a traffic lane

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.740 
or casino and there was a traffic lane
from<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.670> front<00:02:21.910> door<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.390> bellhop

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
from the front door to the bellhop

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.220 
from the front door to the bellhop
counter<00:02:23.140> well<00:02:23.740> then<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.040> would<00:02:24.160> only<00:02:24.430> put<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
counter well then you would only put the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.990 
counter well then you would only put the
solvent<00:02:26.230> powder<00:02:26.500> where<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.400> necessary<00:02:27.550> you

solvent powder where it's necessary you
don't<00:02:28.060> put<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.480> everywhere<00:02:32.490> okay<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.360> now<00:02:34.510> we

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
don't put it everywhere okay so now we

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.540 
don't put it everywhere okay so now we
have<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.960> incapable<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> carpet<00:02:36.310> now

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550
