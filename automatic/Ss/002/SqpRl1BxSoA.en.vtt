00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
benchmark video so i'm gonna go ahead

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.000 
benchmark video so i'm gonna go ahead
and<00:00:15.509> start<00:00:15.719> doing<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.320> first<00:00:16.560> game<00:00:16.800> is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and start doing that the first game is

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.189 
and start doing that the first game is
going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.250> batman<00:00:17.789> arkham<00:00:18.000> knight<00:00:18.390> there's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
going to be batman arkham knight there's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.849 
going to be batman arkham knight there's
all<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> settings<00:00:19.890> i<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.220> all<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.760> extra

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
all the settings i have all the extra

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.470 
all the settings i have all the extra
nvidia<00:00:22.859> gameworks<00:00:23.430> settings<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> lot

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
nvidia gameworks settings on and a lot

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.150 
nvidia gameworks settings on and a lot
of<00:00:24.539> people<00:00:24.630> don't<00:00:25.080> actually<00:00:25.500> include<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.010> in

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
of people don't actually include that in

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.880 
of people don't actually include that in
their<00:00:26.310> benchmarks<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:28.199> definitely<00:00:28.590> does

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
their benchmarks so it definitely does

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.359 
their benchmarks so it definitely does
put<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> some<00:00:29.910> stretch<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.539> FPS<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.710> now

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
put a some stretch on the FPS and now

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.330 
put a some stretch on the FPS and now
also<00:00:32.759> keep<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.300> mind<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.870> game<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.350> kind

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
also keep in mind that this game is kind

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
also keep in mind that this game is kind
of<00:00:35.460> screwed<00:00:35.760> up<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.930> didn't<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:37.260> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
of screwed up if you didn't know this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
of screwed up if you didn't know this
game<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.770> removed<00:00:38.160> from<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> steam<00:00:38.700> market

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
game was removed from the steam market

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.810 
game was removed from the steam market
because<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.989> broken<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:41.730> get

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
because it's kind of broken but to get

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
because it's kind of broken but to get
more<00:00:42.059> than<00:00:42.180> 30<00:00:42.390> FPS<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.140> actually<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.680> go

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
more than 30 FPS you actually have to go

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.250 
more than 30 FPS you actually have to go
into<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> game<00:00:44.309> files<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.090> edit<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.050> game

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
into the game files and edit the game

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.430 
into the game files and edit the game
files<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.860> allow<00:00:47.100> max<00:00:47.399> FPS<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.180> unlimited<00:00:48.539> so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
files to allow max FPS to unlimited so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.189 
files to allow max FPS to unlimited so
here's<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> benchmark<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.000> game<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:52.020> will

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
here's the benchmark in game and I will

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.920 
here's the benchmark in game and I will
also<00:00:52.379> show<00:00:52.590> some<00:00:53.280> extra<00:00:54.270> game<00:00:54.420> footage<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
also show some extra game footage at the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.479 
also show some extra game footage at the
end<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:55.920> bit<00:00:56.070> different

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
end because it is a little bit different

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.240 
end because it is a little bit different
you<00:00:56.640> actually<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.949> bit<00:00:59.039> higher

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you actually get a little bit higher

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.060 
you actually get a little bit higher
during<00:00:59.850> your<00:01:00.000> average<00:01:00.420> playing<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> game

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
during your average playing in the game

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.649 
during your average playing in the game
depending<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> situation<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:04.500> um<00:01:05.659> in

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
depending on the situation but um in

certain games benchmarks i'm going to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.270 
certain games benchmarks i'm going to
find<00:01:17.909> something<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.990> will<00:01:19.170> show<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.799> FPS

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
find something that will show the FPS

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.050 
find something that will show the FPS
big<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> top<00:01:21.180> left<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.820> get

big in the top left and you know get

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
big in the top left and you know get
some<00:01:24.180> proper<00:01:24.420> benchmarking<00:01:25.110> done<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
some proper benchmarking done for you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.399 
some proper benchmarking done for you
guys<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.390> for<00:01:27.390> games<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.049> they<00:01:28.259> have

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
guys but for games like this they have

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.190 
guys but for games like this they have
the<00:01:28.530> built-in<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:29.250> testing<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:30.030> FPS<00:01:30.750> testing

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the built-in game testing or FPS testing

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160 
the built-in game testing or FPS testing
i'll<00:01:31.350> definitely<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:31.979> doing<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.170> every

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
i'll definitely be doing that and every

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.810 
i'll definitely be doing that and every
video<00:01:34.350> might<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.040> commentary<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.700> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
video might not have commentary in it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
video might not have commentary in it
either<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.780> video<00:01:37.020> i<00:01:37.079> decided<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
either this video i decided to do it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.260 
either this video i decided to do it
just<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> explain<00:01:38.430> what's<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
things like that plus if you couldn't

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.240 
things like that plus if you couldn't
tell<00:01:41.520> already<00:01:42.229> my<00:01:43.229> voice<00:01:43.439> sounds<00:01:44.220> different

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250

great<00:01:44.790> well<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:45.930> i<00:01:46.049> finally

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
great well that's because i finally

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
great well that's because i finally
figured<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.860> how<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.540> make<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.689> quality

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
figured out how to make the quality

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.039 
figured out how to make the quality
better<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.439> microphone<00:01:49.619> through<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:51.049> the

work in this game seems to work in every
other<00:02:31.680> game<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:33.450> game<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.750> kind<00:02:34.110> of

other game but this game is kind of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.320 
other game but this game is kind of
broken<00:02:34.290> anyway<00:02:34.739> so<00:02:34.849> why<00:02:35.849> would<00:02:36.090> something

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
broken anyway so why would something

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.420 
broken anyway so why would something
work<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.140> anyway<00:02:37.680> there<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> little

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
work on it but anyway there is a little

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
FPS counter at the top left you may have

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.809 
FPS counter at the top left you may have

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
to make it full screen to see it but

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.990 
to make it full screen to see it but
it's<00:02:42.060> getting<00:02:42.540> anywhere<00:02:42.959> around<00:02:43.110> 60<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.459> 100

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000

said<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.660> get<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> little<00:02:49.019> bit<00:02:49.200> more<00:02:49.579> while

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
said you get a little bit more while

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.039 
said you get a little bit more while
playing<00:02:50.849> then<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.329> benchmark<00:02:51.780> because

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
playing then in the benchmark because

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.870 
playing then in the benchmark because
the<00:02:52.170> benchmark<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.739> just<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.130> complete<00:02:53.579> stress

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
the benchmark is just a complete stress

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.509 
the benchmark is just a complete stress
test<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.829> pretty<00:02:56.010> much<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.370> this

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519
