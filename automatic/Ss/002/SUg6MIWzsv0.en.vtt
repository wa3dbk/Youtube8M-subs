alphabetically<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.189> search<00:01:56.490> for

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
alphabetically I can then search for

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
alphabetically I can then search for
specific<00:01:57.030> files<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.719> find<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.110> name<00:01:58.380> if

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
specific files we find out the name if

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.679 
specific files we find out the name if
say<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> document<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.969> type<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.540> there

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
say a document I can type it in there

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.499 
say a document I can type it in there
and<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> will<00:02:01.110> find<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.560> me<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:02.360> can<00:02:03.360> then

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and it will find it for me I can then

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.620 
and it will find it for me I can then
decide<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:05.310> move<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.450> down

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
decide to move these up and down

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.770 
decide to move these up and down
wherever<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.500> want<00:02:07.740> them<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> last

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
wherever I want them and then the last

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.360 
wherever I want them and then the last
one<00:02:09.929> I'm<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.349> show<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
so to take a picture for example I just

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.500 
so to take a picture for example I just
click<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.050> ID<00:02:15.320> button<00:02:15.890> here<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.580> then<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:17.240> can

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
click this ID button here and then I can

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.600 
click this ID button here and then I can
create<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> new<00:02:17.930> folder<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.920> start<00:02:19.340> file

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
create a new folder I can start file

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.090 
create a new folder I can start file
manager<00:02:20.120> i<00:02:20.300> can<00:02:20.540> add<00:02:20.630> from<00:02:20.780> camera<00:02:21.170> or<00:02:21.380> i<00:02:21.980> can

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
manager i can add from camera or i can

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.210 
manager i can add from camera or i can
take<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.150> photo<00:02:23.420> directly<00:02:23.930> or<00:02:24.200> i<00:02:24.260> can<00:02:24.860> delete

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
take a photo directly or i can delete

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.210 
take a photo directly or i can delete
everything<00:02:25.610> that's<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:27.040> we<00:02:28.040> head<00:02:28.190> over

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
everything that's in that we head over

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.670 
everything that's in that we head over
to<00:02:28.430> settings<00:02:28.910> there's<00:02:29.540> instruction<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.590> it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
to settings there's instruction so it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.990 
to settings there's instruction so it
tells<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.400> different<00:02:31.520> things<00:02:31.880> that

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
tells you all the different things that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.150 
tells you all the different things that
you<00:02:32.120> can<00:02:32.210> do<00:02:32.570> with<00:02:33.050> our<00:02:33.170> discrete<00:02:33.530> there's<00:02:34.070> a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
you can do with our discrete there's a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.890 
you can do with our discrete there's a
video<00:02:34.490> demo<00:02:34.790> mode<00:02:34.940> which<00:02:35.210> is<00:02:35.240> really<00:02:35.690> nice

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
video demo mode which is really nice

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.510 
video demo mode which is really nice
because<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.320> tells<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:36.890> gives<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.100> an

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
because it tells you and gives you an

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.310 
because it tells you and gives you an
in-depth<00:02:38.030> look<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.570> then<00:02:38.900> it's<00:02:39.050> got<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
in-depth look and then it's got the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.620 
in-depth look and then it's got the
protection<00:02:39.830> settings<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.700> slideshow<00:02:41.360> timer

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
protection settings and slideshow timer

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.720 
protection settings and slideshow timer
so<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.350> slideshow<00:02:42.710> time<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.250> how<00:02:43.490> quickly

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
so the slideshow time it is how quickly

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.030 
so the slideshow time it is how quickly
it<00:02:44.450> will<00:02:44.480> go<00:02:44.810> through<00:02:45.560> your<00:02:45.590> different

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
it will go through your different

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.470 
it will go through your different
pictures<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.850> adjust<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.240> there

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
pictures and you can adjust that there

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.180 
pictures and you can adjust that there
but<00:02:47.960> we<00:02:48.140> head<00:02:48.290> into<00:02:48.440> protection<00:02:48.980> settings

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
but we head into protection settings

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.580 
but we head into protection settings
I've<00:02:49.760> got<00:02:50.180> my<00:02:50.300> protection<00:02:50.630> turned<00:02:50.990> on<00:02:51.200> if<00:02:51.500> I

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
I've got my protection turned on if I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.380 
I've got my protection turned on if I
turn<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:51.980> off<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.459> wouldn't<00:02:52.820> get<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.000> fake

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
turn that off you wouldn't get that fake

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.190 
turn that off you wouldn't get that fake
notes<00:02:53.900> application<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:56.000> play<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
notes application I can play the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.470 
notes application I can play the
protections<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.100> torial<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:58.640> then<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.240> can

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
protections you torial and then I can

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.440 
protections you torial and then I can
change<00:02:59.720> my<00:02:59.810> touch<00:03:00.170> sequence<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.250> here<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.420> can

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
change my touch sequence so here you can

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.030 
change my touch sequence so here you can
see<00:03:02.600> you've<00:03:02.900> got<00:03:02.930> different<00:03:03.230> boxes<00:03:03.800> with<00:03:04.010> a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
see you've got different boxes with a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.000 
see you've got different boxes with a
loaded<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.670> middle<00:03:05.390> now<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.810> can<00:03:06.260> put<00:03:06.620> in<00:03:06.830> a

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
loaded in the middle now I can put in a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.920 
loaded in the middle now I can put in a
touch<00:03:07.370> sequence<00:03:07.850> which<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.450> really<00:03:08.720> nice

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
touch sequence which is really nice

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.840 
touch sequence which is really nice
because<00:03:09.200> most<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.770> applications<00:03:09.890> that

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
because most of the applications that

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.880 
because most of the applications that
you<00:03:10.970> do<00:03:11.180> get<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.690> passcode<00:03:12.020> now<00:03:12.500> if

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
you do get have a passcode now if

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.220 
you do get have a passcode now if
somebody<00:03:13.160> opens<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.700> they<00:03:13.850> know<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.990> there's

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
somebody opens it they know that there's

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.750 
somebody opens it they know that there's
something<00:03:15.440> hidden<00:03:15.709> in<00:03:15.980> there<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.340> they<00:03:16.610> will

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
something hidden in there and they will

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.640 
something hidden in there and they will
keep<00:03:17.000> trying<00:03:17.239> if<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.840> comes<00:03:18.019> up<00:03:18.170> with<00:03:18.320> enter<00:03:18.590> a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
keep trying if it comes up with enter a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.290 
keep trying if it comes up with enter a
password<00:03:18.890> but<00:03:19.250> with<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.519> hidden<00:03:20.120> touch

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
password but with this hidden touch

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.960 
password but with this hidden touch
sequence<00:03:21.230> it's<00:03:21.410> really<00:03:21.830> nice<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.550> as<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.820> saw

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
sequence it's really nice and as you saw

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.490 
sequence it's really nice and as you saw
when<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.150> first<00:03:23.390> boot<00:03:23.660> up<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.019> don't<00:03:24.140> get<00:03:24.350> any

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
when I first boot up you don't get any

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.440 
when I first boot up you don't get any
of<00:03:24.590> these<00:03:24.739> sections<00:03:25.040> or<00:03:25.370> lines<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:26.120> my<00:03:26.239> touch

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
of these sections or lines so my touch

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.690 
of these sections or lines so my touch
sequence<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.050> just<00:03:27.260> going<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.440> be<00:03:27.500> 1<00:03:28.600> 2<00:03:29.600> 3<00:03:30.700> okay

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
sequence is just going to be 1 2 3 okay

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.350 
sequence is just going to be 1 2 3 okay
clear<00:03:31.970> all<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.209> sorry<00:03:32.390> it's<00:03:32.600> going<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.810> be<00:03:32.870> a

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
clear all that sorry it's going to be a

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.380 
clear all that sorry it's going to be a
