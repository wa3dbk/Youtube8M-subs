using some organic forest honey

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.759 
using some organic forest honey
you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.070> use<00:00:59.190> anything<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.580> like<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.940> also<00:01:00.900> use

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
you can use anything you like I also use

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.930 
you can use anything you like I also use
a<00:01:02.070> curve<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.089> gob<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.750> next<00:01:04.350> time<00:01:04.489> in<00:01:05.489> this

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
a curve or a gob a next time in this

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.060 
a curve or a gob a next time in this
recipe<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.810> works<00:01:07.320> quite<00:01:07.650> as<00:01:07.920> well

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
recipe I think that works quite as well

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:21.350 
recipe I think that works quite as well
so<00:01:17.030> then<00:01:18.030> carob<00:01:18.840> powder<00:01:19.080> dark<00:01:19.980> brown<00:01:20.520> powder

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
so then carob powder dark brown powder

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
so then carob powder dark brown powder
looks<00:01:21.870> like<00:01:22.110> dark<00:01:22.500> chocolate<00:01:22.590> powder<00:01:23.160> and<00:01:23.550> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
looks like dark chocolate powder and it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.700 
looks like dark chocolate powder and it
is<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:23.970> good<00:01:24.270> substitute<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:25.260> chocolate<00:01:25.290> as

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
is a good substitute for chocolate as

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.550 
is a good substitute for chocolate as
well<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.520> high<00:01:26.760> in<00:01:27.210> calcium<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.080> up

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
well but it's high in calcium and up

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.860 
well but it's high in calcium and up
minerals<00:01:29.070> without<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.060> caffeine<00:01:30.600> that

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
minerals without the caffeine that

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.890 
minerals without the caffeine that
chopped<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.770> other<00:01:31.890> bad<00:01:32.130> things<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
chopped and that other bad things that

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
chopped and that other bad things that
cook<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.110> chocolate<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.860> raw<00:01:35.550> chocolate

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
cook to chocolate can have raw chocolate

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.670 
cook to chocolate can have raw chocolate
powder<00:01:36.300> can<00:01:36.630> also<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:37.140> used<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.620> recipe

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
powder can also be used in this recipe

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.100 
powder can also be used in this recipe
because<00:01:38.130> raw<00:01:38.400> chocolate<00:01:38.610> powder<00:01:38.970> has<00:01:39.750> got

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
because raw chocolate powder has got

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.860 
because raw chocolate powder has got
loads<00:01:40.410> of<00:01:40.710> nutrients<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.640> well<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.720> is

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
loads of nutrients as well so this is

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.680 
loads of nutrients as well so this is
also<00:01:43.080> this<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.370> also<00:01:44.550> replace<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
also this is can also replace like the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.480 
also this is can also replace like the
chocolate<00:01:46.110> smoothie<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.530> chocolate<00:01:47.040> milkshake

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
chocolate smoothie a chocolate milkshake

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.940 
chocolate smoothie a chocolate milkshake
is<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.300> this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:49.050> good<00:01:49.170> replacement<00:01:49.440> for<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
is a this is a good replacement for it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.730 
is a this is a good replacement for it
so<00:01:50.160> I<00:01:50.190> put<00:01:50.580> about<00:01:50.640> two<00:01:51.270> tablespoons<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.170> carob

powder
I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.090> measure<00:01:54.300> I<00:01:54.480> just<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.800> how
