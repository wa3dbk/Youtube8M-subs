cone<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.520> take<00:02:45.850> your<00:02:46.800> quarter<00:02:47.800> ribbon

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
cone and then take your quarter ribbon

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.930 
cone and then take your quarter ribbon
and<00:02:50.140> place<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.739> on<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.250> hot<00:02:52.060> glue<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.940> then

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
and place it on the hot glue and then

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.590 
and place it on the hot glue and then
just<00:02:55.360> hold<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.810> down<00:02:56.880> until<00:02:57.880> it's<00:02:58.680> cooled<00:02:59.680> down

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
just hold it down until it's cooled down

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.960 
just hold it down until it's cooled down
and<00:03:01.600> once<00:03:01.780> that's<00:03:01.930> cooled<00:03:02.260> down<00:03:04.290> continue<00:03:05.290> on

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.400 

and<00:03:11.480> you're<00:03:11.630> going<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.780> want<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.990> make<00:03:12.110> sure<00:03:12.260> to

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
and you're going to want to make sure to

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.610 
and you're going to want to make sure to
look<00:03:12.560> at<00:03:12.710> it<00:03:12.860> straight<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.440> make<00:03:15.440> sure

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
look at it straight on and make sure

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.830 
look at it straight on and make sure
it's<00:03:15.800> not<00:03:15.980> going<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.250> be<00:03:16.340> lopsided<00:03:16.840> where

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
it's not going to be lopsided where

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.250 
it's not going to be lopsided where
you're<00:03:17.960> putting<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.580> Corporal<00:03:19.580> ribbon<00:03:20.260> okay

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
you're putting the Corporal ribbon okay

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.850 
you're putting the Corporal ribbon okay
now<00:03:21.410> put<00:03:21.620> some<00:03:21.770> hot<00:03:21.950> glue<00:03:23.530> um<00:03:24.550> around<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
now put some hot glue um around the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.600 
now put some hot glue um around the
other<00:03:27.980> side<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.760> cone<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:31.220> this<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.490> our

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
other side of the cone and this is our

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.640 
other side of the cone and this is our
backside<00:03:32.270> so<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.930> does<00:03:33.080> not<00:03:33.260> need<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.620> be

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
backside so it does not need to be

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:52.710 
backside so it does not need to be
perfect

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.360 

so<00:03:53.720> basically<00:03:54.050> we're<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:54.770> wrapping<00:03:54.950> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
so basically we're just wrapping the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.480 
so basically we're just wrapping the
corcoran<00:03:56.950> around<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.130> cone<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.250> just

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
corcoran around the cone and so you just

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.490 
corcoran around the cone and so you just
glue<00:04:02.380> now<00:04:03.380> on<00:04:03.590> top<00:04:03.830> of<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.069> corporate<00:04:04.280> ribbon

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
glue now on top of the corporate ribbon

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.620 
glue now on top of the corporate ribbon
I'm<00:04:06.500> placing<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.100> next<00:04:07.400> row<00:04:07.580> of<00:04:07.819> ribbon<00:04:08.480> on

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
I'm placing the next row of ribbon on

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:16.390 
I'm placing the next row of ribbon on
top<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.500> first<00:04:09.709> row<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:15.380> want<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.830> second

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
top of the first row you want the second

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.159 
top of the first row you want the second
row<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.519> be<00:04:16.820> slightly<00:04:17.419> smaller<00:04:17.780> than<00:04:18.049> that

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
row to be slightly smaller than that

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.470 
row to be slightly smaller than that
first<00:04:18.500> row<00:04:21.490> so<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.580> just<00:04:22.790> got<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:22.970> manipulate

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
first row so you just got to manipulate

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.409 
first row so you just got to manipulate
the<00:04:23.600> ribbon<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.530> where<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.830> want<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.419> then

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
the ribbon to where you want it and then

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.270 
the ribbon to where you want it and then
sometimes<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.590> need<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.860> hold<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.250> little

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
sometimes you need to hold it a little

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.970 
sometimes you need to hold it a little
bit<00:04:28.580> longer<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.350> that's<00:04:30.350> not<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.740> way<00:04:30.830> that

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
bit longer so that's not the way that

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:59.680 
bit longer so that's not the way that
ribbon<00:04:31.160> wants<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.640> go

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.350 

this<00:05:00.260> ice<00:05:01.190> cream<00:05:01.250> cone<00:05:01.550> ribbon<00:05:02.030> sculpture

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
this ice cream cone ribbon sculpture

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.630 
this ice cream cone ribbon sculpture
takes<00:05:02.600> a<00:05:02.810> lot<00:05:03.200> of<00:05:03.230> practice<00:05:03.890> so<00:05:04.190> if<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:04.460> don't

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
takes a lot of practice so if you don't

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.670 
takes a lot of practice so if you don't
get<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.910> right<00:05:04.940> away

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
get it right away

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:39.530 
get it right away
don't<00:05:06.680> be<00:05:06.830> too<00:05:06.980> upset<00:05:07.150> just<00:05:08.150> keep<00:05:08.330> practicing

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.210 

and<00:05:40.050> when<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.290> get<00:05:40.440> to<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.650> end<00:05:40.800> if<00:05:41.070> you<00:05:41.100> have

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
and when you get to the end if you have

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.410 
and when you get to the end if you have
ribbon<00:05:41.670> left<00:05:41.850> over<00:05:42.150> you<00:05:42.560> can<00:05:43.560> just<00:05:43.590> snip<00:05:44.010> it

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
ribbon left over you can just snip it

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.690 
ribbon left over you can just snip it
using<00:05:45.420> your<00:05:45.540> scissors

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.700 

okay<00:05:50.700> so<00:05:50.970> we're<00:05:51.360> basically<00:05:51.630> all<00:05:51.960> done<00:05:52.410> we<00:05:52.680> just

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
okay so we're basically all done we just

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.190 
okay so we're basically all done we just
got<00:05:53.040> to<00:05:53.160> hide<00:05:53.370> that<00:05:53.610> piece<00:05:53.880> right<00:05:54.060> there<00:05:54.200> and

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
got to hide that piece right there and

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.990 
got to hide that piece right there and
so<00:05:57.980> it's<00:05:58.980> a<00:05:59.100> little<00:05:59.220> bit<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.520> glue<00:05:59.640> on<00:05:59.850> the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
so it's a little bit of glue on the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.340 
so it's a little bit of glue on the
inside<00:06:03.230> you<00:06:04.230> can<00:06:04.380> see<00:06:04.620> that<00:06:04.800> on<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.370> inside<00:06:05.790> of

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
inside you can see that on the inside of

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.310 
inside you can see that on the inside of
your<00:06:07.350> ice<00:06:07.500> cream<00:06:07.770> cone<00:06:08.010> and<00:06:08.900> then<00:06:09.900> take<00:06:10.140> that

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
your ice cream cone and then take that

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.570 
your ice cream cone and then take that
ribbon<00:06:11.810> and<00:06:12.810> then<00:06:12.930> look<00:06:13.620> at<00:06:13.740> it<00:06:13.860> from<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.160> from

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
ribbon and then look at it from the from

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.180 
ribbon and then look at it from the from
the<00:06:14.670> front<00:06:14.910> just<00:06:15.690> make<00:06:15.810> sure<00:06:15.960> that<00:06:16.140> it<00:06:16.320> looks

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
the front just make sure that it looks

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.810 
the front just make sure that it looks
okay<00:06:18.770> we<00:06:19.770> place<00:06:20.010> it<00:06:20.190> down<00:06:20.340> in<00:06:20.520> there

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
okay we place it down in there

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.300 
okay we place it down in there
and<00:06:21.110> make<00:06:22.110> sure<00:06:22.140> that<00:06:22.380> it's<00:06:22.560> kind<00:06:22.770> of<00:06:22.830> flat<00:06:23.130> on

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
and make sure that it's kind of flat on

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:30.680 
and make sure that it's kind of flat on
the<00:06:23.430> top<00:06:27.080> and<00:06:28.080> that<00:06:28.230> finishes<00:06:28.680> your<00:06:29.690> your

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
the top and that finishes your your

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.650 
the top and that finishes your your
sculpture<00:06:31.380> on<00:06:31.500> the<00:06:31.590> ribbon<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:32.360> now<00:06:33.360> we<00:06:33.420> just

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
sculpture on the ribbon and now we just

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.040 
sculpture on the ribbon and now we just
need<00:06:33.780> to<00:06:33.870> add<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.830> top<00:06:35.100> to<00:06:35.340> it<00:06:35.490> and<00:06:35.760> so<00:06:36.570> once

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
need to add the top to it and so once

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.830 
need to add the top to it and so once
that's<00:06:37.310> cooled<00:06:38.310> down<00:06:38.460> and<00:06:38.700> it's<00:06:38.820> ready<00:06:39.030> take

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
that's cooled down and it's ready take

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.560 
that's cooled down and it's ready take
your<00:06:41.000> top<00:06:42.000> and<00:06:42.390> I'm<00:06:42.450> using<00:06:42.630> this<00:06:42.870> pink<00:06:43.490> pearl
