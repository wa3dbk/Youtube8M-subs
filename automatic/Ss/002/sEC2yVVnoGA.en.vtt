00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.109
 the staff here I get in turn 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.419
 almost a video for the moment itself. 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.259
 as it is the so-called I was 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:14.549
 for you guys but a video view since 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.549
 the last three attempts 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.380
 the parade all obvious sorry for some 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.400
 characters on some blood covers 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.660
 I really like her so much today so I 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.840
 I decided to sow some water 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.190
 I'm going to talk about five books that everything 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.190
 I'm half but it's logical 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.329
 Finally I hope you like to continue 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.329
 with the side go back there 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.880
 Good first book in front of you. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.760
 Strange, that was once again in Brazil. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.000
 that our house is simply trampled 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.390
 tread meadow 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.760
 the literary beasts to achieve understand 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.020
 the free course judged there with the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.300
 of actors with photos of hu 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.320
 but from the principle that each and 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.990
 of all 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.940
 the moka always behind to play together and is 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.760
 what is the paiva passing more 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.010
 proposed my graduation drain 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.450
 released by the publisher galera look there is already 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.070
 another to call 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.340
 hi how did fiat harrison jeff de raza 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.789
 has the commitment of August to realize 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.979
 really here see the better shows this 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.829
 summed up the space was low because 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.069
 I liked quite a lot against the 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.069
 malaria 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.970
 austin then is useless by tite 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.610
 so many critics tread on sanaa and understand 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.820
 his proposal the course enough and pt 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.730
 the face people in July 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.210
 already the second book of our list to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.300
 he was so well accepted that to be sent to 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.120
 radiotherapy he will not publish anymore 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.730
 bet only the link 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.640
 the path chosen but there was the series 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.190
 paul patin I know me 4-0 on 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.150
 the best when you advance in a 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.880
 had speed 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.290
 jonas gives 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.140
 a lot of people thought that this is going to 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.810
 same event course 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.330
 aaaah that the reviews were five 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.130
 tenths then asks that I took too long 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.890
 with them and optimizing the space of 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.830
 negative reviews even when I 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.100
 I think aaa is a push cliche 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.830
 but the author tells the story well 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.640
 well neat, she's going to be okay 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.620
 certinha 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.260
 then sometimes reaches between a clinch 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.140
 base carol well told the story 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.540
 totally innovative plate and modorrento 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.380
 and wood sometimes I prefer to stay with 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.970
 that the basic x1 of the treaty in our 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.700
 third book to share many opinions 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.650
 When I bought it I did not even know that 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.170
 was going to be released in Brazil 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.800
 the iconix brought home start the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.470
 search on the internet exercises on upload 0 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.209
 as well as representative and was kaká 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.860
 It cost a lot more when I like it. 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.010
 enough and will call only find 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.380
 different than its the order of time 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.640
 normal than in the past because I'm 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.710
 guys 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.710
 is a book that talks about the coup 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.439
 You dream and you do not like much with 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.689
 a very different narrative 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.780
 the author prays for the list on hand that 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:07.269
 adolescence is a book played 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.799
 a little more you know completely made 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.709
 the end of the narrative 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.390
 I really liked it, despite a lot of people. 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.069
 have water 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.090
 Finally I want to take into account that 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.959
 It will be our ambition. 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:25.080
 then our third game to the south 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:29.050
 our fourth type that the last river is the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.810
 our people like that had to reflect 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.240
 It's far from me, it's a lot of people. 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.870
 abandons him in truth but like me 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.050
 liked it 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.169
 not so much for the character then you are 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.960
 but portugal does not transmit something curious 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.510
 and I ended up finding myself hit very far 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.080
 so my cds and curimbatá fao 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:53.129
 who is king of the dollar already sleeps 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.919
 are two tragic think many mistakes 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.480
 of these people you already told him that if 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.490
 oppose negative pressure 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.620
 a macro is only positive new 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.470
 I enjoyed a very fast audience but for 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.390
 I even found it native left a lot 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.280
 delicious and today I like in a lot of 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.210
 methodology for the already very 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.660
 far more traditional with which is much 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.570
 used in every adult game 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.810
 I think you all already know 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.190
 so in today's case the public that 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.790
 see this is it 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.790
 I like 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.990
 and last in front of the book for 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.900
 consider that it is already such a classic of 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.630
 all the people that I have 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.249
 the book and mainly only follow boy 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.309
 despite the regrets I like 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.799
 the outcome that the county and author 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:54.369
 So this is my favorite book and 

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:56.739
 left with the first to win 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:06:00.669
 the hardest step I like a lot 

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:03.609
 in the beginning, many people complain that 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:07.179
 brand is preparing a great battle in 

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:09.519
 end to happen what I know what 

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:11.469
 happens but what can I say to 

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:15.459
 you will see that Cuzco 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:17.439
 You've always seen our team. 

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:19.889
 hiring happen with touch screen 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.889
 nothing more 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.140
 the eagle pa 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.000
 before leaving with the ivat you 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.840
 they really believed that the creation of 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.399
 agency 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.580
 You really are right. 

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:35.879
 ad 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:40.259
 I really like winning, I really like 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:43.620
 chic of the yellow series not running away 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.750
 her proposal in moments from the 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.420
 start what then 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.100
 I really enjoyed the process. 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.940
 and yes in the morning this is one of mine 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.300
 favorites 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:58.050
 although 95% of the world population 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:03.870
 friendly then mouse click you 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:06.290
 must compensate this was mine is in 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.530
 Portuguese 5 liters that will 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.450
 understand 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.850
 I hope logical things you have 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.980
 liked the video if you liked how 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.630
 always talk does not stop implying not 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.060
 I liked that it will help both to pay a 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.650
 pension that tells us if you guarantee that 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.690
 changeover also entered the button 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.210
 green below is this 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.220
 if you also show good money from 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.740
 all of yushu where and as we are 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:32.060
 with new four-cylinder duration 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.320
 feel the area 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.860
 finally home could show a video 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.620
 What was the challenge? 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:41.250
 on the blog right now the staff and even the 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.250
 our next meeting
