you can plug it into the top of the
vehicle<00:00:52.559> mode<00:00:52.830> not<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.699> most<00:00:53.820> elegant

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
vehicle mode not the most elegant

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.910 
vehicle mode not the most elegant
storage<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.589> it<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.769> now<00:00:56.519> underneath

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920

he<00:00:58.920> looks<00:00:59.189> simple<00:00:59.670> he's<00:01:00.089> actually<00:01:00.330> got<00:01:00.600> some

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
he looks simple he's actually got some

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.320 
he looks simple he's actually got some
really<00:01:01.110> neat<00:01:01.939> transformation<00:01:02.939> bits<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.839> him

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
really neat transformation bits on him

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
really neat transformation bits on him
just<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.630> shame<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.290> overall<00:01:07.890> he<00:01:08.040> looks

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
just a shame that just overall he looks

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.280 
just a shame that just overall he looks
so<00:01:08.640> basic<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.299> simple<00:01:09.509> we'll<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> robot

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so basic and simple we'll get to robot

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620 
so basic and simple we'll get to robot
mode<00:01:10.320> later<00:01:10.560> black<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.220> even<00:01:11.460> his<00:01:11.580> isn't<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
mode later black but even his isn't the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.289 
mode later black but even his isn't the
exterior<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.320> his<00:01:13.439> vehicle<00:01:13.860> mode<00:01:14.090> it's<00:01:15.090> not

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
exterior of his vehicle mode it's not

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.510

animation<00:01:15.990> accurate<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.979> you've<00:01:17.189> seen<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
animation accurate if you've seen the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.660 
animation accurate if you've seen the
episode<00:01:18.380> exactly<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.680> certainly<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.579> was

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
episode exactly and certainly I was

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.470 
episode exactly and certainly I was
robot<00:01:21.000> mode<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.159> it's<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.940> sparse

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
robot mode and it's just it's so sparse

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.780 
robot mode and it's just it's so sparse
it's<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.930> white<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.070> sparse<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.700> he

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it's so white and sparse and like he

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.970 
it's so white and sparse and like he
does<00:01:26.940> have<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.300> blue<00:01:27.480> and<00:01:27.510> red<00:01:27.740> stripes<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
does have the blue and red stripes and

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.649 
does have the blue and red stripes and
details<00:01:29.370> on<00:01:29.580> him<00:01:29.730> but<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.420> enough

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
details on him but not really in enough

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.550 
details on him but not really in enough
areas<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> make<00:01:31.200> him<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.470> feel<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:34.140> he<00:01:34.320> just

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
areas to make him not feel the he just

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950 
areas to make him not feel the he just
appears<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> cheap<00:01:36.000> cheaply<00:01:36.720> made

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
appears to be like a cheap cheaply made

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600 
appears to be like a cheap cheaply made
toy<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> while<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:38.100> they<00:01:38.250> ever<00:01:38.460> had

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
toy and while you know they ever had

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.790 
toy and while you know they ever had
like<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.880> back<00:01:39.030> window<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:39.600> painted<00:01:39.960> well

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
like the back window is not painted well

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.840 
like the back window is not painted well
I<00:01:40.830> don't<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:43.490> he's<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.610> got<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
I don't know but he's just got a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
I don't know but he's just got a
slightly<00:01:45.150> odd<00:01:45.390> design<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> horrible

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
slightly odd design it's not a horrible

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.340 
slightly odd design it's not a horrible
design<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.880> somebody<00:01:48.210> said<00:01:48.420> hey<00:01:48.900> here's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
design like if somebody said hey here's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.719 
design like if somebody said hey here's
a<00:01:49.440> transformer<00:01:49.979> who<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.580> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
a transformer who do you think this is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
a transformer who do you think this is
supposed<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:52.080> say<00:01:52.170> jazz<00:01:52.620> he's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
looks he's got the vague shape and the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.200 
looks he's got the vague shape and the
right<00:01:54.930> colors<00:01:55.260> and<00:01:55.290> everything<00:01:55.650> but<00:01:56.610> just

here but so anyway on to robot mode and
uh<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:12.209> said<00:02:12.390> transform<00:02:12.780> he<00:02:12.930> was<00:02:13.049> kind<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.260> fun

this skinny bit as a rifle and it kind

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.840 
this skinny bit as a rifle and it kind
of<00:03:52.019> hides<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.590> peg<00:03:52.769> but<00:03:53.459> he<00:03:53.519> can<00:03:53.610> hold<00:03:53.730> it

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
however you want and in robot mode he's

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.259 
however you want and in robot mode he's
actually<00:03:56.250> pretty<00:03:56.459> cool-looking<00:03:56.730> um

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
actually pretty cool-looking um

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.960 
actually pretty cool-looking um
I<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.320> detail<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.920> wish<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.220> wheels<00:03:59.610> fold

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
I like the detail I wish the wheels fold

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.710 
I like the detail I wish the wheels fold
it<00:04:00.090> away<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.269> little<00:04:00.420> bit<00:04:00.570> better<00:04:02.510> likely<00:04:03.510> that

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
it away a little bit better likely that

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.930 
it away a little bit better likely that
these<00:04:03.810> panels<00:04:04.260> could<00:04:04.350> rotate<00:04:04.560> around

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
these panels could rotate around

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.009 
these panels could rotate around
bringing<00:04:05.940> these<00:04:06.090> up<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.480> front<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.810> hide

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
bringing these up to the front and hide

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.420 
bringing these up to the front and hide
the<00:04:07.110> wheels<00:04:07.260> on<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.470> back<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.920> think<00:04:08.280> it'd<00:04:08.400> be

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
the wheels on the back I think it'd be

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.900 
the wheels on the back I think it'd be
cool

picking up yeah I think I think jazz is
worth<00:06:50.930> picking<00:06:51.140> up<00:06:51.350> I<00:06:51.470> still<00:06:51.680> think<00:06:52.190> it's<00:06:52.280> a

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
worth picking up I still think it's a

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.830 
worth picking up I still think it's a
drifting<00:06:52.760> Grimlock<00:06:53.120> I<00:06:53.240> think<00:06:53.420> are<00:06:53.510> still<00:06:53.720> my

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
drifting Grimlock I think are still my

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.210 
drifting Grimlock I think are still my
two<00:06:53.900> favorite<00:06:54.410> ones<00:06:54.590> I<00:06:54.740> mentioned<00:06:54.800> that<00:06:55.100> in

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
two favorite ones I mentioned that in

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.860 
two favorite ones I mentioned that in
sideswipe<00:06:55.640> having<00:06:56.180> played<00:06:56.390> with<00:06:56.570> both<00:06:56.690> of

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870 
sideswipe having played with both of

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.510 
sideswipe having played with both of
these<00:06:56.960> now<00:06:57.200> I<00:06:57.470> can<00:06:57.890> confirm<00:06:58.190> that<00:06:58.370> that<00:06:58.460> is

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
these now I can confirm that that is

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.040 
these now I can confirm that that is
still<00:06:58.730> the<00:06:58.850> case

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
still the case

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.680 
still the case
jazz<00:07:00.650> is<00:07:00.890> up<00:07:01.040> there<00:07:01.280> sideswipe<00:07:02.240> would<00:07:02.480> be

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
jazz is up there sideswipe would be

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.900 
jazz is up there sideswipe would be
absolutely<00:07:03.650> on<00:07:03.890> that<00:07:04.040> list<00:07:04.220> if<00:07:04.400> his<00:07:04.520> shoulders

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
absolutely on that list if his shoulders

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.050 
absolutely on that list if his shoulders
locked<00:07:05.650> but<00:07:06.650> I<00:07:06.680> think<00:07:07.370> jazz<00:07:07.580> is<00:07:07.730> worth<00:07:07.880> picking

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
locked but I think jazz is worth picking

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.970 
locked but I think jazz is worth picking
up<00:07:08.270> sideswipe<00:07:09.050> if<00:07:09.590> you<00:07:09.770> want<00:07:09.920> a

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:09.980 
up sideswipe if you want a

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.200 
up sideswipe if you want a

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
representation of the character he's a

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.490 
representation of the character he's a
good<00:07:11.480> representation<00:07:11.840> of<00:07:12.110> the<00:07:12.200> character

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
good representation of the character

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.470 
good representation of the character
he's<00:07:12.680> worth<00:07:12.920> picking<00:07:13.160> up<00:07:13.370> for<00:07:13.550> that<00:07:13.700> as<00:07:13.910> long

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480 
he's worth picking up for that as long

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.750 
he's worth picking up for that as long
as<00:07:14.660> you're<00:07:14.780> not<00:07:14.810> looking<00:07:15.290> to<00:07:15.610> spend<00:07:16.610> a<00:07:16.700> whole

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
as you're not looking to spend a whole

lot<00:07:16.820> of<00:07:16.970> time<00:07:17.120> actually<00:07:17.390> playing<00:07:17.630> with<00:07:17.720> it<00:07:17.900> or

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
lot of time actually playing with it or
