00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.530
 already in very ancient texts it is mentioned 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.200
 the presence of a nebulous object in the 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.559
 andromeda constellation this due 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.050
 to the fact that the galaxy is easily 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.080
 observable with the naked eye 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.840
 in the twentieth century 64 after Christ 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.970
 the Arabic astronomer at the Sufi described it 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.029
 in his book like a small cloud 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.980
 the first to catalog it was put air ed 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.750
 then all the greatest astronomers 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.740
 they wanted to understand what it was 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.989
 in 1847 the astronomer bond succeeded to 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.809
 observe two long dark calls that 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.360
 subsequently they were called channels 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.520
 of bonds and that aroused at the time 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.150
 so many contradictions until i 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.820
 sacred gherzi in 1887 with a photo 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.320
 he managed to immortalize the dark arms of 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.360
 dust its magnitude is 3.5 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.180
 and because of its considerable size 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.600
 the most spectacular vision is obtained 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.420
 using a simple binocular with 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.880
 tools more details are 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.520
 so many dark areas of 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.520
 chiaroscuro on the arms and condensations 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.789
 luminous along the arms were 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 identified and about 700 regions h2 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.970
 similar to our orion nebula 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.490
 170 were discovered in the halo 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.789
 globular clusters and about ten of them 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.300
 they are of magnitude 14 15 and can 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.770
 be seen with 300 mm telescopes of 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.979
 diameter 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.840
 pity that m31 is visible only for the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.869
 part facing towards ours 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.180
 galaxy otherwise if it were visible 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.370
 frontally we could have seen 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.530
 many more details 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.230
 it is the farthest object that 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.380
 we can observe with our eyes of 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.070
 from our galaxy 2.2 million 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 of light years 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.500
 it has a diameter of 110 thousand years 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.710
 light and a mass of 230 billion 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.040
 just 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.509
 near m31 there are 7 galaxies 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.610
 satellites and the brightest are m32 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.540
 m110 visible in the same field 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.439
 using low magnification 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.400
 m 32 is superimposed m31 and fu 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:24.859
 discovered in 1749 by the fairer and 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.909
 admitted air fu is only eight years later 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:31.579
 the diameter of 32 m and 8 thousand years 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.380
 light and its brightness is equal to 200 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.440
 millions of suns 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.050
 m110 instead is 2.1 million from us 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.440
 light years with a diameter of 10 thousand 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.440
 light years
