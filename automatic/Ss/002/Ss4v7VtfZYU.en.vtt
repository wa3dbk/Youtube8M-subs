00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 p 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.620
 so it's been good product since a few 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.170
 years the industry 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.790
 start to get interested 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.260
 we are in the Loire valley next 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.450
 angers 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.400
 the mildness of its climate but also the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.870
 quality of its soils have made it the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.430
 third largest vegetable producer 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.930
 la France 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.350
 but the real star of the region 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.880
 it's the lamb's lettuce 85% of the production 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.390
 national fate of factories 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.339
 conditioning of the val de loire 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.920
 the market gardening sector in l'anjou it's 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.629
 also nearly 5000 jobs each year 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.129
 12000 tons of fruits and vegetables are 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.100
 Shipped all over Europe 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.430
 as an economy based on the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 vegetable 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.420
 but in recent years in this 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.090
 cooperative engine on starts selling 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.600
 other vegetables with the origin of this 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.100
 change 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 a party imported from the united states 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.630
 especially develop the all-vegetable bar 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.190
 old from the 2000s actually 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 beautiful we took advantage of the halloween phenomenon 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.640
 butternut pastries things like that ya 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.810
 had an interest in these products there was 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.790
 thought quickly that there was 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 simply a market to exploit a little 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.020
 seemed obvious in a few years 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.270
 cooperative has therefore to diversify 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.830
 activity and develop a range of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 old vegetables that represents 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.290
 today 12% of the turnover of 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.640
 the company is the trick for michel 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.790
 it is to sell them 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.080
 just like the game of trays 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.240
 for rather satisfied rather the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.369
 large retail customers 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.710
 barc floor bar was developed 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.869
 keita game mostly in 500 grams 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.340
 with a recipe card inside 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.030
 so we propose charlottes 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.410
 Jerusalem artichokes 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.420
 we propose blinis Jerusalem artichokes 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:15.180
 sliced old-fashioned pork at the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.470
 parsnip mousseline and that's 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.940
 important to do pedagogy on 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.620
 this type of levis is obvious 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.780
 that you have to do a lot of pedagogy 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.210
 it's obvious that it really helps 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.130
 product development 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.060
 how much you sell it sold 1 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.330
 euro 50 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.850
 the 500 gram container in 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.490
 the occurrence for parsnips is more 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.600
 a kilo of potatoes 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.030
 today probably some 20 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.950
 kg of potatoes and you have 500 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.510
 grams parsnip potato vitelotte 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.630
 in total twenty species all 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.690
 produced in the region 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.830
 with at the top of the podium the Jerusalem artichoke 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.450
 700 tons are sold each year 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.380
 it's five times more than ten years ago and 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.390
 the Jerusalem artichoke 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.340
 it is here that he produced there is a 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.780
 a few dozen years dominique 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.440
 pichonneau started to cultivate this 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:18.140
 ancestral roots the streets 2 by 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.620
 against that scratch it would be beer that 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.100
 can grow up to 3 4 meters tall 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.100
 neurons to snatch a 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.140
 that's what 's at the root level 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.379
 are there are not mature a 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.330
 it's when it's going to be mature 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.930
 are going to do the three times on this 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.000
 big time there is a culture that 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.280
 is almost conducted as an organic crop 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.739
 a little bit of smoke the mushroom and 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.599
 then behind that I put nothing else and 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.849
 it's a culture that does not receive any 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.220
 meaning insecticides herbicides fungicides 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.069
 because it's a culture that has to 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.010
 pretty rustic and who needs to be who is 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.049
 unscathed almost free from disease 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.450
 the Jerusalem artichoke is almost a plant 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.510
 wild a species that grows by itself 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.900
 almost everywhere his only problem the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.630
 harvest it was done before that was the 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.389
 very simple and behind harvesters 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.669
 had to pick up by hand so it was 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.620
 very sorry for the workers 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.700
 by all weather work outside 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.700
 it's not easy 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.760
 finished so harvest by hand for 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.330
 increase its yields of the onecca of the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.590
 reinvent everything and in a few years he 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.310
 became one of the biggest producers 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:42.370
 of Jerusalem artichokes in France 250 tons per 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.370
 year to him alone always to seek 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:53.390
 l adapt a vegetable or rustic but 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.920
 also a winter vegetable which allows 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.550
 dominique to provide work to his 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.690
 employees nearly ten months out of twelve 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.820
 long considered a plant 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.280
 harmful the basic diet of 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.270
 pigs so we are witnessing the renewal of the 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.000
 Jerusalem artichoke seven small tubers 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.230
 would have healing virtues including 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.390
 on cancer prevention 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.190
 moreover studies are in progress 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.990
 on the transformation of his plant into 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.160
 biofuels maybe a future 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.160
 opportunities for producers 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.040
 it's that day it's jacky brÃ©chet who 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.380
 comes to see dominique production of this 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.580
 morning jacky it's the manager 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.620
 technical cooperative is there for 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.400
 check the quality of the vegetables before 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.470
 marketing 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.150
 yes it looks good because it is 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.980
 already a form to Serbian whose color 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.220
 it's a good sign it's going to be beautiful 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.800
 products do a good job of 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.490
 fairly important research between 2007 and 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.460
 2009 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.670
 we had three years of study we compared 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.600
 16 varieties the Jerusalem artichoke to try 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.940
 to see if we could improve the 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.800
 commercial presentation of the product for 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.140
 avoid having products that they 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.190
 to inform to have 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.040
 products you either the course one can 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.280
 also in clear create a Jerusalem artichoke 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.140
 unevenness easier to peel a 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.180
 product capable of seducing the housewife 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.370
 this is called selection 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.470
 varietal an old technique like 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.050
 agriculture, which consists in identifying 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.840
 best plans to replicate them to 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.230
 right 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.490
 well sheltered in a refrigerated room 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.990
 dominique keeps a precious booty 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:43.860
 it gave it a vegetable caviar 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:45.840
 ancient chervil tuberous root 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.190
 still unknown to the general public who 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.750
 has been the subject of almost 10 years of 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.740
 search a real niche market 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.570
 since the producers of chervil 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.860
 tuberous are counted on the fingers of 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.960
 the hand 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.110
 it's different from the Jerusalem artichoke 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.520
 a high value product 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:06.740
 we are paid ridiculous 4 5 euros the 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.690
 kilo and I think it's resold to 15 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.700
 euros the kilo people do not know 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.470
 many chervil tuberous it is a 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.530
 product it's original that is 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:18.610
 extremely fine delicate train on the 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.610
 gastronomic plan and 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.330
 we would dream of being able to produce 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:26.669
 especially to consume much more 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.040
 if people gradually consume it 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:33.030
 knew him discover it 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.030
 it's hope for the future
