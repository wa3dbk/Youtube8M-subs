00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.440
 you supposed to fight that last tour victory 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.620
 yes he has one 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.439
 let where you are completely short I think 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.679
 I don't hear you I didn't know that there was anyone behind the flood right 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.939
 no longer important 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.230
 that's for your head 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.929
 oh well this is not an idea 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.470
 now with them all for two years and 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.040
 I think that was very good awareness and that was it even though 9 was the most important 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.490
 today realize before the game that was coming today 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.739
 we could do it and then 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.040
 after the regular clover why to beat brazil and not expectant full 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.220
 furthermore we were indeed seeing that was the most important think it is in the 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.130
 fifty minutes 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.880
 the player right how we shouldn't do it a bit and wait 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.710
 afterwards with a lot of figure football plays an I think I crawled out of our shell 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.690
 and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.800
 second half of good plays I have to blame why is 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.379
 awesome 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 before considering strange things that are on top of the young people yes that is the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.280
 truth is the car can also but then I either then we should want to 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 viewing and borrowing 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650
 yes then we have to look i am not going to say that it is not my father of any of the 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.210
 largest city in the country he kept stable i don't think so 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 you as it were to regret that the man through the center of lead two men off 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.680
 walked but good 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.880
 you saw that say 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.270
 yes that states that there was nothing that was mine and my view was not that 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.150
 quite the intention like that king day 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.160
 only that should of course never happen and 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.930
 yes if someone is watching me I might still have a few 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.240
 follow the steps 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.119
 what a big party for but 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.390
 the die corner kick 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.510
 I've never seen such a big screen 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.680
 how is that possible on a chip it is a trained corner kick 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.950
 it is the first time that does not help the first time with the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.970
 give priority 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.300
 that is he is not there is that once that and the planning tense 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.010
 we were in the right place just the right place can borrow it I think so 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.380
 was fine I did the ly just right and I was able to explain exactly so 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.820
 allowing input to extend that was intended to be extended and 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.979
 Normally the strong player that I do not want after a band 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.760
 just set up that wesley 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.460
 let's consider that very beautiful 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.140
 I meant the job swap the teams that others through twitter it a politics 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.169
 from ahoy's own 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.049
 yes this cable installed is the hunter 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.999
 he proved that almost rebound in the mast also to the site of the newspaper and 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.569
 to be the one you take me said tick and pretend june takes 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.489
 You see that sometimes happens with other teams that it 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.810
 beasts than people think how that goes so take it alone you laugh me 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.849
 that can not hear the ball a double 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.799
 only after alves was the rider who was smart a lot heavier does it look with 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.820
 the server room yes well 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.969
 that is indeed ridiculous from emmen 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.969
 if you stand behind and there may be even more lending 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:42.919
 women can now wait 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.099
 then cheryl as today 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.930
 well be the first on many people or if we have yes on passchier 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.789
 fought thinking fought like lions 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.549
 orange above 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.079
 we said to each other in a remix and act fairly calmly 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.529
 keep winning 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.269
 continue to play according to own game and play even more daring forward 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.969
 we have done what we all fought and walked together and 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.649
 one he can one the foo 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:15.249
 bell level shows new element atmosphere is good that there are still on top 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.639
 the laarschot by the way red hangover with the ball but yes stop 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.959
 really 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.509
 she became sentences that were right there that he stood there but okay 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:28.209
 delano second lunar mission the westerdijk departed from schreuder m2 that bite 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.029
 well he i just keep fighting and that is the merit of the whole team 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:33.609
 today 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:34.999
 the polder further 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.579
 yes but if it is more important just not happy 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.439
 only they have to keep it upside-down and they don't have it 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.449
 come 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.579
 to reach all the finalist that in every cell of h honest we have a lot 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.399
 succeeded 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:48.659
 we're not there yet 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.229
 enexis be investigated whether reader profile yes 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.379
 we want to be there too 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.450
 we have that chance with this team and that feeling is that within the 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.279
 plow on 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.029
 yes, we must continue to radiate that outwards, also together 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:06.269
 the need for that luck as they have already done a lot with the cubs
