step<00:01:09.930> psychic<00:01:10.680> without<00:01:11.340> specs<00:01:13.400> isn't<00:01:14.400> going

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
step psychic without specs isn't going

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.960

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
to do left it to Hecate sexually i think

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.570 
to do left it to Hecate sexually i think
a<00:01:18.060> three<00:01:18.240> hit<00:01:18.450> KO<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.500> pretty<00:01:19.770> nicely<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
a three hit KO so it's pretty nicely and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.570 
a three hit KO so it's pretty nicely and
i<00:01:21.509> recommend<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> run<00:01:22.680> swing<00:01:23.100> dress<00:01:23.369> but

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
i recommend you to run swing dress but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.730 
i recommend you to run swing dress but
actually<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.180> move<00:01:24.450> set<00:01:24.750> sir<00:01:25.170> ingress<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
actually in this move set sir ingress is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
actually in this move set sir ingress is
useless<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> every<00:01:27.119> ability<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.689> here

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
useless and every ability is here

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.840 
useless and every ability is here
useless<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:29.060> both<00:01:30.060> run<00:01:30.479> away<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> serene<00:01:31.500> race

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
useless as both run away and serene race

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.789 
useless as both run away and serene race
so<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.909> look<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.360> defense<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.990> our<00:01:34.140> tvs<00:01:34.530> is

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
so you look a defense with our tvs is

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.480 
so you look a defense with our tvs is
pretty<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.460> guess<00:01:35.990> also<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.799> good

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
pretty good I guess also but not as good

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.330 
pretty good I guess also but not as good
but<00:01:38.759> okay<00:01:39.750> special<00:01:40.290> defense<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.799> kind<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> high

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
but okay special defense is kind of high

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.679 
but okay special defense is kind of high
I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.350> pretty<00:01:43.770> nice<00:01:44.040> stiff<00:01:44.659> HP<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
I think so it's pretty nice stiff HP is

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.340 
I think so it's pretty nice stiff HP is
very<00:01:46.229> good<00:01:46.530> i<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.240> amount<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.780> HP<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
very good i like this amount of HP and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.300 
very good i like this amount of HP and
the<00:01:52.350> main<00:01:52.560> move<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.130> curse<00:01:53.579> cuz<00:01:55.969> if<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.780> know

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
the main move is curse cuz if you know

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.170 
the main move is curse cuz if you know
curse<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> pretty<00:01:59.820> good<00:02:00.090> move<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.229> run<00:02:01.680> curse

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
curse is a pretty good move so run curse

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.760

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
set up the gyroball you can use SAS in

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.310 
set up the gyroball you can use SAS in
nature<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> think<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.610> more<00:02:40.610> useless<00:02:41.150> here<00:02:41.600> so

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
nature I think it's more useless here so

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.820 
nature I think it's more useless here so
the<00:02:43.040> main<00:02:43.270> attack<00:02:44.270> is<00:02:44.540> curse<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:46.420> terrible

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
the main attack is curse then terrible

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.380 
the main attack is curse then terrible
because<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.880> know<00:02:50.320> terrible<00:02:51.320> for<00:02:51.830> example

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
because you know terrible for example

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.449 
because you know terrible for example
for<00:02:53.390> classes<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.200> terrible<00:02:54.800> is<00:02:55.100> like

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
for classes and terrible is like

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.630 
for classes and terrible is like
dominating<00:02:56.450> some<00:02:57.310> because<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.370> know

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
dominating some because you know

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.790 
dominating some because you know
minus<00:02:59.240> 4<00:02:59.630> speed<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.800> plus<00:03:01.160> or<00:03:02.060> attack<00:03:02.450> and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
minus 4 speed and plus or attack and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.730 
minus 4 speed and plus or attack and
then<00:03:03.800> i<00:03:04.070> recommend<00:03:05.000> this<00:03:05.240> to<00:03:05.600> go<00:03:05.990> with<00:03:06.320> stealth

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
then i recommend this to go with stealth

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.320 
then i recommend this to go with stealth
rocks<00:03:07.040> because<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.490> know<00:03:07.610> stealth<00:03:07.940> rock<00:03:08.150> is

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
rocks because you know stealth rock is

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.960 
rocks because you know stealth rock is
always<00:03:08.660> good<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:08.959> if<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.620> have<00:03:09.830> such<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.640> thing

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
always good and if you have such a thing

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.850 
always good and if you have such a thing
with<00:03:11.180> stealth<00:03:11.600> rock<00:03:11.870> i<00:03:12.050> think<00:03:12.350> it's<00:03:12.530> pretty

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
with stealth rock i think it's pretty

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.750 
with stealth rock i think it's pretty
nice<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:15.410> last<00:03:15.560> move<00:03:15.890> i<00:03:16.130> recommend<00:03:16.519> to

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
nice and the last move i recommend to

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.190 
nice and the last move i recommend to

set of the earthquake because you know
it's<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.920> has<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.640> lot<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:19.940> good<00:03:20.269> coverage<00:03:20.870> cuz

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
it's it has a lot of good coverage cuz

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.650

earthquake<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.280> one<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.760> best<00:03:23.000> moves<00:03:23.330> in

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
earthquake is one of the best moves in

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.650 
earthquake is one of the best moves in
in<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.680> game<00:03:24.920> i<00:03:24.950> think<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.610> earthquake<00:03:26.480> is

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
in the game i think and earthquake is

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.250 
in the game i think and earthquake is
always<00:03:27.140> useful<00:03:27.769> in<00:03:28.280> every<00:03:28.640> Pokemon<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.420> if

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
always useful in every Pokemon and if

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.229 
always useful in every Pokemon and if
you<00:03:30.830> if<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:32.300> have<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:33.170> pretty<00:03:33.500> good<00:03:33.560> coverage

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
you if you have a pretty good coverage

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.560 
you if you have a pretty good coverage
so<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.690> is<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.140> curse<00:03:36.800> tank<00:03:37.190> dance<00:03:37.910> bars<00:03:38.239> and
