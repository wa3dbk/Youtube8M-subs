00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
so who's got to say that that's not a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.870 
so who's got to say that that's not a
target<00:04:26.200> market<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.920> future<00:04:27.190> right<00:04:27.310> yeah

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
target market in the future right yeah

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.810 
target market in the future right yeah
so<00:04:28.330> gamers<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:29.170> they<00:04:29.650> loved<00:04:30.220> one<00:04:30.430> thing<00:04:30.640> its

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
so gamers if they loved one thing its

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.990 
so gamers if they loved one thing its
recognition<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.720> being<00:04:32.620> rewarded<00:04:33.400> for<00:04:33.970> their

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
their skills at video gaming right so I

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.240 
their skills at video gaming right so I
think<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.900> that's<00:04:38.200> all<00:04:38.500> kind<00:04:38.710> of<00:04:38.770> behind<00:04:39.100> the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
think that that's all kind of behind the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.830 
think that that's all kind of behind the
incentive<00:04:39.880> for<00:04:40.360> gamers<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:42.840> activate

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
incentive for gamers to to activate

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.659 
incentive for gamers to to activate
around<00:04:44.470> some<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:44.680> these<00:04:44.800> really<00:04:45.100> fun<00:04:45.280> titles
