that<00:00:21.119> could<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.779> more<00:00:22.020> accessible<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:23.310> they

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
that could be more accessible if they

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.990 
that could be more accessible if they
were<00:00:23.609> reduced<00:00:24.090> or<00:00:24.630> increased<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:25.289> scale

come in contact with something that

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.900 
come in contact with something that
they've<00:01:21.460> held<00:01:21.820> touched<00:01:22.600> used<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:24.369> makes<00:01:24.729> us

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
they've held touched used that makes us

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.700 
they've held touched used that makes us
feel<00:01:25.119> that<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.450> are<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:26.020> part<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.500> their

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
feel that we are a part of their

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.550 
feel that we are a part of their
existence<00:01:27.250> if<00:01:27.670> students<00:01:28.390> are<00:01:28.630> using<00:01:28.840> datasets

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
existence if students are using datasets

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.310 
existence if students are using datasets
to<00:01:30.490> create<00:01:30.940> their<00:01:31.270> own<00:01:31.300> friends<00:01:32.050> they're

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
to create their own friends they're

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.950 
to create their own friends they're
obviously<00:01:32.860> taking<00:01:33.369> on<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.940> science<00:01:34.750> and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
obviously taking on the science and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.070 
obviously taking on the science and
technology<00:01:35.680> end<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:37.360> think<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.810> there

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
technology end of it I think that there

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.290 
technology end of it I think that there
are<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.380> number<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:39.040> ways<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:39.820> it'll<00:01:40.119> enhance

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
are a number of ways that it'll enhance

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.700 
are a number of ways that it'll enhance
classroom<00:01:41.020> learning

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.360 

the<00:01:45.710> 3d<00:01:46.130> viewer<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.880> think<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:47.960> going<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.350> be<00:01:48.650> one

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
the 3d viewer I think is going to be one

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.580 
the 3d viewer I think is going to be one
of<00:01:49.640> those<00:01:49.910> great<00:01:50.540> things<00:01:50.570> in<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.380> classroom

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
of those great things in the classroom

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.680 
of those great things in the classroom
one<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.280> things<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.760> we<00:01:53.180> work<00:01:53.390> hard<00:01:53.630> to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
one of the things that we work hard to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.200 
one of the things that we work hard to
teach<00:01:54.020> students<00:01:54.470> about<00:01:55.220> history<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:56.000> that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
teach students about history is that

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.690 
teach students about history is that
it's<00:01:56.540> always<00:01:56.780> being<00:01:56.960> told<00:01:57.140> from<00:01:57.410> multiple

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
it's always being told from multiple

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.690 
it's always being told from multiple
perspectives<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.050> the<00:02:00.050> tour<00:02:00.710> tool<00:02:01.130> will

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
perspectives and so the tour tool will

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.690 
perspectives and so the tour tool will
allow<00:02:01.850> us<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.240> look<00:02:02.810> at<00:02:03.020> an<00:02:03.260> object<00:02:03.410> in<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.130> bunch

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
allow us to look at an object in a bunch

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580 
allow us to look at an object in a bunch
of<00:02:04.820> different<00:02:04.880> ways<00:02:05.210> on<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.600> 3d<00:02:05.930> viewer<00:02:06.230> there

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
of different ways on the 3d viewer there

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.710 
of different ways on the 3d viewer there
will<00:02:06.800> be<00:02:06.830> what<00:02:07.490> we're<00:02:07.610> calling<00:02:07.760> hotspots<00:02:08.390> and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
will be what we're calling hotspots and

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.380 
will be what we're calling hotspots and
their<00:02:09.470> pinpoints<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.580> different<00:02:10.910> pieces<00:02:11.120> of

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
their pinpoints to different pieces of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.350 
their pinpoints to different pieces of
the<00:02:11.870> object<00:02:12.350> what<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.980> does<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.850> enables

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the object what it does is it enables

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.990 
the object what it does is it enables
them<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.630> self<00:02:15.290> guide<00:02:15.500> what<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.430> excites

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
them to self guide what really excites

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.300 
them to self guide what really excites
me<00:02:17.090> for<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.540> future<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.680> we'd<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:19.100> to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
me for the future is that we'd like to

me for the future is that we'd like to
have<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.730> tool<00:02:19.970> be<00:02:20.210> available<00:02:20.870> as<00:02:20.990> an

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
have the tool be available as an
