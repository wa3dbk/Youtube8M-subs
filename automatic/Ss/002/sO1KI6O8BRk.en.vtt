00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello personnel Professor Andrew 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:12.249
 today I will show you how to remove the 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:15.879
 thermal cooler of processors 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:18.670
 or even a chipset to make the 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:26.020
 removal of the thermal paste we must 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:28.960
 using isopropyl alcohol is not 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.910
 recommended you use water and detergent 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.870
 Anyway, you should use alcohol 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.050
 isopropyl because it does not water it 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.440
 is recommended for cleaning there plate 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:45.539
 circuits and there we will use it to 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:52.059
 remove the thermal paste from the vat 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:56.789
 and processors to make the removal 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:01:00.789
 you must remove the excess paste 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.639
 using cotton on cotton swab 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:10.320
 if you do not have cotton swab you 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:10.320
 You can use a piece of toilet paper 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.630
 training 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.619
 after removing the excess you will play the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:25.119
 public allthingsd is not cooler after 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:28.630
 on the processor where the folder is to 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.280
 remove excess from it 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.430
 in this video here we are showing 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.310
 focusing more AllThingsD the problem is 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.330
 used to make this removal in the next 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.590
 I'll show you how to apply the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.830
 thermal paste 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.770
 Ok, we finished the video here. 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.830
 however filming it will continue our 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.060
 friend is daniel it will start and the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.860
 removal of the thermal paste and document 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.860
 and then the processors 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.020
 of power 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.940
 comes 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.319
 there is this beauty here is to expose the sandro 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.990
 to play more 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.690
 ae
