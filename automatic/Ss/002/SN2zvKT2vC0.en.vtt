00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
that holds the bushings before you

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.350 
that holds the bushings before you
remove<00:00:51.100> this<00:00:51.280> bolt<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.699> make<00:00:51.820> sure<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.030> check

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
remove this bolt to make sure you check

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.420 
remove this bolt to make sure you check
how<00:00:52.720> far<00:00:53.050> it's<00:00:53.230> threaded<00:00:53.620> into<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.860> nut<00:00:54.160> in

how far it's threaded into the nut in
the<00:00:54.699> motor<00:00:54.910> mount<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:56.230> you'll<00:00:56.500> have<00:00:56.620> to

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
the motor mount because you'll have to

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.280 
the motor mount because you'll have to
set<00:00:56.949> it<00:00:57.070> back<00:00:57.190> to<00:00:57.370> that<00:00:57.489> exact<00:00:57.790> same<00:00:57.970> spot

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
set it back to that exact same spot

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:07.609 
set it back to that exact same spot
later<00:00:59.290> on

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.779 

this<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:08.799> where<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.069> used<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.429> little<00:01:09.549> bit<00:01:09.700> of

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
this is where you used a little bit of

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.969 
this is where you used a little bit of
grease<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.210> get<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.630> make<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.840> easier<00:01:11.409> sliding

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
grease to get to make it easier sliding

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.340 
grease to get to make it easier sliding
these<00:01:12.189> performance<00:01:13.030> bushings<00:01:13.390> back<00:01:14.020> into

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
these performance bushings back into

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.429 
these performance bushings back into
these<00:01:14.469> cups<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:16.270> else<00:01:16.539> it's<00:01:16.719> very<00:01:16.990> difficult

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
these cups or else it's very difficult

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.779 
these cups or else it's very difficult
to<00:01:17.649> get<00:01:17.740> them<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.009> there<00:01:18.189> since<00:01:18.399> they're<00:01:18.579> very

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
to get them in there since they're very

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.690 
to get them in there since they're very
grippy<00:01:19.179> a<00:01:20.020> little<00:01:20.950> bit<00:01:21.039> of<00:01:21.130> grease<00:01:21.280> helped

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
grippy a little bit of grease helped

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.870 
grippy a little bit of grease helped
make<00:01:22.569> it<00:01:22.719> much<00:01:22.959> easier<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.530> recommend<00:01:24.490> which<00:01:24.700> we

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
make it much easier I recommend which we

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.669 
make it much easier I recommend which we
didn't<00:01:25.149> do<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.509> grease<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:26.049> stem<00:01:26.409> also

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
didn't do is grease this stem also

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.740 
didn't do is grease this stem also
because<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.399> makes<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.849> very<00:01:28.000> hard<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.420> shove

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
because it makes it very hard to shove

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.480 
because it makes it very hard to shove
this<00:01:28.899> thing<00:01:28.959> on<00:01:29.259> we<00:01:29.500> have<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.679> try<00:01:29.890> twice<00:01:29.950> to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
this thing on we have to try twice to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.580 
this thing on we have to try twice to
get<00:01:30.609> it<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.880> push<00:01:31.179> on<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.929> that's<00:01:32.079> using<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:32.439> lot

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
get it to push on and that's using a lot

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.399 
get it to push on and that's using a lot
of<00:01:32.709> body<00:01:32.859> strength<00:01:33.219> to<00:01:33.340> push<00:01:33.640> upwards<00:01:34.409> what

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
of body strength to push upwards what

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.949 
of body strength to push upwards what
popped<00:01:35.649> out<00:01:35.859> was<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.250> was<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.670> nut<00:01:37.299> that<00:01:37.539> sits

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
popped out was the was the nut that sits

order to record it on video so probably

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.710 
order to record it on video so probably
about<00:03:15.950> 20<00:03:16.640> minutes<00:03:16.970> half<00:03:17.180> an<00:03:17.300> hour<00:03:17.450> at<00:03:17.600> the

mounts<00:03:38.270> weren't<00:03:38.480> available<00:03:38.960> this<00:03:39.140> one<00:03:39.350> was

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
mounts weren't available this one was

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.500 
mounts weren't available this one was
available<00:03:39.650> because<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.340> Veloster<00:03:40.850> is<00:03:41.330> a

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
available because the Veloster is a

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.090 
available because the Veloster is a
popular<00:03:41.990> car<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.560> lot<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.800> aftermarket

popular car and a lot of aftermarket
parts<00:03:43.370> for<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:44.450> i<00:03:44.810> just<00:03:45.140> grabbed<00:03:45.680> these

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
parts for it so i just grabbed these

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.420 
parts for it so i just grabbed these
these<00:03:47.750> mounts<00:03:48.470> since<00:03:48.710> the<00:03:48.860> Veloster<00:03:49.220> has<00:03:49.340> a

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
these mounts since the Veloster has a

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.720 
these mounts since the Veloster has a
identical<00:03:49.880> motor<00:03:50.150> mount<00:03:51.490> much<00:03:52.490> better

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
identical motor mount much better

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.060 
identical motor mount much better
performance<00:03:53.030> no<00:03:53.570> wheel<00:03:54.110> hop<00:03:54.350> anymore<00:03:54.830> from

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
performance no wheel hop anymore from

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.500 
performance no wheel hop anymore from
the<00:03:55.130> engine<00:03:55.520> jumping<00:03:55.850> back<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.030> forth<00:03:56.210> on

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
the engine jumping back and forth on

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.560 
the engine jumping back and forth on
those<00:03:56.660> soft<00:03:56.840> motor<00:03:57.140> mounts<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:58.150> well<00:03:59.150> worth<00:03:59.300> it

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
those soft motor mounts so well worth it

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.280 
those soft motor mounts so well worth it
I'd<00:03:59.690> say<00:04:00.850> that<00:04:01.850> part<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.300> vibrations<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.050> do

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
I'd say that part is vibrations you do

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.630 
I'd say that part is vibrations you do
get<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.530> vibration<00:04:04.010> because<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.250> engine<00:04:04.520> has

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
get the vibration because the engine has

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.880 
get the vibration because the engine has
a<00:04:04.670> rough<00:04:04.910> idle<00:04:05.180> rough<00:04:05.630> vibration<00:04:06.350> at<00:04:06.470> around<00:04:06.740> a

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
a rough idle rough vibration at around a

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.260 
a rough idle rough vibration at around a
thousand<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.790> 1100<00:04:08.360> rpm<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:10.000> when<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.090> first

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
thousand to 1100 rpm so when you first

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.510 
thousand to 1100 rpm so when you first
start<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.510> car<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:11.870> it's<00:04:11.990> cold<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:13.220> engines

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
start the car and it's cold the engines

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.580 
start the car and it's cold the engines
cold<00:04:13.700> it'll<00:04:14.000> idle<00:04:14.330> at<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.630> rpm<00:04:15.020> which

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
cold it'll idle at that rpm which

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.849

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
clump of the engine jerking around so I

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.280 
clump of the engine jerking around so I
really<00:04:52.820> like<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.120> I<00:04:53.300> definitely<00:04:53.900> put<00:04:54.050> up<00:04:54.139> the

really like it I definitely put up the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.080 
really like it I definitely put up the
vibe<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.680> small<00:04:54.979> amount<00:04:55.160> of<00:04:55.250> vibration<00:04:55.820> and

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
vibe the small amount of vibration and

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.190 
vibe the small amount of vibration and
just<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.050> get<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:57.290> type<00:04:57.620> of<00:04:57.650> performance
