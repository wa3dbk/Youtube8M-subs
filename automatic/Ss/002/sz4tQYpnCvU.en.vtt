00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
maybe there is something what could be

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.000

improved<00:03:17.120> by<00:03:18.120> wolfing<00:03:19.610> it's<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:21.800> heard<00:03:22.800> that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
improved by wolfing it's I heard that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.790 
improved by wolfing it's I heard that
some<00:03:23.430> people<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:24.180> some<00:03:24.930> movers<00:03:25.260> are<00:03:25.380> not<00:03:25.530> very

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800

happy<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.459> their<00:03:26.640> farms<00:03:27.260> because<00:03:28.260> maybe<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
happy with their farms because maybe the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.810 
happy with their farms because maybe the
conditions<00:03:30.060> are<00:03:30.330> not<00:03:30.540> as<00:03:30.870> good<00:03:31.590> as<00:03:31.860> at<00:03:32.400> our

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.290 
conditions are not as good as at our
farm<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:34.110> maybe<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:35.340> would<00:03:35.519> be<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.700> good<00:03:35.910> idea

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
farm so maybe it would be a good idea

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.020 
farm so maybe it would be a good idea
when<00:03:36.930> someone<00:03:37.410> visited<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> farms<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.760> see
