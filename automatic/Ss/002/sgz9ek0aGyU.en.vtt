00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
of the NLCS and what I'm talking about

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.769 
of the NLCS and what I'm talking about
here<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:20.100> use<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.580> clean<00:00:20.910> arm<00:00:21.240> swing<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
here is the use of a clean arm swing and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.750 
here is the use of a clean arm swing and
efficient<00:00:22.230> arm<00:00:22.410> swing<00:00:22.740> into<00:00:23.160> rotation

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
efficient arm swing into rotation

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
efficient arm swing into rotation
something<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.930> these<00:00:25.170> two

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
something that I think that these two

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.339 
something that I think that these two
guys<00:00:25.670> demonstrate<00:00:26.670> very<00:00:26.910> well<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.960> has

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
guys demonstrate very well and has

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.830 
guys demonstrate very well and has
allowed<00:00:28.650> them<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.179> experience<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.390> high<00:00:30.539> level

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
allowed them to experience a high level

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
allowed them to experience a high level
of<00:00:31.140> results<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.040> continue<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.850> dominate

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
of results and continue to dominate

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.639 
of results and continue to dominate
hitters<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.750> let's<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.050> ahead<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.469> right

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
hitters so let's go ahead and get right

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.090 
hitters so let's go ahead and get right
to<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280 
to it
now<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:36.180> I'm<00:00:36.270> talking<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.110> got

now what I'm talking about is here I got
both<00:00:37.469> these<00:00:37.649> guys<00:00:37.860> synched<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.730> we're

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
both these guys synched up and we're

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
both these guys synched up and we're
going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> look<00:00:39.629> at<00:00:39.780> how<00:00:40.020> they<00:00:40.230> both<00:00:40.520> bring<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
going to look at how they both bring the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.529 
going to look at how they both bring the
ball<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.989> glove<00:00:43.250> okay<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.550> initially

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
ball out of the glove okay is initially

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.799 
ball out of the glove okay is initially
moving<00:00:46.110> into<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.280> arm<00:00:47.550> swing<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.690> we're

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
moving into the arm swing and what we're

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.529 
moving into the arm swing and what we're
going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:50.210> we're<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.449> ahead

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
going to do here is we're to go ahead

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.189 
going to do here is we're to go ahead
and<00:00:51.899> draw<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.590> line<00:00:53.219> okay<00:00:53.940> coming<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.020> really

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and draw a line okay coming up really

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.369 
and draw a line okay coming up really
from<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.190> back<00:00:56.520> heel<00:00:57.710> upwards<00:00:58.760> okay<00:01:00.020> from<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
from the back heel upwards okay from the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
from the back heel upwards okay from the
mound<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.949> we'll<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.780> both

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
mound so we'll do it do this with both

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.850 
mound so we'll do it do this with both
throwers<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.930> what<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.049> want<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> try<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> see

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
throwers and what we want to try to see

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.289 
throwers and what we want to try to see
as<00:01:08.189> both<00:01:08.939> guys<00:01:09.210> move<00:01:09.659> into<00:01:10.110> rotation<00:01:11.299> does

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
as both guys move into rotation does

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.899 
as both guys move into rotation does
this<00:01:12.570> arm<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.950> behind<00:01:14.220> their<00:01:14.700> back

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this arm really get behind their back

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.609 
this arm really get behind their back
now<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> camera<00:01:15.689> angles<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.320> bit

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
now the camera angles are a little bit

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
now the camera angles are a little bit
different<00:01:17.340> they're<00:01:17.729> slightly<00:01:17.970> angled<00:01:18.570> so

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
different they're slightly angled so

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.080 
different they're slightly angled so
there<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.070> degree<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.909> variability

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
there will be a degree of variability

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.080 
there will be a degree of variability
here<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.380> start<00:01:22.650> inferring<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> few

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
here but we can start inferring a few

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
here but we can start inferring a few
things<00:01:24.479> okay<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> want<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> talk

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
things okay and what I want to talk

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.330 
things okay and what I want to talk
about<00:01:26.670> initially<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.390> let's<00:01:28.140> focus<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
about initially is let's focus on the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.030 
about initially is let's focus on the
hands<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> both<00:01:30.390> throwers<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.770> bring

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

hands of both throwers so as they bring
the<00:01:32.220> hand<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.000> glove<00:01:33.270> you'll<00:01:33.570> see

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the hand out of the glove you'll see

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.649 
the hand out of the glove you'll see
here<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.619> Wacha<00:01:34.920> his<00:01:35.340> hand<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.180> over<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
plane here of the body so I drew this

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.100 
plane here of the body so I drew this
line<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.570> sure<00:01:54.600> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you're most of the arm action in the bag

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.719 
you're most of the arm action in the bag
this<00:01:57.600> arm<00:01:57.930> swing<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.530> occurring<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
this arm swing is occurring on the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.580 
this arm swing is occurring on the
inside<00:02:00.540> part<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.790> this<00:02:02.790> line<00:02:03.119> okay<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.110> what

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
inside part of this line okay and what

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740 
inside part of this line okay and what
you'll<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.180> know<00:02:06.299> walk<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
you'll see is here you know walk it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
you'll see is here you know walk it
probably<00:02:07.049> gets<00:02:07.200> his<00:02:07.350> hands<00:02:07.890> maybe<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.670> little

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
probably gets his hands maybe a little

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.119 
probably gets his hands maybe a little
bit<00:02:09.090> far<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.200> relationship<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.979> where

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
bit far but in a relationship to where

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.300 
bit far but in a relationship to where
his<00:02:11.310> shoulder<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.879> it's<00:02:12.239> pretty<00:02:12.660> good

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
his shoulder is it's pretty good

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
his shoulder is it's pretty good
okay<00:02:13.760> Kershaw's<00:02:14.360> probably<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> little<00:02:14.900> bit

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
okay Kershaw's probably a little bit

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.440 
okay Kershaw's probably a little bit
better<00:02:15.319> here<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.950> keeping<00:02:16.640> his<00:02:16.760> arm<00:02:17.000> swing<00:02:17.300> in

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
better here I keeping his arm swing in

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.070 
better here I keeping his arm swing in
the<00:02:17.540> plane<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.650> both<00:02:18.860> guys<00:02:19.160> get<00:02:19.819> into<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.480> great

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
the plane but both guys get into a great

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.830 
the plane but both guys get into a great
position<00:02:21.890> as<00:02:22.489> they<00:02:22.880> begin<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.300> accelerate

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
position as they begin to accelerate

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.300 
position as they begin to accelerate
okay<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:26.000> can<00:02:26.150> see<00:02:26.180> here<00:02:26.890> Kershaw<00:02:27.890> looks

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
okay so you can see here Kershaw looks

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.440 
okay so you can see here Kershaw looks
like<00:02:28.459> he's<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.700> little<00:02:28.940> bit<00:02:29.030> more<00:02:29.239> together

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
like he's a little bit more together

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.680 
like he's a little bit more together
okay<00:02:30.410> walk<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.280> here<00:02:31.730> he's<00:02:31.940> kind<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.269> straight

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
okay walk it here he's kind of straight

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.860 
okay walk it here he's kind of straight
down<00:02:32.989> but<00:02:33.830> as<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.580> bodies<00:02:34.940> move<00:02:35.269> in<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.750> it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
down but as the bodies move in and it

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.290 
down but as the bodies move in and it
starts<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.230> move<00:02:36.410> into<00:02:36.709> acceleration

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
starts to move into acceleration

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.690 
starts to move into acceleration
you'll<00:02:38.599> notice<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.110> really<00:02:39.800> both<00:02:40.400> guys

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
you'll notice that really both guys

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.410 
you'll notice that really both guys
elbows<00:02:41.330> are<00:02:41.840> below<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.500> shoulder<00:02:43.040> okay<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.300> we

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
elbows are below the shoulder okay so we

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.690 
elbows are below the shoulder okay so we
can<00:02:44.540> check<00:02:44.750> them<00:02:44.930> here<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.410> really<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.370> sets

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
can check them here and really this sets

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.410 
can check them here and really this sets
them<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.750> deliver<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:49.130> baseball<00:02:49.670> from<00:02:50.269> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
them up to deliver the baseball from a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.259 
them up to deliver the baseball from a
really<00:02:50.720> supported<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.530> healthy<00:02:51.920> position

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
really supported and healthy position

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.300 
really supported and healthy position
okay<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:53.330> you'll<00:02:53.630> see<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.650> hand<00:02:55.069> is

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
okay so you'll see that the hand is

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.190 
okay so you'll see that the hand is
still<00:02:55.580> facing<00:02:55.910> towards<00:02:56.540> first<00:02:56.750> base<00:02:56.870> for

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
still facing towards first base for

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
still facing towards first base for
Kershaw<00:02:57.620> third<00:02:58.459> base<00:02:58.790> for<00:02:59.060> Wacha<00:02:59.330> now<00:03:00.230> one

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
Kershaw third base for Wacha now one

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.660 
Kershaw third base for Wacha now one
thing<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.569> they<00:03:02.569> both<00:03:02.870> do<00:03:03.230> very<00:03:03.560> well<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:04.310> as

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
thing that they both do very well is as

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.420 
thing that they both do very well is as
they<00:03:05.000> are<00:03:05.299> beginning<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:06.019> move<00:03:06.230> into<00:03:06.560> rotation

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
they are beginning to move into rotation

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.580 
they are beginning to move into rotation
here<00:03:07.670> if<00:03:07.760> we<00:03:07.880> go<00:03:08.060> from<00:03:08.299> this<00:03:08.510> frame<00:03:08.840> you'll

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
here if we go from this frame you'll

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.210 
here if we go from this frame you'll
notice<00:03:10.239> they<00:03:11.239> start<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.720> use<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.319> degree<00:03:12.950> of

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
notice they start to use a degree of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.120 
notice they start to use a degree of
thoracic<00:03:13.849> extension<00:03:14.269> where<00:03:14.900> you'll<00:03:15.049> see<00:03:15.319> the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
thoracic extension where you'll see the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.259 
thoracic extension where you'll see the
back<00:03:16.819> arch<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:19.040> start<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.430> prepare<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:20.030> body

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
back arch to start to prepare the body

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.170 
back arch to start to prepare the body
to<00:03:20.989> get<00:03:21.560> into<00:03:21.799> rotational<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.670> is<00:03:22.820> extremely

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
to get into rotational this is extremely

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.080 
to get into rotational this is extremely
valuable<00:03:23.480> in<00:03:24.200> terms<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.769> how<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.370> arm<00:03:25.700> swing

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
valuable in terms of how the arm swing

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.250 
valuable in terms of how the arm swing
can<00:03:26.359> be<00:03:26.540> best<00:03:26.930> utilized<00:03:27.880> into<00:03:28.880> rotation<00:03:29.569> so<00:03:30.079> if

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
can be best utilized into rotation so if

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.979 
can be best utilized into rotation so if
it<00:03:30.380> stays<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:31.069> these<00:03:31.730> planes<00:03:32.209> here<00:03:32.660> which<00:03:32.810> I've

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
it stays in these planes here which I've

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.910 
it stays in these planes here which I've
outlined<00:03:33.579> with<00:03:34.579> this<00:03:34.790> line<00:03:35.260> then<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.650> allows

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
outlined with this line then it allows

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.030 
outlined with this line then it allows
them<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:37.880> greatest<00:03:38.209> opportunity<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.470> rotate

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
them the greatest opportunity to rotate

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.819 
them the greatest opportunity to rotate
the<00:03:40.160> arm<00:03:40.400> freely<00:03:41.060> into<00:03:41.870> rotation<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.620> if<00:03:42.709> we

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
the arm freely into rotation so if we

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.280 
the arm freely into rotation so if we
look<00:03:43.040> at<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.370> position<00:03:43.910> here<00:03:44.239> okay<00:03:44.930> which<00:03:45.170> is

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
look at this position here okay which is

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.930 
look at this position here okay which is
relatively<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.859> same<00:03:45.950> position<00:03:46.670> for<00:03:46.880> each

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
relatively the same position for each

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.780 
relatively the same position for each
thrower<00:03:47.420> you'll<00:03:48.079> notice<00:03:48.470> from<00:03:48.620> here<00:03:48.790> okay

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
thrower you'll notice from here okay

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.729 
thrower you'll notice from here okay
where<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.450> relationship<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.170> with<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.470> hand

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
where the relationship is with the hand

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.940 
where the relationship is with the hand
and<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:52.010> elbow<00:03:52.310> okay<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.299> then<00:03:53.900> from<00:03:54.440> here<00:03:54.470> as

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
and the elbow okay and then from here as

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.129 
and the elbow okay and then from here as
they<00:03:55.130> begin<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.549> rotate<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.329> as<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.750> hips

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
they begin to rotate so as the hips

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.830 
they begin to rotate so as the hips
concentrate<00:03:58.069> on<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.220> hips<00:03:58.430> as<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.970> hip<00:03:59.299> rotates

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
concentrate on the hips as a hip rotates

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.280 
concentrate on the hips as a hip rotates
you'll<00:04:00.350> see<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.650> arm<00:04:00.920> go<00:04:01.280> kind<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.819> into<00:04:02.090> this

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
you'll see the arm go kind of into this

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.710 
you'll see the arm go kind of into this
vertical<00:04:03.290> position<00:04:04.010> alright<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.540> is

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
vertical position alright and this is

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.530 
vertical position alright and this is
what<00:04:05.900> we<00:04:06.019> really<00:04:06.260> want<00:04:06.350> to<00:04:06.590> achieve<00:04:07.100> as<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
what we really want to achieve as the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.990 
what we really want to achieve as the
thrower<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.380> going<00:04:10.010> into<00:04:10.280> thoracic<00:04:10.850> extension

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
thrower is going into thoracic extension

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.440 
thrower is going into thoracic extension
and<00:04:11.750> rotating<00:04:12.560> towards<00:04:12.739> delivering<00:04:13.519> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
and rotating towards delivering the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.250 
and rotating towards delivering the
baseball<00:04:14.739> okay<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:17.329> hand<00:04:17.600> is<00:04:17.810> still<00:04:17.989> over

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
baseball okay so the hand is still over

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.620 
baseball okay so the hand is still over
the<00:04:18.350> ball<00:04:18.560> here<00:04:18.859> in<00:04:18.889> both<00:04:19.160> frames<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:19.940> as<00:04:20.389> the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
the ball here in both frames and as the

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.740 
the ball here in both frames and as the
hip<00:04:20.840> rotates<00:04:21.349> you'll<00:04:21.530> see<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:23.000> path<00:04:23.300> of

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
hip rotates you'll see the the path of

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.080 
hip rotates you'll see the the path of
the<00:04:24.380> elbow<00:04:24.950> to<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.490> hand

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
the elbow to the hand

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.590 
the elbow to the hand
really<00:04:26.720> become<00:04:27.139> more<00:04:27.860> vertical<00:04:28.520> here<00:04:28.820> okay<00:04:29.330> in

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
really become more vertical here okay in

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.200 
really become more vertical here okay in
both<00:04:29.810> throwers<00:04:30.470> all<00:04:31.160> right<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.639> is<00:04:32.060> this

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
both throwers all right and is this

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.510 
both throwers all right and is this
really<00:04:32.300> sets<00:04:32.810> up<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.530> shoulder<00:04:33.919> capsule<00:04:34.370> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
really sets up the shoulder capsule the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.820 
really sets up the shoulder capsule the
elbow<00:04:34.970> beginning<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.930> rotate<00:04:36.500> in<00:04:36.740> the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
elbow beginning to rotate in the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.400 
elbow beginning to rotate in the
supported<00:04:37.370> manner<00:04:37.580> with<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:37.940> trunk<00:04:38.449> okay<00:04:39.290> and

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
supported manner with the trunk okay and

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.500 
supported manner with the trunk okay and
this<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:39.560> really<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:42.400> best<00:04:43.400> use<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:43.970> the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
this is really the the best use of the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.050 
this is really the the best use of the
arm<00:04:44.720> swing<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.199> how<00:04:45.320> it<00:04:45.530> can<00:04:45.650> allow<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.430> pitcher

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
arm swing and how it can allow a pitcher

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.930 
arm swing and how it can allow a pitcher
to<00:04:47.570> consistently<00:04:48.169> get<00:04:48.470> into<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.280> consistent

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
to consistently get into a consistent

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.439 
to consistently get into a consistent
release<00:04:50.479> point<00:04:50.840> out<00:04:51.169> front<00:04:51.770> okay<00:04:52.120> both<00:04:53.120> guys

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
release point out front okay both guys

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.680 
release point out front okay both guys
are<00:04:53.870> pretty<00:04:54.830> good<00:04:54.919> examples<00:04:55.669> of<00:04:55.940> how<00:04:56.389> to<00:04:56.449> go

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
are pretty good examples of how to go

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.379 
are pretty good examples of how to go
about<00:04:56.840> doing<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:57.620> okay<00:04:58.280> they're<00:04:59.090> each<00:04:59.240> a

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
about doing it okay they're each a

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.300 
about doing it okay they're each a
little<00:04:59.540> bit<00:04:59.780> unique<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.740> they<00:05:00.950> allow<00:05:01.250> the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
little bit unique but they allow the

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.159 
little bit unique but they allow the
hand<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:02.000> kind<00:05:02.240> of<00:05:02.330> stay<00:05:02.540> in<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.810> consistent

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
hand to kind of stay in a consistent

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.280 
hand to kind of stay in a consistent
plane<00:05:03.710> as<00:05:04.100> they're<00:05:04.790> moving<00:05:05.000> into<00:05:05.510> this

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
plane as they're moving into this

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.390 
plane as they're moving into this
position<00:05:06.889> okay<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:08.080> this<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.229> a<00:05:09.260> way<00:05:09.530> to<00:05:10.190> where

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
position okay and this is a way to where

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.490 
position okay and this is a way to where
you<00:05:10.970> know<00:05:11.060> every<00:05:11.450> thrower<00:05:11.720> can<00:05:11.990> benefit<00:05:12.440> from

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
you know every thrower can benefit from

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.110 
you know every thrower can benefit from
watching<00:05:13.160> some<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.400> these<00:05:13.520> guys<00:05:13.760> in<00:05:13.790> the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
watching some of these guys in the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.200 
watching some of these guys in the
playoffs<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:15.040> how<00:05:16.040> they<00:05:16.280> begin<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.910> rotate

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
playoffs and how they begin to rotate

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.350 
playoffs and how they begin to rotate
okay<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:18.440> this<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:18.889> really<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.760> know<00:05:19.880> they

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
okay and this is really you know they

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.320 
okay and this is really you know they
the<00:05:20.840> crucial<00:05:21.289> component<00:05:21.919> of<00:05:22.010> when<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:23.000> begin

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
the crucial component of when you begin

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.200 
the crucial component of when you begin
to<00:05:23.510> rotate<00:05:23.979> where<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.130> elbow<00:05:25.490> needs<00:05:25.729> to<00:05:25.880> be<00:05:26.060> in

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
to rotate where the elbow needs to be in

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.760 
to rotate where the elbow needs to be in
relationship<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:27.080> shoulder<00:05:27.470> and<00:05:27.500> both

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
relationship to the shoulder and both

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.150 
relationship to the shoulder and both
throwers<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:28.520> how<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.120> hips<00:05:29.840> rotate<00:05:30.440> allow

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
throwers and how the hips rotate allow

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.460 
throwers and how the hips rotate allow
the<00:05:31.220> arm<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.700> start<00:05:32.030> working<00:05:32.479> with<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:33.050> body

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
the arm to start working with the body

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.310 
the arm to start working with the body
into<00:05:34.340> acceleration<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:35.419> then<00:05:35.840> into<00:05:36.169> the

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
into acceleration and then into the

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.450 
into acceleration and then into the
finish<00:05:36.710> okay<00:05:37.370> so<00:05:37.880> just<00:05:38.270> to<00:05:38.389> recap<00:05:39.340> when<00:05:40.340> they

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
finish okay so just to recap when they

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.250 
finish okay so just to recap when they
bring<00:05:40.639> in<00:05:40.760> the<00:05:40.820> ball<00:05:41.030> out<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.389> glove<00:05:41.539> the

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
bring in the ball out of the glove the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.900 
bring in the ball out of the glove the
hands<00:05:42.590> are<00:05:42.710> staying<00:05:42.950> towards<00:05:43.430> third-base<00:05:43.669> the

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
hands are staying towards third-base the

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.659 
hands are staying towards third-base the
arm<00:05:44.389> is<00:05:44.630> moving<00:05:45.130> consistently<00:05:46.130> with<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.430> body

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
arm is moving consistently with the body

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.690 
arm is moving consistently with the body
is<00:05:47.270> staying<00:05:47.720> in<00:05:47.900> this<00:05:48.050> good<00:05:48.289> plane<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:49.370> as<00:05:49.460> the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
is staying in this good plane and as the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.640 
is staying in this good plane and as the
hip<00:05:49.910> rotates<00:05:50.450> and<00:05:50.840> they<00:05:50.990> start<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.349> go<00:05:51.500> into

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
hip rotates and they start to go into

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.490 
hip rotates and they start to go into
the<00:05:51.830> thoracic<00:05:51.950> extension<00:05:52.780> okay<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:54.289> arm

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
the thoracic extension okay the arm

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.550 
the thoracic extension okay the arm
comes<00:05:54.830> up<00:05:55.070> naturally<00:05:55.510> here<00:05:56.510> you<00:05:57.050> can<00:05:57.200> start<00:05:57.470> to

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
comes up naturally here you can start to

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.159 
comes up naturally here you can start to
see<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.830> retraction<00:05:58.280> of<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.669> elbows<00:05:59.169> okay

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
see the retraction of the elbows okay

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.020 
see the retraction of the elbows okay
and<00:06:00.500> this<00:06:00.830> is<00:06:00.950> how<00:06:01.099> it<00:06:01.220> should<00:06:01.370> be<00:06:01.460> done<00:06:01.490> the

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
and this is how it should be done the

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.000 
and this is how it should be done the
elbow<00:06:02.599> shouldn't<00:06:02.960> be<00:06:03.020> getting<00:06:03.200> into<00:06:03.620> this

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
elbow shouldn't be getting into this

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.969 
elbow shouldn't be getting into this
position<00:06:04.389> without<00:06:05.389> the<00:06:05.599> use<00:06:05.960> of<00:06:05.990> the<00:06:06.680> thoracic

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
position without the use of the thoracic

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.310 
position without the use of the thoracic
extension<00:06:07.370> so<00:06:08.060> just<00:06:08.539> to<00:06:08.630> clarify<00:06:08.870> that<00:06:09.260> point

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
extension so just to clarify that point

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.890 
extension so just to clarify that point
you<00:06:10.010> can<00:06:10.160> see<00:06:10.340> how<00:06:10.520> both<00:06:10.760> throwers<00:06:11.210> here<00:06:11.539> their

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
you can see how both throwers here their

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.650 
you can see how both throwers here their
arms<00:06:12.200> fairly<00:06:12.590> extended<00:06:13.160> and<00:06:13.550> then<00:06:14.060> if<00:06:14.510> you

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
arms fairly extended and then if you
