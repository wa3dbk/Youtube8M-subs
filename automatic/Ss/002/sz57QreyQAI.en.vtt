 how about friends new video for the channel 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.850
 cactus since studies this time 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.610
 we bring a simple team but the 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.820
 true enough apt that would be the ctt x2 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.220
 come out in this model we will be able to 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.169
 find pretty good news 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.570
 functions or improve the functions of your 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.539
 previous versions first of all 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.970
 that what we will be able to find 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.579
 4 inch display android 4.4 and 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.699
 updated teacher of dual core to one 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.100
 to one arrives at heart and camera of 5 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.989
 megapixels or does not have flash you have to 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.800
 Be careful because if it 's field then 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.800
 what is flash 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.640
 let's see what we can find 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:48.190
 in this dear telefonito 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.190
 first Carlos was the normal 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.510
 what our hearing aids will do 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.290
 great little headphones are not chicharito 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.290
 they are not the support 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.810
 and what will be your charger to use 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.950
 simple recipes these chargers for 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.720
 all its original floor models 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.860
 obviously and on the battery 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.450
 what is that touch this account with let's 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.030
 open it so that it tells them well in what 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.880
 are the ministries and can be given a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.470
 good idea of how much it will be the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.570
 battery life that in this case 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.700
 as it is 4 inches I do not think they have 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.440
 many problems more than anything for this 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.490
 Screen morning that it is quite 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.300
 small there are three thousand 202 milliamps and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.440
 her hands 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.810
 does not come out 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.420
 apart from complete and what is our 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.720
 dear device which brings us back to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.340
 show exactly the same and what's going 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 to be a professor of alcohol facebook 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.600
 twitter android so they can take out 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.880
 the camera applications here 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.320
 in often it is these three buttons that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.590
 appear on an android display 4.4 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.729
 5 camera does not possess what is flash there 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.920
 have to be a little careful if you 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.800
 they look for the normal entry flash of 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.650
 3.5 microusb charging input 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.530
 charger the power button on this side and 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.930
 Volume and down volume up and down 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.870
 a true finish the baxada is pretty 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.690
 nice here is your voice and nita is very 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.180
 softly the lid the truth is that good 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.490
 for me the note is very comfortable 4 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.610
 Injurious inches that are already fashionable 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.470
 big teams but I think that still 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.130
 well the small and small teams 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.410
 like this are still a good bet 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.480
 well let's put it together to see how 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.659
 works 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.700
 ok you have already armed our device 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.700
 let's proceed to light 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.310
 to see how is your camera screen and 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.630
 the processor how are you going to work with 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.090
 what they are 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.580
 is a processor how is it going to work 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.620
 sorry it's about a presentation 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.930
 pretty pretty as a curious fact what 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.730
 are the three buttons light everything 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.890
 giving a touch to the truth then 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.340
 quite friendly is stressed that everything 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.340
 what is the team 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.310
 and in the same way with the technology of 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.920
 4.4 the team will support up to one 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.260
 32gb microsd 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.260
 let's configure it obviously spanish 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.790
 let's talk 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.420
 anyway, nothing happens 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.959
 pretty quick to turn that on 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.379
 truth is that it's very nice that 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.170
 work fast the buttons as we can 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.900
 see suddenly suddenly turn on not 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.680
 I guess I would do it more than anything like 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.660
 what 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.910
 and already create an effect but good in order 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.610
 let's continue this is going to be our 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.710
 dear acetate the presentation of the 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.410
 Pretty pretty screen on the button 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.570
 world seven times like that incorporates 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.680
 a little bit his own style with what 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.540
 is the interface pretty well fluid no 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.640
 be slow 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.459
 in which it is clear there are other teams that 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.850
 a little bit tougher and it looks 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.630
 a little more like that fluency here 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.150
 a little bit but it's not much more than 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.130
 ok let's now to one of the questions 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.699
 most important check if you really 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.860
 has the android 4.4 let's bring the 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:38.950
 4.4 point two android device 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.440
 more numbers to the solar the x2 max 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:47.050
 let's take out the beloved girl 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.050
 there he is giving him 4.4 points 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.820
 Now we are going to reduce again what is 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.409
 another curious fact does not have a camera 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.939
 frontal 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.080
 so here I have a little bit of 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:04.089
 be careful with that the space of 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.129
 storage 1.7 gigabytes basically 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.539
 I think it would be 2 gigabytes are 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.910
 crazy when the operating system to 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.430
 best 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.230
 what are a giga or the system and we 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.470
 leave available for applications are 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.560
 what we want what is 1.27 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.050
 gigas 1.11 you get sorry for 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.430
 applications music photos images i am 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.300
 that as always the idea is that better 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.169
 everything saved in the microsd card 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.270
 but anyway 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.610
 now 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.800
 let's check a very equation 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.420
 important also your camera to see what 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.370
 such are sorry 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.330
 we go often 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.920
 and there is the camera 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.020
 let's see how it looks is good 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.680
 the presentation would be to try 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.680
 overtake it 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.840
 sorry 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.170
 as always they will give us 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.170
 but what is the welcome 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.410
 how to use the camera the piston 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.360
 good that when you buy it or if 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.750
 you get animal by this phone then 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.750
 you will see 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.310
 let's see the camera 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:20.030
 of 5 the truth is that 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.030
 stable 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.880
 and what I do not like is how to focus what 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:29.620
 what are the fence 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.990
 it is not that yes 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.990
 for what is the good closeness a 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.860
 example we are recording with a super 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:41.620
 p55 and it looks like it's recording 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.260
 and now let's see what is the Christ 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.000
 like the letters a little bit but 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.490
 same for long-range photos as 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.150
 better maybe the comparison is better 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.150
 of this one 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:02.569
 what if I did not like it 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.569
 what is the focus of the camera 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:09.290
 but in the camera if I do not give it a 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.170
 popcorn because the truth if not lost 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:15.080
 to make 5 megapixels that 's so that 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.750
 I had a little more of more quality 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.780
 for the short profile approach 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.570
 I say the same can serve well on the sides 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.710
 good thing is that it's an economic team what 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.120
 they will be able to find me with a 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.280
 quite accessible price depending on the 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.910
 dealer as always will depend 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.490
 of the distributor fluency is pretty the 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.830
 interface also no I do not see any 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.930
 classic complaint that can create 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.129
 are the folders an almost clean android 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.219
 very nearly 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:46.739
 it did not change it much the company is 

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:49.249
 super good then for the truth it's very 

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:49.249
 nice 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.800
 something bad more than the camera that yes no no 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.430
 I like it a lot 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.889
 if it does not convince me 100% for everything 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.259
 otherwise, yes, the truth was quite 

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:04.090
 he's quite good in team but in short 

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:05.590
 taste breaks genres here 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.360
 waiting, as always, for this little one 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.580
 and simple video solve what are your 

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.349
 doubt if it is like this and do not forget to share it 

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.610
 that the only thing we asked in the channel and 

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:14.319
 we'll see you in the next video of 

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:18.300
 health technology of your friend and companion 

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:18.300
 cactus yak until the next video
