00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
a bit different it does look like a

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.450 
a bit different it does look like a
really<00:00:15.299> cool<00:00:15.420> puzzle<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.619> prefer<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
really cool puzzle but I do prefer the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.880 
really cool puzzle but I do prefer the
other<00:00:17.490> kind<00:00:18.260> with<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> other<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.800> other

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
other kind with the other the other

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
other kind with the other the other
colors<00:00:20.220> when<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> solve<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.600> actually

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
colors when I solve on this I actually

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.880 
colors when I solve on this I actually
find<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.800> difficult<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:24.890> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
find it really really difficult to to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.359 
find it really really difficult to to
get<00:00:26.220> my<00:00:26.390> recognition<00:00:27.390> down<00:00:28.039> and<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.189> I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
get my recognition down and I think I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.859 
get my recognition down and I think I
need<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> maybe<00:00:29.760> tension<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.599> little<00:00:30.720> bit

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
need to maybe tension this a little bit

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.530 
need to maybe tension this a little bit
better<00:00:31.019> too<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:32.059> let's<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> quick

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
better too but let's just do a quick

00:00:33.540 --> 00:01:00.950 
better too but let's just do a quick
solve<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:40.820> alright<00:00:41.960> so<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> um<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.930> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
solve here alright so so um as you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
solve here alright so so um as you can
see<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.230> moves<00:01:01.410> pretty<00:01:01.559> good<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.980> corner<00:01:02.219> cuts

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
see it moves pretty good at corner cuts

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
see it moves pretty good at corner cuts
it's<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.850> regular<00:01:03.149> Fang<00:01:03.390> Fang<00:01:03.750> sheet<00:01:04.049> but
