C major a minor F major back to C and so

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.869 
C major a minor F major back to C and so
that's<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.739> structure<00:01:01.100> of<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.430> song<00:01:01.610> the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
only other part we have is a bridge but

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.859 
only other part we have is a bridge but
let's<00:01:04.009> just<00:01:04.220> play<00:01:04.549> it<00:01:04.580> together<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:05.630> can

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
let's just play it together so we can

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.270 
let's just play it together so we can
get<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.020> sense<00:01:06.289> for<00:01:06.500> how<00:01:06.649> it<00:01:06.710> goes

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
get a sense for how it goes

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:19.510 
get a sense for how it goes
so<00:01:07.520> rhythmically<00:01:08.509> it's
