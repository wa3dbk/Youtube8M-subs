this<00:02:34.610> passes<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:36.080> seems<00:02:36.290> very<00:02:36.500> tight<00:02:36.890> yes

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
this passes it seems very tight yes

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000 
this passes it seems very tight yes
not<00:02:38.480> many<00:02:38.630> errors<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.170> run<00:02:39.380> around<00:02:39.470> would<00:02:39.920> be

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
not many errors to run around would be

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.750 
not many errors to run around would be
free<00:02:40.310> with<00:02:40.520> a<00:02:40.820> lot<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.240> tight<00:02:41.420> corridors<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
free with a lot of tight corridors the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.250 
free with a lot of tight corridors the
best<00:02:43.970> way<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.150> maybe<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.510> think<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.080> maybe

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
best way of maybe I think is maybe

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.960 
best way of maybe I think is maybe
getting<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.620> top<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.980> things<00:02:46.130> but<00:02:46.820> its

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
getting on top of things but its

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.610 
getting on top of things but its
