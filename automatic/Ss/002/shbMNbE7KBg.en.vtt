was<00:00:20.010> using<00:00:20.220> clay<00:00:20.640> before<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.449> did<00:00:21.630> not

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
was using clay before and that did not

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.200 
was using clay before and that did not
really<00:00:22.050> work<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.859> decided<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.910> trying<00:00:24.180> to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
really work out so decided I trying to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.160 
really work out so decided I trying to
build<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.949> sides<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.160> using<00:00:26.460> bondo<00:00:27.170> so

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
build up the sides here using bondo so

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.919 
build up the sides here using bondo so
what<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> did<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.800> took<00:00:28.859> some<00:00:29.310> paper<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
what I did was I took some paper and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.350 
what I did was I took some paper and
tried<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.230> make<00:00:31.439> some<00:00:31.679> sort<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> little

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
tried to make some sort of a little

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.450 
tried to make some sort of a little
barrier<00:00:33.469> and<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.680> I'm<00:00:34.770> hoping<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.219> I'll<00:00:35.370> be

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
barrier and what I'm hoping is I'll be

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.729 
barrier and what I'm hoping is I'll be
able<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.700> remove<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> paper<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.930> pretty

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
able to remove the paper and pretty

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.560 
able to remove the paper and pretty
easily<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.250> leave<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.910> pretty<00:00:39.719> flat

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
easily and they leave a a pretty flat

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.090 
easily and they leave a a pretty flat
flat<00:00:42.570> surface<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> make<00:00:43.350> things<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.739> little<00:00:43.920> bit

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
flat surface to make things a little bit

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.700 
flat surface to make things a little bit
easy<00:00:44.309> for<00:00:44.579> me<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.879> comes<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> sanding<00:00:45.710> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
easy for me when it comes to sanding and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.580 
easy for me when it comes to sanding and
I'm<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.070> applying<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.539> bondo<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I'm just applying a lot of bondo out of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.310 
I'm just applying a lot of bondo out of
time<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.370> build<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.090> area<00:00:51.360> we'll

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
time here to build up this area we'll

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.439 
time here to build up this area we'll
see<00:00:52.500> how<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.770> works<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.579> could<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.300> just

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
see how this works out I could have just

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.029 
see how this works out I could have just
massively<00:00:55.230> screwed<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:57.260> give<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.379> shot<00:00:58.620> I

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
massively screwed it up give it a shot I

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.110 
massively screwed it up give it a shot I
haven't<00:00:59.430> done<00:00:59.520> much<00:00:59.670> lately

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
haven't done much lately

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.740 
haven't done much lately
anyways<00:01:00.629> done<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.460> give<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> try<00:01:02.820> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
anyways done it so give this a try and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.050 
anyways done it so give this a try and
check<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.860> morning

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.440 

all<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.390> here's<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.920> finished<00:01:17.450> stride

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
all right so here's the finished stride

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
all right so here's the finished stride
and<00:01:19.970> as<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.300> it<00:01:21.450> did<00:01:21.690> leave<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.520> smooth

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and as you can see it did leave a smooth

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.360 
and as you can see it did leave a smooth
edge<00:01:23.760> which<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.390> should<00:01:24.660> have<00:01:24.690> done<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.370> not

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
edge which I should have done is not

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.360 
edge which I should have done is not
left<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> paper<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.040> pulled<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.160> off

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
left the paper here and pulled that off

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.680 
left the paper here and pulled that off
Oh<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.900> fully<00:01:31.500> pardon<00:01:32.510> so<00:01:33.510> now<00:01:33.600> I'm

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
Oh see now this fully pardon so now I'm

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.000 
Oh see now this fully pardon so now I'm
just<00:01:33.750> gonna<00:01:33.900> continue<00:01:34.200> trying<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.770> this

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
just gonna continue trying to do this

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.590 
just gonna continue trying to do this
and<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.730> will<00:01:35.880> most<00:01:36.090> likely<00:01:38.360> do<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.480> whole

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and then I will most likely do the whole

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.710 
and then I will most likely do the whole
helmet<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.230> then<00:01:40.320> continue<00:01:41.210> sanding<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
helmet and then continue sanding and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
helmet and then continue sanding and
hopefully<00:01:43.530> we'll<00:01:43.650> have<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.920> lip<00:01:44.190> I<00:01:44.310> think<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
hopefully we'll have this lip I think I

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.310 
hopefully we'll have this lip I think I
might<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.729> put<00:01:44.940> on<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.270> too<00:01:45.810> much<00:01:46.050> here

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
might have put on a little too much here

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.850 
might have put on a little too much here
as<00:01:46.440> well<00:01:50.390> but<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.660> will<00:01:51.869> give<00:01:52.410> me<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.650> more

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
as well but this will give me one more

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.010 
as well but this will give me one more
option

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
option

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.180 
option
alright<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.440> is<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.680> I've<00:01:55.800> ended<00:01:56.040> up

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
alright so this is what I've ended up

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.180 
alright so this is what I've ended up
with<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.880> apologize<00:01:57.600> about<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.170> crappy<00:01:58.920> video

I'm using my iPhone for this sooo easy

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.640 
I'm using my iPhone for this sooo easy
to<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.000> grab<00:02:03.210> my<00:02:03.330> camera<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.390> use<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.660> the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
to go grab my camera so I use the the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.690 
to go grab my camera so I use the the
the<00:02:07.680> sort<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.330> paper<00:02:10.160> borders<00:02:11.160> here

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the sort of the the paper borders here

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.210 
the sort of the the paper borders here
to<00:02:11.970> create<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.260> detail<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:14.100> was

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
to create the the detail that I was

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.350 
to create the the detail that I was
looking<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.989> it's<00:02:16.140> worked<00:02:16.489> okay<00:02:17.489> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
looking for and it's worked okay the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.440 
looking for and it's worked okay the
problem<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.709> not<00:02:19.800> all<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.370> same

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
problem is that it's not all the same

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.770 
problem is that it's not all the same
level<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.480> thickness<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.000> did<00:02:24.300> initially

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
level of thickness so I did initially

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.530 
level of thickness so I did initially
way<00:02:25.320> too<00:02:25.380> fat<00:02:25.950> over<00:02:26.489> on<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.820> side<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.120> I'm

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
way too fat over on this side so I'm

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.449 
way too fat over on this side so I'm
trying<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.930> take<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.500> down<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.709> good<00:02:28.950> bit<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
trying to take it down a good bit and

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.290 
trying to take it down a good bit and
then<00:02:30.620> on<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.830> side<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.730> other<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.180> other

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
then on this side the other the other

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.420 
then on this side the other the other
side<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.600> helmet<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.050> have<00:02:34.620> gone<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.160> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
side of the helmet I have gone in and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.240 
side of the helmet I have gone in and
and<00:02:35.670> made<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.150> good<00:02:36.300> bit<00:02:36.570> thinner<00:02:37.250> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and made it a good bit thinner and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.199 
and made it a good bit thinner and
almost<00:02:38.610> too<00:02:38.820> thin<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.540> some<00:02:40.530> areas<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.970> I'm

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
almost too thin in some areas so I'm

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.759 
almost too thin in some areas so I'm
gonna<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.480> going<00:02:42.780> back<00:02:42.810> through<00:02:43.440> and

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
gonna be going back through and

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.560 
gonna be going back through and
basically<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.370> sanding<00:02:44.880> everything<00:02:45.269> down

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
basically just sanding everything down

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.090 
basically just sanding everything down
now

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
now

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.620 
now
and<00:02:47.540> I'm<00:02:48.540> really<00:02:49.320> not<00:02:49.530> liking<00:02:50.060> how<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> did<00:02:51.420> this

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and I'm really not liking how I did this

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.880 
and I'm really not liking how I did this
I<00:02:51.810> probably<00:02:52.019> could<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.350> gone<00:02:52.470> about<00:02:52.680> this

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
I probably could have gone about this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
I probably could have gone about this
better<00:02:53.160> way<00:02:53.400> especially<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:54.120> some<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
better way especially with some of the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.530 
better way especially with some of the
comments<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.200> guys<00:02:55.310> had<00:02:56.310> had<00:02:56.970> left<00:02:57.299> for

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
comments that you guys had had left for

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.820 
comments that you guys had had left for
me<00:02:58.610> but<00:02:59.720> uh<00:03:00.720> live<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.260> learn<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.590> guess

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
me but uh live and learn I guess

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.240 
me but uh live and learn I guess
and<00:03:02.239> just<00:03:03.239> showing<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.660> guys<00:03:03.860> again<00:03:04.860> what

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
and just showing you guys again what

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.880 
and just showing you guys again what
probably<00:03:05.910> not<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.080> not<00:03:07.110> exactly

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
probably not to do this is not exactly

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.220 
probably not to do this is not exactly
the<00:03:08.010> best<00:03:08.420> way<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.450> go<00:03:09.690> about<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:10.080> I'm

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
the best way to go about this I'm

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.330 
the best way to go about this I'm
probably<00:03:10.320> gonna<00:03:10.560> have<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.769> do<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> good<00:03:11.160> bit

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
probably gonna have to do a good bit

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.850 
probably gonna have to do a good bit
more<00:03:11.549> work<00:03:11.820> now<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.570> this<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.680> where<00:03:13.830> I

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
more work now to get this to where I

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.660 
more work now to get this to where I
want<00:03:14.190> it

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
want it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.560 
want it
but<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:17.070> it's<00:03:18.070> progress<00:03:18.700> it's<00:03:19.210> better<00:03:19.390> than

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
but it is it's progress it's better than

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.320 
but it is it's progress it's better than
what<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> had<00:03:19.900> before<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:21.910> not<00:03:22.060> sitting

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
what I had before and it's not sitting

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.940 
what I had before and it's not sitting
here<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.230> that's<00:03:23.920> good<00:03:24.330> but<00:03:25.740> yeah<00:03:26.740> I'm<00:03:26.830> just

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
here so that's good but yeah I'm just

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.640 
here so that's good but yeah I'm just
gonna<00:03:27.040> be<00:03:27.330> sanding<00:03:28.330> away<00:03:28.570> on<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:28.870> now<00:03:29.110> and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
gonna be sanding away on this now and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.980 
gonna be sanding away on this now and
and<00:03:30.640> then<00:03:30.760> I'm<00:03:30.850> gonna<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.120> applying<00:03:31.660> more

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
and then I'm gonna be applying more

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.680 
and then I'm gonna be applying more
bondo<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.650> this<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.490> then<00:03:34.150> what<00:03:34.450> I'm<00:03:34.540> probably

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
bondo to this and then what I'm probably

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.920 
bondo to this and then what I'm probably
gonna<00:03:35.050> do<00:03:35.260> next<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:36.070> I'm<00:03:36.520> gonna<00:03:36.640> apply<00:03:37.030> cut<00:03:37.810> out

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
gonna do next is I'm gonna apply cut out

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.400 
gonna do next is I'm gonna apply cut out
some<00:03:38.170> cardboard<00:03:39.030> strips<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.390> apply<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.780> to

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
some cardboard strips and apply that to

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.070 
some cardboard strips and apply that to
create<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.890> sort<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.820> spike<00:03:43.209> details<00:03:43.750> that

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
create the sort of spike details that

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.430 
create the sort of spike details that
come<00:03:44.290> off<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:46.330> then<00:03:46.690> I'll<00:03:47.110> apply

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
come off of this and then I'll apply

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.490 
come off of this and then I'll apply
bondo<00:03:48.070> over<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:48.910> which<00:03:49.570> should<00:03:50.100> hopefully

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
bondo over that which should hopefully

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.380 
bondo over that which should hopefully
give<00:03:53.500> me<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.770> same<00:03:54.010> at<00:03:54.550> least<00:03:54.820> uniform

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
give me the same at least uniform

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.120 
give me the same at least uniform
thickness<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.470> won't<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.860> worry<00:03:57.040> so

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
thickness and I won't have to worry so

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.810 
thickness and I won't have to worry so
much<00:03:57.340> about<00:03:58.260> sanding<00:03:59.260> down<00:03:59.440> but<00:03:59.830> as<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.670> see

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
much about sanding down but as you see

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.340 
much about sanding down but as you see
here<00:04:01.090> I've<00:04:01.150> got<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.300> whole<00:04:01.480> bunch<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.780> gaps<00:04:02.050> that

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
here I've got a whole bunch of gaps that

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.070 
here I've got a whole bunch of gaps that
I<00:04:02.410> need<00:04:02.620> now<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:02.860> fill<00:04:03.630> one<00:04:04.630> other<00:04:04.810> thing<00:04:05.050> that

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
I need now to fill one other thing that

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.030 
I need now to fill one other thing that
I<00:04:05.230> might<00:04:05.590> try<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:06.520> some<00:04:07.239> tips<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.630> I've<00:04:08.040> seen

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
I might try is some tips that I've seen

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.760 
I might try is some tips that I've seen
and<00:04:09.580> apologize<00:04:10.450> can't<00:04:10.690> remember<00:04:11.350> his<00:04:11.739> name

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
and apologize can't remember his name

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.500 
and apologize can't remember his name
over<00:04:12.100> there<00:04:12.280> on<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.430> RPF<00:04:12.910> but<00:04:14.220> using<00:04:15.220> epoxy<00:04:15.580> to

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
over there on the RPF but using epoxy to

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.009 
over there on the RPF but using epoxy to
sculpt<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:19.060> detail<00:04:19.450> so<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.780> might

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
sculpt the the detail so I might

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.449 
sculpt the the detail so I might
actually<00:04:20.169> give<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> try<00:04:20.830> as<00:04:20.950> well<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.400> I

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
actually give that a try as well so I

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.670 
actually give that a try as well so I
picked<00:04:21.790> up<00:04:21.850> some<00:04:21.910> epoxy<00:04:22.630> from<00:04:22.810> Harbor<00:04:23.410> Freight

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
picked up some epoxy from Harbor Freight

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.600 
picked up some epoxy from Harbor Freight
for<00:04:24.010> I<00:04:24.520> think<00:04:24.760> a<00:04:24.850> buck<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.360> think<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:26.460> but<00:04:27.460> yeah
