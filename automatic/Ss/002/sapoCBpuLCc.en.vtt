yesterday talking about my favorite gun

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.399 
yesterday talking about my favorite gun
the<00:02:44.909> game<00:02:45.060> which<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.329> XR<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.049> three<00:02:46.230> round

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
the game which the XR to the three round

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.289 
the game which the XR to the three round
burst<00:02:46.620> weapon<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.790> one<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.120> also

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
burst weapon but so this one is also

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.270 
burst weapon but so this one is also
really<00:02:48.480> high<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:48.989> there<00:02:49.349> this<00:02:49.470> one's<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.890> very

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
really high up there this one's a very

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
really high up there this one's a very
very<00:02:50.549> good<00:02:50.700> weapon<00:02:50.879> if<00:02:51.299> first<00:02:51.569> weapons<00:02:51.900> aren't

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
very good weapon if first weapons aren't

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.899 
very good weapon if first weapons aren't
your<00:02:52.230> thing<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.010> think<00:02:53.250> at<00:02:53.340> least<00:02:53.489> as<00:02:53.760> of

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
your thing but I think at least as of

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.059 
your thing but I think at least as of
right<00:02:54.090> now<00:02:54.299> this<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.470> probably<00:02:55.829> gonna<00:02:55.950> be

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
right now this is is probably gonna be

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.530 
right now this is is probably gonna be
one<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.370> best<00:02:56.549> assault<00:02:56.970> rifles<00:02:57.269> in<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
one of the best assault rifles in the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.300 
one of the best assault rifles in the
game<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:57.810> who<00:02:57.930> knows<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.349> could<00:02:58.560> change<00:02:58.799> by

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
game but who knows that could change by

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.589 
game but who knows that could change by
the<00:02:59.370> time<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.329> game<00:03:00.450> actually

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
the time that the the game actually

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.699 
the time that the the game actually
comes<00:03:00.930> out<00:03:01.049> there's<00:03:01.230> still<00:03:01.290> going<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.560> some

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
