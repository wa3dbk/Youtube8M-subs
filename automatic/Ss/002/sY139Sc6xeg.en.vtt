00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.790
 for a cat or chance then this one there 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.130
 is twice as bad as our sisters 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.580
 alto azor I was hunting 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.650
 challenges to monkeys on mount chi 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.900
 minh and fireplaces finally short I think 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.910
 that you understood the place and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.529
 not having much space for the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.820
 to hunt I said good so much 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.019
 will try again later and I wanted 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.310
 go and hunt for flags and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.119
 look for a little bit of flags in 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.349
 the secret bases 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.790
 so I go down the hill and I 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.579
 go in life I find a mega 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.559
 I like the demo site and I go back to 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.780
 the right to continue my way I 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.600
 take the bike I pass in the grass 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.789
 and there white bubbles annie plus 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 I bus them I really had the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.690
 eyes on the screen 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.219
 I saw the stars appear 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.719
 not immediately engaged and I 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.190
 thought he was normal on the spot 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.559
 since I had never seen how he 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.300
 was in engineering I see the stars I 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.609
 do not but what happens 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.160
 in my game but it's the second 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.290
 yesterday juno agreement will be the whole thing finally and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.270

 do not say frankly but I was there 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.680
 I say what but see you this fire but 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.659
 what happens is that I know 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.150
 not really I'm still under the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.920
 shock since I'm just recording really 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.720
 in the seconds that followed the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.140
 meet 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.750

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 was in normal it is pink paul with the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.780
 brown and white pants annihilate 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.100
 rather gray with the blue trousers and the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.570
 blue shoes also his pop was 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.250
 humanoid pokemon and ok well okay 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.220
 I do not know if he has anything 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.990
 dangerous or anything I have 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.369
 not the former navy at all for one 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.649
 there also adopts the same first 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.060
 start meeting when setting apart 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.439
 when I complete the pokedex for 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.369
 to go that must be the second I have 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.259
 had to meet in the game 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.930
 finally we'll see it later with the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.950
 na'vi d'aix then sport it's gone 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.750
 here we are sleeping 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.189
 however, since I do not know if he has 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.290
 something dangerous I'm going all 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.009
 immediately launched a hormone I will not 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.750
 mow it or not or if they wake up 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.810
 I expected but then you 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.940
 loving but really not finished enough 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.880
 I will never use regrowth anymore 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.590
 if I do not navy d'aix but even 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.660
 limit by making life last from excess I 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.210
 even more want to use the support 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.520
 thumb is the greatest geniuses 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:37.560
 caught on it's awesome nickname bah no 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:40.200
 not for now I have not what you 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.610
 to say because those voices there I was I 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.650
 went through the top herbs 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.120
 I could have gone through a bench more 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.820
 and there was no grass just down there 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.239
 so it's really a big bowl 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.180
 so I was looking at the na'vi d'aix where 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.480
 is he my style she a man 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:03.930
 how often do I meet them and 2 2 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.200
 x 2 x start when I do not know 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.930
 to tell you I do not really know 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.200
 meetings on living 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.250
 amazing it's amazing 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.720
 I do not know what's going on right now 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.500
 in my game but I 'm not against a 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.209
 so I put it first in 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.040
 the team to show you we are 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.780
 so on pole in you show it I tend 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:36.200
 not yet on a gene yazar bedbugs and 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:36.200
 it's gone against a pity chamallow 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.190
 here he is there he is beautiful in 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.870
 more like that I do not know at all 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.150
 what I'm going to change since 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.170
 that one he can evolve in tagnon who 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.070
 cooked and capoeira 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.100
 I do not know which one I'm going to 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.480
 choose maybe I'll decide 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.790
 completely randomly I'm going to 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.560
 level up and finally choose 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.910
 it may be the surprise with 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.040
 evolution i think i'm going to do 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.140
 like that since I do not really have any 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.780
 choice with which to evolve it 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:16.590
 but here I do not know what to say 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.080
 I can not believe it myself so 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.030
 here and in any case 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.570
 do like me have used more than 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.830
 support pushes back because I 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.930
 thought it grows it happens is very 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.030
 very very rarely chaigne chance 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.340
 never happened to me on a version he 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.520
 is a super self hainaut will be and at 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.900
 forgiveness and is now beginning gloves 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.980
 if it continues I will not use 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.450
 from one to empty and that I know I'm going 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.050
 outright was going to darken in the air 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.740
 it will come out of what will come out in what 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.450
 anyway that's it 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.920

 little bit on facebook I had
