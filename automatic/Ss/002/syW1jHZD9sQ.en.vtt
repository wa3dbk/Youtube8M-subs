00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
your nexus 10 now with the micro USB it

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.040 
your nexus 10 now with the micro USB it
would<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.600> approximately<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.890> 70%<00:00:50.809> after<00:00:51.809> five

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
would be approximately at 70% after five

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810 
would be approximately at 70% after five
hours<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.620> that's<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.190> sizeable

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
hours that's that's a sizeable

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.569 
hours that's that's a sizeable
difference<00:00:54.769> approximately<00:00:55.769> now<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> cannot

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
difference approximately now I cannot

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
difference approximately now I cannot
say<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.000> quite<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.480> sure<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.769> do<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
say that quite for sure but if you do a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.599 
say that quite for sure but if you do a
test<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.480> find<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
test you will find that it is

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.180 
test you will find that it is
significantly<00:01:02.609> faster<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.440> is<00:01:04.920> when

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
significantly faster and that is when

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.749 
significantly faster and that is when
you<00:01:05.489> use<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.020> stock<00:01:07.500> charger<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.429> comes

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
one way it can go and see how it kind of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.050 
one way it can go and see how it kind of
like<00:02:00.119> slants<00:02:00.780> down<00:02:01.049> right<00:02:01.950> towards<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
like slants down right towards the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.870 
like slants down right towards the
middle<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:05.280> magnetic<00:02:06.259> slants<00:02:07.259> down<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
middle the magnetic slants down it is

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.400 
middle the magnetic slants down it is
the<00:02:09.119> same<00:02:09.390> case<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.400> this<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:13.019> kind<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the same case with this it just kind of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.020 
the same case with this it just kind of
slants<00:02:13.950> down<00:02:14.400> if<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.299> can<00:02:15.480> kind<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.780> see<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:15.989> so

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
slants down if you can kind of see it so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.590 
slants down if you can kind of see it so
that<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.269> basically<00:02:19.019> it

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
that is basically it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.500
