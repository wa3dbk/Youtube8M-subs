leftover<00:01:42.540> flour<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.990> need<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.560> sticky<00:01:43.890> dough

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
leftover flour I need the sticky dough

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.190 
leftover flour I need the sticky dough
for<00:01:44.369> about<00:01:44.729> 10<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> 15<00:01:45.329> minutes<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
for about 10 to 15 minutes and it is a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.230 
for about 10 to 15 minutes and it is a
very<00:01:46.380> crucial<00:01:46.979> step<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
very crucial step because we want a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.730 
very crucial step because we want a
gluten<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.780> develop<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> after<00:01:52.200> kneading<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
gluten to develop so after kneading the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.499 
gluten to develop so after kneading the
dough<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:53.430> about<00:01:53.460> 15<00:01:54.060> minutes

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
dough for about 15 minutes

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.300 
dough for about 15 minutes
I<00:01:54.540> added<00:01:54.840> some<00:01:55.020> oil<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> dough<00:01:56.130> can

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
I added some oil so that the dough can

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.530 
I added some oil so that the dough can
become<00:01:56.520> easy<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.090> work<00:01:57.240> with

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
become easy to work with

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
become easy to work with
I<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.750> people<00:01:58.140> traditionally<00:01:58.530> use<00:01:59.040> flour<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I know people traditionally use flour to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
I know people traditionally use flour to
work<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.329> dough<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.689> trust<00:02:01.079> me<00:02:01.200> adding

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
work with the dough but trust me adding

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980 
work with the dough but trust me adding
oil<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.670> make<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> difference<00:02:03.479> will<00:02:03.780> knead

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
oil will make a difference will knead

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.749 
oil will make a difference will knead
the<00:02:04.229> dough<00:02:04.259> at<00:02:04.530> least<00:02:04.770> 5<00:02:05.100> minutes<00:02:05.549> more

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the dough at least 5 minutes more

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.940 
the dough at least 5 minutes more
because<00:02:06.090> developing<00:02:06.570> gluten<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.350> main

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
because developing gluten is the main

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.760 
because developing gluten is the main
key<00:02:08.250> all<00:02:08.610> right<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.599> now<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.319> well-oiled

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
key all right so now in a well-oiled

the dough has doubled in size and you'll
get<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.540> nice<00:02:38.870> fermented<00:02:39.650> too<00:02:39.829> and<00:02:40.040> if<00:02:40.159> you

salmon and that's something that you

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.970 
salmon and that's something that you
really<00:02:46.609> want<00:02:47.359> in<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.659> yeast<00:02:47.930> dough<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.469> I'm<00:02:48.680> just

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
really want in a yeast dough so I'm just

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.949 
really want in a yeast dough so I'm just
gonna<00:02:49.129> puncture<00:02:49.549> my<00:02:49.819> dough<00:02:49.879> and<00:02:50.150> if<00:02:50.599> you<00:02:50.780> act

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
gonna puncture my dough and if you act

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.899 
gonna puncture my dough and if you act
on<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.199> so<00:02:51.469> that<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.680> can<00:02:51.859> cut<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.159> in<00:02:52.310> four<00:02:52.730> equal

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
on it so that I can cut it in four equal

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.149 
on it so that I can cut it in four equal
sizes<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.810> now<00:02:54.019> if<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.469> feel<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.889> dough<00:02:55.099> you

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
sizes and now if you feel the dough you

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.309 
sizes and now if you feel the dough you
will<00:02:55.519> feel<00:02:55.699> that<00:02:55.909> it's<00:02:56.030> pretty<00:02:56.510> pretty<00:02:57.049> dense

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
will feel that it's pretty pretty dense

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.009 
will feel that it's pretty pretty dense
than<00:02:57.709> 24<00:02:58.219> hours<00:02:58.250> earlier<00:02:58.909> so<00:02:59.239> I'm<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.870> gonna

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
than 24 hours earlier so I'm just gonna

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.289 
than 24 hours earlier so I'm just gonna
flatten<00:03:00.379> the<00:03:00.799> dough<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:01.159> then<00:03:01.790> cut<00:03:02.030> them<00:03:02.150> into

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
flatten the dough and then cut them into

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.300 
flatten the dough and then cut them into
four<00:03:02.599> equal<00:03:03.109> size<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:03.620> make<00:03:03.769> them<00:03:03.919> into<00:03:04.040> four

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
four equal size and make them into four

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.670 
four equal size and make them into four
small<00:03:04.639> balls<00:03:04.939> so<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.719> official<00:03:06.079> method<00:03:06.409> is<00:03:06.530> to

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
small balls so the official method is to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.559 
small balls so the official method is to
tug<00:03:06.949> the<00:03:07.099> dough<00:03:07.280> from<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.699> edges<00:03:08.060> towards<00:03:08.389> the

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
tug the dough from the edges towards the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.149 
tug the dough from the edges towards the
bottom<00:03:08.989> in<00:03:09.139> a<00:03:09.199> circular<00:03:09.409> motion<00:03:09.949> which<00:03:10.129> is

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
bottom in a circular motion which is

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.619 
bottom in a circular motion which is
pretty<00:03:10.489> much<00:03:10.639> what<00:03:10.879> I've<00:03:11.000> shown<00:03:11.209> you<00:03:11.239> but<00:03:11.540> you

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
pretty much what I've shown you but you

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.330 
pretty much what I've shown you but you
can<00:03:11.750> also<00:03:11.930> go<00:03:12.199> with<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.379> normal<00:03:12.620> method<00:03:13.099> you

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
can also go with the normal method you

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.069 
can also go with the normal method you
know<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.519> had<00:03:13.909> to<00:03:14.180> throw<00:03:14.389> at<00:03:14.569> least<00:03:14.780> some

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
know I had to throw at least some

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.050
