00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.359
 This week, there were various interesting 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.910
 app updates also meant to be the galaxy 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.530
 note 2 1 get lollipop update and it 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.540
 are some interesting rumors to 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.190
 next nexus smartphone all that and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.119
 just a tiny bit more 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.980
 now it's off in the news, according to the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.109
 there are currently two rumors kitchen 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.010
 manufacturer using a nexus smartphone 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.789
 should work 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.779
 LG and Huawei LG is supposed to be at a 52 inch 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.510
 Variant sit 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.610
 more is was currently not known as 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.670
 it will, however more concrete one 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.579
 Qualcomm snapdragon 810 and one- way hd 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 Display of samsung seem safe though 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.860
 you're sure about dishes 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.379
 can be 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.930
 it seems plausible if google 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.489
 certain components pretend the snapdragon 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.829
 chipset is for developers a lot 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.170
 more accessible than the in-house carey 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.780
 Solution from vw samsung's displays 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.629
 thanks to it amoled are energy efficient and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460
 extremely high resolution if it was like 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.079
 google then even manage to do that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.850
 usual price performance ratio of 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.739
 nexus row upright 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.560
 then that could be interesting 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.299
 We will have the weight rockband like that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.130
 Tool tested and some pretty 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.409
 interesting points noted 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.689
 optically white was really convincing 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.710
 also the implementation as bluetooth headset 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.869
 is really smart 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.880
 Unfortunately, the premium has just 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.549
 version of the tractor a nickel 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 many of them react discreetly 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.780
 allergic what the rock band offer 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.369
 else can or not 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.970
 Find out in our test report 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.409
 giga DE we have 1800 participants 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.799

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.460
 whatsapp design 1344 have said 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.930
 finally, it has been waiting long enough 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.110
 178 people told me that has 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.840
 previous optics liked better and 258 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.360
 standard implemented 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.250
 A few new color new buttons 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.990
 but a proven system 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.780
 The developers have done it all 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.009
 to look different and still 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.520
 control elements in their known place 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.860
 calmly 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.739
 I like what you think of the new 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.179

 the data can be estimated but 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.489
 also with various other apps 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.500
