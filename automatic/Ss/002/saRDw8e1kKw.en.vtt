00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello everyone today we will 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.000
 make such savages a day not 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.540
 decorated mechanical shower which 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 very very very helpful in your home 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.240
 if you build a house a mechanical house with 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.330
 mechanisms will quite help decorate in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.810
 bath mechanism that is it but 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 shower booth vent which is quite 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.230
 cool looks so get down to it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.140
 creation now I will show you 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.969
 booth that I created and so on 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.930
 booth so long ago works hop and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.219
 water poured 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.710
 but adopted water cleverly 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:55.070
 It takes here so much space that is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:01:01.680
 what happens two three 4 5 6 6 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:06.990
 cubes want 6 cubes vertically and times 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:12.390
 two three 4 5 5 horizontal and so 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:18.530
 get down to and about creating here we did 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 times two three 4 5 we did it 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:28.729
 vertically and horizontally so will 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.869
 such as a ladder stand and which will 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.740
 on which there will be red dust 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.810
 redstone there differently can be called 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.420
 height you can do absolutely any 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
 very easy i will actually do so 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.180
 approximately for my initial most 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.180
 minimum height 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:05.189
 externally minimal may be two blocks 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:06.719
 but I will put 3 up block tools 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.250
 which we need 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:15.050
 this is a block here is the base it can be 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.760
 tree at least that he shower on 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.959
 my ground is cobble and then 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.299
 will need red dust when running 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.360
 I will show you how much work you need here. 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:31.250
 less so it is a clear matter the mechanism is very 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.680
 idle need one lever 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:41.959
 glass so we put them in 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:46.040
 shower cabin turns 6 glasses 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.709
 any absolutely any one half block 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.049
 or you can do without glasses but do it like this 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.720
 here and half a block is already on your 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:03:00.840
 discretion I like to do so 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:05.579
 in general, it is still very beautiful 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.500
 need one red torch and of course 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.160
 same one sticky later like without him 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.030
 darling 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.109
 and so what we do lever can 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.170
 put only here or so it can 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:24.250
 where to put where we will go 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:30.020
 red dust is as simple as a lever knocks 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:32.810
 put in the back the red dust is two three times and 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.110
 all that is, it turns out we need 3 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.950
 red dust and even need it 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:45.220
 In general, the house from my point of view is very 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:52.190
 convenient not much cost you will not get out such 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:58.660
 put sticky here and put the block 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.660
 of our ceiling so it is not also noticeable 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.769
 mutim ceiling itself 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:31.539
 prettier make cashing us more 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:42.500
 need a bucket of water 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:45.140
 make such a mini box and fill 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.180
 water here if we wait here water 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.610
 after the first use it is all and 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:56.750
 spend so we need two buckets 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:01.100
 water is very kind of bath so all 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.560
 the case will be ready if you have 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.400
 bath position please door 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.729
 stand we go this steel in the mine 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.990
 rummaged afterwards carries 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.990
 came dipped 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:24.409
 watch panel and once again plunged into rubles 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.449
 rain and almost peace of mind walk 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:32.650
 further here actually closes the cool 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:36.800
 the mechanism turned out for so and 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:40.629
 small amount of materials thanks 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.629
 for watching everyone good luck
