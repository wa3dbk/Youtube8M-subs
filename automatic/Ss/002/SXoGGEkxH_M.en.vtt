00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:08.069
 yes my name is alex so look at 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.469
 new review on the movie abus interview 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.570
 is 7 is unfortunately the last part of paul 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.420
 walker who died in 2013 at a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.510
 car accident my first part 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.100
 director james wan and that's you crazy 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
 because that guy actually has more 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.439
 hear movies directed to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
 seriously the could sorrel and will 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.550
 and now this shit you suddenly fast and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.800
 furious 7 why would you go to fans and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.200
 figure 7 must go i can tell you 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 the music appealed to me enormously it is me 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.969
 of course very much from now it is bit 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.040
 rain and you show the house and so that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 certainly appeals to the target group 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.239
 from 15 to 35 I think something 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.750
 of course even more that audience is 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.420
 naturally sexy ladies sexy men 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.879
 pressure in bold the landscapes come visually 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.710
 you do not lack anything fat the cars constantly 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 so the adrenaline for that matter 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.640
 the young guard is really natural 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.770
 a top pills and nature lima are missing 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.600
 is humor and I honestly think about it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.430
 who plays chips and who plays Rome in the film 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 and of course to multiple a fast and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.670
 furious movies did participate anyway 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.950
 the crown strains when it comes to that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.119
 man i want he can take me to it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.890
 make you laugh 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.479
 vomiting with demanded young kind of 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.729
 leadership thing from louder in london 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.049
 and then what followed it is 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.460
 very beautiful and at the same time so too 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.770
 when they go out of a fly with the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 car and he fucking fears of heights 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.280
 has 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.780
 no, it's just a tournament and I wanted to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.970
 really laughed so that is certainly 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.159
 why you vest reviews 7 certainly which 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.930
 have a go and look alongside humor 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.670
 this film is certainly nice black 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.740
 edge and that is what death is thinking 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.720
 van paul walker who died in 2000 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.240
 in a car accident 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.549
 I look back at that very nicely 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.250
 do not very big but 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.470
 modest and yet just enough to be yourself 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.970
 I get goosebumps even now 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 goose bumps because I thought it was one 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.720
 beautiful very very yes I sat boy dress me 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.790
 drove quite a lump of it 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.009
 my throat and you look back so what's the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.469
 last 14 years has also been made with him 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.270
 of course in the finish 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.619
 am I think you are just as sin you feel 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.600
 really ok so really actually 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.900
 save someone from the family 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.130
 passed away 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.630
 of course must be very objective 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.130
 so there are also reasons why 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.750
 you shouldn't go to the movies and 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.110
 one of those runs is it anyway 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.450
 story in verse 6 have the last part 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.040
 about a show and that is in the end 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.960
 in the hospital and or show from the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.020
 brother more dekker char is played 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.490
 by jason's voice and he wants revenge and 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.940
 so I'm going behind 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.470
 dorado and dominic toretto and on brian 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.810
 actually goes in the back together 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.910
 be responsible for the fact that 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.090
 she brother is the hospital 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.730
 then wilders heracles and traffic jams 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.620
 family who turn off dekker show 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.880
 because it just read to make them 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.140
 doing in fast and furious 7 is that they are god 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.930
 need and that is kind 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.540
 technical thing giving them access 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.220
 have access to all mobile devices 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.920
 to get under thing they need a meme 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.850
 empty off and then 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.940
 behind 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.270
 dekker cho to go but you understand 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.980
 that is very illogical for people 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.300
 in general and when one belongs to us 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.010
 to let those come to us and 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.840
 we are not going to put so much effort into it 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.610
 eventually get one thing 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.550
 go after the one we want to know 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.410
 that he is after us 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.560
 sorry yes the the other thing is that the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.540
 film is really over the top in terms of action 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.070
 the opening scene with this fight and in 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.350
 the hospital I'm not going to spoil anymore 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:34.810
 but that's so heavy about it on me 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.330
 think though you would like fresh reviews part 1 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.269
 compare with the last part then go 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.370
 you really think at vesna 4 is 10 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.930
 just have transformers' i want one 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.390
 new just sure I'm almost there 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.400
 certainly but the room work 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.170
 yes i occasionally was a bit nauseous 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.930
 make that as much as my movements 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.630
 no less lead the phone call 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.250
 and then they turn around and I have 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.810
 never felt that way in 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.269
 a kind of roller coaster salt because they 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.370
 run the constant well i have none 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.989
 ask a question with the flower and your book 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.820
 you leave your comment in the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.799
 comments because in the movies and brown 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.480
 corner or I drove the use wit he is 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.739
 then in my house be a dad got there 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.420
 resuming normal life 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.340
 a child we're not accustomed 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.040
 also touch this type of movies is it 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.540
 not enormously predictable and 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.520
 are not with that nut are with 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.130
 not pussy sat I am very curious what 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.200
 you have the answer and or ate 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.090
 review is also just done with this 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.380
 theme still in the planning two films anyway 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.020
 for that paul walker 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.460
 would die and fin diesel would too 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.190
 would love to continue but yes 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.710
 suppose poker had lived 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.210
 we would still like to wait for one 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.200
 fast review is 8 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.820
 I am very curious let me know 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.680
 in the comments below and that is 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.410
 of course time for the star band 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.630
 marriage said i'm already a fan of the 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.400
 fresh and fire is the music 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.630
 action everything that appeals to me 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.170
 I think it's tough 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.390
 someone kick strong movie no but because 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.740
 paul walker it is a final movie 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.570
 gives it 4 stars 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.980
 but I many men think two 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.530
 stars and watch it from a 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.820
 objective points of view I mean I can 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.170
 of course spend my focus less 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.760
 but of course I also have to be honest 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.020
 for the people who have nothing at all 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.170
 with this kind of movies and then I say two 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.810
 stars but I still give two 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.210
 kick DVD boxes away from as many as per 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.830
 sven vath review is one to seth then 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.080
 you can see for yourself how far a bit 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.090
 has gotten out of hand and three times 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.560
 two free tickets because you can do that 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.680

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.200
