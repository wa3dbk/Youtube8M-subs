00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
apply this on my nose and I'm doing this

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.240 
apply this on my nose and I'm doing this
because<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.640> cream<00:01:37.330> is<00:01:37.539> made<00:01:37.929> for<00:01:38.289> thin<00:01:38.770> areas

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
because I cream is made for thin areas

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.800 
because I cream is made for thin areas
or<00:01:39.460> sensitive<00:01:39.880> areas<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.420> it's<00:01:40.660> also

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
or sensitive areas and it's also

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.940 
or sensitive areas and it's also
formulated<00:01:41.410> to<00:01:41.530> stay<00:01:42.429> put<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.380> figure<00:01:44.770> it
