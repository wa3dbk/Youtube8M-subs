00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.340
 Hmm 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.389
 me 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.070
 Unquestioned 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.220
 Pikka 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:20.010
 Pick-up Cable-Out With This Eiko Guitar 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.010
 pbt amp 0 positive sound but I also 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.070
 1 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.179
 Yup 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.030
 Ah ~ 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.079
 Dedicated box 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.700
 I'm picking up the sound right now 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.030
 That's well 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:42.510
 There are two types of pickups in this acoustic guitar. 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.190
 On a PC glowing like a firefly 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.710
 When this cable is inserted with the LED lamp 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 Even if the led lamp glows and wears it 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.600
 Ride is picking up as 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.170
 But I supposed to say this to the side b, respectively the so-called Well that 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:10.000
 The type of pickup just pasting the power generation element is hostage and 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:15.909
 It says such ordinary normal I mean this condenser 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.460
 The microphone is installed later and this volume adjustment is 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:29.650
 There are two volume knobs in front of this lamp 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:35.150
 That are in because elaborate picking both piezo sound and condenser microphone sound on 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:39.890
 I'm adding two sounds and that's why 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:45.200
 It is why adults to Well a little shrill is the Tteyuu piezo pickup 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:51.370
 Put that mean to Kin Kin is to me only of the microphone are Well Konbo Aun 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.980
 The sound of these 123 or later cones will be picked up well 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.300
 But 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.070
 This six string direction note 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.260
 I wonder if it will be beautiful or not, so this sound 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.350
 The truth is that inside the hall 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.429
 It's like a cave and it's wow 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:17.909
 The sound is not really true 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:20.830
 The space in the cave in this box that refers to the space to be the acoustic guitar 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:25.720
 I have to pick it up 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.500
 There is no point in playing it on an acoustic guitar and that mic is included 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.170
 Is now 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:38.730
 I put it out, but in the case of me, I will point the microphone towards the gap 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:45.760
 The line at an angle to show the sound towards this hole without 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.870
 Although Which was a win or toward this side you have toward the microphone 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.520
 so 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.470
 Here of Mike intends this 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.200
 Originally in unprocessed Hmm 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:04.030
 Because it picks up the sound echoing in this hall 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:11.410
 Piezo's brother who picks up treble at pa degrees 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:17.140
 The low sound is picked up as space sound in the sound hole with the current condenser microphone 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:22.260
 Let's just say that the two volumes are mixed 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.380
 If it is under the volume of about 10 to 8 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.740
 Condenser microphone is 8 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:35.030
 In As you to Toka balance say howling even if a large Damn pa mixer 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:39.700
 So stomach makes it easier to Koenji training 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.940
 If it sounds like you can hear the bass properly without gold and silver thread 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:48.170
 Once since it has become a system that say 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:52.280
 Voice of such instinct mother even if I cut it by the river 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.730
 This kind of voice is said to be picked up 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.140
 here 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.250
 If you put in 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.670
 Ah 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.020
 Cave cave too 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.020
 It sounds like a cave 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.290
 Yup 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.970
 Power play amplifier 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.220
 Yes Yes 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.299

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.090
 It Tteyuu is open 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.849
 Hmm 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.969
 Hmm 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.460

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:46.390
