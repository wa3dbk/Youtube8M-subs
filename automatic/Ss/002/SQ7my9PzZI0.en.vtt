00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:35.809
 you can see your sea 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:35.809
 do wine vinegar look when we do 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.489
 when we do and learn because 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 concerns matters 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.039
 usually and not we leave small 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.710
 space for us 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:55.039
 enlightened fermentation percentage in order 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:01:01.320
 to less artificial gardens and 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:02.910
 vinegar on the air to have this feeling 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.510
 which we have and need to write off 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.220
 therefore leave a large space 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.130
 very large area for this 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.790
 we did not give birth to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.869
 we are sour 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.680
 now the only thing we will put soon 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.680
 such meaning will be there 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.910
 everything else to exclude 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.650
 hit any pathogen Nastya 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:45.400
 Mironov 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:48.660
 we have this gauze filter which will 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:02:06.570
 provide us with oxygen 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:02:09.630
 in order to hereafter for 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.940
 wine vinegar production 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.470
 we impose such a filter it will 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.550
 allow ingested oxygen and 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:23.130
 we will follow the process in not 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:32.980
 fermentation about oxidation and in order to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:37.320
 let's say this filter we would do here 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.489
 such an event we are now valve 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.489
 we will complete 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.150
 and if i don't do this i will 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:56.070
 told kiss they make mommy 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:01.720
 we have wine vinegar left 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.800
 he weeks he does not ferment he will abandon 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.170
 first turn sour 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:13.830
 and will have very long courses 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.940
 good taste it will appear in a year 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.380
 absolutely perfect state of it 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.640
 becomes then when he has an excerpt 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.640
 23 years 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:33.250
 to the feet and the most important thing for what we are here 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.180
 it makes this wine vinegar which we 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.040
 do no see the best cure for 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.300
 colds and sore throats helps fight off 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.650
 oncological diseases 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.100
 blood disorders 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.799
 that is, the product is much better 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.200
 to eat 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:56.799
 than ordinary actually home country

 only when the greats are here 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.830
 is done 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:29.590
 ground out sediment from in biological 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 the material that remains in the wort you 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.210
 need to do produce regularly 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.160
 lightening process take and constantly 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.410
 if sediment form you pour 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:50.590

 will do the assad who 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.580
 formed on the day it will start to rot and 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.070
 like kiki 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:06.130
 you will spoil the whole period 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.190
 how often I bought I just knew without 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.300
 me you always do not do two 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.010
 cans of this vinegar you need to come up 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.790
 put it some place she will 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.090
 long stand 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.630
 that someone does not stick very long 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.800
