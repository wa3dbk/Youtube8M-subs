00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
is our main squad that we're building up

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.350 
is our main squad that we're building up
we've<00:04:11.040> also<00:04:11.190> got<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.520> Bundesliga<00:04:12.090> squad

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.479 
which is used for our fitness but I'm
also<00:04:15.870> slowly<00:04:16.350> building<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:16.890> one<00:04:17.070> up<00:04:17.160> as<00:04:17.280> well

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
also slowly building this one up as well

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.659
