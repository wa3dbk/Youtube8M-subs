00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.040
 residents of Ust-Ilimsk that in Irkutsk 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.319
 areas to return the previous schedule 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.139
 trains to the regional center and beyond 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.650
 up to the resort Kislovodsk decision 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.570
 this was taken by the leadership of the RSB after 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 numerous appeals the fact is that 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.859
 for a large city railway 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.050
 let the long but the most convenient way 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.810
 get to other places 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.449
 by car away airport never 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:36.809
 The most modern Siberia has turned the floor 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:39.270
 abandoned runway none at all 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.239
 on the ground did not know the plane will sit today 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.520
 or not matches he's the director of the boarding 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.920
 site weather determines by experience 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.440
 wind speed and atmospheric 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.780
 pressure other devices it does not grow 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.329
 because now the board on the highway leads 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.039
 air pilot from bratsk there case 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.809
 through and alternate aerodrome 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.000
 and Ust-Ilimsk I'm a playground now 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.480
 officially only has takeoff status 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.149
 stripes 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.640
 note in the city itself lives today 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.960
 more than 80,000 people even to Irkutsk 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.210
 these people get 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.159
 very difficult on the car will have 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.250
 drive about 900 kilometers 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.710
 distance by rail almost 1300 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.630
 and the planes fly here and only twice 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 per week according to experts 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.229
 the only thing left from 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.229
 modern airport 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.460
 it's a runway she doesn't 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.350
 causes concern 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 only need to cover the seams and to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.579
 build a new terminal in 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 Ust-Ilimsk requires about 3 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.780
 billion rubles get that amount 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.450
 on development can only be hitting 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.420
 federal registry from which airport 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.310
 was excluded mid nineties it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.710
 perfected here built 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.869
 newest terminal style trails and length 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.850
 runway exceeded 3 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.930
 kilometers and could take any 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 aircraft 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.649
 We flew here direct flights to Moscow 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.960
 novosibirsk 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.880
 vladivostok but existed in such 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.649
 the form of airport Ust-Ilim only four 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.140
 years later went bankrupt 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.570
 equipment was sold out remaining 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.200
 looted and now before the airfield 2 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.119
 dog houses 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.600
 control room and passenger lounge 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.090
 they stoked a stove me 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.860
 work on Wednesdays and Saturdays plane 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.620
 needed because on the train pretty 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.240
 long to Irkutsk to get here we are all 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.790
 gathered in order to save 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.740
 easy cessna grand easy time 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.080
 caravan popularly called air 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.710
 shuttle bus accommodates only nine 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.930
 passengers 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.300
 this is the only regular flight out 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.850
 Irkutsk and back there were more aircraft 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.470
 take to people because people 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.570
 quite a few who want to take off 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.700
 interferes twice a week it's very little 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.980
 so the queues are in addition 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.260
 the passenger is a southern city dream 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.450
 fly and beyond the Irkutsk region 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.960
 people interested seemed and birsk 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.560
 Almost patients 30 citizens wanted 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.140
 would be going on 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.890
 but such if the direction will be 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.390
 sustained 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.040
 already between the subjects of the transportation federation 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.520
 then of course the banana when creating the station 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.260
 150 150 places and alone urban 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.830
 budget equip and build new 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.320
 airport 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.030
 beyond the strength but with one condition 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.890
 Administration of Ust-Ilimsk already 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.690
 handled the podium which concerned 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.970
 get feasibility 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.340
 justification yes that is which gives 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.989
 opportunity 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.870
 bring in here federal money and 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.940
 means this task is done ready two 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.190
 airport options to the maximum and 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.260
 truncated clear past scale 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.810
 infrastructure does not make sense 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.239
 volume not those experienced aviators say 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.120
 freight rate also 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.069
 and takeoff should work anyway 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.870
 immediate plans have styled cypher 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.239
 process the seams equip strip 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.489
 security and perimeter fence 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.680
 and for the reception of third-class aircraft 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.319
 such as an-24 and yak-40 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.390
 need a driving radio now 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.430
 Ust-Ilimsk waiting for the reaction of the regional 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.260
 ministries of transport and open to 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.260
 negotiation board 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.120
