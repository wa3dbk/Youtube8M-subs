00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.929
 hi everyone, this is a rubric of video responses to 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.269
 questions in which I answer video 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.810
 Answers to questions that they write to me 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.939
 comments but also subscribers 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:26.820
 In general, the question I asked my subscriber 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.720
 Alexey on his name that asked me 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.000
 such a question which need to change the gum 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.620
 on the front suspension 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.620
 by car daewoo sens 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:44.520
 Well gum there are likely to be 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.190
 change gum stabilizer that is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.770
 nastochka stabilizer and bushings themselves 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.460
 stabilizer i mean i will show where they are 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.510
 there are, that is , well, from gum 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.789
 salenblocks 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.879
 salenbloki is already a separate conversation 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.320
 There is in general now something I eat and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.939
 show me and go under the hood so I climb 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.500
 could so here we are in the pit let's start with 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:22.500
 left side so rezinochki that need 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 change is worth it . stabilizer here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:33.509
 Here are the gum, that's two at the top and 2 below 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:36.000
 there is this on the left and here on the right 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.790
 the parties here it is also stand 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.579
 stabilizer these gum change then 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.619
 there they break fast taxi we 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.770
 can not see because I protect the engine 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.570
 It is not visible how to show from I will 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.570
 top show that is to find the motor 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.780
 here is this 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.510
 I will call the screwdriver right there 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.000
 stabilizer goes and here it is attached here 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.610
 this stabilizer bush and here on such 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.960
 brace well, it is mounted there with a key for 14 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.800
 unscrewed then there are these here 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.810
 gum, too, still changing that is, but it 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.680
 I donâ€™t know right and left 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.680
 show end 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.260
 the right will not work then the camera can not 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.970
 crawl so it can be seen the class there is not 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.850
 I see that is, these are the rezinochki 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 change but if there is already a knock at 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:56.370
 the car itself 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.320
 before everything collapsed and so well that is and 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.710
 Alexey also asked how much they cost us 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:09.450
 These rezinochki but I will say so in dollars 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:12.810
 In general, I have an old kit 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.430
 that is . stabilizer here we have something 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.920
 have they sold in pairs already with 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.560
 rubber bands absolutely absolutely that is , we 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.450
 and here that is, a couple of these are worth 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.110
 when i change them myself that is good 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.530
 qualities here dollars they were worth 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.370
 that is, with rubber bands at all these 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.230
 these are stabilizer bushings i.e. they are 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.390
 there are two kinds 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.970
 that is, this is such a formula with 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.150
 so from the sides and there is just well 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.770
 there she is smooth and here it is here 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.950
 convexity that is one from this side and 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.500
 from this side, that is, when buying well 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.960
 here we are when you buy the seller 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.140
 asks you a fight or another with 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.940
 with these bumps, that is to say 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.890
 say what kind of sleeve do you need 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.810
 but it is necessary to stabilizer 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.120
 look like a lot about the site and here it is 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.430
 who press out of either she is smooth and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.190
 woman with projections that is she there but 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.620
 different that is in diameter in 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.480
 to size it is the same but you 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.390
 bulge that's it so what's wrong 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.109
 there is an important moment like that is 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.060
 when you will buy it is usually but 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.050
 sellers ask 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.520
 you have all the cars can be seen that is 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.490
 they were staffed there with various of these 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.220
 I used to stand like that 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.919
 pharynx and I set myself with bulges 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.870
 that is, bought this mounting bracket and here 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.330
 to her already well then there are new ones here 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.010
 stabilizer bushings cost them but i don't 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.000
 I know probably a couple there for dollars 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:52.020
 about worth that is about exactly not 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.270
 say we bowl well here from the gum of this 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.070
 Well, that is, this is changing separately already 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.280
 that is, what else is rubber there is 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.340
 salenblocks which are already holding levers and 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.910
 either thrust bearing or thrust bearing 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.229
 pillow 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.389
 I call them thrust bearings 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.870
 are above that is if there 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.910
 the bearing is broken it will also start 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.830
 taps here it is sold all together 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.900
 she stands 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:26.880
 $ 20 approximately 1 well and so and replacing 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.729
 these gum that is there is nothing complicated 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.160
 no, that is, the car is on wheels but 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.620
 this is if there is yamato that is old 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:40.250
 disable new you put nothing complicated 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:42.720
 there is absolutely no question but answered 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.660
 if something is not clear then write in 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.110
 comments and i will try to explain 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.210
 I did not understand something there but so everyone 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.050
 the rest that is, I will ask questions 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.240
 answer 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.789
 either in the comments or video responses 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.710
 draw someone interesting 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.720
 to people who see this video, that is 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.820
 subscribe to the channel will be many 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.590
 interesting 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.889
 I recently bought a camera that is, I started 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:14.400
 take off how do i repair cars like 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.889
 I do it interestingly enough that is 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.960
 I myself when I say something I do not know what 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.700
 I go to youtube there or on the Internet 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:27.000
 Well, I see that how is it done? 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:31.490
 do well and that's all the answer video 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.490
 Good luck to everyone
