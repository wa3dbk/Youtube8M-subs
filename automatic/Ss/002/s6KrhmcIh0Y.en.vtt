00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hey guys today we open in dosa craft

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.840 
hey guys today we open in dosa craft
advanced<00:00:03.990> machines<00:00:04.319> video<00:00:04.620> yeah<00:00:05.549> so<00:00:05.759> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
advanced machines video yeah so the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.950 
advanced machines video yeah so the
first<00:00:06.029> thing<00:00:06.089> we're<00:00:06.299> going<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.480> show<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.720> is

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
first thing we're going to show you is

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.259 
first thing we're going to show you is
the<00:00:06.990> advanced<00:00:07.649> machine<00:00:08.130> block<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.120> is

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the advanced machine block and this is

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.820 
the advanced machine block and this is
just<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.570> component<00:00:10.019> for<00:00:10.260> more<00:00:10.500> advanced

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
just a component for more advanced

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.070 
just a component for more advanced
machines<00:00:11.420> so<00:00:12.420> if<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.690> don't<00:00:12.780> know<00:00:12.929> how<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
machines so if you don't know how to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.780 
machines so if you don't know how to
make<00:00:13.200> these<00:00:13.410> carbon<00:00:13.920> plates<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.400> advanced

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
make these carbon plates and advanced

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.519 
make these carbon plates and advanced
alloys<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.509> check<00:00:15.690> out<00:00:15.839> our<00:00:15.870> tools<00:00:16.230> video

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
alloys you can check out our tools video

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.990 
alloys you can check out our tools video
yeah<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:18.029> chose<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.270> risk<00:00:18.480> reduce<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> once

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
yeah you chose to risk reduce so once

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.160 
yeah you chose to risk reduce so once
you've<00:00:21.150> made<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.480> you're<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> want<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
you've made this you're going to want to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.529 
you've made this you're going to want to
make<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.470> chest<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.060> use<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> regular

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
make a chest and now this use a regular

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.939 
make a chest and now this use a regular
machine<00:00:25.080> block<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.560> we're<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
machine block but we're just going to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.200 
machine block but we're just going to
add<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.730> didn't<00:00:26.970> know<00:00:27.029> where

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
add it in because we didn't know where

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.839 
add it in because we didn't know where
else<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.449> put<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.039> yeah<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.789> here

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
else to put it yeah so this right here

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.659 
else to put it yeah so this right here
is<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.179> crystal<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.750> safe<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is a crystal and safe so what a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.160 
is a crystal and safe so what a
personal<00:00:33.059> safe<00:00:33.239> does<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> works<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
personal safe does is it works like a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.530 
personal safe does is it works like a
regular<00:00:34.410> chest<00:00:34.860> once<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> put<00:00:36.120> something<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
regular chest once you put something in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.690 
regular chest once you put something in
it<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.840> becomes<00:00:37.140> yours<00:00:37.649> yeah<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.460> first

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it it becomes yours yeah the first

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.459 
it it becomes yours yeah the first
person<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> right-click<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.660> gets<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.110> chest

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
person to right-click it gets a chest

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.900 
person to right-click it gets a chest
and<00:00:40.649> no<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:40.920> else<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.160> open<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.730> this

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and no one else can open it on this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270 
and no one else can open it on this
unless<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.260> an<00:00:43.680> admitting<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
unless it's you or an admitting the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.790 
unless it's you or an admitting the
server<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.809> normally<00:00:46.500> break<00:00:46.680> your

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
server now you can normally break your

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.380 
server now you can normally break your
with<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> wrench<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.700> has<00:00:47.850> items<00:00:48.210> you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
with a wrench but if it has items you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
with a wrench but if it has items you
can't<00:00:48.660> yeah<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.890> cannot<00:00:50.070> break<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> with

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
can't yeah you cannot break it with

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.900 
can't yeah you cannot break it with
anything<00:00:50.879> else<00:00:51.469> yeah<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.710> has<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:53.039> incredibly

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
anything else yeah it has an incredibly

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.720 
anything else yeah it has an incredibly
large<00:00:54.149> blast<00:00:54.510> resistance<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:56.070> than<00:00:56.340> any

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
large blast resistance more than any

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.869 
large blast resistance more than any
other<00:00:57.300> item<00:00:57.570> including<00:00:58.760> obsidian<00:00:59.760> or

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
other item including obsidian or

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.479 
other item including obsidian or
anything<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.309> here

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
anything like that and this right here

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
anything like that and this right here
is<00:01:02.520> an<00:01:02.910> induction<00:01:03.180> furnace<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.379> an<00:01:04.470> induction

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
is an induction furnace so an induction

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.440 
is an induction furnace so an induction
furnace<00:01:05.220> works<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.180> regular

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
furnace works a lot like a regular

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.120 
furnace works a lot like a regular
furnace<00:01:07.020> except<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.340> heats<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:10.680> requires

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
furnace except it heats up it requires

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.230 
furnace except it heats up it requires
both<00:01:11.310> energy<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> heat<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.610> apply<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
both energy and heat so to apply to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.880 
both energy and heat so to apply to
start<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.990> working<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.619> need<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> give

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
start it working you just need to give

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.880 
start it working you just need to give
it<00:01:17.130> energy<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.670> well<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> redstone<00:01:18.509> signal

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
it energy as well as a redstone signal

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.399 
it energy as well as a redstone signal
yep<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:21.180> cool<00:01:21.390> things<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.900> cook<00:01:22.170> two

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
yep the cool things that will cook two

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
yep the cool things that will cook two
things<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.860> once<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> other<00:01:24.390> cool<00:01:24.780> thing

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
things at once now the other cool thing

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
things at once now the other cool thing
about<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.250> slowly<00:01:26.490> heats<00:01:26.820> up

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
about it is that as it slowly heats up

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.270 
about it is that as it slowly heats up
it'll<00:01:27.900> start<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.200> work<00:01:28.500> faster<00:01:29.070> than<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it'll start to work faster than a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.030 
it'll start to work faster than a
regular<00:01:29.549> furnace<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:31.079> more<00:01:31.320> heat<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> has<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
regular furnace the more heat it has the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.609 
regular furnace the more heat it has the
faster<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.460> goes<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.570> heat<00:01:33.720> builds<00:01:34.409> up

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
faster it goes and the heat builds up

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.010 
faster it goes and the heat builds up
with<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.460> time<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:36.840> being

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
with with time with a that is not being

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.499 
with with time with a that is not being
used<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:38.880> good<00:01:39.150> if<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> want

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
used so this is really good if you want

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
used so this is really good if you want
to<00:01:39.600> make<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> lot<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> items<00:01:40.500> cooked<00:01:40.979> like

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
to make a lot of items cooked like

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.520 
to make a lot of items cooked like
cobblestone<00:01:42.090> into<00:01:42.689> stone<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.200> anything<00:01:43.500> like

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
cobblestone into stone or anything like

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.620 
cobblestone into stone or anything like
that<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.310> you're<00:01:44.490> doing<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> lot<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.210> once<00:01:45.390> it's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that if you're doing a lot at once it's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840 
that if you're doing a lot at once it's
really<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.950> shouldn't<00:01:47.130> use<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:47.700> it's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
really you shouldn't use it when it's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.310 
really you shouldn't use it when it's
this<00:01:48.090> low<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.390> should<00:01:48.630> use<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.810> when<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.170> lit

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
this low you should use it when it's lit

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.270 
this low you should use it when it's lit
like<00:01:49.500> fifty<00:01:49.950> percent<00:01:50.280> hi<00:01:50.930> but<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.290> for

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
like fifty percent hi but it's good for

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.670 
like fifty percent hi but it's good for
anytime<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:54.450> good<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.750> also<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.200> regular

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
anytime it's good to also have regular

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
anytime it's good to also have regular
ones<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.040> well<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:57.030> right<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.390> an

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
ones as well and this right here is an

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.780 
ones as well and this right here is an
electrolyzer<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.649> basically<00:01:58.950> an<00:01:59.189> extra

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
electrolyzer which is basically an extra

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.600 
electrolyzer which is basically an extra
storage<00:02:00.570> up<00:02:00.869> upgrade<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.799> an<00:02:01.890> mft<00:02:02.340> or<00:02:02.369> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
storage up upgrade to an mft or a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.850 
storage up upgrade to an mft or a
Memphis<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.229> doesn't<00:02:04.439> work<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
Memphis you so this doesn't work like a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.130 
Memphis you so this doesn't work like a
normal<00:02:05.310> storage<00:02:05.670> device<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.450> put<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.780> next<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
normal storage device you put it next to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139 
normal storage device you put it next to
it<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.619> put<00:02:07.649> water<00:02:08.099> cells<00:02:08.429> inside<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it and then put water cells inside and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.600 
it and then put water cells inside and
this<00:02:09.929> will<00:02:10.110> transform<00:02:10.470> water<00:02:11.009> sourcing<00:02:11.459> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
this will transform water sourcing to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.649 
this will transform water sourcing to
electrolyze<00:02:12.120> water<00:02:12.569> salts

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
electrolyze water salts

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.119 
electrolyze water salts
so<00:02:14.659> what<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:14.959> does<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.469> it'll<00:02:15.680> take<00:02:15.920> 15

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
so what this does is it'll take 15

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.699 
so what this does is it'll take 15
thousand<00:02:16.879> EU<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.450> store<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.109> inside<00:02:18.319> an

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
thousand EU and store it inside an

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.979 
thousand EU and store it inside an
electrolyzed<00:02:19.219> water<00:02:19.219> cell<00:02:19.760> yeah<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:20.810> would

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
electrolyzed water cell yeah it would

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.380 
electrolyzed water cell yeah it would
only<00:02:21.049> do<00:02:21.349> this<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:22.010> unit<00:02:22.849> cost

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
only do this if the unit cost

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.589 
only do this if the unit cost
seventy-five<00:02:24.109> percent<00:02:24.290> power<00:02:25.329> so<00:02:26.329> what<00:02:26.510> it

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
seventy-five percent power so what it

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.869 
seventy-five percent power so what it
does<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:27.079> once<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.709> becomes<00:02:28.010> less<00:02:28.640> than

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
does is once it becomes less than

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.209 
does is once it becomes less than
twenty-five<00:02:29.450> percent<00:02:29.719> power<00:02:30.139> then<00:02:30.950> it'll

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:31.219 
twenty-five percent power then it'll

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.099 
twenty-five percent power then it'll
take<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.670> electrolyzed<00:02:32.389> water<00:02:32.389> cells<00:02:32.959> from

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
take the electrolyzed water cells from

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.750 
take the electrolyzed water cells from
the<00:02:33.170> right<00:02:33.439> side<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.920> put<00:02:34.159> them<00:02:34.310> back<00:02:34.489> into

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the right side and put them back into

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.080 
the right side and put them back into
energy<00:02:35.170> yeah<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.680> bad<00:02:37.129> thing<00:02:37.159> is<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.549> we'll

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
energy yeah the bad thing is that we'll

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.610 
energy yeah the bad thing is that we'll
use<00:02:38.389> ten<00:02:38.629> percent<00:02:38.659> of<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.109> power<00:02:39.290> in<00:02:39.500> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
use ten percent of the power in the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.190 
use ten percent of the power in the
process<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.180> an<00:02:41.420> iron<00:02:41.659> fence<00:02:41.840> and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
process so this is an iron fence and

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.809 
process so this is an iron fence and
we're<00:02:42.500> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.650> be<00:02:42.799> using<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.430> make<00:02:43.609> a

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
we're going to be using it to make a

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.809 
we're going to be using it to make a
sort<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.569> elevator<00:02:45.019> system<00:02:45.590> they<00:02:46.430> also<00:02:46.549> work

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
sort of elevator system they also work

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.429 
sort of elevator system they also work
like<00:02:47.000> regular<00:02:47.450> defenses<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.439> out<00:02:48.799> of<00:02:48.950> iron<00:02:50.439> so

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
like regular defenses but out of iron so

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.449 
like regular defenses but out of iron so
the<00:02:51.530> next<00:02:51.560> thing<00:02:51.799> we're<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.159> make<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.430> a

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
the next thing we're going to make is a

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.990 
the next thing we're going to make is a
magnetizer<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.769> thats<00:02:55.069> recipe<00:02:55.549> right<00:02:55.700> there

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
magnetizer and thats recipe right there

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.559 
magnetizer and thats recipe right there
and<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.620> used<00:02:57.829> alongside<00:02:58.219> the<00:02:58.489> fences<00:02:58.879> so

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
and this is used alongside the fences so

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.869 
and this is used alongside the fences so
what<00:02:59.719> we<00:02:59.810> have<00:02:59.989> set<00:03:00.230> up<00:03:00.349> here<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.769> an<00:03:00.980> MFE<00:03:01.400> with

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
what we have set up here is an MFE with

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.640 
what we have set up here is an MFE with
some<00:03:02.090> gold<00:03:02.269> cable<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.290> low<00:03:03.469> voltage

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
some gold cable and a low voltage

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.559 
some gold cable and a low voltage
transformer<00:03:04.519> yeah<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:04.909> have<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.450> only

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
transformer yeah you have to it only

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.929 
transformer yeah you have to it only
takes<00:03:05.930> 30<00:03:06.439> to<00:03:06.560> EU<00:03:07.069> so<00:03:07.219> you<00:03:07.310> have<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.549> break<00:03:07.760> it

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
takes 30 to EU so you have to break it

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.300 
takes 30 to EU so you have to break it
down<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.299> low<00:03:09.290> voltage<00:03:09.469> transformer<00:03:10.129> or

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
down with a low voltage transformer or

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.720 
down with a low voltage transformer or
you<00:03:10.669> can<00:03:10.819> just<00:03:10.939> use<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.150> bat<00:03:11.359> box<00:03:11.629> yep<00:03:12.579> so<00:03:13.579> if

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
you can just use a bat box yep so if

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.059 
you can just use a bat box yep so if
you're<00:03:13.879> wearing<00:03:14.060> Iron<00:03:14.419> Boots<00:03:14.719> or<00:03:15.079> nano<00:03:15.680> boots

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
you're wearing Iron Boots or nano boots

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.119 
you're wearing Iron Boots or nano boots
you<00:03:16.939> can<00:03:17.150> be<00:03:17.359> shot<00:03:17.720> up<00:03:17.930> by<00:03:18.079> this<00:03:18.440> yeah<00:03:18.859> any

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
you can be shot up by this yeah any

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.309 
you can be shot up by this yeah any
metal<00:03:19.519> boots<00:03:19.790> will<00:03:20.030> be<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.510> quantum<00:03:20.959> boots

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
metal boots will be so quantum boots

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.629 
metal boots will be so quantum boots
iron<00:03:21.769> nano<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.639> gold<00:03:23.979> so<00:03:24.979> what<00:03:25.099> it<00:03:25.190> does<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.400> it

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
iron nano and gold so what it does is it

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.530 
iron nano and gold so what it does is it
just<00:03:25.940> sort<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.239> as<00:03:26.419> long<00:03:26.989> as<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.260> put<00:03:27.440> the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
just sort of as long as you put the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.800 
just sort of as long as you put the
magnetizer<00:03:29.540> below<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.500> iron<00:03:30.939> fence<00:03:31.939> then

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
magnetizer below the iron fence then

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.030 
magnetizer below the iron fence then
it'll<00:03:33.049> shoot<00:03:33.199> you<00:03:33.349> up<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.739> top<00:03:33.859> of<00:03:33.919> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
it'll shoot you up to the top of the

to trade it for it so if you put in
tutor<00:04:08.419> instead<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.870> one<00:04:09.109> then<00:04:09.409> every<00:04:09.739> two<00:04:09.889> dirt

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
tutor instead of one then every two dirt

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.460 
tutor instead of one then every two dirt
you<00:04:10.189> put<00:04:10.400> in<00:04:10.489> would<00:04:10.669> get<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.939> other<00:04:11.090> item<00:04:11.470> so

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
you put in would get the other item so

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.479 
you put in would get the other item so
what<00:04:12.590> we're<00:04:12.680> going<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:12.889> do<00:04:13.069> is<00:04:13.220> we're<00:04:13.340> going<00:04:13.430> to

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
with other players and it's sort of like

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.700 
with other players and it's sort of like
having<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:37.250> sort<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.240> selling<00:04:38.630> stand<00:04:39.380> or<00:04:39.650> a

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.589 
having a sort of a selling stand or a
market<00:04:40.099> or<00:04:40.220> something<00:04:40.250> yep<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.569> next

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
market or something yep so the next

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:45.909 
market or something yep so the next
thing<00:04:44.810> we're<00:04:45.020> going<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.169> make<00:04:45.319> is<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.500> medium

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
thing we're going to make is a medium

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.379 
thing we're going to make is a medium
voltage<00:04:46.069> transformer<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:47.990> breaks<00:04:48.650> down

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
voltage transformer and this breaks down

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.999 
voltage transformer and this breaks down
512<00:04:50.389> EU<00:04:50.900> into<00:04:51.610> 128<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:54.320> next<00:04:54.620> thing<00:04:54.770> is<00:04:54.919> a

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
512 EU into 128 you the next thing is a

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.400 
512 EU into 128 you the next thing is a
Tesla<00:04:55.460> coil<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:55.970> rescue<00:04:56.930> work<00:04:57.199> pretty

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
Tesla coil and the rescue work pretty

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.080 
Tesla coil and the rescue work pretty
fast<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:57.919> spa<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:58.340> if<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.550> need<00:04:58.699> to<00:04:58.820> see<00:04:59.000> it

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
fast you spa so if you need to see it

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.839 
fast you spa so if you need to see it
again<00:04:59.470> so<00:05:00.470> what<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.620> Tesla<00:05:00.979> coil<00:05:01.160> does<00:05:01.430> is<00:05:01.699> it

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
again so what a Tesla coil does is it

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.600 
again so what a Tesla coil does is it
takes<00:05:02.000> power<00:05:02.330> from<00:05:02.570> one<00:05:02.720> device<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.520> when<00:05:04.520> you

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
takes power from one device and when you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.790 
takes power from one device and when you
apply<00:05:04.910> a<00:05:04.940> redstone<00:05:05.270> signal<00:05:05.599> a<00:05:05.930> person<00:05:06.440> can<00:05:06.650> be

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
apply a redstone signal a person can be

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.610 
apply a redstone signal a person can be
sort<00:05:07.220> of<00:05:07.630> discharged<00:05:08.630> on<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:09.110> with<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.440> power

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
sort of discharged on to with the power

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.089 
sort of discharged on to with the power
if<00:05:10.310> you're<00:05:10.580> close<00:05:10.789> to<00:05:10.820> it<00:05:11.150> it<00:05:11.330> will<00:05:11.919> hit<00:05:12.919> you

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
if you're close to it it will hit you

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.070 
if you're close to it it will hit you
now<00:05:13.909> the<00:05:13.970> reason<00:05:14.150> we<00:05:14.389> take<00:05:14.599> very<00:05:14.900> little

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
now the reason we take very little

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.330 
now the reason we take very little
damage<00:05:15.349> from<00:05:15.590> this<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.949> we're<00:05:16.099> wearing

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
damage from this is we're wearing

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.279 
damage from this is we're wearing
diamond<00:05:16.729> armor<00:05:17.030> but<00:05:17.509> keep<00:05:17.659> in<00:05:17.780> mind<00:05:17.840> that's<00:05:18.169> a

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
diamond armor but keep in mind that's a

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.290 
diamond armor but keep in mind that's a
lot<00:05:18.530> of<00:05:18.560> power<00:05:18.889> going<00:05:19.190> into<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.699> you<00:05:20.150> can

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
lot of power going into it you can

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.899 
lot of power going into it you can
actually<00:05:20.630> have<00:05:20.979> four<00:05:21.979> or<00:05:22.099> five<00:05:22.250> of<00:05:22.430> these<00:05:22.520> and

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
actually have four or five of these and

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.279 
actually have four or five of these and
when<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.180> get<00:05:23.270> close<00:05:23.539> to<00:05:23.690> old<00:05:23.840> for<00:05:24.080> them

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
when you get close to old for them

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.990 
when you get close to old for them
you'll<00:05:24.440> get<00:05:24.650> four<00:05:25.070> times<00:05:25.400> to<00:05:25.550> pop<00:05:25.699> into<00:05:25.880> the

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
you'll get four times to pop into the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.990 
you'll get four times to pop into the
damage<00:05:26.389> you<00:05:27.199> can<00:05:27.349> put<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.590> underneath

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
damage you can put it underneath

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.100 
damage you can put it underneath
floorboards<00:05:29.000> or<00:05:29.090> anything<00:05:29.419> and<00:05:29.599> it'll<00:05:29.780> still

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
floorboards or anything and it'll still

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.709 
floorboards or anything and it'll still
damage<00:05:30.470> them<00:05:31.210> alright<00:05:32.210> so<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.479> next<00:05:32.509> thing

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
damage them alright so the next thing

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:33.790 
damage them alright so the next thing
we're<00:05:32.930> going<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.080> make<00:05:33.229> is<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.469> high-voltage

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
we're going to make is a high-voltage

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.399 
we're going to make is a high-voltage
transformer<00:05:34.599> now<00:05:35.599> we're<00:05:36.050> not<00:05:36.139> going<00:05:36.320> to

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
transformer now we're not going to

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.080 
transformer now we're not going to
actually<00:05:36.500> use<00:05:36.800> this<00:05:36.949> in<00:05:37.130> this<00:05:37.310> video<00:05:37.669> but<00:05:37.940> what

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
actually use this in this video but what

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.209 
actually use this in this video but what
it<00:05:38.180> does<00:05:38.360> is<00:05:38.599> converts<00:05:38.960> high<00:05:39.199> voltage<00:05:39.680> to

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
it does is converts high voltage to

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.370 
it does is converts high voltage to
extreme<00:05:40.759> voltage<00:05:41.210> or<00:05:41.389> extreme<00:05:41.810> voltage<00:05:42.199> to

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
extreme voltage or extreme voltage to

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.670 
extreme voltage or extreme voltage to
high<00:05:42.500> voltage<00:05:42.949> extreme<00:05:43.789> voltage<00:05:44.150> is<00:05:44.270> about

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
high voltage extreme voltage is about

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.820 
high voltage extreme voltage is about
2048<00:05:45.680> EU<00:05:46.330> absolutely<00:05:47.330> that<00:05:48.080> will<00:05:48.259> fill<00:05:48.560> you<00:05:48.800> a

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
2048 EU absolutely that will fill you a

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.100 
2048 EU absolutely that will fill you a
lot<00:05:49.250> of<00:05:49.400> damage<00:05:49.580> if<00:05:50.000> you're<00:05:50.330> not<00:05:50.539> wearing<00:05:50.930> any

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
lot of damage if you're not wearing any

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.830 
lot of damage if you're not wearing any
insulation<00:05:52.330> so<00:05:53.330> what<00:05:53.419> we're<00:05:53.509> going<00:05:53.599> to<00:05:53.690> make

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
insulation so what we're going to make

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.870 
insulation so what we're going to make
here<00:05:54.050> is<00:05:54.259> called<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.590> lockitron<00:05:55.039> kit<00:05:55.400> crystal

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
here is called the lockitron kit crystal

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.870 
here is called the lockitron kit crystal
and<00:05:56.530> this<00:05:57.530> will<00:05:57.680> basically<00:05:57.800> store<00:05:58.280> it's<00:05:58.610> a

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
and this will basically store it's a

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.469 
and this will basically store it's a
battery<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.360> will<00:05:59.539> start<00:05:59.780> 1million<00:06:00.380> EU

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
battery that will start 1million EU

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.820 
battery that will start 1million EU
right<00:06:02.479> so<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.870> use<00:06:03.050> this<00:06:03.229> battery<00:06:03.650> you're

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
right so to use this battery you're

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.360 
right so to use this battery you're
going<00:06:03.979> to<00:06:04.039> need<00:06:04.190> an<00:06:04.370> MF<00:06:04.820> s<00:06:04.969> you<00:06:06.130> so<00:06:07.130> it<00:06:07.190> needs

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
going to need an MF s you so it needs

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.070 
going to need an MF s you so it needs
six<00:06:07.639> lapit<00:06:08.030> ron<00:06:08.210> crystals<00:06:08.599> and<00:06:08.780> it's<00:06:08.870> very

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
six lapit ron crystals and it's very

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.050 
six lapit ron crystals and it's very
expensive<00:06:09.349> but<00:06:09.889> it's<00:06:10.070> definitely<00:06:10.310> worth<00:06:10.699> it<00:06:10.849> I

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
expensive but it's definitely worth it I

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.890 
expensive but it's definitely worth it I
mean<00:06:11.509> stores<00:06:11.870> 10<00:06:12.229> million<00:06:12.710> EU<00:06:13.300> so<00:06:14.300> mostly

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
mean stores 10 million EU so mostly

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.360 
mean stores 10 million EU so mostly
you're<00:06:15.110> going<00:06:15.229> to<00:06:15.289> need<00:06:15.440> this<00:06:15.620> for<00:06:15.979> nuclear

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
you're going to need this for nuclear

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.129 
you're going to need this for nuclear
power<00:06:16.639> which<00:06:16.909> we<00:06:17.090> promise<00:06:17.659> we<00:06:17.810> will<00:06:17.900> show

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
power which we promise we will show

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.490 
power which we promise we will show
later<00:06:18.409> and<00:06:19.039> this<00:06:19.550> takes<00:06:19.789> any<00:06:20.120> power<00:06:20.900> for<00:06:21.169> input

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
later and this takes any power for input

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.219 
later and this takes any power for input
to<00:06:21.710> you<00:06:21.949> can<00:06:22.099> just<00:06:22.280> have<00:06:22.479> regular<00:06:23.479> thank<00:06:24.080> you

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
to you can just have regular thank you

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.700 
to you can just have regular thank you
but<00:06:24.979> it<00:06:25.099> outputs<00:06:25.490> at<00:06:25.699> five<00:06:26.479> fundamental<00:06:27.080> so

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
but it outputs at five fundamental so

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.110 
but it outputs at five fundamental so
that's<00:06:27.889> where<00:06:28.099> you'll<00:06:28.279> need<00:06:28.460> your<00:06:28.669> medium

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
that's where you'll need your medium

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.040 
that's where you'll need your medium
voltage<00:06:29.270> transfer

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
voltage transfer

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.089 
voltage transfer
and<00:06:30.379> then<00:06:30.530> you're<00:06:30.650> going<00:06:30.740> to<00:06:30.800> need<00:06:30.979> another

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
and then you're going to need another

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.839 
and then you're going to need another
low<00:06:31.490> voltage<00:06:31.909> transformer<00:06:32.569> yep<00:06:33.340> and<00:06:34.340> for<00:06:34.669> the

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
low voltage transformer yep and for the

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.390 
low voltage transformer yep and for the
high<00:06:35.780> voltage<00:06:36.139> power<00:06:36.169> you<00:06:36.560> need<00:06:36.740> to<00:06:36.919> use<00:06:37.129> a

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
high voltage power you need to use a

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.430 
high voltage power you need to use a
high-voltage<00:06:37.940> cable<00:06:38.599> so<00:06:39.259> to<00:06:39.349> make

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
high-voltage cable so to make

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.050 
high-voltage cable so to make
high-voltage<00:06:39.770> cable<00:06:40.340> you<00:06:40.460> just<00:06:40.669> need<00:06:40.819> three

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
high-voltage cable you just need three

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.960 
high-voltage cable you just need three
iron<00:06:41.870> like<00:06:42.259> that<00:06:42.500> three<00:06:42.860> processed<00:06:43.460> iron<00:06:43.669> and

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
iron like that three processed iron and

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.719 
iron like that three processed iron and
you<00:06:44.780> can<00:06:44.930> insulate<00:06:45.830> it<00:06:45.949> up<00:06:46.069> to<00:06:46.250> four<00:06:46.490> times

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
you can insulate it up to four times

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.330 
you can insulate it up to four times
when<00:06:47.240> we<00:06:47.479> recommend<00:06:47.990> inserting<00:06:48.440> insulating

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
when we recommend inserting insulating

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.369 
when we recommend inserting insulating
it<00:06:49.460> up<00:06:49.610> to<00:06:49.729> four<00:06:49.940> times<00:06:50.060> because<00:06:50.419> it<00:06:50.599> has<00:06:51.349> less

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 
it up to four times because it has less

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.700 
it up to four times because it has less
waste<00:06:51.919> of<00:06:52.580> you<00:06:53.000> as<00:06:53.180> well<00:06:53.930> it<00:06:54.139> doesn't<00:06:54.440> hurt<00:06:54.530> you

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
waste of you as well it doesn't hurt you

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.439 
waste of you as well it doesn't hurt you
either<00:06:54.889> and<00:06:55.550> this<00:06:55.879> small<00:06:56.620> transport<00:06:58.060> 512<00:06:59.060> EU
