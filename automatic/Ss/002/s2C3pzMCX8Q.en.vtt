00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
usually you know the top cover just

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.040 
usually you know the top cover just
comes<00:00:41.790> right<00:00:41.879> off<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.629> full<00:00:42.870> access

comes right off and you have full access
to<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.559> laser<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.620> if<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.890> slot<00:00:47.190> load<00:00:47.489> DVD

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
to the laser so if it's a slot load DVD

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.830 
to the laser so if it's a slot load DVD
player<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:49.160> that's<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.370> different<00:00:50.789> story<00:00:51.000> but

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
player then that's a different story but

player then that's a different story but
anyway<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.309> could<00:00:53.460> try<00:00:53.640> cleaning<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.090> laser

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
anyway you could try cleaning the laser

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.470 
anyway you could try cleaning the laser
with<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.829> q-tip<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.579> some<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.210> put<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.390> little

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
with a q-tip with some just put a little

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.420 
with a q-tip with some just put a little
bit<00:00:57.660> rubbing<00:00:57.930> alcohol<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> tip<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
bit rubbing alcohol on the tip here and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
bit rubbing alcohol on the tip here and
just<00:01:00.300> gently<00:01:01.520> clean<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> laser<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.530> don't

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
just gently clean the laser you don't

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.260 
just gently clean the laser you don't
want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> push<00:01:05.040> too<00:01:05.220> hard<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
want to push too hard a little bit of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.270 
want to push too hard a little bit of
movement<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> lasers<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.470> bad<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.040> just

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
movement in the lasers not bad but just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.530 
movement in the lasers not bad but just
don't<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.700> force<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.330> just

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
don't you know force it and then just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.359 
don't you know force it and then just
let<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.750> dry<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.229> few<00:01:13.290> seconds<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:16.130> if<00:01:17.130> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
let it dry for a few seconds now if that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.100 
let it dry for a few seconds now if that
does<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.820> work<00:01:19.610> then<00:01:20.610> look<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> back<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
does not work then look on the back of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.710 
does not work then look on the back of
the<00:01:22.170> laser<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.390> usually<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.049> some

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
the laser and usually there will be some

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.590 
the laser and usually there will be some
potentiometers<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:28.170> trimpots<00:01:29.000> now<00:01:30.000> one

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
potentiometers little trimpots now one

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
potentiometers little trimpots now one
of<00:01:30.630> them<00:01:30.869> will<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.470> DVD<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
of them will be for the DVD and one of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.410 
of them will be for the DVD and one of
them<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> CD<00:01:35.299> depending<00:01:36.299> on

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
them will be for the CD depending on

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.899 
them will be for the CD depending on
what<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.720> problem<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.259> whether<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.280> say<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
what your problem is whether I say the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.980 
what your problem is whether I say the
DVD<00:01:39.240> player<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.680> DVD<00:01:40.920> stop<00:01:41.369> plan

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
DVD player you know just a DVD stop plan

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.889 
DVD player you know just a DVD stop plan
but<00:01:42.990> it'll<00:01:43.409> still<00:01:43.590> read<00:01:43.829> CDs<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> do

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
but it'll still read CDs so what you do

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.179 
but it'll still read CDs so what you do
is<00:01:47.720> sometimes<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.500> lettering<00:01:49.770> on

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
is sometimes will be some lettering on

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
is sometimes will be some lettering on
the<00:01:50.220> back<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> C<00:01:51.990> on

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the back here some will have like a C on

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.120 
the back here some will have like a C on
there<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.680> D<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.520> meaning<00:01:53.909> CD<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.540> Sarah<00:01:55.170> DVD

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
there a D not meaning CD or Sarah DVD

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.450 
there a D not meaning CD or Sarah DVD
trim<00:01:56.460> pot<00:01:57.140> some<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.799> you'll<00:01:59.369> just

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
trim pot some will not and you'll just

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.660 
trim pot some will not and you'll just
have<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> guess<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.009> you'll

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
have to guess so what you do is you'll

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.639 
have to guess so what you do is you'll
have<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> multimeter<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.020> mean<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.500> can

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
have to have a multimeter I mean you can

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.160 
have to have a multimeter I mean you can
do<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.219> one<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.909> you'll<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.509> risk

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
do it with that one but you'll just risk

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.400 
do it with that one but you'll just risk
blowing<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.649> your<00:02:07.799> laser<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.340> no<00:02:08.520> time<00:02:09.410> you'll

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
blowing up your laser in no time you'll

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.030 
blowing up your laser in no time you'll
have<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.649> set<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
have to set it to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.160 
have to set it to
um<00:02:12.220> scale<00:02:12.760> usually<00:02:13.540> around<00:02:13.810> 20k<00:02:14.440> ohms<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:15.069> a

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
um scale usually around 20k ohms is a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.470 
um scale usually around 20k ohms is a
good<00:02:17.170> start

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
good start

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.350 
good start
so<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.860> go<00:02:21.010> back<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.610> laser<00:02:21.819> here<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.269> these

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
so you go back the laser here and these

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.690 
so you go back the laser here and these
little<00:02:22.510> trim<00:02:22.780> pots<00:02:23.049> will<00:02:23.769> have<00:02:23.980> two<00:02:24.430> little

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
little trim pots will have two little

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.970 
little trim pots will have two little
points<00:02:24.909> on<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.209> side<00:02:25.420> there<00:02:25.799> those<00:02:26.799> two

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
points on the side there those two

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.589 
points on the side there those two
points<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.459> what<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.730> want<00:02:27.909> to<00:02:27.970> measure<00:02:28.120> so

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
points is what you want to measure so

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.979 
points is what you want to measure so
you<00:02:28.690> take<00:02:28.870> your<00:02:28.900> two<00:02:29.370> leads<00:02:30.370> here<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> put

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
you take your two leads here and you put

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.170 
you take your two leads here and you put
them<00:02:32.110> on<00:02:32.170> those<00:02:32.349> two<00:02:32.560> points<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.819> it<00:02:34.060> will

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
them on those two points and it will

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.670 
them on those two points and it will
read<00:02:34.450> let's<00:02:34.989> say<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.440> reads<00:02:37.049> 7k<00:02:38.049> ohms<00:02:38.290> on

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
read let's say if it reads 7k ohms on

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.390 
read let's say if it reads 7k ohms on
the<00:02:39.310> 20k<00:02:39.760> ohms<00:02:39.970> scale<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.290> would<00:02:41.920> just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
the 20k ohms scale then you would just

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.960 
the 20k ohms scale then you would just
simply<00:02:43.950> depending<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.069> your<00:02:45.190> model<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.790> would

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
simply depending on your model you would

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.819 
simply depending on your model you would
have<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.269> turn<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.599> counterclockwise<00:02:47.049> or

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
have to turn it counterclockwise or

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.780 
have to turn it counterclockwise or
clockwise<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.739> you'll<00:02:51.160> have<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.400> figure<00:02:51.579> that

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
clockwise so you'll have to figure that

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.520 
clockwise so you'll have to figure that
out<00:02:51.849> too<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.760> just<00:02:55.480> measure<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.959> turn<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.379> one

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
out too so just measure it turn it one

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.190 
out too so just measure it turn it one
way<00:02:56.560> if<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.250> measurement<00:02:57.700> goes<00:02:57.819> up<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:58.989> you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
way if the measurement goes up then you

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.289 
way if the measurement goes up then you
know<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.379> did<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.890> did<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.280> wrong<00:03:00.459> you

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
know you did you did it wrong you

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.220 
know you did you did it wrong you
because<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.660> have<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.930> go<00:03:02.049> down<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:04.079> what<00:03:05.079> you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
because you have to go down so what you

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.619 
because you have to go down so what you
want<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.980> get<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.819> down<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.030> let's<00:03:07.420> say

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
want to do is get it down to let's say

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.039 
want to do is get it down to let's say
six<00:03:07.959> point<00:03:08.230> five<00:03:08.849> that's<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:10.209> little<00:03:10.569> too<00:03:10.810> much

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
six point five that's a little too much

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.539 
six point five that's a little too much
really<00:03:11.560> um<00:03:11.799> I<00:03:13.560> would<00:03:14.560> actually<00:03:14.739> probably<00:03:15.160> go

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
really um I would actually probably go

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.789 
really um I would actually probably go
down<00:03:15.819> maybe<00:03:16.329> six<00:03:16.660> point<00:03:16.930> eight<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.290> then<00:03:17.530> try

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
down maybe six point eight and then try

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.270 
down maybe six point eight and then try
it<00:03:18.150> let's<00:03:19.150> say<00:03:19.500> let's<00:03:20.500> say<00:03:20.620> if<00:03:20.859> you<00:03:20.950> turn<00:03:21.130> this

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
it let's say let's say if you turn this

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.180 
it let's say let's say if you turn this
too<00:03:21.519> much<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:22.389> you<00:03:22.480> get<00:03:22.660> like<00:03:22.810> five<00:03:23.440> instead

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
too much and you get like five instead

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.110 
too much and you get like five instead
of<00:03:24.370> at<00:03:24.760> from<00:03:25.090> seven<00:03:25.889> then<00:03:26.889> turn<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.190> back<00:03:27.819> up

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
of at from seven then turn that back up

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.659 
of at from seven then turn that back up
to<00:03:28.870> at<00:03:28.959> least<00:03:28.989> six<00:03:29.410> point<00:03:29.680> five<00:03:29.889> or<00:03:30.220> six<00:03:30.430> point

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
to at least six point five or six point

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.809 
to at least six point five or six point
eight<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:32.590> go<00:03:32.769> down<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.250> point<00:03:33.609> two

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
eight just go down like point two

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.059 
eight just go down like point two
increments<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:35.079> real<00:03:35.260> small<00:03:35.560> increments

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
increments just real small increments

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.710 
increments just real small increments
and<00:03:37.410> once<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.530> go<00:03:38.650> down<00:03:38.910> try<00:03:39.910> your<00:03:40.090> DVD<00:03:40.419> if<00:03:40.569> it

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
and once you go down try your DVD if it

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.690 
and once you go down try your DVD if it
plays<00:03:40.930> great<00:03:40.959> if<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.799> doesn't<00:03:42.220> go<00:03:42.459> down<00:03:42.669> a

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
plays great if it doesn't go down a

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.849 
plays great if it doesn't go down a
little<00:03:43.060> bit<00:03:43.239> more<00:03:43.450> again<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.349> just<00:03:44.709> keep

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
little bit more again and just keep

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.849 
little bit more again and just keep
doing<00:03:44.889> that<00:03:45.220> until<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:46.599> get<00:03:47.169> your<00:03:47.319> DVDs<00:03:47.709> you

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
doing that until you get your DVDs you

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.420 
doing that until you get your DVDs you
read<00:03:48.069> now<00:03:49.030> if<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.900> go<00:03:50.049> down<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.410> low<00:03:50.739> yes<00:03:51.250> you

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
read now if you go down to low yes you

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.490 
read now if you go down to low yes you
will<00:03:51.609> risk<00:03:51.880> burning<00:03:52.150> out<00:03:52.359> the<00:03:52.389> laser<00:03:52.690> but<00:03:53.290> it

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
will risk burning out the laser but it

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.900 
will risk burning out the laser but it
doesn't<00:03:53.889> work<00:03:54.010> anyway<00:03:54.310> don't<00:03:54.700> worry<00:03:55.150> about<00:03:55.359> it

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
doesn't work anyway don't worry about it

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.390 
doesn't work anyway don't worry about it
but<00:03:57.910> like<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.209> said<00:03:58.650> you'll<00:03:59.650> have<00:03:59.829> to<00:03:59.950> find<00:04:00.190> out

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
but like I said you'll have to find out

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.159 
but like I said you'll have to find out
which<00:04:00.519> one's<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.940> CD<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.359> which<00:04:01.480> one's<00:04:01.690> DVD

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
which one's the CD and which one's DVD

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:03.920 
which one's the CD and which one's DVD
like<00:04:02.470> if<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.709> doesn't<00:04:02.950> have<00:04:03.099> those<00:04:03.250> letterings

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
like if it doesn't have those letterings

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.259 
like if it doesn't have those letterings
then<00:04:04.930> you're<00:04:05.530> not<00:04:05.620> going<00:04:05.829> to<00:04:05.889> know<00:04:06.040> right<00:04:06.269> well

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
then you're not going to know right well

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.740 
then you're not going to know right well
try<00:04:07.780> one<00:04:07.989> first<00:04:08.290> go<00:04:08.919> down<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.160> little<00:04:09.400> bit<00:04:09.750> if

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
try one first go down a little bit if

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.659 
try one first go down a little bit if
this<00:04:10.959> doesn't<00:04:11.260> work<00:04:11.470> go<00:04:11.829> down<00:04:11.859> it<00:04:12.190> go<00:04:12.459> down<00:04:12.609> a

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
this doesn't work go down it go down a

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.789 
this doesn't work go down it go down a
little<00:04:12.849> bit<00:04:13.030> more<00:04:13.209> like<00:04:14.199> if<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.500> was<00:04:14.620> that

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
little bit more like if it was that

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.360 
little bit more like if it was that
seven<00:04:15.609> and<00:04:16.139> you're<00:04:17.139> down<00:04:17.320> at<00:04:17.500> six<00:04:17.769> already<00:04:18.160> and

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
seven and you're down at six already and

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.370 
seven and you're down at six already and
it<00:04:18.430> still<00:04:18.639> doesn't<00:04:18.789> work<00:04:18.910> then<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:19.900> would<00:04:20.169> say

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
it still doesn't work then I would say

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.970 
it still doesn't work then I would say
just<00:04:21.159> put<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.489> back<00:04:21.669> up<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.030> seven<00:04:22.390> like<00:04:22.690> we're

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
just put it back up to seven like we're

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.050 
just put it back up to seven like we're
was<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.460> then<00:04:24.450> tried<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.810> other<00:04:24.960> one<00:04:25.170> and

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
was and then tried the other one and

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.360 
was and then tried the other one and
then<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:28.200> know<00:04:28.320> hopefully<00:04:28.530> you'll<00:04:29.100> get<00:04:29.220> the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
then you know hopefully you'll get the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.120 
then you know hopefully you'll get the
right<00:04:29.520> one<00:04:29.700> that<00:04:29.730> time<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:34.470> that's<00:04:34.800> pretty

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
right one that time so that's pretty

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.190 
right one that time so that's pretty
much<00:04:35.250> how<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.760> would<00:04:35.940> adjust<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.570> laser<00:04:36.810> all

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
much how you would adjust the laser all

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.230 
much how you would adjust the laser all
you're<00:04:37.380> doing<00:04:37.710> is<00:04:37.860> adjusting<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.580> current<00:04:38.940> to

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
you're doing is adjusting the current to

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.690 
you're doing is adjusting the current to
the<00:04:39.270> laser<00:04:40.010> you're<00:04:41.010> lessening<00:04:41.580> the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
the laser you're lessening the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.770 
the laser you're lessening the
resistance<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.670> laser<00:04:44.880> which<00:04:45.210> will<00:04:45.450> you

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
resistance to the laser which will you

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.080 
resistance to the laser which will you
know<00:04:45.870> it'll<00:04:46.380> light<00:04:46.530> up<00:04:46.560> brighter<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:48.030> able

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
know it'll light up brighter to be able

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.360 
know it'll light up brighter to be able
to<00:04:48.210> read<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:51.870> from<00:04:52.080> age<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.740> know<00:04:52.860> they<00:04:53.070> they

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
to read just from age you know they they

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.140 
to read just from age you know they they
get<00:04:53.520> weak<00:04:54.470> some<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.770> your<00:04:55.980> DVD<00:04:56.310> players<00:04:56.610> like

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
get weak some of your DVD players like

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.360 
get weak some of your DVD players like
this<00:04:57.360> one<00:04:57.630> will<00:04:58.020> be<00:04:58.140> way<00:04:58.380> different<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:02.310> know

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
this one will be way different you know

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.440 
this one will be way different you know
you<00:05:02.490> won't<00:05:02.580> be<00:05:02.730> able<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:02.910> get<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.060> screwdriver

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
you won't be able to get a screwdriver

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.530 
you won't be able to get a screwdriver
down<00:05:03.780> in<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.050> area<00:05:04.880> but<00:05:05.880> as<00:05:06.030> you<00:05:06.180> can<00:05:06.330> see

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
down in this area but as you can see

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.370 
down in this area but as you can see
there's<00:05:06.810> no<00:05:07.020> trimpots<00:05:07.950> right<00:05:08.370> here<00:05:08.550> anyway

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
there's no trimpots right here anyway

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.780 
there's no trimpots right here anyway
they're<00:05:10.380> actually<00:05:10.770> at<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.010> bottom<00:05:11.190> you<00:05:11.760> can

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
they're actually at the bottom you can

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:19.100 
they're actually at the bottom you can
just<00:05:14.180> maybe<00:05:15.180> barely<00:05:17.480> see<00:05:18.480> the<00:05:18.600> little<00:05:18.840> shiny

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
just maybe barely see the little shiny

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.310 
just maybe barely see the little shiny
pieces<00:05:19.500> in<00:05:19.920> there<00:05:20.160> I'm<00:05:20.520> not<00:05:20.580> sure<00:05:20.730> but<00:05:21.330> but

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
pieces in there I'm not sure but but

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.980 
pieces in there I'm not sure but but
they're<00:05:22.530> down<00:05:22.710> there<00:05:23.040> and<00:05:23.730> for<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.180> you

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
they're down there and for that you

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.560 
they're down there and for that you
would<00:05:25.140> have<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.700> you<00:05:26.700> know<00:05:26.730> remove<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.330> bunch

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
would have to you know remove a bunch

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.270 
would have to you know remove a bunch
more<00:05:27.630> stuff<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.350> think<00:05:28.560> under<00:05:28.860> these<00:05:29.010> are

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
more stuff I think under these are

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.490 
more stuff I think under these are
probably<00:05:29.520> some<00:05:29.610> screws<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.450> there's<00:05:31.320> some

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
probably some screws and there's some

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.920 
probably some screws and there's some
screws<00:05:31.800> all<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.040> way<00:05:32.160> around<00:05:32.460> here<00:05:32.940> will<00:05:33.600> tiny

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
screws all the way around here will tiny

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.950 
screws all the way around here will tiny
ones<00:05:34.220> that'll<00:05:35.220> take<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.400> back<00:05:35.700> cover<00:05:36.030> off<00:05:37.370> now

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
ones that'll take the back cover off now

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.080 
ones that'll take the back cover off now
like<00:05:39.960> on<00:05:40.170> some<00:05:40.380> of<00:05:40.470> them<00:05:40.560> TV<00:05:40.950> set-top<00:05:41.280> you<00:05:42.000> know

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
like on some of them TV set-top you know

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.730 
like on some of them TV set-top you know
boxes<00:05:42.810> or<00:05:42.960> whatever<00:05:44.510> like<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.690> regular<00:05:45.870> DVD

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
boxes or whatever like the regular DVD

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.020 
boxes or whatever like the regular DVD
players<00:05:47.040> with<00:05:47.370> thing<00:05:47.520> all<00:05:47.700> the<00:05:47.790> tray<00:05:48.000> that

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
players with thing all the tray that

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.000 
players with thing all the tray that
comes<00:05:48.390> out<00:05:48.630> or<00:05:48.780> whatever<00:05:48.930> for<00:05:49.560> those<00:05:49.740> you

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
comes out or whatever for those you

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.500 
comes out or whatever for those you
would<00:05:50.100> have<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.310> flip<00:05:50.520> them<00:05:50.640> upside<00:05:50.970> down<00:05:51.210> and

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
would have to flip them upside down and

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.660 
would have to flip them upside down and
take<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:51.870> screws<00:05:52.170> out<00:05:52.350> of<00:05:52.410> them<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.890> take<00:05:53.550> the

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
take the screws out of them to take the

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.350 
take the screws out of them to take the
lid<00:05:53.850> off<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:55.800> be<00:05:55.950> able<00:05:56.010> to<00:05:56.160> get<00:05:56.880> to<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.120> laser

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
lid off to be able to get to the laser

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.880 
lid off to be able to get to the laser
there<00:05:59.150> and<00:06:01.640> which<00:06:02.640> is<00:06:02.790> usually<00:06:03.120> not<00:06:03.150> too<00:06:03.510> bad

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
there and which is usually not too bad

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.380 
there and which is usually not too bad
but<00:06:04.890> you<00:06:05.370> know<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:05.520> have<00:06:05.730> to<00:06:05.850> get<00:06:05.970> in<00:06:06.090> there<00:06:06.270> to

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
but you know you have to get in there to

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.800 
but you know you have to get in there to
clean<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.720> laser<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.970> you<00:06:09.210> know<00:06:09.330> like<00:06:09.510> I<00:06:09.540> said

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
clean the laser and you know like I said

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.930 
clean the laser and you know like I said
if<00:06:09.930> that<00:06:09.960> doesn't<00:06:10.350> work<00:06:10.470> try<00:06:10.830> adjusting<00:06:11.400> the

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
if that doesn't work try adjusting the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.660 
if that doesn't work try adjusting the
potentiometers<00:06:12.660> on<00:06:12.750> the<00:06:12.840> back<00:06:13.020> there<00:06:13.670> just

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
potentiometers on the back there just

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.970 
potentiometers on the back there just
one<00:06:14.910> at<00:06:15.060> a<00:06:15.120> time<00:06:15.360> and<00:06:15.840> make<00:06:16.020> sure<00:06:16.050> you<00:06:16.800> know<00:06:16.920> you

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
one at a time and make sure you know you

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.220 
one at a time and make sure you know you
write<00:06:17.280> them<00:06:17.430> right<00:06:17.970> the<00:06:18.150> resistance<00:06:18.870> values

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
write them right the resistance values

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.620 
write them right the resistance values
down<00:06:19.470> before<00:06:20.370> you<00:06:20.490> start<00:06:20.820> so<00:06:21.150> that<00:06:21.330> if<00:06:21.510> you

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
down before you start so that if you

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.450 
down before you start so that if you
mess<00:06:21.840> up<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:22.260> can<00:06:22.290> put<00:06:22.590> them<00:06:22.740> right<00:06:22.770> back<00:06:22.950> to

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
mess up you can put them right back to

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.610 
mess up you can put them right back to
the<00:06:23.550> original<00:06:27.680> so

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
the original so

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.180 
the original so
yeah<00:06:31.940> I'll<00:06:32.940> tell<00:06:33.150> you<00:06:33.330> a<00:06:33.800> repair<00:06:34.800> one<00:06:35.010> or

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
yeah I'll tell you a repair one or
