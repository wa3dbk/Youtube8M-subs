00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
ah well it feels a lot less important

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.270 
ah well it feels a lot less important
now<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.630> we<00:04:33.810> know<00:04:33.840> Superman<00:04:34.560> exists<00:04:35.040> in<00:04:35.160> this

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280

something<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:37.590> 10<00:04:38.070> minutes<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.700> guess<00:04:39.030> I

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
something like 10 minutes so I guess I

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.250 
something like 10 minutes so I guess I
guess<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:39.840> can<00:04:39.960> fail<00:04:40.170> to<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.500> big<00:04:40.680> deal<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:42.260> know

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
guess we can fail to a big deal I know
