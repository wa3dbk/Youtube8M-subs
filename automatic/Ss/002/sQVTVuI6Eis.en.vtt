00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it's a simple setup so there's not much

I'm the flooville system doesn't reach

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
I'm the flooville system doesn't reach
all<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> way<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.510> bottom<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.710> still

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
all the way to the bottom but it's still

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.990

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
a fairly good filter on it as you can

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.880 
a fairly good filter on it as you can
see<00:00:48.180> has<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> small<00:00:48.809> part<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> top<00:00:49.590> which

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
see has a small part in the top which

see has a small part in the top which
doesn't<00:00:50.579> seem<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> bother<00:00:51.329> Kratos<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.260> was

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
doesn't seem to bother Kratos I was

show<00:01:18.570> off<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.470> system<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.130> how<00:01:20.310> well

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
show off this little system and how well
it's<00:01:20.670> doing<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.689> crate<00:01:22.619> dose

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it's doing as you can see crate dose

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.730 
it's doing as you can see crate dose
isn't<00:01:22.979> 5<00:01:23.340> gallon<00:01:23.759> tank<00:01:24.030> now<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:25.080> sell<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740

little half gallon in one gallon tanks

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.340 
little half gallon in one gallon tanks
but<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:29.180> wouldn't<00:01:30.180> suggest<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:31.020> way

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
but I wouldn't suggest it because way

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.289 
but I wouldn't suggest it because way
does<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.950> move<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.520> he's<00:01:33.030> very

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
does like to move and he's very

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
does like to move and he's very
preoccupied<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.229> his<00:01:34.380> reflection<00:01:34.890> right

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
preoccupied with his reflection right

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.859 
preoccupied with his reflection right
now<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.439> he's<00:01:37.710> mad<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.750> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
now as you can see he's mad at it but it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.090 
now as you can see he's mad at it but it
gives<00:01:39.960> them<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.259> excitement<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.009> I'm

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
gives them a little excitement so I'm

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.090 
gives them a little excitement so I'm
not<00:01:41.250> gonna<00:01:41.400> worry<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.079> but<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.979> back

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
not gonna worry about it but in the back

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710 
not gonna worry about it but in the back
there<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.270> bait<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
there I have it here because bait is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990 
there I have it here because bait is
doing<00:01:46.020> required<00:01:46.439> temperature<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.220> around<00:01:47.369> 78

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
doing required temperature of around 78

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.990 
doing required temperature of around 78
to<00:01:48.210> 80<00:01:48.360> degrees<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.140> lot<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.100> betas<00:01:50.490> die<00:01:50.670> because

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to 80 degrees a lot of betas die because

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
to 80 degrees a lot of betas die because
they<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.360> too<00:01:51.479> cold<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.649> just

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
they get too cold in there they just

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249 
they get too cold in there they just
can't<00:01:53.040> take<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.250> their<00:01:53.490> immune<00:01:53.729> system<00:01:54.259> lowers

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
can't take it their immune system lowers

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.920 
can't take it their immune system lowers
and<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:55.619> stop<00:01:55.829> eating<00:01:56.689> unfortunately<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> had

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and they stop eating unfortunately I had

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.450 
and they stop eating unfortunately I had
several<00:01:58.110> wagos<00:01:58.469> died<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.100> didn't<00:01:59.369> know

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
several wagos died because I didn't know

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.880 
several wagos died because I didn't know
that<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.759> needed<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> filter<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.899> now<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.770> I'm

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that is needed a filter and now that I'm

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.940 
that is needed a filter and now that I'm
