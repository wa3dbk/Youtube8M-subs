crashing down

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.380 
crashing down
and<00:01:26.750> he<00:01:26.810> fell<00:01:27.080> a<00:01:27.110> decent<00:01:27.619> ways<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.190> just<00:01:29.180> like

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
and he fell a decent ways and just like

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.180 
and he fell a decent ways and just like
I<00:01:29.540> said<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:29.990> hope<00:01:30.229> he<00:01:30.410> was<00:01:30.530> on<00:01:30.650> some<00:01:30.950> type<00:01:31.160> of

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
I said I hope he was on some type of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.880 
I said I hope he was on some type of
drug<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:31.729> he<00:01:31.820> can<00:01:31.940> justify<00:01:32.570> why<00:01:33.200> he<00:01:33.470> was<00:01:33.590> trying

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
drug so he can justify why he was trying

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.530 
drug so he can justify why he was trying
to<00:01:33.950> do<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.310> one<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.820> reasons<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:35.330> think

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
to do that one of the reasons I think

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.359 
to do that one of the reasons I think
this<00:01:35.690> is<00:01:35.869> one<00:01:36.050> of<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.229> stupidest<00:01:36.950> things<00:01:37.040> I've

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
this is one of the stupidest things I've

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.760 
this is one of the stupidest things I've
ever<00:01:37.550> seen<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:38.030> there<00:01:38.420> was<00:01:38.540> obviously<00:01:39.140> no<00:01:39.560> way

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
ever seen is there was obviously no way

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.440 
ever seen is there was obviously no way
he<00:01:39.979> was<00:01:40.070> ever<00:01:40.280> gonna<00:01:40.490> escape<00:01:40.790> climbing<00:01:41.330> on<00:01:41.420> top

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
he was ever gonna escape climbing on top

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.450 
he was ever gonna escape climbing on top
of<00:01:41.720> that<00:01:41.810> stupid<00:01:42.229> thing<00:01:42.410> no<00:01:42.979> way<00:01:43.190> he'd<00:01:43.369> ever

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
of that stupid thing no way he'd ever

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.609 
of that stupid thing no way he'd ever
escape<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.240> by<00:01:44.479> doing<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.900> he's<00:01:45.080> resisting
