00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.080
 this is the big chain of 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.430
 volkswagen a white giant of the optical 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.859
 certainly not at first glance 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.779
 Everyone is convinced but we have now 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.059
 since two weeks in decent test and me 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.650
 must say it is a dare quite 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.620
 suitable for the terrain thoroughly 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.199
 interesting for hunter four -wheel drive 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.710
 of course an amazing one 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.000
 ground clearance as exaggerated by 30 cm 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.949
 he will not have it 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.470
 maybe 20 and he has a lot 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.190
 place and little schmankerl first 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.579
 not quite sound every utilization with 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.020
 Adjustments with many 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.000
 gimmicks with the little things the 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.370
 men would have fun but to 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.379
 apart from the great example 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.210
 headroom so there are alone over 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.890
 my head again 25 centimeters air 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.520
 he has a storage compartment 20 cm deep at the top 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.600
 and yes over the entire width of the car 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.860
 fits binocular rows that you can 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.270
 You can also clean cartridges 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.149
 documents rintun or a first aid 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.560
 box beer always schmankerl the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:24.049
 fun and I place no question 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.810
 before the rear seat is folded 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.900
 of course, a bit bigger one 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.630
 at the back with pure what you want more 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.000
 there fits half a stretch pure eight 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.049
 were all right and left and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.210
 two subjects for foxes 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.880
 So obviously we have the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.890
 Hunter thought volkswagen and has with the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.350
 cross chain a car on the market 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.740
 Thrown what I said determined 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.810
 optically getting used to is me 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.820
 find nothing because what is bad is when 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.990
 you want to know more about it 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.719
 I gave them the august issue of 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.259
 German hunting newspaper once more much 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.259
