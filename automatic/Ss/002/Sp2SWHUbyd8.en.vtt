00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
me the l 96 is better than the m 98 be

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.380 
me the l 96 is better than the m 98 be
and<00:00:27.750> slightly<00:00:28.260> better<00:00:28.500> than<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> m40<00:00:29.279> i<00:00:29.460> like

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and slightly better than the m40 i like

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.669 
and slightly better than the m40 i like
the<00:00:30.539> m4<00:00:30.840> teasers<00:00:31.050> nope<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.619> my

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the m4 teasers nope I was one of my

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860 
the m4 teasers nope I was one of my
favorite<00:00:32.040> ones<00:00:32.270> playing<00:00:33.270> aggressive<00:00:33.719> role

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
favorite ones playing aggressive role

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.090 
favorite ones playing aggressive role
like<00:00:34.550> kind<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.110> like<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.980> m

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
like kind of like this I like it the m

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.060 
like kind of like this I like it the m
98<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:39.420> good<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:39.989> i<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> l<00:00:40.590> 96<00:00:40.829> is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
98 be is good but i think the l 96 is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.549 
98 be is good but i think the l 96 is
better<00:00:41.309> purely<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.420> has<00:00:42.540> 11<00:00:43.379> rounds

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
better purely because it has 11 rounds

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
better purely because it has 11 rounds
where's<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> m<00:00:44.250> let<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.670> struggles<00:00:45.329> an

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
where's the m let it be struggles an

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.569 
where's the m let it be struggles an
earlier<00:00:45.809> 6<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> reload<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.250> quite

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
earlier 6 you have to reload it quite

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.700 
earlier 6 you have to reload it quite
often<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> miss<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> target<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.500> one

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
often if you miss a target that's one

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.709 
often if you miss a target that's one
bullet<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.190> did<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.520> ask<00:00:50.640> me<00:00:50.730> where's<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> l

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
bullet with did you ask me where's the l

dnieper Eiffel and it comes down with
effective<00:01:49.890> range<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> use<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
effective range is what you use the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370 
effective range is what you use the
sniper<00:01:51.299> rifles<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> Recon<00:01:52.079> kick-out

sniper rifles and the Recon kick-out
really<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> range<00:01:53.460> i'm<00:01:53.640> using

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
really and I think the range i'm using

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.840 
really and I think the range i'm using
this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.299> below<00:01:54.689> 100<00:01:55.170> meters<00:01:55.439> i<00:01:55.649> say<00:01:56.579> between

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
this is below 100 meters i say between

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.260 
this is below 100 meters i say between
like<00:01:57.500> 50<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.710> 150<00:01:59.159> meters<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> fairly

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
like 50 to 150 meters is a fairly

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
like 50 to 150 meters is a fairly
effective<00:02:00.719> range<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.350> sniper<00:02:01.770> rifles<00:02:02.189> i

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
effective range for all sniper rifles i

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.639 
effective range for all sniper rifles i

potential<00:03:33.560> especially<00:03:34.560> when<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.709> get<00:03:34.799> a

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
potential especially when you get a

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.530 
potential especially when you get a
motion<00:03:35.129> sensor<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:36.030> place<00:03:36.329> people

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
motion sensor and like a place people

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.509 
motion sensor and like a place people
can<00:03:36.840> spawn<00:03:37.139> if<00:03:37.440> you're<00:03:37.980> not<00:03:38.099> doing<00:03:38.310> anything

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
can spawn if you're not doing anything

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.309 
can spawn if you're not doing anything
really<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.060> you're<00:03:39.209> not<00:03:39.329> playing<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.959> kind<00:03:40.199> of

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
really and you're not playing a kind of
