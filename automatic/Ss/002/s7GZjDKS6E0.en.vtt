I'd assume if you bought this device

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.279 
I'd assume if you bought this device
separately<00:00:21.630> there<00:00:21.779> would<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:21.960> been<00:00:22.020> more

separately there would have been more

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.560 
separately there would have been more

Samsung don't want you to resell this

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.279 
Samsung don't want you to resell this
device<00:00:26.580> since<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.630> free<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.140> the

purchase of the galaxy s6 or galaxy s6
edge<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.210> hence<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> reason<00:00:33.630> why<00:00:33.719> it's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
edge and hence the reason why it's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.709 
edge and hence the reason why it's
unmarked<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.770> yeah<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.730> inside<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> box<00:00:36.510> we

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
unmarked so yeah but inside the box we

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.500 
unmarked so yeah but inside the box we
have<00:00:36.750> three<00:00:37.260> things<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.920> Samsung<00:00:38.879> u.s.<00:00:39.239> wall

wart a micro USB charging cable and then

itself<00:00:45.390> which<00:00:46.079> uses<00:00:46.530> qi<00:00:46.920> wireless<00:00:47.160> charging

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
itself which uses qi wireless charging

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970 
itself which uses qi wireless charging
technology<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.930> looks<00:00:49.110> very<00:00:49.260> much<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
technology it looks very much like a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
technology it looks very much like a
little<00:00:50.280> frisbee<00:00:50.550> disc<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> flying<00:00:51.750> saucer

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
with some clear plastic and then a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
with some clear plastic and then a
rubber<00:00:54.930> ring<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.559> grip<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> device<00:00:56.160> whatever

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
rubber ring to grip the device whatever

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.630 
rubber ring to grip the device whatever
device<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.360> sitting<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.260> top<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:59.399> people

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
device it is sitting on top some people

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.040 
device it is sitting on top some people
think<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> need<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> pad

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
think that all you need is the pad

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
think that all you need is the pad
itself<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.859> charge<00:01:02.250> your<00:01:02.460> device<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
itself to charge your device but you

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
itself to charge your device but you
actually<00:01:03.809> need<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> micro<00:01:04.409> USB<00:01:04.439> charging

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
actually need the micro USB charging

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.789 
actually need the micro USB charging
cable<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.820> plug<00:01:06.090> into<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.540> pad<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.439> it's

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
cable to plug into the pad so it's

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920 
cable to plug into the pad so it's
wireless<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> certain<00:01:08.850> degree<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.330> not

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
wireless to a certain degree but not

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.510 
wireless to a certain degree but not
entirely<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.830> thought<00:01:10.920> I'd<00:01:11.100> mention<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
entirely I just thought I'd mention that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.850 
entirely I just thought I'd mention that
with<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.390> said<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.229> need<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> charge

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
with that said all you do need to charge

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.399 
with that said all you do need to charge
your<00:01:13.979> Galaxy<00:01:14.400> s6<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:15.060> galaxy<00:01:15.509> s6<00:01:15.840> edge<00:01:16.110> or

other qi wireless charging Nabal device

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.410 
other qi wireless charging Nabal device
is<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.710> simply<00:01:20.189> set<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.729> top<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.299> the

is to simply set it on top of the
charging<00:01:21.840> pad<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.350> it'll<00:01:23.070> start<00:01:23.280> charging

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
charging pad and it'll start charging

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.670 
charging pad and it'll start charging
just<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.600> haven't<00:01:25.229> tested<00:01:25.380> this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just like that I haven't tested this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
just like that I haven't tested this
with<00:01:25.860> any<00:01:26.009> other<00:01:26.100> device<00:01:26.340> besides<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> galaxy

s6<00:01:27.900> edge<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.549> does<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> great

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
s6 edge but it really does do a great

s6 edge but it really does do a great
job<00:01:30.420> charging<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> Galaxy<00:01:31.680> s6<00:01:32.070> edge<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:33.060> know

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
job charging the Galaxy s6 edge you know

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.760 
job charging the Galaxy s6 edge you know
as<00:01:33.299> long<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.720> place<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> middle<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the charger otherwise it just won't

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
the charger otherwise it just won't
really<00:01:36.509> charge<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
really charge as you can see here it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.359 
really charge as you can see here it
needs<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:39.060> generally<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> middle<00:01:40.650> but

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
needs to be generally in the middle but

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
needs to be generally in the middle but
you<00:01:41.400> don't<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.939> super<00:01:42.329> precise<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you don't have to be super precise and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
you don't have to be super precise and
it<00:01:43.229> will<00:01:43.380> even<00:01:43.590> let<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it will even let you know if you have it

that really bothers me I mean I maybe
would<00:02:40.150> have<00:02:40.239> added<00:02:40.420> some<00:02:40.720> additional<00:02:41.140> weight

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
would have added some additional weight

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.410 
would have added some additional weight
to<00:02:41.409> make<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.159> sit<00:02:42.370> more<00:02:42.519> firmly<00:02:42.849> on<00:02:43.060> my<00:02:43.150> desk

to make it sit more firmly on my desk
but<00:02:43.900> that's<00:02:44.140> not<00:02:44.349> really<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> big<00:02:44.829> issue<00:02:44.860> at<00:02:45.250> all

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
but that's not really a big issue at all

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.190 
but that's not really a big issue at all
I<00:02:45.700> mean<00:02:46.000> whether<00:02:46.359> or<00:02:46.540> not<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.720> can<00:02:46.840> recommend
