00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
this case just like that without this

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.859 
this case just like that without this
bumper<00:01:34.170> part<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.040> does<00:01:35.159> come<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.869> still

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
bumper part that does come with it still

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.510 
bumper part that does come with it still
comes<00:01:37.079> fully<00:01:37.409> around<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> edges<00:01:37.890> has<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
comes fully around the edges has this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.749 
comes fully around the edges has this
bezel<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> raised<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> if

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
bezel it's going to have it raised so if

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.280 
bezel it's going to have it raised so if
you<00:01:41.850> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> use<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.049> it's

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you want to use it just like that it's

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.450 
you want to use it just like that it's
going<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> give<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.799> plenty<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> protection

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
going to give you a plenty of protection

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.210 
going to give you a plenty of protection
I<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.689> probably<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.409> use<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.920> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
I would probably just use it like that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.690 
I would probably just use it like that
but<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.600> extra<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.320> bumper<00:01:49.950> does<00:01:50.520> add

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
but this extra little bumper does add

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.289 
but this extra little bumper does add
some<00:01:50.939> extra<00:01:51.299> color<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:53.119> make<00:01:54.119> sure

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
some extra color to it and make sure
