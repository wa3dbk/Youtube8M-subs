hey<00:00:01.290> guys<00:00:01.760> so<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:02.790> recently<00:00:03.030> found<00:00:03.389> out<00:00:03.659> that<00:00:03.990> if

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
hey guys so I recently found out that if

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.249 
hey guys so I recently found out that if
you<00:00:05.100> were<00:00:05.339> playing<00:00:05.549> Minecraft<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.569> set

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
you were playing Minecraft and you set

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.919 
you were playing Minecraft and you set
your<00:00:07.440> clock<00:00:08.099> time<00:00:08.340> ahead<00:00:08.580> like<00:00:09.360> two<00:00:09.599> years<00:00:09.780> and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
your clock time ahead like two years and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
your clock time ahead like two years and
start<00:00:10.349> shooting<00:00:10.769> all<00:00:10.980> over<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.250> place<00:00:11.490> and

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
start shooting all over the place and

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.900 
start shooting all over the place and
it's<00:00:12.570> speeding<00:00:12.840> around<00:00:13.400> it's<00:00:14.400> basically<00:00:14.730> what

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it's speeding around it's basically what

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.330 
it's speeding around it's basically what
I<00:00:14.940> did<00:00:15.030> was<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.660> made<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.049> little<00:00:16.199> program<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
I did was I made a little program a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.660 
I did was I made a little program a
little<00:00:18.300> utility<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.310> constantly<00:00:20.310> updates

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
little utility that constantly updates

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.779 
little utility that constantly updates
the<00:00:20.939> system<00:00:21.570> clock<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.930> fast<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.350> want<00:00:22.789> so

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the system clock as fast as you want so

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.370 
the system clock as fast as you want so
i<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:24.000> running<00:00:24.119> right<00:00:24.359> now<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.140> just

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
i got running right now right now just

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.269 
i got running right now right now just
set<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> 1<00:00:25.830> times<00:00:27.199> give<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> second<00:00:28.710> I'll

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.299 

slow<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.309> down<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.579> bit

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
slow it down a bit

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.430 
slow it down a bit
it'll<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.460> second<00:00:35.790> letter<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.260> update<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it'll take a second letter to update and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.460 
it'll take a second letter to update and
start<00:00:37.620> slowing<00:00:37.860> down<00:00:38.690> right<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> did<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
start slowing down right now I did was I

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.470 
start slowing down right now I did was I
set<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.720> point<00:00:42.720> 1<00:00:42.989> times<00:00:43.970> so<00:00:44.970> it<00:00:45.270> should

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
set it to a point 1 times so it should

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360 
set it to a point 1 times so it should
start<00:00:45.660> slowing<00:00:45.960> down<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:47.160> really

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
start slowing down and going really

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.110 
start slowing down and going really
slowly<00:00:48.620> as<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.400> I<00:00:52.879> just<00:00:53.879> proved

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
slowly as you can see here I just proved

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.340 
slowly as you can see here I just proved
I<00:00:54.180> didn't<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.510> saw<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:54.839> video<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.140> can

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
I didn't just saw on the video I can

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.970 
I didn't just saw on the video I can
still<00:00:57.320> move<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.500> mouse<00:00:58.710> full<00:00:59.129> speed<00:01:00.920> do<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
still move my mouse full speed do a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
still move my mouse full speed do a
controlled<00:01:02.339> 364<00:01:03.089> at<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.269> ground<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:03.720> would

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
controlled 364 at the ground which would

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.179 
controlled 364 at the ground which would
probably<00:01:04.320> pretty<00:01:04.800> hard<00:01:05.009> and<00:01:05.129> opened

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
probably pretty hard and opened

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.730 
probably pretty hard and opened
so<00:01:08.299> yeah<00:01:09.469> here<00:01:10.469> it<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:10.860> slow

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
so yeah here it is going really slow

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.700 
so yeah here it is going really slow
next<00:01:13.740> I'll<00:01:15.409> set<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.439> real<00:01:16.679> fast<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.340> try<00:01:17.579> a

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
next I'll set it real fast let's try a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.380 
next I'll set it real fast let's try a
three-times<00:01:19.710> speed<00:01:22.189> no<00:01:23.189> gettin<00:01:23.939> leg<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.240> know

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
three-times speed no gettin leg you know

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.069 
three-times speed no gettin leg you know
I<00:01:24.659> don't<00:01:24.899> think<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.229> likes<00:01:25.319> the<00:01:25.619> craps<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
I don't think it likes the craps and the

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.709 
I don't think it likes the craps and the
speed<00:01:28.079> hack<00:01:28.289> but<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:29.069> we<00:01:29.219> go<00:01:30.200> really<00:01:31.200> fast

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
speed hack but here we go really fast

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.709 
speed hack but here we go really fast
she's<00:01:33.719> really<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.770> anything<00:01:34.950> because

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
she's really see anything because

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.209 
she's really see anything because
perhaps<00:01:36.719> plus<00:01:37.259> trying<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.710> run<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.069> game

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
perhaps plus trying to run the game

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.570 
perhaps plus trying to run the game
three<00:01:38.459> times<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.819> fast<00:01:38.849> does<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:40.399> help<00:01:41.399> my

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
three times as fast does not help my

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.449 
three times as fast does not help my
computer<00:01:42.740> see<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.770> two<00:01:43.979> times<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.399> any<00:01:44.549> better

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
computer see if two times is any better

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.389 
computer see if two times is any better
that's<00:01:47.459> about<00:01:47.670> soon<00:01:48.770> but<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.220> see

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that's about soon but as you can see

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.990 
that's about soon but as you can see
obviously<00:01:50.849> I'm<00:01:51.709> going<00:01:52.709> pretty<00:01:52.920> damn<00:01:53.069> fast<00:01:56.000> set

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
obviously I'm going pretty damn fast set

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.990 
obviously I'm going pretty damn fast set
it<00:01:57.119> back

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.969 

and<00:02:02.540> we're<00:02:02.720> back<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.760> one<00:02:04.760> time<00:02:05.030> speed

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.400 

so<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.690> if<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> want<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.140> include

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so they have it if you want to include

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.370 
so they have it if you want to include
the<00:02:13.680> download<00:02:14.280> link<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> description<00:02:15.380> so

you download it and you know have some

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.290 
you download it and you know have some
fun<00:02:20.790> speed<00:02:21.570> hack<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.870> Minecraft
