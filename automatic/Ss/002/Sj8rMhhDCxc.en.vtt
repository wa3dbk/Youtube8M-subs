 hello guys welcome to the new video 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.319
 unboxing I recently purchased 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.860
 pokémon mystery dungeon the portals 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.950
 on infinity on nintendo 3ds was not 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.970
 in my short term plans but I have 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.039
 found an advantageous offer 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.619
 recently in toys center throughout 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.980
 italy as you well know i don't like doing 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.660
 unboxing boxes to ends in themselves 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.109
 if at least really collectible 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.530
 attacked this obviously does not have it 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.300
 the only reason for boxing and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.780
 video was just to tell you a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.450
 offer that I used the game and pressed 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:49.530
 usually 30,999 euros but from toys 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 center in italy doing so 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 Free 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.149
 the toys card will be enough to leave 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.289
 of your data 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:05.040
 you can get the game for 34 euros and 99 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.840
 this is valid from 17 May until 31 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.430
 until the end of the month 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.490
 so if you are interested in the game e 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.340
 you have not already purchased a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.549
 good thing to keep an eye on this 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.520
 precise moment on amazon is appreciated 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.860
 slightly more at 37 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.720
 so he is even more convinced than amazon 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 probably this will change over the course 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.500
 of the time because amazon always beats 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.290
 all but we see the cover a lot 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.509
