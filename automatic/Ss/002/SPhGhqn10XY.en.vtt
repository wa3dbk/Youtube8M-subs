fuel<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> roaster<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.300> there

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.569 

let's<00:00:55.649> see<00:00:55.890> what's<00:00:56.129> upstairs<00:00:58.219> there's<00:00:59.219> two

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
let's see what's upstairs there's two

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
let's see what's upstairs there's two
levels<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
levels in here that are just like this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
levels in here that are just like this
you<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.579> your<00:01:05.210> spawners<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.049> set<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you have your spawners which are set to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.300 
you have your spawners which are set to
spawn<00:01:07.740> skeletons<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.380> it's<00:01:10.380> hard<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.920> but

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
spawn skeletons and it's hard to see but

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.929 
spawn skeletons and it's hard to see but
over<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.689> there's<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:13.560> opening<00:01:14.430> all<00:01:14.640> these

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
over there there's an opening all these

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.740 
over there there's an opening all these
conveyors<00:01:15.380> will<00:01:16.380> bring<00:01:17.360> skeleton<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
conveyors will bring skeleton to that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.010 
conveyors will bring skeleton to that
opening<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.549> said<00:01:20.729> there's<00:01:20.970> two<00:01:21.630> levels

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
opening and as I said there's two levels

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.420 
opening and as I said there's two levels
of<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.290> cell<00:01:22.530> there's<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> total<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.310> eight

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
of this cell there's a total of eight

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:34.500 
of this cell there's a total of eight
Spooner's<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.909> then<00:01:28.280> down<00:01:29.280> here

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.390 

you<00:01:35.510> have<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:35.690> pulsar<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.920> little<00:01:37.190> bit<00:01:37.280> of

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
you have a pulsar a little bit of

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.469 
you have a pulsar a little bit of
redstone<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.150> where<00:01:41.330> all<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
redstone this is where all the

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.270 
redstone this is where all the
experience<00:01:42.140> points<00:01:42.409> are<00:01:42.860> collected<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:45.280> some

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
experience points are collected and some

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.370 
experience points are collected and some
elevators<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.270> bring<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.690> items<00:01:48.110> up<00:01:48.350> to

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
elevators to bring the items up to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.620 
elevators to bring the items up to
storage<00:01:49.040> chest<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.700> there<00:01:50.060> goes<00:01:50.240> some<00:01:50.450> bone

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
storage chest and there goes some bone

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.460 
storage chest and there goes some bone
meal<00:01:50.869> right<00:01:51.140> now<00:01:51.350> as<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:52.670> can<00:01:52.820> see<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:54.020> splits

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
meal right now as you can see it splits

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.120 
meal right now as you can see it splits
each<00:01:55.460> bone<00:01:56.240> gives<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:56.690> three<00:01:56.960> bone<00:01:57.170> meal<00:01:57.470> and

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
each bone gives you three bone meal and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.040 
each bone gives you three bone meal and
it<00:01:58.220> splits<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.700> up<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.000> sends<00:01:59.270> one<00:01:59.479> into<00:01:59.509> here

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
it splits it up it sends one into here

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.030 
it splits it up it sends one into here
10<00:02:00.470> min<00:02:00.740> here<00:02:01.070> one<00:02:01.460> into<00:02:01.759> here<00:02:02.680> does<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.800> same

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
10 min here one into here does the same

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.859 
10 min here one into here does the same
thing<00:02:04.280> with<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.520> arrow<00:02:04.700> splits<00:02:05.360> them<00:02:05.479> all<00:02:05.660> of

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
thing with the arrow splits them all of

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:14.130 
thing with the arrow splits them all of
them<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.739> then<00:02:10.600> let's<00:02:11.600> go<00:02:11.750> back<00:02:11.959> upstairs

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
them and then let's go back upstairs

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.670 
them and then let's go back upstairs
oops<00:02:15.880> there<00:02:16.880> we<00:02:16.910> go<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:21.019> coming<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
oops there we go you coming to the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.540 
oops there we go you coming to the
killing<00:02:22.280> floor

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.020 

the<00:02:32.260> skeletons<00:02:33.260> dropped<00:02:33.620> down<00:02:33.920> onto<00:02:34.370> this

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
the skeletons dropped down onto this

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.110 
the skeletons dropped down onto this
conveyor<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.099> then<00:02:37.099> they're<00:02:37.250> stopped<00:02:37.610> by<00:02:38.090> a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
conveyor and then they're stopped by a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.289 
conveyor and then they're stopped by a
glass<00:02:38.870> block<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:39.620> kind<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.549> hard<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:41.060> but

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
glass block it's kind of hard to see but

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.059 
glass block it's kind of hard to see but
it's<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:42.560> there<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.690> as<00:02:44.690> they<00:02:45.560> collect<00:02:45.890> in

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
it's right there and as they collect in

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.869 
it's right there and as they collect in
here<00:02:46.340> every<00:02:46.849> 15<00:02:47.720> seconds<00:02:48.200> or<00:02:48.349> so<00:02:48.610> this<00:02:49.610> laser

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
here every 15 seconds or so this laser

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:57.360 
here every 15 seconds or so this laser
will<00:02:50.239> fire<00:02:52.390> there's<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.660> couple<00:02:55.329> there<00:02:56.329> they<00:02:56.450> go

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
will fire there's a couple there they go

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.229 
will fire there's a couple there they go
the<00:02:58.870> glowing<00:03:00.010> experience<00:03:01.010> orbs<00:03:01.400> off<00:03:01.579> be

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.990 
the glowing experience orbs off be
diverted<00:03:02.569> down<00:03:02.930> here<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:04.280> arrows<00:03:04.579> and<00:03:04.760> bones

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
diverted down here the arrows and bones

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.610 
diverted down here the arrows and bones
go<00:03:05.360> this<00:03:05.569> way<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.170> then<00:03:06.379> there's<00:03:06.560> another

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
go this way and then there's another

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.130 
go this way and then there's another
diverter<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.670> puts<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.000> arrows<00:03:08.329> down<00:03:08.629> here

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
diverter that puts the arrows down here

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.349 
diverter that puts the arrows down here
and<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:10.250> bones<00:03:10.489> come<00:03:10.790> around<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.480> there's<00:03:11.780> a

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
and the bones come around and there's a

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.119 
and the bones come around and there's a
flip<00:03:14.359> there's<00:03:15.349> a<00:03:15.440> couple<00:03:15.590> right<00:03:15.920> there

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
flip there's a couple right there

flip there's a couple right there
they're<00:03:16.400> going<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.609> get<00:03:16.700> zapped<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.859> like<00:03:18.859> this

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
they're going to get zapped I like this

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.789 
they're going to get zapped I like this
because<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.489> watch<00:03:19.700> them<00:03:19.910> die<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.769> call<00:03:21.769> it

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
because you can watch them die I call it

because you can watch them die I call it
The<00:03:21.950> Killing<00:03:22.250> Floor<00:03:23.950> fire<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:30.260> bones<00:03:30.500> get

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
The Killing Floor fire the bones get

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.890 
The Killing Floor fire the bones get
processed<00:03:31.430> in<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.670> bone<00:03:31.970> meal<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.569> come

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
processed in the bone meal and come

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.319 
processed in the bone meal and come
around<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.319> drop<00:03:33.560> down<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.160> then<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.150> bone

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
around and drop down and then the bone

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.759 
around and drop down and then the bone
meal<00:03:35.540> comes<00:03:35.840> up<00:03:36.049> into<00:03:36.349> here<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:38.889> split<00:03:39.889> evenly

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
meal comes up into here and split evenly

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.379 
meal comes up into here and split evenly
and<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.730> arrows<00:03:44.090> into<00:03:44.930> here<00:03:45.819> which<00:03:46.819> are<00:03:47.000> split

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
and the arrows into here which are split

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.130 
and the arrows into here which are split
somewhat<00:03:48.230> evenly

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.770 

every<00:03:52.980> now<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.370> then<00:03:53.520> an<00:03:53.670> orb<00:03:53.880> gets<00:03:54.180> by<00:03:54.420> I

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
every now and then an orb gets by I

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:03.199 
every now and then an orb gets by I
don't<00:03:55.470> know<00:03:55.590> why<00:03:55.800> but<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:56.760> does<00:04:01.640> but<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.940> is

hear that will drop off fuel for the
roaster<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.870> need<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.169> roaster<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.650> fire<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
roaster you need the roaster to fire the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.900 
roaster you need the roaster to fire the
laser<00:04:33.230> but<00:04:34.230> I<00:04:34.320> was<00:04:34.500> also<00:04:34.710> thinking<00:04:34.890> about<00:04:35.520> you

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
out you can put this switch and you get

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:31.670 
out you can put this switch and you get
lights

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.920 

what<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.310> plan<00:05:32.610> on<00:05:32.639> doing<00:05:32.850> is<00:05:33.300> removing<00:05:33.509> that

what I plan on doing is removing that

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.510 
what I plan on doing is removing that
switch<00:05:34.289> and<00:05:34.560> hooking<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:35.009> up<00:05:35.160> to<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.490> light

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
switch and hooking it up to the light

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.090 
switch and hooking it up to the light
sensor<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.990> way<00:05:37.169> as<00:05:37.229> soon<00:05:37.440> as<00:05:37.590> you<00:05:37.650> get<00:05:37.770> dark

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
sensor that way as soon as you get dark

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.600 
sensor that way as soon as you get dark
the<00:05:38.370> light<00:05:38.580> will<00:05:38.729> go<00:05:38.850> on<00:05:38.880> automatically<00:05:41.600> but

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
the light will go on automatically but

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.980 
the light will go on automatically but
that's<00:05:44.610> basically<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:46.970> one<00:05:47.970> bone<00:05:48.720> meal

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
that's basically it one bone meal

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:56.060 
that's basically it one bone meal
factory<00:05:50.630> hope<00:05:51.630> you<00:05:51.780> liked<00:05:51.960> it<00:05:53.060> later
