00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.660 

okay<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.289> this<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.740> how<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> hair<00:01:41.189> looks<00:01:41.460> when

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
okay so this is how the hair looks when

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.580 
okay so this is how the hair looks when
it<00:01:41.789> is<00:01:41.909> time<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.479> washed<00:01:42.720> as<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.409> see

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it is time to be washed as you can see

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.029 
it is time to be washed as you can see
it's<00:01:44.070> poofy<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.899> curls<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.649> defined

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
it's poofy and the curls are not defined

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.630 
it's poofy and the curls are not defined
so<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:48.179> I<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.810> spray<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.009> spray

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so what I do is I spray it with a spray

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.389 
so what I do is I spray it with a spray
bottle<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.659> water<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.159> just

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
spritz it down to make it easier for me

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.289 
spritz it down to make it easier for me
to<00:01:56.780> detangle<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.049> before<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.470> actually<00:01:59.119> wet<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
