really just about knowing your body and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.719 
really just about knowing your body and
how<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:52.939> reacts<00:01:53.420> when<00:01:53.990> you're<00:01:54.470> traveling

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.240 

all<00:02:01.240> right<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:01.719> when<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.140> get<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.350> security<00:02:03.009> it

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.550 
all right so when you get to security it
can<00:02:03.399> be<00:02:03.549> really<00:02:03.880> overwhelming<00:02:03.909> especially<00:02:04.780> if

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
can be really overwhelming especially if

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.350 
can be really overwhelming especially if
you<00:02:05.799> don't<00:02:05.920> travel<00:02:06.340> all<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.850> time<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.299> you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
you don't travel all the time and you

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.910 
you don't travel all the time and you
feel<00:02:07.539> like<00:02:07.570> other<00:02:07.930> people<00:02:08.019> around<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.800> have

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
feel like other people around you have

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.770 
feel like other people around you have
done<00:02:09.099> this<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.310> million<00:02:09.640> times<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.390> they're

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
the plane so when I'm at the gate and I

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.770 
the plane so when I'm at the gate and I
do<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:41.220> access<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.700> Internet<00:02:42.240> I'll<00:02:42.420> try<00:02:42.720> to

plane anything else that happens is just

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.750 
plane anything else that happens is just
kind<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.740> bonus

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
will take deep breaths close my eyes and

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.539 
will take deep breaths close my eyes and
just<00:03:07.940> think<00:03:08.030> about<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:09.170> end<00:03:09.440> result<00:03:09.799> where

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
just think about the end result where

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.000 
just think about the end result where
I'm<00:03:10.700> going<00:03:11.299> what<00:03:11.780> I'm<00:03:11.930> gonna<00:03:12.080> be<00:03:12.349> doing<00:03:12.830> when

okay this is totally normal there are

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.809 
okay this is totally normal there are
thousands<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.560> other<00:03:18.799> flights<00:03:19.190> happening

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
thousands of other flights happening

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.729 
thousands of other flights happening
right<00:03:20.090> now<00:03:20.150> at<00:03:20.569> this<00:03:20.750> moment<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.379> other

one of my biggest fears was oh my gosh
if<00:03:43.300> this<00:03:43.510> plane<00:03:43.840> goes<00:03:43.870> down<00:03:44.350> I'm<00:03:44.950> gonna<00:03:45.100> be

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
if this plane goes down I'm gonna be

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.160 
if this plane goes down I'm gonna be
leaving<00:03:45.610> behind<00:03:45.940> all<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.630> people<00:03:46.960> that<00:03:47.140> I

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.500 
love I'm not ready to die yet and it was
really<00:03:50.110> about<00:03:50.230> shifting<00:03:50.950> my<00:03:51.340> mindset<00:03:51.940> it's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
really about shifting my mindset it's

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.360 
really about shifting my mindset it's
about<00:03:52.690> being<00:03:52.990> grateful<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.770> appreciative

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
about being grateful and appreciative

for<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.910> life<00:03:55.210> that<00:03:55.420> I've<00:03:55.570> lived<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.290> far

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.420 

so<00:04:07.050> one<00:04:07.230> thing<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.470> really<00:04:07.980> used<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.220> freak

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
so one thing that really used to freak

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.860 
so one thing that really used to freak
me<00:04:08.580> out

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
me out

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
me out
turbulence<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.200> thing<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.560> worked

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
turbulence and the thing that worked

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.070 
turbulence and the thing that worked
best<00:04:11.130> for<00:04:11.250> me<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:11.790> was<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.090> educating

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
best for me here was just educating

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.600 
best for me here was just educating
myself<00:04:13.500> instead<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.100> hearing<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.490> from

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
myself instead of just hearing it from

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.770 
myself instead of just hearing it from
somebody<00:04:15.000> else<00:04:15.060> like<00:04:15.300> yeah<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.660> totally
