 recommending the plate they only

 mention an excessive noise in the

 one parent used a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 3d printer and built a prosthesis 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 for his son, a court was born 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.750
 without fingers in one hand 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.729

 interview that the best part of having a

 hand is to be a cyborg more 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.700
 curious is that a mechanic can cost 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.270
 up to $ 30,000 and that made with 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.340
 printer is between $ 5 and $ 10 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.590
 the parent can make some changes in the

 project so that future prostheses 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.329

 Apple can adopt such technology. 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.290
 type in a smartwater future do you think 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.909
