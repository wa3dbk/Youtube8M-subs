00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.630
 so hard to be yourself 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.640
 stitches and white lost but lasts 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.920
 same ecstasy when in the heart 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.840
 how much did it burn out from the edge 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.599
 lost version 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.910
 this is my last fight here is meat and blood 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.149
 fleece from Tobolsk will not now 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:39.520
 the length of the wood at the turn I trigger on the platoon and 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.250
 claws from coleman grade 9 row 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.860
 not the concept of time as Tim changed 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.960
 as if the heartache prevented us 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.750
 cool down and we lit the master 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.060
 the sidewalk in the abyss identifying themselves in 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.410
 did not ask for a simple zone 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.629
 ask for forgiveness 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.000
 now I define love as one of the best 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.400
 men just didn't want just not 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.040
 did it happen as if ill in the mountains 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.979
 as if bones our cane broke not 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.250
 climbing and left us without reaching 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.040
 scheisse built so long 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.680
 into the future and our relationship tower piles 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.020
 stones and love there is no i never lose 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.690
 believes in the realm who knows whether pain is somewhere 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.229
 It is not lost, and it was like flying 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.500
