00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hey people want comes my first 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.109
 tutorial here on this channel video 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.010
 I show you just like her 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.080
 a dcps can in this case the fx 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.190
 processor 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.300
 It is also a requirement that you have the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.890
 black edition have it very easy 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.519
 Overclocks are thanks to the freely selectable 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.990
 multiplier if you like if you 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.699
 not the black edition have it then 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.080
 a bit more difficult and then you have to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.030
 also know what because Beier to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.380
 unscrew or screw around 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.360
 But then you best just different 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.420
 so first you invite two of you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.239
 programs down amd overdrive and cpu 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
 z at the programs for free and the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.530
 first you open all the overdrive 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.660
 then here comes this left here 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.430
 Warning has succeeded if you are 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.289
 here on ok confirm that yours 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.079
 Manufacturer warranty everything as soon as the on 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.079
 Okay, that's just what happened 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.979
 if it not worth the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.140
 manufacturer's warranty is as I then 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.240
 Can you do that when you do that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.110
 want to start over program has gone 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.689
 first on clock rate and then tension 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.970
 do you go here on turbo core control 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.930
 and up here then hung the hook 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.580
 activated turbo core best 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.229
 Number of posted core business 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.630
 service I actually have six cores 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.100
 but we can only be so blown 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.600
 then you could theoretically here 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.600
 play around with this regulator with me 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.430
 I'm here for 20 until he becomes you 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.130
 probably do not shut up let's say 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 you have eight ten or twenty then 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.060
 Please I guess you just go 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.820
 here at zero power level 0 and then 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.649
 I would say you can take two steps 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.280
 So higher are two multipliers 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.040
 So now if I have 18 times 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.780
 For example, I put on 20 there goes 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.670
 namely my clock rate from 3.3 ghz to 4 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.610
 ghz maximum here on normal ok 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.409
 back to ok for confirm 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.360
 and best to take on down 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.940
 I have not after again 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.940
 saved that is 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.390
 take over again 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.400
 then ok and ok now starts 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.300
 you in the west cpu-z I still have it 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.740
 not even open so starts 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.650
 then takes a very short time to load it there 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.510
 By the way, gpu-z you know your what 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.870
 your graphics card packs you want as synonymous 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.020
 look up so and and multiplayer stands 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.950
 here also 720 that means yours 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.650
 multiplier that actually works too 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.000
 higher here you will see the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.190
 momentary now was just fell 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.950
 now like now four again this 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.500
 gate 4 ghz goes though he default 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.960
 now we have 33 of course we can 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.280
 again one on three start 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.930
 it may be that my vote now 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.730
 By the way, very and in sync, there I am 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.980
 believe that fraps not everything right now 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.510
 at least takes the administrator 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:14.489
 area well but he then goes times 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:17.190
 you can do stability test or go 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.170
 the then click Select all imagine 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.620
 this time to a minute and does 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.810
 then start can cause your 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.320
 system gets stuck that remains for him 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.350
 then if you hang your cpu then 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.420
 had too high clocked hat 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.180
 I would recommend you two steps 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.700
 from 18 for example to 20 if you 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.660
 Now you have a good fan 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.470
 water cooling or a suction 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.260
 fan then I can you can 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.420
 I recommend you 25 steps or three 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.630
 to go four steps higher 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.820
 So then from 18 to 22, for example 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.140
 but it will work on my pc, too 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.110
 probably when playing one would 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.530
 processes begin to melt 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.190
 therefore it is I seem quite 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.709
 optimal 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.720
 Well, right now, everything is fine 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:12.660
 everything is active in the green area 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.010
 means yes it fits so no problems so 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.450
 I could actually gamble for now 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.639
 example battlefield much we much 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.669
 a lot of fun 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.259
 and yes if i ask you if i either 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.520
 new tutorial do something else themselves 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:29.650
 I propose the blow with the btv 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:34.400
 always very much contrary to stability test 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:38.150
 relatively inactive looks relatively good 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.800
 said yes from the result na honest 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.659
 that she shit but that is 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.729
 but because the pastor is shit 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.800
 well then i hope it has you 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.620
 fallen something helped what the 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.819
 thumb up there if you liked it 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.550
 and yes I know and until the next 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:55.569
 times a game power your team of gameboy 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.569
 you better click
