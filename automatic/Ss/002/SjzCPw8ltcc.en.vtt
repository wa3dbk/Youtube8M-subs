00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.299 

with<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.179> me<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.230> taken<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> great<00:00:46.890> step

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
with just me we have taken a great step

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
with just me we have taken a great step
forward<00:00:47.609> we<00:00:48.449> have<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:48.930> understood<00:00:49.050> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
forward we have really understood that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.560 
forward we have really understood that
we<00:00:49.800> know<00:00:49.980> almost<00:00:50.190> nothing<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:51.149> water

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
we know almost nothing about water

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.020 
we know almost nothing about water
therefore<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> great<00:00:53.219> step<00:00:53.640> because

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
therefore it is a great step because

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
therefore it is a great step because
this<00:00:54.269> realization<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.589> followed<00:00:56.129> by<00:00:56.159> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this realization is followed by the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.029 
this realization is followed by the
