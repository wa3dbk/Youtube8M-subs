looking things even the mirrors
everything<00:00:08.389> plays<00:00:08.630> a<00:00:08.660> part<00:00:09.019> in<00:00:09.110> aerodynamics

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:09.890 
everything plays a part in aerodynamics

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.250 
everything plays a part in aerodynamics
what<00:00:10.670> aerodynamics<00:00:11.330> this<00:00:11.510> is<00:00:11.840> it's<00:00:12.110> a

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
what aerodynamics this is it's a

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.870 
what aerodynamics this is it's a
question<00:00:13.010> to<00:00:13.100> make<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:13.400> part<00:00:13.640> that<00:00:13.790> goes

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
question to make the part that goes

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.720 
question to make the part that goes
through<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:14.269> air<00:00:14.480> as<00:00:15.380> quick<00:00:15.680> as<00:00:15.800> it<00:00:15.920> can<00:00:16.129> but

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
through the air as quick as it can but

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.609 
through the air as quick as it can but
the<00:00:17.029> airs<00:00:17.210> it<00:00:17.390> does<00:00:17.630> run<00:00:17.869> over<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.230> car<00:00:18.439> we

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
the airs it does run over the car we

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.460 
the airs it does run over the car we
wanted<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:18.919> make<00:00:19.130> grit<00:00:19.460> we<00:00:19.699> wanted<00:00:19.970> to<00:00:19.999> create

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
wanted to make grit we wanted to create

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.870 
wanted to make grit we wanted to create
an<00:00:21.470> opportunity<00:00:21.650> for<00:00:22.130> us<00:00:22.339> drivers<00:00:22.640> to<00:00:22.849> take

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
an opportunity for us drivers to take

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.110 
an opportunity for us drivers to take
the<00:00:23.179> car<00:00:23.359> that<00:00:23.539> much<00:00:23.720> faster

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
the car that much faster

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.630 
the car that much faster
so<00:00:25.570> basically<00:00:26.050> you<00:00:26.560> felt<00:00:26.890> some<00:00:27.130> cars<00:00:27.400> with<00:00:27.550> you

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
so basically you felt some cars with you

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.910 
so basically you felt some cars with you
drive<00:00:27.850> their<00:00:28.090> high<00:00:28.420> and<00:00:28.810> heavy<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.560> you<00:00:29.740> go<00:00:29.890> on

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
drive their high and heavy and you go on

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.710 
drive their high and heavy and you go on
an<00:00:30.220> on<00:00:30.340> ramp<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:30.820> you<00:00:31.180> hear<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.360> tires

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
an on ramp and you hear the tires

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.800 
an on ramp and you hear the tires
squealing<00:00:32.350> hopefully<00:00:32.800> not<00:00:32.980> today<00:00:33.310> and<00:00:34.150> you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
squealing hopefully not today and you

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.050 
squealing hopefully not today and you
feel<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.170> car<00:00:35.350> rolling<00:00:35.680> over<00:00:35.980> what<00:00:36.910> we've

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
feel the car rolling over what we've

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.990 
feel the car rolling over what we've
done<00:00:37.240> here<00:00:37.300> is<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:38.010> exact<00:00:39.010> opposite<00:00:39.640> we<00:00:39.820> want

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
done here is the exact opposite we want

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.030 
done here is the exact opposite we want
the<00:00:40.090> car<00:00:40.300> as<00:00:40.420> low<00:00:40.660> as<00:00:40.840> we<00:00:41.020> can<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.500> least

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
the car as low as we can to the least

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.850 
the car as low as we can to the least
amount<00:00:42.310> of<00:00:42.460> center<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:43.180> gravity<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:44.500> lowest

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
amount of center of gravity the lowest

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.240 
amount of center of gravity the lowest
center<00:00:45.040> gravity<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.480> we<00:00:46.780> want<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.020> lightly<00:00:47.350> so

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
center gravity and we want it lightly so

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.330 
center gravity and we want it lightly so
that<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.520> can<00:00:48.670> accelerate<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.510> decelerate

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that it can accelerate and decelerate

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.500 
that it can accelerate and decelerate
everything<00:00:51.340> on<00:00:51.460> this<00:00:51.550> car<00:00:51.610> specific<00:00:52.330> bill

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
everything on this car specific bill

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.200 
everything on this car specific bill
Tracy<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.530> brake<00:00:54.010> pads<00:00:54.280> himself<00:00:54.700> or<00:00:54.880> carbon

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
Tracy the brake pads himself or carbon

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.869 
Tracy the brake pads himself or carbon
fiber<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.620> rotors<00:00:56.950> are<00:00:57.100> carbon<00:00:57.400> fiber<00:00:57.610> so

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
fiber the rotors are carbon fiber so

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.640 
fiber the rotors are carbon fiber so
what<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.059> means<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.510> it's<00:00:58.720> lighter<00:00:58.989> but<00:00:59.530> it

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
what that means is it's lighter but it

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.829 
what that means is it's lighter but it
can<00:00:59.800> resist<00:01:00.129> heat<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.730> you<00:01:01.150> can<00:01:01.330> brake<00:01:01.570> as<00:01:01.780> late

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
can resist heat so you can brake as late

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.770 
can resist heat so you can brake as late
and<00:01:02.440> hard<00:01:02.650> as<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.830> can<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.309> literally<00:01:03.910> this

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
and hard as you can and literally this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.250 
and hard as you can and literally this
part<00:01:05.170> will<00:01:05.379> pelletier<00:01:06.010> out<00:01:06.190> of<00:01:06.340> my<00:01:06.490> eye<00:01:06.520> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
part will pelletier out of my eye and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.630 
part will pelletier out of my eye and
slap<00:01:08.260> it<00:01:08.290> on<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.830> shield<00:01:09.070> in<00:01:09.250> front<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.550> me

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
slap it on to the shield in front of me

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.310 
slap it on to the shield in front of me
that's<00:01:09.820> how<00:01:09.970> much<00:01:10.120> g-force<00:01:10.420> there<00:01:10.870> is<00:01:10.960> just<00:01:11.200> in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
that's how much g-force there is just in

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.220 
that's how much g-force there is just in
stopping<00:01:11.830> ability<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.550> turning<00:01:12.940> ability<00:01:13.230> 4.3

the<00:01:20.590> court<00:01:20.860> that's<00:01:21.820> how<00:01:21.970> much<00:01:22.090> grip<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:22.540> car

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the court that's how much grip this car

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.870 
the court that's how much grip this car
takes<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.409> literally<00:01:23.890> makes<00:01:24.220> your<00:01:24.490> organs

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
takes so it literally makes your organs

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.830

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
hurt after a couple hours in the car but

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.870 
hurt after a couple hours in the car but
look<00:01:29.170> at<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:29.530> mean<00:01:29.650> this<00:01:29.800> is<00:01:29.980> my<00:01:30.130> office<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.640> I

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
look at it I mean this is my office I I

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.000 
look at it I mean this is my office I I

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it's tough you have to treat it with

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.580 
it's tough you have to treat it with
respect<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> level<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.840> hero<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.140> zero<00:01:37.350> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
respect as the level of hero and zero is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.620 
respect as the level of hero and zero is
very<00:01:37.830> close<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.760> say<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.030> line<00:01:39.420> between

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
very close they say that line between

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.380 
very close they say that line between
brave<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> stupid<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.800> very<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.430> very<00:01:42.030> fine
