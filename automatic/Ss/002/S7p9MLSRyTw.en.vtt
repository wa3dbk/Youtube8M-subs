seen so far so I spent a little bit of
time<00:00:31.590> grinding<00:00:32.009> them<00:00:32.189> together<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.640> I'm

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730

going to shoot at every location that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.900 
going to shoot at every location that
has<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:34.950> there's<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> ground<00:00:35.520> back

there<00:00:36.149> there's<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.870> top<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
there there's one up there on top you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.020 
there there's one up there on top you
can<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.920> again<00:00:38.219> yes<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.879> some

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
can see so again yes they can be in some

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.250 
can see so again yes they can be in some
very<00:00:39.180> awkward<00:00:39.629> areas<00:00:39.930> where<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.170> gonna

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
very awkward areas where you're gonna

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
very awkward areas where you're gonna
have<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.500> jump<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:40.980> glide<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.700> few<00:00:42.059> times<00:00:42.270> just

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
have to jump or glide a few times just

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.510 
have to jump or glide a few times just
to<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.710> course<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.340> find

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to get to of course you're going to find

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
to get to of course you're going to find
the<00:00:44.640> potential<00:00:45.030> locations<00:00:45.510> inside<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.930> every

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the potential locations inside of every

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.569 
the potential locations inside of every
one<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.379> these<00:00:46.590> caves<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.160> i<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:47.399> there's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
one of these caves and i think there's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
one of these caves and i think there's
about<00:00:47.670> eight<00:00:48.239> probably<00:00:49.020> roughly<00:00:49.500> around

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
about eight probably roughly around

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.979 
about eight probably roughly around
eight<00:00:49.980> caves<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> system<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.660> could<00:00:51.809> jump

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
eight caves in the system you could jump

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
eight caves in the system you could jump
right<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.199> above<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.739> too<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.160> gonna<00:00:53.280> be

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
right up above here too there's gonna be

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.650 
right up above here too there's gonna be
one<00:00:53.550> that's<00:00:53.730> kind<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.180> plane<00:00:54.420> little

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
one that's kind of on this plane little

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
one that's kind of on this plane little
platform<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.289> i'm<00:00:55.350> sure<00:00:55.590> there's<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.160> two

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
platform and i'm sure there's one or two

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.529 
platform and i'm sure there's one or two
good<00:00:56.460> i've<00:00:56.610> missed<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.120> people<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.449> going

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
good i've missed that people are going

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.299 
good i've missed that people are going
to<00:00:57.629> notice<00:00:57.780> over<00:00:58.140> time<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.829> see<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.160> one

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to notice over time you see that one

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
to notice over time you see that one
right<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.670> there<00:00:59.820> conveniently<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> top

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
right up there conveniently at the top

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.689 
right up there conveniently at the top
of<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.050> cliff<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> one

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
of this cliff right here and and the one

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
of this cliff right here and and the one
thing<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.000> noticed<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:04.080> things

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
thing that I noticed is these things

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.990 
thing that I noticed is these things
seem<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.710> vicinity<00:01:05.309> based<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
seem to be vicinity based the more and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
seem to be vicinity based the more and
more<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.330> started<00:01:06.780> finding<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.320> hunting

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
more that I started finding and hunting

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.710 
more that I started finding and hunting
for<00:01:07.770> these<00:01:07.890> chests<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.640> develop<00:01:09.210> runs<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.659> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
for these chests to develop runs for you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.810 
for these chests to develop runs for you
guys<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.200> started<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.100> realize<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.729> if

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
guys I started to realize that if

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
guys I started to realize that if
there's<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> lot<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.080> know

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
there's one that I see a lot you know

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.480 
there's one that I see a lot you know
four<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.409> five<00:01:13.560> times<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> row<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
four or five times in a row and then I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
four or five times in a row and then I
don't<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.909> again<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.420> another<00:01:15.600> 10<00:01:15.869> or<00:01:15.900> 15

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
don't see it again for another 10 or 15

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
don't see it again for another 10 or 15
minutes<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.950> probably<00:01:17.220> spawned<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> another

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
minutes it's probably spawned in another

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.999 
minutes it's probably spawned in another
location<00:01:18.390> very<00:01:18.990> very<00:01:19.200> close<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.830> one

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
location very very close to that one

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
location very very close to that one
that<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.369> yet<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> discover<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that I have yet to discover so with that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.050 
that I have yet to discover so with that
method<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.799> idea<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.250> started<00:01:23.880> running

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
method with that idea I started running

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.420 
method with that idea I started running
around<00:01:24.509> looking<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.020> these<00:01:25.259> things<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
around looking for these things and you

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.039 
around looking for these things and you
know<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:26.729> similar<00:01:27.119> ones<00:01:27.330> didn't<00:01:27.600> pop<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
know when similar ones didn't pop up I

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.359 
know when similar ones didn't pop up I
know<00:01:28.110> hey<00:01:28.380> there's<00:01:28.650> got<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:28.950> around<00:01:29.100> here

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
know hey there's got to be around here

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.370 
know hey there's got to be around here
somewhere<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.909> another<00:01:30.210> area<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.229> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
somewhere in another area and with that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.200 
somewhere in another area and with that
method<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.950> found<00:01:32.250> lots<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.759> others<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> can

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
method we found lots of others you can

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.609 
method we found lots of others you can
also<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.079> peak<00:01:34.320> there's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
also see one up on that peak there's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
also see one up on that peak there's
about<00:01:34.799> three<00:01:35.070> locations<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.670> top<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
about three locations on top of that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.460 
about three locations on top of that
very<00:01:36.270> large<00:01:36.479> area<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.320> can

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
very large area up there that you can

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.620 
very large area up there that you can
see<00:01:37.710> them<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.090> between<00:01:39.450> this

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
see them there can be one between this

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.960 
see them there can be one between this
little<00:01:39.869> passageway<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.280> you're

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
little passageway right there and you're

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
little passageway right there and you're
just<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> keep<00:01:42.390> moving<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.869> out<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.979> this

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
just going to keep moving on out so this

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.920 
just going to keep moving on out so this
was<00:01:44.369> very<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.700> challenging<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.479> just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
was very very challenging because I just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.359 
was very very challenging because I just
had<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.140> feeling<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.619> my<00:01:46.649> mind<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
had this feeling in my mind you know the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.039 
had this feeling in my mind you know the
Mars<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> earth<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.240> moon<00:01:48.420> run<00:01:48.659> they<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:48.899> had

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
Mars the earth the moon run they all had

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
Mars the earth the moon run they all had
great<00:01:49.259> runs<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.829> know<00:01:49.920> 20<00:01:50.220> potential<00:01:50.610> chest

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
great runs you know 20 potential chest

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.270 
great runs you know 20 potential chest
areas<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.200> had<00:01:52.590> eight<00:01:52.920> caves

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
areas and this one just had eight caves

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
areas and this one just had eight caves
I'm<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.880> there's<00:01:54.030> got<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
I'm like there's got to be more so I

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.359 
I'm like there's got to be more so I
started<00:01:55.140> hunting<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.920> found<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.280> there

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
started hunting and I found that there

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.709 
started hunting and I found that there
could<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.700> up<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.000> behind<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.450> rock

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
could be one up there behind that rock

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539 
could be one up there behind that rock
right<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:58.020> none<00:01:58.649> inside<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.430> right

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
right there none inside here for right

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.280 
right there none inside here for right
now<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.329> again<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> pretty

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
now but again this one is a pretty

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
now but again this one is a pretty
unique<00:02:01.380> method<00:02:02.040> also<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
unique method also just like all the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.459 
unique method also just like all the
other<00:02:03.180> ones<00:02:03.420> there<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.719> lots<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.229> lots<00:02:04.380> of

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
other ones there can be lots and lots of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.810 
other ones there can be lots and lots of
public<00:02:04.770> events<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.369> makes<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.579> one<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
public events but what makes this one a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.980 
public events but what makes this one a
little<00:02:05.969> bit<00:02:06.180> differently<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.869> see

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
little bit differently as you can see

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
little bit differently as you can see
there<00:02:07.170> are<00:02:07.200> large<00:02:07.530> clusters<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.459> creatures<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
there are large clusters of creatures I

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.390 
there are large clusters of creatures I
find<00:02:09.690> myself<00:02:09.869> getting<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.379> couple<00:02:10.739> Ingram's<00:02:11.160> I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
find myself getting a couple Ingram's I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.030 
find myself getting a couple Ingram's I
guess<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> go<00:02:12.150> around<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:12.599> or<00:02:12.629> two

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
guess a go around one or two

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.429 
guess a go around one or two
peugeot<00:02:13.670> around<00:02:14.030> simply<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.260> then

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
peugeot around simply just because then

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.720 
peugeot around simply just because then
not<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.680> mention<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> heavy<00:02:16.189> area<00:02:16.519> for<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
not to mention it's a heavy area for you

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.030 
not to mention it's a heavy area for you
to<00:02:16.819> just<00:02:16.939> find<00:02:17.209> spirit<00:02:17.989> bloom<00:02:18.200> around<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.859> map

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
to just find spirit bloom around the map

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.550 
to just find spirit bloom around the map
itself<00:02:19.459> too<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.420> find<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.049> I'd<00:02:21.260> say<00:02:21.439> in

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
itself too so I find that I'd say in

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.929 
itself too so I find that I'd say in
about<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.799> 10-minute<00:02:22.250> period<00:02:22.370> which<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.670> about

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
about a 10-minute period which is about

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.380 
about a 10-minute period which is about
three<00:02:23.329> runs<00:02:23.659> worth<00:02:24.079> I<00:02:24.439> average<00:02:25.280> about<00:02:25.400> 50<00:02:26.239> or

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
three runs worth I average about 50 or

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.000 
three runs worth I average about 50 or
so<00:02:27.040> i'd<00:02:28.040> say<00:02:28.579> i'd<00:02:28.790> say<00:02:28.939> around<00:02:29.060> 30<00:02:29.689> to<00:02:29.870> 50<00:02:30.290> spear

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
so i'd say i'd say around 30 to 50 spear

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.530 
so i'd say i'd say around 30 to 50 spear
bloom<00:02:31.250> depending<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:31.730> how<00:02:31.909> many<00:02:31.970> chests<00:02:32.450> are

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
bloom depending on how many chests are

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.360 
bloom depending on how many chests are
actually<00:02:32.959> there<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:33.859> is<00:02:33.890> actually<00:02:34.250> an

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
actually there so this is actually an

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.979 
actually there so this is actually an
extremely<00:02:34.760> effective<00:02:35.239> farming<00:02:35.629> method<00:02:35.900> you

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
extremely effective farming method you

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.300 
extremely effective farming method you
could<00:02:36.079> probably<00:02:36.290> build<00:02:36.500> up<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.829> around<00:02:37.069> 100

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
could probably build up to around 100

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.610 
could probably build up to around 100
within<00:02:37.790> 20<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.120> 30<00:02:38.390> minutes<00:02:38.629> just<00:02:39.260> picking

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
within 20 to 30 minutes just picking

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.929 
within 20 to 30 minutes just picking
them<00:02:39.739> up<00:02:39.829> randomly<00:02:40.189> off<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> ground<00:02:40.730> like

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
them up randomly off the ground like

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.300 
them up randomly off the ground like
that<00:02:40.970> or<00:02:41.689> even<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.170> much<00:02:42.349> as<00:02:42.379> just<00:02:42.709> going<00:02:43.189> in

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
that or even so much as just going in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.059 
that or even so much as just going in
here<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.549> getting<00:02:43.670> 122<00:02:44.090> /<00:02:44.299> chest<00:02:44.889> right<00:02:45.889> there

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
here and getting 122 / chest right there

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.399 
here and getting 122 / chest right there
just<00:02:46.250> picked<00:02:46.430> up<00:02:46.519> another<00:02:46.639> one<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:47.689> hopefully

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
just picked up another one so hopefully

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.050 
just picked up another one so hopefully

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
home let's go spelunking and I got

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.559 
home let's go spelunking and I got
fortunate<00:03:10.579> enough<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.819> find<00:03:10.939> that<00:03:11.269> one<00:03:11.329> there

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
fortunate enough to find that one there

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:12.729 
fortunate enough to find that one there
there<00:03:11.720> was<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.079> perfect<00:03:12.379> example<00:03:12.709> of

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
there was one of the perfect example of

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.020 
there was one of the perfect example of
one<00:03:12.859> of<00:03:12.950> those<00:03:13.040> ones<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.519> realized<00:03:13.849> one

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
one of those ones that I realized one

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.339 
one of those ones that I realized one
wasn't<00:03:14.329> spawning<00:03:14.540> up<00:03:14.720> on<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:14.930> Ridge<00:03:15.109> right

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
wasn't spawning up on that Ridge right

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.869 
wasn't spawning up on that Ridge right
above<00:03:15.590> where<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.889> hole<00:03:16.099> is<00:03:16.280> right<00:03:16.430> here<00:03:16.730> it

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
above where this hole is right here it

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.490 
above where this hole is right here it
wasn't<00:03:17.510> seeing<00:03:17.659> anything<00:03:17.930> in<00:03:18.139> those<00:03:18.229> caves

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
wasn't seeing anything in those caves

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.719 
wasn't seeing anything in those caves
and<00:03:18.769> I'm<00:03:18.859> like<00:03:19.010> now<00:03:19.250> there's<00:03:19.489> going<00:03:19.609> to<00:03:19.669> be

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729 
and I'm like now there's going to be

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.569 
and I'm like now there's going to be
another<00:03:19.970> location<00:03:20.359> nearby<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:22.340> I'm<00:03:22.400> gonna<00:03:22.489> go

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.149 
ahead and drop down here there are two
locations<00:03:24.049> that<00:03:24.349> I've<00:03:24.470> seen<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:24.859> far<00:03:24.889> down
