metabolism and I lost 24 pounds and I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.200 
metabolism and I lost 24 pounds and I
got<00:00:31.980> back<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.340> basically<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> weighed<00:00:33.090> in

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
got back to basically what I weighed in

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.260 
got back to basically what I weighed in
high<00:00:33.270> school<00:00:34.309> but<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.370> did<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> different

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
high school but I did it for a different

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
high school but I did it for a different
reason<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.410> mean<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> lose<00:00:38.250> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
reason but I mean I want to lose a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.979 
reason but I mean I want to lose a
little<00:00:38.370> weight<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.090> didn't<00:00:39.600> read<00:00:39.750> reamed

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
little weight but I didn't read reamed

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.720 
little weight but I didn't read reamed
this<00:00:40.140> would<00:00:40.320> happen<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.480> did<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:43.730> after

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
this would happen I did it because after

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.930 
this would happen I did it because after
i<00:00:44.760> had<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.210> stint<00:00:45.629> put<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> i<00:00:46.760> realized<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
i had this stint put in i realized that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.850 
i had this stint put in i realized that
even<00:00:48.420> though<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> happens<00:00:49.230> quite<00:00:49.379> often<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
even though it happens quite often that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.330 
even though it happens quite often that
after<00:00:50.870> he<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.960> bypasses<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.860> lose<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
after he have bypasses you lose the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.650 
after he have bypasses you lose the
veins<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.910> they're<00:00:54.090> thinner<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> weaker

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
veins because they're thinner and weaker

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
veins because they're thinner and weaker
than<00:00:55.079> arteries<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.730> truth<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
than arteries the truth is that it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.900 
than arteries the truth is that it
clogged<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.190> which<00:00:59.190> means<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
clogged up which means that the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.939 
clogged up which means that the
cholesterol<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.570> still<00:01:00.780> calling<00:01:01.260> buildup<00:01:01.739> in

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
cholesterol was still calling buildup in

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.910 
cholesterol was still calling buildup in
my<00:01:02.539> vein<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.899> part<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.229> by<00:01:04.439> pascal

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
my vein that was part of my by pascal

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.940 
my vein that was part of my by pascal
and<00:01:05.479> thank<00:01:06.479> God<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> could<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> stance<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and thank God I could take the stance I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.359 
and thank God I could take the stance I
don't<00:01:08.729> want<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> happen<00:01:09.090> again<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> did<00:01:11.250> all

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
don't want to happen again so I did all

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.100 
don't want to happen again so I did all
this<00:01:11.490> research<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.270> saw<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.540> eighty-two

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
this research and I saw that eighty-two

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.710 
this research and I saw that eighty-two
percent<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> people<00:01:13.799> since<00:01:14.220> 1986<00:01:14.970> who
