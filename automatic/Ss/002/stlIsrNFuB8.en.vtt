Zombie<00:01:05.579> is<00:01:05.700> hunched<00:01:06.180> over<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> bit

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
Zombie is hunched over so it's a bit

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.800 
Zombie is hunched over so it's a bit
difficult<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.070> tell<00:01:08.219> exactly<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.820> scale<00:01:09.540> he

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
difficult to tell exactly how scale he

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.999 
difficult to tell exactly how scale he
is<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.439> these<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.680> 7<00:01:11.219> inch<00:01:11.399> figures<00:01:11.850> um

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
is I think these are 7 inch figures um

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.660 
is I think these are 7 inch figures um
if<00:01:14.009> i<00:01:14.189> take<00:01:14.520> Hellboy<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.100> try<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.490> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
if i take Hellboy and try to kind of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
if i take Hellboy and try to kind of
make<00:01:17.880> him<00:01:18.060> crouched<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.289> just

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
make him crouched down like that just

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.999 
make him crouched down like that just
quickly<00:01:20.539> he<00:01:21.539> doesn't<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.110> quite<00:01:22.590> crouched

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
quickly he doesn't really quite crouched

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.270 
quickly he doesn't really quite crouched
like<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.469> don't<00:01:25.469> know<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:26.009> looks<00:01:26.219> like

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
like that but I don't know it looks like

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
like that but I don't know it looks like
maybe<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.850> he<00:01:27.000> could<00:01:27.270> Crouch<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> way

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
maybe if he could Crouch all the way

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
maybe if he could Crouch all the way
down<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.649> that<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.369> around

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
down like that that they would be around

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.389 
down like that that they would be around
the<00:01:30.030> same<00:01:30.240> size<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:31.289> he's<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> six<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.100> seven

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
the same size so he's a six or seven

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.179 
the same size so he's a six or seven
inch<00:01:32.579> size<00:01:33.119> figure<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
inch size figure or something to that

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.310 
inch size figure or something to that
extent<00:01:35.759> anyway<00:01:36.539> let's<00:01:36.719> get<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> other<00:01:37.140> two

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
on this base does look pretty good it's

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.510 
on this base does look pretty good it's
also<00:05:09.450> really<00:05:09.870> like<00:05:10.380> it's<00:05:10.620> solid<00:05:11.160> it's<00:05:11.280> not

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.260 
base so it's pretty cool I like the way
it<00:05:16.919> looks<00:05:16.950> a<00:05:17.190> lot<00:05:17.310> I'm<00:05:17.910> going<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.120> quickly

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.590 
attach the claws to rob zombie and put
him<00:05:20.220> on<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.310> base<00:05:20.550> just<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.940> show<00:05:21.240> you<00:05:21.270> what<00:05:21.389> it

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
him on the base just to show you what it

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.980 
him on the base just to show you what it
looks<00:05:21.630> like<00:05:21.930> in<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.260> entire<00:05:22.590> effect<00:05:23.720> so<00:05:24.720> yeah

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
looks like in the entire effect so yeah

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.390 
looks like in the entire effect so yeah
all<00:05:25.169> in<00:05:25.320> all<00:05:25.410> he<00:05:25.590> should<00:05:25.770> end<00:05:25.949> up<00:05:26.070> looking

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
all in all he should end up looking

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.950 
all in all he should end up looking
something<00:05:26.669> like<00:05:26.880> this<00:05:27.419> with<00:05:27.630> this<00:05:27.750> clause

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
something like this with this clause

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.320 
something like this with this clause
equipped<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.500> on<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.740> base<00:05:28.949> so<00:05:29.669> it's<00:05:30.150> got<00:05:30.300> a

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
equipped and on the base so it's got a

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.820 
equipped and on the base so it's got a
pretty<00:05:30.570> nice<00:05:30.750> effect<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.289> it<00:05:31.320> I<00:05:31.440> kind<00:05:31.560> of<00:05:31.680> like

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
pretty nice effect to it I kind of like

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.320 
pretty nice effect to it I kind of like
the<00:05:31.919> way<00:05:32.039> it<00:05:32.160> looks<00:05:32.190> just<00:05:32.820> sitting<00:05:33.270> around

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
the way it looks just sitting around
