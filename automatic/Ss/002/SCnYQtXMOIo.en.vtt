baking<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.299> final<00:00:15.900> speculation<00:00:16.529> video<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:17.039> who

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
baking my final speculation video of who

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.790 
baking my final speculation video of who
the<00:00:17.550> Arkham<00:00:17.970> Knight<00:00:18.119> really<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.770> some

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
the Arkham Knight really is in some

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.920 
the Arkham Knight really is in some
other<00:00:20.010> predictions<00:00:20.369> because<00:00:20.670> I've<00:00:21.180> made<00:00:21.900> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
other predictions because I've made a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.990 
other predictions because I've made a
bunch<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.529> video<00:00:23.039> speculating<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.789> who<00:00:23.939> i

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
bunch of video speculating on who i

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.460 
bunch of video speculating on who i
think<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> Arkham<00:00:24.600> Knight<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.320> like

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
think the Arkham Knight is from like

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.580 
think the Arkham Knight is from like
Frank<00:00:25.800> bowls<00:00:26.099> coming<00:00:26.789> back<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.330> James<00:00:28.230> Gordon

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
Frank bowls coming back to James Gordon

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.189 
Frank bowls coming back to James Gordon
jr.<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:30.720> gonna<00:00:30.869> finally

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
jr. and now I'm one of I'm gonna finally

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.799 
jr. and now I'm one of I'm gonna finally
decide<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.800> what<00:00:32.040> I've<00:00:32.160> done<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> ton<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.300> yeah<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
decide on what I've done a ton so yeah I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.650 
decide on what I've done a ton so yeah I
think<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.680> Jeremiah<00:00:35.520> Arkham<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.180> another

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
think it's a Jeremiah Arkham or another

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840 
think it's a Jeremiah Arkham or another
descendant<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.380> Amadeus<00:00:38.070> Arkham<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.610> they

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
descendant of Amadeus Arkham that they

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.000 
descendant of Amadeus Arkham that they
just<00:00:39.090> made<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.870> game<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.320> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
just made up for this game because that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.350 
just made up for this game because that
would<00:00:41.100> make<00:00:41.219> sense<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.640> why<00:00:41.879> he's<00:00:42.059> got<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
would make sense for why he's got the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.910 
would make sense for why he's got the
big<00:00:42.510> arc<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.260> his<00:00:43.379> chest<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.770> why<00:00:43.829> he

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
big arc of a on his chest and why he

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.700 
big arc of a on his chest and why he
goes<00:00:44.070> by<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.280> Arkham<00:00:44.910> Knight<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.710> yeah

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
goes by the Arkham Knight and yeah

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.369 
goes by the Arkham Knight and yeah
because<00:00:47.219> otherwise<00:00:47.850> who<00:00:48.600> else<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:49.079> go<00:00:49.200> with

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
because otherwise who else would go with

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930 
because otherwise who else would go with
the<00:00:49.739> Arkham<00:00:50.129> name<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.640> thinking

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the Arkham name because I was thinking

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.580 
the Arkham name because I was thinking
maybe<00:00:51.059> James<00:00:51.360> Gordon<00:00:51.660> jr.<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.379> one

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
maybe James Gordon jr. because that one

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.560 
maybe James Gordon jr. because that one
quote<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.980> Facebook<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:54.059> put<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.390> where

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
quote on Facebook that they put up where

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.990 
quote on Facebook that they put up where
it<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.899> old<00:00:55.230> man<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.610> who's

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
it was like old man is I was like who's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.520 
it was like old man is I was like who's
young<00:00:57.300> enough<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> call<00:00:57.809> him<00:00:57.899> old<00:00:58.020> man<00:00:58.260> because

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
young enough to call him old man because

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.340 
young enough to call him old man because
Jeremiah<00:00:58.920> Arkham<00:00:59.309> isn't<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.050> James<00:01:01.050> Gordon

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
Jeremiah Arkham isn't and James Gordon

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.170 
Jeremiah Arkham isn't and James Gordon
jr.<00:01:01.500> could<00:01:01.890> also<00:01:02.129> James<00:01:02.430> Gordon<00:01:02.699> jr.<00:01:02.789> doesn't

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
jr. could also James Gordon jr. doesn't

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
jr. could also James Gordon jr. doesn't
have<00:01:03.359> an<00:01:03.449> alias<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.350> he<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:04.830> by<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
have an alias so he could go by the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.649 
have an alias so he could go by the
Arkham<00:01:05.400> Knight<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.670> where<00:01:05.820> Jeremiah<00:01:06.180> Arkham

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Arkham Knight to where Jeremiah Arkham

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.310 
Arkham Knight to where Jeremiah Arkham
was<00:01:06.900> black<00:01:07.320> mask<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.920> one<00:01:08.040> point<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> yeah<00:01:10.020> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
was black mask at one point so yeah I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.950 
was black mask at one point so yeah I
think<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.220> probably<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.659> new

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
think it's probably just a new

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
think it's probably just a new
descendant<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.040> amadeus<00:01:14.640> Arkham<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.330> what

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
descendant of amadeus Arkham that's what

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.630 
descendant of amadeus Arkham that's what
I'm<00:01:15.540> thinking<00:01:15.920> because<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.070> way<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.460> means

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
I'm thinking because that way that means

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.340 
I'm thinking because that way that means
they<00:01:17.820> made<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> new<00:01:18.360> character<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> would

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
they made a new character and it would

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.539 
they made a new character and it would
make<00:01:19.500> sense<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> whole<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.250> complete

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
make sense for the whole are complete

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
make sense for the whole are complete
now<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:22.140> his<00:01:22.320> army<00:01:22.710> I'm

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
now as to how he got his army I'm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.320 
now as to how he got his army I'm
thinking<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.700> might<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.970> League<00:01:24.180> of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
thinking that might be League of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810 
thinking that might be League of
Assassins<00:01:25.049> cuz<00:01:25.470> i<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:25.950> thinkin<00:01:26.250> race<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
Assassins cuz i was thinkin race has to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.310 
Assassins cuz i was thinkin race has to
have<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.119> big<00:01:27.299> part<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.689> game<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
have a big part in this game because of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.190 
have a big part in this game because of
Arkham<00:01:28.860> City<00:01:29.070> he<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> big<00:01:30.900> part<00:01:31.170> in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
Arkham City he has to have a big part in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
Arkham City he has to have a big part in
this<00:01:31.320> game<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:32.310> happened<00:01:32.610> Arkham

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this game because what happened Arkham

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.010 
this game because what happened Arkham
City<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.299> think<00:01:33.420> he's<00:01:33.540> gonna<00:01:33.600> let<00:01:33.840> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
City I don't think he's gonna let that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.890 
City I don't think he's gonna let that
go<00:01:34.079> what's<00:01:34.920> he<00:01:35.189> gonna<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.119> no<00:01:36.390> clue<00:01:36.600> but

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
go what's he gonna do I have no clue but

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.450 
go what's he gonna do I have no clue but
I<00:01:36.960> think<00:01:37.290> he's<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.710> who's<00:01:37.950> supplying<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I think he's the one who's supplying the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
I think he's the one who's supplying the
army<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:38.880> otherwise<00:01:39.240> house<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.049> Ark<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
army because otherwise house the Ark of

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
army because otherwise house the Ark of
night<00:01:40.409> get<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.979> big<00:01:41.220> army<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.790> everything<00:01:42.180> I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
night get this big army and everything I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.870 
night get this big army and everything I
don't<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.100> ratio<00:01:44.610> cool
