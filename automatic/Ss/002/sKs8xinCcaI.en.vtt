00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.760
 Laptop are popular for several reasons 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 so you can join on facebook websites 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.500
 check movies 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 but you especially a lot of work 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.100
 the reason why you want to buy a laptop 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.869
 is very different 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.090
 and that's why I'm going to help in this video 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 making the right choice 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.220
 Most laptops are available with one 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.660
 screen from 11 to 17 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.540
 small laptops are easy to carry 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.130
 Taking large laptops are easy for that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.590
 for example, it uses graphics 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.270
 applications and therefore choose a lot 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.160
 people to compromise 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.329
 13 to 15 inches make them fine in between 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 do you think it is important that your laptop and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.140
 have lighting but you want 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 actually do not work with such a small 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.629
 screen 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.879
 are the oeg solutions and those 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.059
 solutions eats the ultra boots 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.469
 these are made very thin and laptops 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.240
 so you have a lightweight but you do 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:09.209
 Simply we have 15 inch screen with you 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.399
 13 how to carry in sharp is a drawback 

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:13.529
 and that is that all parts are smaller 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.779
 must be made and that are just 

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:17.990
 a little less quickly from an ordinary 

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:17.990
 Laptop 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.179
 there are multiple operating systems 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.319
 what you can choose if you have one 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.130
 buy a laptop 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:28.319
 so are her android linux and chromeos 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.169
 but by far the two most common 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.509
 operating systems are mac osx from 

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:36.779
 apple and windows 8 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.159
 finish one morning by microsoft 

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:39.539
 mac osx from apple is one 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.240
 operating system it a super 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.729
 is user-friendly and because only 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.069
 apple computers he is running mac osx 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.989
 also once very quickly very 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.099
 fluent and almost thank you 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.079
 never stuck 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.220
 well so with a mac osx you don't 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.930
 can run windows applications 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.360
 and that your comparison with, for example 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.220
 windows little to adjust to in 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 the operating system 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.810
 but the biggest drawback on the laptop 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.780
 Apple's are much more expensive than letters 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.890
 the latest version of the competition 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.670
 windows is windows 8 point 1 and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.790
 Inner pocket must and looks the same 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.520
 out to the tablet on the computer 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.670
 and also to the laptop in windows 8 is the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.140
 introduced metro layout and that makes it 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.790
 him he is so suitable for all those 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.709
 different devices and that comes 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.510
 because you are now just easy with you 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.890
 operate things 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.110
 do you have a touch sensitive screen 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.900
 is also logical with a tablet 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.010
 but whatever some laptops have like 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.810
 this one 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.790
 and another big advantage is that there 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.770
 many more programs applications too 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.700
 are available for windows from 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.700
 for example mac osx 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.840
 are going to use your laptop for things like 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.970
 mail you choke with excel work 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.650
 prepare reports and such 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.420
 your laptop doesn't have to be that fast 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.430
 and then you have nice luck because 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.780
 do not want to lose any money 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.690
 you do with those photos in those videos 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.130
 work or gamer yes then you would computer 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.130
 really have to meet high requirements 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.660
 and most important part of your laptop 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.900
 is the processor and the processes 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.670
 also called the brain of your pc how 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.580
 fast your processor the faster you 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.250
 computer and the speed is indicated 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.430
 in mega hertz or gigahertz a thousand mega 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.140
 there is a giga man who can use a processor 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.180
 once again several cores 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.160
 and that means he has several 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.790
 calculations at the same time 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.430
 to carry out 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.799
 so generally the higher the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.400
 gigaherz more cores the faster you 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.400
 computer 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.370
 also the internal memory of your laptop 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.830
 is very important for its speed 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.630
 note keep internal memory and external 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.250
 memory so we set up all your files 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.739
 not mixed up 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.230
 internal memory is important a lot 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.000
 internal memory is important if you 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.030
 multiple programs at the same time 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.980
 wanted to be able to run a lot 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.290
 lighter programs as word excel 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.090
 point together then you have 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.010
 actually a 4 gigabyte internal memory 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.560
 more than sufficient 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.120
 trijnie like me in this case at the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.810
 waiter premiere where you can watch videos 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.840
 edit 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.790
 photo shop all across each other 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.620
 there yes then you have more internal memory 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.260
 needed and you will have to search for one 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.190
 laptop for at least 8 gigabytes 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.740
 memory 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.560
 preferably a little more your laptop has too 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.930
 space needed to view all photos and videos 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.389
 store programs for storage 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.220
 do you have 3 options or you buy an ordinary one 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.610
 hard drive that is a really a physical one 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.680
 disk on which data is written or 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.070
 you buy a lot nowadays 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.110
 models have a ssd disk and ssd 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.900
 disk is much more expensive than a regular one 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.340
 hard disk but also much faster and 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.500
 that is ideal for example you 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.419
 operating system and one 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.630
 third option is a combination of the 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.570
 two 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.570
 so a ssd disk and just a hard disk 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.340
 if you want to work with a lot of videos 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.479
 Great pictures of real gamer then 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.240
 you have to put on some important things 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.919
 and that is that on your laptop one 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.080
 separate gpu 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.850
 chip is present that takes care of the 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.710
 handling of those things 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.630
 and the more applies to that gpu chip 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.000
 video memory that has 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.250
 the better you are with all that photo and video 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.789
 programs can work and also better 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.789
 can play games 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.479
 figuring out the right laptop is like this 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.289
 easy not that you see again 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.819
 but 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.819
 but first have to look at is how 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.970
 big do you want your laptop to go 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.560
 a lot of path goes for it and a small laptop 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.840
 you really don't want to make concessions 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.629
 do and do you want to travel but one 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.979
 big screen then go for the ultrabook 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.909
 which operating system do you need 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.319
 choose you can choose from a handful 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.419
 operating systems do you go for windows 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.310
 you for mac osx or free for the wat 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.340
 smaller operating systems such as 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.050
 for example, crown aos and how quickly must 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.810
 you pay attention to his look at the 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.469
 processor and from internal memory and a 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.960
 slow gaming 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.419
 then there must be a good grasp 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.550
 when you are ready then you already have that good 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.319
 specified that you actually 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.669
 just have to look the extra 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.669
 I wish you good luck
