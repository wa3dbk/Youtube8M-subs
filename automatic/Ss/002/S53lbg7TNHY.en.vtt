00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.570
 welcome to the brand new asus fix 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.849
 55 o'clock notebook here in hands-on was 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.530
 is just totally out of focus right now 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.089
 do you see it a little better we see 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.520
 Can we have a 15.6 inches de 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.240
 Reflective display with camera on top 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.859
 lead only 247 euro as I did before 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.109
 of course, has seen only with linux 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.529
 but we have one for that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.550
 fast amd processor in there and to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.680
 another radeon hd 6320 you have to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.110
 not only the hp actions necessarily 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.129
 just watching the 56 run 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 but we still have this 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.570
 really send asx 55 pm I for 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.800
 you just around the device around 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.789
 we can see we have so many 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 were in it 500 gb hard disk dvd burner 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.719
 Show graphic and also usb3 like you 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 will soon show 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.410
 really very shift-button tour that is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.420
 now in Hungarian partly 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.609
 but otherwise really labeled 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.609
 pleasant on and off switch here 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.400
 of course, a look and everyday life 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.299
 sound is really high quality and that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 we'll probably see you next time 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.630
 Try it when I get this 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.610
 Buy or my girlfriend too 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.049
 christmas because she wants something 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 new so we can see we have 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.710
 here a dvd burner in kensington 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.479
 lock where the whole thing here so nice 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.820
 is fixed then we have one here 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.759
 nothing special from a sd 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.369
 Card reader and many many status 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.770
 leds and on the other side we have 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.439
 here the mentioned usb3 connection 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.250
 Headphone microphone separate USB2 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.119
 Connection network HDMI and VGA fan 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.009
 electricity 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.180
 works to the whole time to see to then 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.180
 you also very nice from the outside 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920
 fingerprint repellent mainly 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.750
 So you can already see a little bit here 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.329
 because I always mash a bit 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.579
 but otherwise has fingers here as 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.710
 logo of course feels very nice 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.060
 also very good, of course, right 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.340
 plastically and then we have one here 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.479
 bottom completely a cover 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.890
 man could do there then could 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.810
 I think, hopefully 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.950
 exchange ram and the hard disk 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.060
 otherwise we have here too 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.590
 a battery usually in it and how big 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.940
 This is the best in balance 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.640
 board after that can of course 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.120
 also depending on the vary finances 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.580
 watched was canceled at the ltv ixs 55 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.599
 and asus in the hands on my name is pascal 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.640
 de half day that was here 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.140
 really cheap entry-level notebook 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.120
 that you unfortunately just like me just see 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.099
 with one with two ideally 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.840
 but you can open it for that 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.910
 really nice way back 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.150
 Fold until next time watched 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.150
 to have
