00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 friends of black but we are here at the trullo one 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.870
 now historic town of the capital 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.240
 we listened directly from the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.550
 residents' voice what today the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.269
 trullo as it has changed in these decades 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.580
 and what does it mean today to live here 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.439
 well a particularity is that we have 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.900
 noted that the citizens are distinguished 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.910
 divide into a feeling of affection in the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 comparisons of this territory that does not 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.720
 however, they would never leave the other 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.699
 testimonials that we are not 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 managed to take directly between col 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.809
 video because nobody wants to expose 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.700
 more than that, however, of a reality still 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.660
 of degradation even of much space 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.040
 here I'm 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.590
 we have collected a series of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.530
 testimonials and here is for you what 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.780
 today it is the trullo seen by the residents 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.809
 monica from the ten-year trullo 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.160
 how the goalkeeper has changed 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.129
 of several aspects 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.980
 before there were more people of ours instead 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.530
 now more foreigners with bullying 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.660
 gypsies that I go around before yours 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 roller was beautiful 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 now unfortunately it is no longer the turn of 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.590
 once what does the trullo of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.650
 once because people lived better 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.170
 everything was better than the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.960
 however delinquency is also somehow 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.520
 decreased no no one knows arthur un 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.330
 letter that the trullo we can not 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.920
 complain 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.740
 Mr. roberto da quanta who lives at 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 trullo 45 years what the trullo is today 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 it is as before little changed but it is not 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.549
 changed so much even without 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.070
 specific ethics people people 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.220
 before it was something else 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.350
 there was more it was better to stay together like 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.900
 I can say this now understood 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 distrust wickedness many things but the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.630
 delinquency is still present people yes 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.590
 is what the trullo for her is today? 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.700
 It goes where you go away 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.820
 luck out because not too many people 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.299
 too much here that everyone does not count 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.130
 anyone anything you eat will come 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.210
 she is a great Lazio who lives here at al 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.439
 trullo which situation is worse than 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.929
 so 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.780
 just look you park like 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.630
 as if we had the case with the cows and 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.600
 goats 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.660
 Here comes some time we had three 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.890
 carabinieri barracks or at least three 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.540
 stations 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 now there weren't really the carabinieri 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.190
 there is only light some writing 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.940
 carabiniere somewhere you are 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.010
 a young man 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.340
 if I had the opportunity to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.770
 you would go yes I have two children that in short 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.800
 that you make me mimic affects there is a 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.870
 store near instead an article of the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.270
 messenger where citizens are said to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.700
 and those who say to the trullo will never go away 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.580
 a basic and I would not go on sincere 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.430
 because anyway I went here for 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.250
 it seems to me also beautiful it is said that the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.550
 trullo is recently inhabited 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.520
 especially from populations of the east 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.650
 even at school there is this variety of yes 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.990
 it's true however there are many foreigners 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.890
 however, they are well integrated in the 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.470
 class group so you are fine is 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.690
 only that the institutions and the municipality 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.300
 he forgot about this one 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.460
 hamlet said that the trullo is gentle 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.190
 completely rude as a 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.500
 Neapolitan because it is enough that he sees in 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.040
 how I was last abandons 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.040
 strange
