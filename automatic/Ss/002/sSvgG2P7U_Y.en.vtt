00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
since I've recorded an actual video but

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.970 
since I've recorded an actual video but
I've<00:00:09.059> been<00:00:09.300> getting<00:00:09.600> a<00:00:09.690> request<00:00:10.080> for<00:00:10.530> how<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.830> do

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
I've been getting a request for how I do

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.610 
I've been getting a request for how I do
my<00:00:11.130> nose<00:00:11.550> make<00:00:11.850> up<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:12.990> quite<00:00:13.350> a<00:00:13.379> long<00:00:13.469> time

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
my nose make up for quite a long time

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.379

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
I'm actually wearing it right now but

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.200 
I'm actually wearing it right now but
because<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.840> the<00:00:16.410> low<00:00:17.370> resolution<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.120> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
because of the low resolution of the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.580 
because of the low resolution of the
camera<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.690> might<00:00:18.870> not<00:00:18.990> even<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.260> able<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
camera you might not even be able to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.520 
camera you might not even be able to
tell<00:00:19.850> but<00:00:20.850> I'm<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.420> show<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.720> how<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.350> do

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
tell but I'm going to show you how I do

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.130 
tell but I'm going to show you how I do
it<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.400> pretty<00:00:24.330> simple<00:00:24.450> pretty

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
it it's really pretty simple pretty

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.200 
it it's really pretty simple pretty
basic<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.970> I<00:00:27.440> think<00:00:28.440> that<00:00:28.680> doing<00:00:29.280> your<00:00:30.030> nose

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
basic and I think that doing your nose

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.630 
basic and I think that doing your nose
like<00:00:30.780> the<00:00:30.960> nose<00:00:31.170> stripe<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.770> very<00:00:32.279> essential

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
like the nose stripe is very essential

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.440 
like the nose stripe is very essential
for<00:00:33.649> gathering<00:00:34.649> makeup<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.270> something<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
for gathering makeup it's something that

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.299 
for gathering makeup it's something that
most<00:00:36.780> people<00:00:36.929> don't<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:39.269> helps<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
most people don't do and it helps to

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.020 
most people don't do and it helps to
just<00:00:42.379> like<00:00:43.379> enhance<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.429> features<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.969> a

just like enhance your features in a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.020 
just like enhance your features in a
different<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> use<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
different way so what I use is a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.860 
different way so what I use is a
concealer<00:00:48.780> stick<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.120> I<00:00:54.120> also<00:00:54.359> use

concealer stick you know and I also use

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.779 
concealer stick you know and I also use
my<00:00:55.289> contour<00:00:56.280> palette<00:00:56.519> it's<00:00:56.879> kind<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.210> old<00:00:57.449> so

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
want to provide a link for that video in

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.990 
want to provide a link for that video in
the<00:02:42.350> description<00:02:42.470> as<00:02:43.130> well<00:02:43.160> but<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:43.970> just

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
the description as well but this is just

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.570 
the description as well but this is just
how<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.300> do<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.660> because<00:02:44.870> my<00:02:45.830> nose<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.310> quite

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
how I do it because my nose is quite

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.290 
how I do it because my nose is quite
flat<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.920> if<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.100> have<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> flat<00:02:49.580> nose<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.240> I

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
flat so if you have a flat nose and I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.210 
flat so if you have a flat nose and I
guess<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.720> video<00:02:50.930> will<00:02:51.320> be<00:02:51.470> helpful<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:52.190> you
