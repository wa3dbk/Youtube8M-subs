00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.110
 page 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.460

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.850
 I do not have all the other parts 3 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.310
 mole level 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.980
 only six times I have a third level and 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.160
 here shows all cats this design 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.060
 Well, let's go to our very rickshaw 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.950
 so rickshaw is very cool with us 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.540
 the only thing that I replaced these here 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 two Circuits because here these here not 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.460
 already kept many old were well and here 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.060
 I put them but still look for words 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.850
 legs are very cool moving so here 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.890
 turns well spinning earlier it 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.890
 the first of a series of sets of Lego BIONICLE at 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.120
 which many bent at the knees and here 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.760
 so too bend 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.250
 you can put him in great poses 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.990
 and a bunch 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.970
 they had such a predator 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.440
 cool feature what if you twist 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.350
 behind 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.140
 then to attack the same function 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.350
 used league designers evseev series 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.720
 lego bionicles matorany those who played 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.880
 in collie I think that's what they call them 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.200
 game but so here's something to twist it 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:21.320
 his hands go on his hands 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.440
 such a cool staff, too, like water 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.090
 really head so pretty 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.950
 my spikes are rubber floor by the way 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.700
 open not here we are sitting sitting with 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.120
 sputum 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.050
 let's take a closer look at her if we 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.920
 we can focus see 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.060
 such a mole 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.670
 very cool not biting on very 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.370
 thank you very much dark bridge in excellent 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.560
 able rakshi u some Circuits 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.200
 undercut but still it was minus league 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.580
 designers did not become such a short 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.060
 level 3 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.840
 I have already said I am gum and can 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.209
 back to plant 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.480
 so for him 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.520
 close and how do you know to create 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.620
 before it was necessary 2 moles 1 mole 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.390
 was becoming so mechanical 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.329
 armor and the second crawled 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.890
 and controlled it in general 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.019
 through seguro que tal 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.240
 just on the bed he is not very stand 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.160
 convenient but such a set for everyone 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.510
 I advise you if you can have a friend 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.060
 swap and leonovym 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.030
 you can just give someone not needed or 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.700
 go as a last resort on ebay or where 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.310
 something else and find as more stores 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.050
 they are not, unfortunately, but I am very happy 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.280
 that i have at least some raksha and 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.560
 all raksha masks 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.350
 i'm just happy i don't know who i am 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.730
 Already half a year wanted and here you are well 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.860
