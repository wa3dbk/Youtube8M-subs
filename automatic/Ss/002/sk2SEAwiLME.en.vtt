between<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:16.130> two<00:04:16.280> games<00:04:16.609> I<00:04:16.910> think<00:04:17.239> that's<00:04:17.359> a

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
between the two games I think that's a

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.000 
between the two games I think that's a
good<00:04:17.539> compromise<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.289> with<00:04:18.680> tripping

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
good compromise and with tripping

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.650 
good compromise and with tripping
removed<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.699> game<00:04:19.849> should<00:04:20.000> never<00:04:20.209> stop<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.630> a

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
removed the game should never stop to a

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.110 
removed the game should never stop to a
grinding<00:04:20.930> halt<00:04:21.320> for<00:04:21.560> no<00:04:22.280> reason<00:04:22.310> so
