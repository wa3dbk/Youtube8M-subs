is that a little rubber piece that you
thread<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.960> into<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.489> thread<00:00:50.850> that

thread that into here you thread that
through<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.879> foam<00:00:53.879> piece<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
through this foam piece and then it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.000 
through this foam piece and then it
threads<00:00:55.199> through<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
threads through here and then on the

threads through here and then on the
back<00:00:59.010> side<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> how<00:00:59.940> well<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.270> can

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
in here there's actually a metal piece

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.609 
in here there's actually a metal piece
that<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.439> thing<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:33.020> can<00:01:34.020> rub<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that this thing can get can rub on and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.240 
that this thing can get can rub on and
it'll<00:01:34.799> cut<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> hole<00:01:35.159> into<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.130> to

it'll cut a hole into it so you have to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.640 
it'll cut a hole into it so you have to
route<00:01:38.460> them<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.869> way<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:40.439> won't

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
route them in a way that they won't

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.020 
route them in a way that they won't
touch<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.520> mine<00:01:42.320> don't<00:01:43.320> touch<00:01:45.439> then<00:01:47.030> you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
touch that and mine don't touch then you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.100 
touch that and mine don't touch then you
can

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
can

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.790 
can
barely<00:01:51.110> see<00:01:51.800> back<00:01:52.040> in<00:01:52.250> there<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.990> yeah

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
barely see back in there but yeah

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.950 
barely see back in there but yeah
they're<00:01:55.070> out<00:01:55.220> there<00:01:55.570> when<00:01:56.570> they<00:01:56.690> come<00:01:56.900> out

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
they're out there when they come out

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.860 
they're out there when they come out
under<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.770> battery<00:01:57.980> tray<00:01:58.460> here<00:01:58.810> and<00:02:00.130> one<00:02:01.870> the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
under the battery tray here and one the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.300 
under the battery tray here and one the
bottom<00:02:03.260> one<00:02:03.440> would<00:02:04.100> be<00:02:04.690> your<00:02:05.690> input<00:02:06.230> so<00:02:06.500> you

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
bottom one would be your input so you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.010 
bottom one would be your input so you
might<00:02:07.640> want<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.820> take<00:02:08.000> your<00:02:08.030> top<00:02:08.390> transmission

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
line off and start the car briefly and I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.980 
line off and start the car briefly and I
mean<00:02:11.960> briefly<00:02:12.940> just<00:02:13.940> for<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.330> second<00:02:14.840> have

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
mean briefly just for a second have

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.480 
mean briefly just for a second have
somebody<00:02:15.320> watch<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.770> see<00:02:15.950> where<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.220> fluid

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
somebody watch and see where the fluid

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.550 
somebody watch and see where the fluid
comes<00:02:16.730> out<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.180> wherever<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.020> fluid<00:02:18.350> starts

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
comes out and wherever the fluid starts

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.390 
comes out and wherever the fluid starts
pumping<00:02:19.100> pumping<00:02:19.490> out<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:20.590> your<00:02:21.590> feed<00:02:22.130> line

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
pumping pumping out is your feed line

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.270 
pumping pumping out is your feed line
your<00:02:23.210> input<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:24.470> in<00:02:24.650> putting<00:02:25.010> through<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
your input so we in putting through the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.980 
your input so we in putting through the
bottom<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.030> way<00:02:26.210> would<00:02:26.480> push<00:02:26.720> all<00:02:26.870> the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
bottom here this way would push all the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.630 
bottom here this way would push all the
air<00:02:27.050> bubbles<00:02:27.110> up<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.100> no<00:02:28.190> air<00:02:28.340> bubbles

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
air bubbles up and the no air bubbles

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.980 
air bubbles up and the no air bubbles
would<00:02:28.760> get<00:02:28.880> trapped<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:31.160> would<00:02:31.280> be<00:02:31.990> my

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
would get trapped so that would be my

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.150 
would get trapped so that would be my
feed<00:02:33.260> line<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.680> coming<00:02:33.950> through<00:02:34.070> here

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
feed line is coming through here

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.730 
feed line is coming through here
actually<00:02:34.970> going<00:02:35.720> through<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.990> radiator<00:02:36.380> on

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
actually going through the radiator on

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.860 
actually going through the radiator on
the<00:02:37.370> bottom<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.150> coming<00:02:38.480> up<00:02:38.600> through<00:02:38.810> here

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
the bottom and coming up through here

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.560 
the bottom and coming up through here
and<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:41.720> line<00:02:42.880> they<00:02:43.880> actually<00:02:44.210> give<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.450> an

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
and this line they actually give you an

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.540 
and this line they actually give you an
adapter<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.230> put<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:45.800> tournaire<00:02:46.040> than<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
adapter to put in the tournaire than the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.220 
adapter to put in the tournaire than the
cooler<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.670> would<00:02:49.790> run<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.150> line<00:02:50.420> to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
cooler and you would run that line to

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
cooler and you would run that line to
the<00:02:51.320> bottom<00:02:51.650> one<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.150> top<00:02:53.150> one<00:02:54.250> would

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
the bottom one and the top one would

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.310 
the bottom one and the top one would
route<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:56.060> go<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.510> your<00:02:56.810> existing

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
route and go to your existing

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.560 
route and go to your existing
transmission<00:02:57.680> line<00:02:58.100> tour<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:59.000> go<00:02:59.120> back<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
transmission line tour to go back to the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.180 
transmission line tour to go back to the
transmission<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.709> they<00:03:00.860> give<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.100> these

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
transmission and they give you these

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.040 
transmission and they give you these
hose<00:03:01.400> clamps<00:03:01.820> but<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.030> can<00:03:02.150> get<00:03:02.330> they<00:03:02.810> work

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
hose clamps but you can get they work

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.320 
hose clamps but you can get they work
but<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:04.220> get<00:03:04.520> some<00:03:04.550> better<00:03:04.790> ones<00:03:05.030> that

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
but you can get some better ones that

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.770 
but you can get some better ones that
are<00:03:05.420> like<00:03:05.570> four<00:03:06.080> injector<00:03:06.850> gas<00:03:07.850> line<00:03:08.150> stuff<00:03:08.600> a

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
are like four injector gas line stuff a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.750 
are like four injector gas line stuff a
little<00:03:08.900> bit<00:03:09.020> better<00:03:09.260> quality<00:03:09.500> but<00:03:09.950> those<00:03:10.580> work

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
little bit better quality but those work

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.400 
little bit better quality but those work
just<00:03:10.970> fine<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.780> make<00:03:11.900> sure<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.230> tighten

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
just fine just make sure you tighten

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.140 
just fine just make sure you tighten
them<00:03:12.590> pretty<00:03:12.800> good<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.160> don't<00:03:13.730> strip<00:03:14.000> them

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
them pretty good and don't strip them

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.370 
them pretty good and don't strip them
out<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:17.150> can<00:03:17.270> also<00:03:17.450> double<00:03:17.870> clamp<00:03:18.080> them<00:03:18.290> if

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
out you can also double clamp them if

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.550 
out you can also double clamp them if
you<00:03:18.470> want<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.920> doesn't<00:03:19.430> matter

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
you want to doesn't matter

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.870 
you want to doesn't matter
I'll<00:03:21.560> prefer<00:03:21.800> you<00:03:22.040> probably<00:03:22.430> double<00:03:22.640> clamp

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
I'll prefer you probably double clamp

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.400 
I'll prefer you probably double clamp
them<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.950> know<00:03:25.040> be<00:03:25.190> on<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.370> safe<00:03:25.550> side

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
them just you know be on the safe side

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.199 
them just you know be on the safe side
but<00:03:27.410> that's<00:03:27.980> pretty<00:03:28.730> much<00:03:28.850> it

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
but that's pretty much it

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.290 
but that's pretty much it
um<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:31.160> want<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.430> warm<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.790> truck<00:03:32.000> or<00:03:32.180> you

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
um you want to warm the truck or you

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.729 
um you want to warm the truck or you
warm<00:03:32.540> your<00:03:32.690> car<00:03:32.840> up<00:03:33.019> or<00:03:33.170> whatever<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.530> put

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
warm your car up or whatever you put

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.360 
warm your car up or whatever you put
this<00:03:33.860> in<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:35.209> check<00:03:35.870> your<00:03:36.370> transmission

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
this in and check your transmission

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.400 
this in and check your transmission
fluid<00:03:37.870> afterwards<00:03:38.870> because<00:03:39.080> you'll<00:03:39.230> lose

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
fluid afterwards because you'll lose

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.059 
fluid afterwards because you'll lose
maybe<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.709> pint<00:03:40.209> or<00:03:41.209> so

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.099 

so<00:03:45.680> yeah<00:03:46.680> that's<00:03:47.519> how<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.760> routed<00:03:48.209> mine<00:03:48.390> car<00:03:48.870> put

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
so yeah that's how I routed mine car put

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.140 
so yeah that's how I routed mine car put
mine<00:03:49.319> at<00:03:49.349> pretty<00:03:50.280> big<00:03:50.489> some<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.909> them<00:03:51.030> are

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
mine at pretty big some of them are

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.550 
mine at pretty big some of them are
really<00:03:51.269> somewhere<00:03:51.900> we're<00:03:52.019> always<00:03:52.230> smaller

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
really somewhere we're always smaller

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.240 
really somewhere we're always smaller
but<00:03:52.829> I<00:03:53.159> decided<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.609> put<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> bigger<00:03:53.969> one<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.299> it

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
but I decided to put a bigger one in it

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.059 
but I decided to put a bigger one in it
but<00:03:56.250> that's<00:03:56.370> how<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.579> routed<00:03:56.849> mine<00:04:00.560> they<00:04:01.560> go<00:04:01.739> way

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
but that's how I routed mine they go way

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.119 
but that's how I routed mine they go way
up<00:04:02.099> under<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.609> battery<00:04:02.819> tray<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:04.040> come<00:04:05.040> up

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
up under the battery tray and come up

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.119 
up under the battery tray and come up
through<00:04:05.159> there<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:09.720> one's<00:04:10.019> probably<00:04:10.260> too

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
through there this one's probably too

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:18.770 
through there this one's probably too
long<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:11.909> well<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.849> do<00:04:18.389> something

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
long but well and I have to do something

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.039 
long but well and I have to do something
about<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.019> there<00:04:19.560> see<00:04:19.859> how<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:20.729> um<00:04:21.049> going

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
about that there see how it's um going
