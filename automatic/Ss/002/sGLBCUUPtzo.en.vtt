00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.470
 hello friends with you again channel mister 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.570
 My name is Ivan and today I will continue 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.240
 forex course on thermoelectric 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.610
 refrigerators of our company 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.320
 most recently in our range 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.160
 There is a new model of car refrigerator 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.250
 mtc 243 of 24 liters by the way here is 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.929
 our closest analogue of this refrigerator 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.870
 this model mtc 24 is noteworthy that 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.820
 the novelty is much smaller 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.080
 previous model and more importantly 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.170
 today's realities 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.620
 this is what the cost of a refrigerator 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.620
 indesit 243 is lower by about 30 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.469
 percent what then let's open our 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.300
 samples and try to figure out what 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.930
 the difference why the novelty is significant 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.809
 cheaper 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.219
 how much do we lose if saving buying 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.530
 new model and so unpack 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:05.380
 both models included 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:10.520
 naturally instruction warranty card 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:13.850
 the fridge itself and the cable for 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.560
 connect to car cigarette lighter and 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.570
 here the differences begin 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.549
 what's in the set to the cooling blades sy 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.400
 24 there is such a lattice for 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:32.930
 volume delimitation 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:37.759
 cable is available to connect the network 220 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.869
 volt here it is actually due to this 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.290
 lower cost of new items second 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:50.180
 nuance this is a removable cover on this Fink 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.740
 the cover is removed all over the previous 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.079
 cover models 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.290
 by the way she, too, is shot like this 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.520
 way well actually it is enough 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.829
 not an important nuance 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.860
 the one and the other cover is very reliable 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:07.399
 fixed handle you can not lift 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.740
 if the handle is forward or you carry the handle 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.170
 this excludes unauthorized 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.710
 opening the lid well and the rest in 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.440
 There is no difference in principle and the third nuance is 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.390
 compactness of the new model 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.400
 on the one hand it is undisputed 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.560
 advantage because you can put 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.550
 this refrigerator is a more modest volume 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.940
 the internal volume of the cameras is absolutely 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.490
 same but tell you naturally 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.740
 suffer insulation, well, let's 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.540
 here is this last fact we are with you 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.490
 check now we turn on 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.880
 both refrigerators and other things being equal 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.740
 factors to what extent 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.840
 the temperature will drop and check how much 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.760
 this refrigerator will be different from 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.330
 its previous more expensive 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.770
 fellow 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:03.520
 let's measure the temperature 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:07.210
 24 25 degrees here is exactly the same 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.220
 most 24 25 degrees use 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.620
 a threesome of our own production 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.050
 notice the drops in a different way 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.730
 you stick it signed 10 means 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.150
 the switch must also be included 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.910
 Odessa 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.860
 switch to cooling same 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:28.480
 the procedure is carried out with a new fridge 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.570
 turn on here here switch nothing 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:37.120
 not only inclusive cooling and 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:40.120
 turn on Odessa cable and so the motor well 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.130
 Well friends passed a couple of hours and now 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.650
 we will try to measure the temperature in 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.600
 our refrigerators and compare them between 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.989
 see what the ambient temperature is 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.220
 the environment has not changed much the same 25 24 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.220
 degrees and so we measure 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.460
 as you can see the temperature of the refrigerator mtc 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.750
 243 stopped 10 degrees it's lower 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.730
 ambient temperature just 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:23.250
 at 15 degrees now we measure 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.250
 This sample refrigerator empty network 24 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.230
 but here as you can see the temperature 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.000
 literally one degree lower so 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.850
 measurements showed that in both models 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.130
 the temperature dropped to the promised 15 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.700
 degrees it means that in principle 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.320
 there is no difference between them if competitive 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.040
 The advantage of the older model is 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.480
 ability to work from the mains 220 volts but 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.500
 by the way there is one secret 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.040
 Our product range is networked. 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.410
 adapter 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.900
 mtc 5 and which she often annuls it 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.730
 there is no advantage I certainly donâ€™t argue that 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.430
 in this context, the older model 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.980
 somewhat more convenient but if you need 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.320
 fridge to 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.030
 operate it in the car and in the house you 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.840
 it is used occasionally 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.600
 then I think that model im yew 243 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.590
 your ideal is not so, I repeat 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:28.720
 the difference between them is the lack of power 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.650
 from the mains 220 volts whereas 24 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.010
 the fridge 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:38.220
 she is sizes he will see several 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.220
 lower considerably already 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:47.490
 and the cap which in this case 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.190
 foldable in this case removable let's 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.160
 I'll show you how to fridge 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.880
 look inside you see that thickness 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.550
 of course also has enough walls 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.979
 big difference but as we showed 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.169
 experiment 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:06.930
 lowering temperature of these models 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.570
 about the same likely this 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.660
 refrigerator off 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:15.360
 a little less hold on chilled 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.620
 rather than this model but in the included 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.389
 condition this model is not inferior to its 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.400
 fellow 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:26.430
 so I suggest you pay attention 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.930
 on these models choose what you want 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.790
 really taste and what you 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.710
 do not need to overpay extra money 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.110
 if you need any extra features 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.220
 don't need i say goodbye to you was 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.220
 channel mister bye
