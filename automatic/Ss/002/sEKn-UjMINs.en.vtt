00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.509
 private island of princess cruises yes and 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.030
 how to reach the island with the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.650
 tender offers in this case I was yes 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.150
 on the road with the crown princess and on 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.889
 board were previously tender tickets 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.809
 distributed so that you are then called 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.330
 was in groups when you go ashore 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.400
 It could take a few minutes entirely 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 Of course, it's not as fast as it gets 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.449
 yes and then you have a whole day there 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 you are there on the island 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.310
 can spend where you relax 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.869
 Can where you can lie on the beach so 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.790
 really a very nice story and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.079
 yes already sent the island in advance 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.020
 I really liked that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.790
 15.30 important during our 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.100
 Travel was the last tender board 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 Back when you do not do it with anyone 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.860
 To save costs 9 dollars a day 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.629
 the easy 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.989
 otherwise you can do a lot of this 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.129
 catamaran 55 dollars an hour 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.780
 and you have already there, of course 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.879
 a wonderful look at the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.320
 crown princess so nice as I said 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 I really liked the designed island 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.760
 told about norwegian cruise line 29 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.399
 dollars at half past 19 dollars and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.729
 half an hour and for the pedal boats 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.100
 also 29 dollars 4 30 minutes so completely 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.630
 cheap it is in the end but not that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 is not to be expected, I mean 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.710
 Of course, the shipping company also wants to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.689
 if they happen on the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 But you have already seen the beach 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.670
 it does not cost anything nice these rafts 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.070
 five dollars a day 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 then this clam 29 dollars a day that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.450
 I think back up relatively yes I have 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 just for sunscreen but you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 Look, the paradise looks wonderful 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 So the day without it was really 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.159
 So very nice 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.540
 Nevertheless, they wanted to be there now 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.060
 heaven sees but that was really a 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.590
 very fantastic beach day yes that is 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.720
 a viewpoint there you can on it 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.900
 climb and have one from the top one completely 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.220
 good look 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.770
 you have this collection of houses 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.710
 on the left just what is that there 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.480
 There are two lines of food there 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.380
 So to speak for the buffet you have to 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.210
 to adjust 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.830
 yes, that looks a bit like canteens 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.510
 moderate but the food is natural 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.370
 as you would from the ship 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.350
 It is usual for us to do everything in the morning 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.980
 There brought to the island 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.660
 of course, there is also a johann barth 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.410
 beer is a musical one 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.640
 little entertained if you want that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.620
 because it lacks possible so nothing this 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.540
 You can rent a house air-conditioned 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.170
 199 dollars a day for up to four 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.860
 people 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.440
 yes , that would be good then yes 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.540
 There are still very exclusive bungalows 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.430
 the cost is $ 249 and they are 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.390
 exclusive that you do not really 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.860
 can see 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.750
 so I do not want that either 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.190
 gone through but you also see the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.250
 island also has a bit quieter 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.730
 Yes, what more do you want? 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.060
 perfect beach day give with princess 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.850
 cruises on princess case yes and then 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.900
 It's the end of the day in the afternoon 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.900
 also back again
