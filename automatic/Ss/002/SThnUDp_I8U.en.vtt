00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
would tell you the W models I believe

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.939 
would tell you the W models I believe
most<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> taillight

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
most all of them have a taillight

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.080 
most all of them have a taillight
headlight<00:00:59.359> and<00:01:01.640> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> little

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090

headlight and going to have a little
trip<00:01:03.359> meter<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.320> speedometer<00:01:05.420> here

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

list<00:01:15.119> rear<00:01:15.330> suspension<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.439> mean

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
list rear suspension so what do we mean

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.429 
list rear suspension so what do we mean
by<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.610> rear<00:01:17.820> shock<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.570> connected

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
by that the rear shock is connected

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.249 
by that the rear shock is connected

directly to the swing arm as opposed to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.980 
directly to the swing arm as opposed to
some<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> other<00:01:23.159> bikes<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.990> linkage

some of the other bikes with the linkage
suspension<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> shock<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.159> connected<00:01:26.610> under

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
suspension the shock is connected under

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120

here<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> linkage<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> makes<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> shock

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
here with a linkage that makes the shock

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.590 
here with a linkage that makes the shock
a<00:01:29.159> little<00:01:29.460> more<00:01:29.549> progressive<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.420> just

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
a little more progressive and it's just

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.429 
a little more progressive and it's just
a<00:01:30.780> matter<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.470> riding<00:01:31.799> style<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:33.439> then

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
a matter of the riding style and then

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.640 
a matter of the riding style and then
what<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> lot<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.369> guys<00:01:36.320> prefer<00:01:37.320> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
what you like a lot of guys prefer this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.590 
what you like a lot of guys prefer this
just<00:01:38.250> again<00:01:38.579> depends<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> type<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.329> riding

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
just again depends on the type of riding

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 
just again depends on the type of riding
but<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.070> KTM<00:01:41.460> does<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.820> these

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000

does have the sidestand

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.050 
does have the sidestand
we're<00:02:41.200> gonna<00:02:41.349> look<00:02:41.650> at<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.430> sides<00:02:42.730> motor

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
we're gonna look at the sides motor

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.610 
we're gonna look at the sides motor
there's<00:02:43.390> your<00:02:43.540> starter<00:02:44.290> motor<00:02:45.150> there<00:02:49.620> of

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
there's your starter motor there of

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.740 
there's your starter motor there of
course<00:02:50.799> with<00:02:51.220> all<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.760> KTM<00:02:52.180> bikes<00:02:52.450> the

just stuck on but these other graphics
are<00:03:01.690> kind<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.900> made<00:03:02.109> onto<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.500> plastic<00:03:02.709> I'm

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
are kind of made onto the plastic I'm

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.830 
are kind of made onto the plastic I'm
not<00:03:03.220> sure<00:03:03.370> exactly<00:03:03.579> what<00:03:03.849> that<00:03:03.879> process<00:03:04.180> is

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
not sure exactly what that process is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.690 
not sure exactly what that process is
but<00:03:05.349> when<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:05.799> get<00:03:05.920> your<00:03:06.069> graphics<00:03:06.459> kids

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
but when you get your graphics kids

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.160 
but when you get your graphics kids
really<00:03:07.000> easy<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.329> lay<00:03:07.599> them<00:03:07.780> on<00:03:07.810> top<00:03:08.019> of

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
really easy you just lay them on top of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.530 
really easy you just lay them on top of
there<00:03:08.290> nothing<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> remove<00:03:09.340> anything<00:03:10.180> like

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
there nothing to remove anything like

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.809 
there nothing to remove anything like
that

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
that

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.970 
that
quarter<00:03:12.819> turn<00:03:13.000> gasket<00:03:13.540> cast<00:03:13.989> cap<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:16.980> easier

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
quarter turn gasket cast cap is easier

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.500 
quarter turn gasket cast cap is easier
to<00:03:18.099> open<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.609> not<00:03:18.819> really<00:03:19.120> as<00:03:19.180> open

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
to open it's not really as open

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.099 
to open it's not really as open
one-handed<00:03:19.959> maybe<00:03:20.139> but<00:03:21.130> yeah<00:03:21.579> there<00:03:21.760> we<00:03:21.849> go

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
one-handed maybe but yeah there we go

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.199 
one-handed maybe but yeah there we go
that's<00:03:23.109> just<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.680> little<00:03:24.040> quarter<00:03:24.310> turn<00:03:24.549> gas

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
that's just a little quarter turn gas

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.720 
that's just a little quarter turn gas
cap<00:03:25.540> mix<00:03:25.810> really<00:03:26.169> easy<00:03:26.319> so<00:03:26.500> fueling<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.099> real

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
cap mix really easy so fueling is real

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.759 
cap mix really easy so fueling is real
quick<00:03:27.879> and<00:03:28.150> easy<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.599> showed<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.379> your<00:03:29.530> gauge
