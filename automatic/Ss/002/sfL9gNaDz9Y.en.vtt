00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
like what I know why because i'm using

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.750 
like what I know why because i'm using
class<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.690> memory<00:00:48.960> card<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.760> really

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
class for memory card which have really

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.619 
class for memory card which have really
split<00:00:51.000> up<00:00:51.120> only<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.079> both<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.829> 23<00:00:53.309> mb<00:00:53.629> per

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
split up only in both to 23 mb per

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.920 
split up only in both to 23 mb per
second<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.079> fine<00:00:55.320> wit<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.680> dislike<00:00:56.930> if

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
