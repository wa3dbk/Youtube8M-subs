something to do my brows with so I found

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.600 
something to do my brows with so I found

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
my C's eyebrow kit has a five hour wax

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.920 
my C's eyebrow kit has a five hour wax
and<00:00:25.000> eyebrow<00:00:26.000> powder<00:00:28.090> usually<00:00:29.090> you<00:00:29.270> should<00:00:29.300> go

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
and eyebrow powder usually you should go

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.610 
and eyebrow powder usually you should go
with<00:00:30.260> a<00:00:30.560> kit<00:00:31.369> because<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:32.090> eyebrow<00:00:32.870> powder<00:00:33.199> is

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
with a kit because the eyebrow powder is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.760 
with a kit because the eyebrow powder is
more<00:00:34.160> coarser<00:00:34.850> than<00:00:35.120> it<00:00:35.570> I<00:00:35.720> shadow<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:36.739> it

more coarser than it I shadow so it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.790 
more coarser than it I shadow so it
