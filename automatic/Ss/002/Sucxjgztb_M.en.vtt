I tell you what there's a heck of a lot
of<00:02:34.930> weight<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.740> back<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.130> trolley<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
of weight on the back of the trolley and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.280 
of weight on the back of the trolley and
it<00:02:36.610> hasn't<00:02:36.940> collapsed<00:02:37.300> completely<00:02:37.600> has<00:02:38.110> it

going to be looking at some of the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.490 
going to be looking at some of the
things<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.600> see<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.900> movie<00:02:47.200> some<00:02:47.410> of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
things that you see in the movie some of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.410 
things that you see in the movie some of
the<00:02:47.560> fantastic<00:02:47.710> things<00:02:48.430> some<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.210> things

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the fantastic things some of the things

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.270 
the fantastic things some of the things
that<00:02:49.630> appear<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.200> be<00:02:50.380> myths<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.890> we're<00:02:51.190> gonna

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
that appear to be myths and we're gonna

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.190 
that appear to be myths and we're gonna
be<00:02:51.370> putting<00:02:51.550> them<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.880> test<00:02:51.970> for<00:02:52.720> example

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
be putting them to the test for example

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.500 
be putting them to the test for example
can<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.710> sniper<00:02:54.040> really<00:02:54.610> hit<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> man<00:02:55.090> using<00:02:55.450> a

single bullet from over a mile away can

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
single bullet from over a mile away can
we<00:03:01.120> fire<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.360> yes<00:03:02.140> absolutely<00:03:02.350> great<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:04.450> it's

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
we fire it yes absolutely great but it's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.990 
we fire it yes absolutely great but it's
not<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> simple<00:03:05.620> case<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:06.040> just<00:03:06.430> pointing<00:03:06.850> and

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
not a simple case of just pointing and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.090 
not a simple case of just pointing and
shooting<00:03:07.180> there's<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:08.050> science<00:03:08.590> behind<00:03:08.830> the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
shooting there's a science behind the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.520 
shooting there's a science behind the
precision<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:10.630> are<00:03:10.750> many<00:03:10.900> factors<00:03:11.260> that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
precision there are many factors that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.500 
precision there are many factors that
will<00:03:11.770> determine<00:03:11.830> where<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.730> actually<00:03:13.000> aim

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
will determine where you actually aim

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.130 
will determine where you actually aim
