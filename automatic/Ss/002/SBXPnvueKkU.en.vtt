00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
a foldable and say hey this word is
parallel<00:01:58.290> that's<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.680> miss<00:01:58.890> Obie<00:01:59.219> said<00:01:59.250> and

parallel that's what miss Obie said and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.730 
parallel that's what miss Obie said and
parallel<00:02:00.240> means<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.750> lines<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.170> equal<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
parallel means the lines are equal I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.499 
parallel means the lines are equal I
know<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.399> makes<00:02:02.579> sense<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.149> wrote<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
my philosophy is to hire the very best

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.460 
my philosophy is to hire the very best
people<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.430> we<00:02:46.579> can<00:02:46.849> empower<00:02:47.540> them<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.049> do

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
people that we can empower them to do

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.259 
people that we can empower them to do
their<00:02:48.680> jobs<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.430> then<00:02:49.940> hold<00:02:50.150> them

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
their jobs and then hold them

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.509 
their jobs and then hold them
accountable<00:02:50.359> because<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.470> teacher<00:02:51.709> can<00:02:52.489> be

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
accountable because the teacher can be

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.399 
accountable because the teacher can be
teaching<00:02:52.879> away<00:02:53.299> all<00:02:53.569> day<00:02:53.780> long<00:02:54.019> but<00:02:54.170> if<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
teaching away all day long but if the

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.080 
teaching away all day long but if the
kids<00:02:54.650> aren't<00:02:54.829> learning<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.310> what's<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.909> point

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
kids aren't learning it what's the point

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.059 
kids aren't learning it what's the point
so<00:02:56.480> that's<00:02:56.629> why<00:02:56.780> when<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:56.989> do<00:02:57.079> observations<00:02:57.379> I

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
so that's why when I do observations I

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.009 
so that's why when I do observations I
want<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.370> hear<00:02:58.489> from<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.849> kids<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.450> see<00:02:59.780> what

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
want to hear from the kids to see what

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.899 
want to hear from the kids to see what
value<00:03:00.590> they<00:03:00.739> place<00:03:01.010> on<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> learning<00:03:01.549> has<00:03:01.760> it

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
value they place on the learning has it

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.580 
value they place on the learning has it
been<00:03:02.060> communicated<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.720> them<00:03:02.959> why<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.290> is

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
been communicated to them why this is

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.280 
been communicated to them why this is
important<00:03:04.220> is<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.849> challenging<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.629> why<00:03:06.170> is

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
important is this challenging you why is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.509 
important is this challenging you why is
this<00:03:06.409> important<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.159> you<00:03:07.310> learn<00:03:07.459> about

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
this important that you learn about

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:15.000 
this important that you learn about
these<00:03:07.940> outer<00:03:08.150> planets<00:03:08.629> why<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.049> important

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.220 

after<00:03:16.010> observations<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.239> walkthroughs<00:03:17.480> we

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
after observations and walkthroughs we

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.559 
after observations and walkthroughs we
certainly<00:03:18.680> follow<00:03:19.190> up<00:03:19.310> with<00:03:19.880> reflective

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
certainly follow up with reflective

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.720 
certainly follow up with reflective
conversations<00:03:21.380> what<00:03:21.680> do<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.859> think<00:03:22.040> went

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
conversations what do you think went

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.970 
conversations what do you think went
well<00:03:22.940> with<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.629> with<00:03:24.139> both<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.470> lesson<00:03:24.859> and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
well with that with both that lesson and

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.009 
well with that with both that lesson and
the<00:03:25.099> whole<00:03:25.220> unit<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.120> when<00:03:26.299> I<00:03:26.329> can<00:03:26.720> ask

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
the whole unit and so when I can ask

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.319 
the whole unit and so when I can ask
questions<00:03:27.859> that<00:03:28.040> cause<00:03:28.280> them<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.700> reflect<00:03:29.120> on

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
questions that cause them to reflect on

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.900 
questions that cause them to reflect on
their<00:03:29.450> own<00:03:29.510> practice<00:03:29.780> on<00:03:30.260> their<00:03:30.620> own

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
their own practice on their own

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.000 
their own practice on their own
strategies<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.359> that<00:03:32.540> they<00:03:32.690> discover<00:03:33.349> a<00:03:33.650> new

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
strategies so that they discover a new

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.740 
strategies so that they discover a new
and<00:03:34.190> better<00:03:34.310> way<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.579> teach<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.180> same<00:03:35.389> skill

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
and better way to teach the same skill

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.599 
and better way to teach the same skill
the<00:03:36.200> retention<00:03:36.530> rate<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.949> that<00:03:37.099> for<00:03:37.310> teachers

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
the retention rate of that for teachers

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.759 
the retention rate of that for teachers
going<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:37.879> be<00:03:37.940> far<00:03:38.239> longer<00:03:38.720> lasting<00:03:38.930> then<00:03:39.530> if<00:03:39.650> I

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
going to be far longer lasting then if I

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.409

great<00:04:50.460> athletic<00:04:50.700> program<00:04:51.210> actually<00:04:51.480> we<00:04:51.780> see

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
great athletic program actually we see

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.960 
great athletic program actually we see
it<00:04:52.050> just<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.380> opposite<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:53.100> having<00:04:53.880> a

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
it just the opposite that having a

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.290 
it just the opposite that having a
participatory<00:04:54.870> culture<00:04:55.020> here<00:04:55.710> at<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.920> school

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
participatory culture here at the school

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.320 
participatory culture here at the school
actually<00:04:57.300> helps<00:04:57.720> raise<00:04:58.590> expectations

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
actually helps raise expectations

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.590 
actually helps raise expectations

and it actually supports academic

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.910 
and it actually supports academic
achievement<00:05:03.720> in<00:05:03.780> our<00:05:03.900> classrooms<00:05:04.350> I<00:05:04.590> think

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
achievement in our classrooms I think

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.590 
achievement in our classrooms I think
it's<00:05:05.070> kind<00:05:05.310> of<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.490> unique<00:05:05.790> environment<00:05:06.120> from

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
it's kind of a unique environment from

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.020 
it's kind of a unique environment from
other<00:05:06.780> middle<00:05:07.320> schools<00:05:07.620> because<00:05:08.100> it<00:05:08.490> focuses

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
other middle schools because it focuses

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.140 
other middle schools because it focuses
so<00:05:09.810> much<00:05:09.870> on<00:05:09.990> not<00:05:10.560> just<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.340> arts<00:05:11.610> or<00:05:11.760> not<00:05:11.910> just

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
so much on not just the arts or not just

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.210 
so much on not just the arts or not just
academics<00:05:12.690> it<00:05:12.870> really<00:05:13.140> incorporates<00:05:13.590> both<00:05:13.890> I

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
academics it really incorporates both I

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.040 
academics it really incorporates both I
