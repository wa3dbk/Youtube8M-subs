work<00:00:44.900> out<00:00:45.110> for<00:00:45.410> me

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
work out for me

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.100 
work out for me
either<00:00:46.280> 10<00:00:46.670> minutes<00:00:47.030> wasn't<00:00:47.390> long<00:00:47.570> enough<00:00:47.900> or

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
either 10 minutes wasn't long enough or

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.560 
either 10 minutes wasn't long enough or
I<00:00:48.860> should<00:00:49.280> have<00:00:49.550> just<00:00:49.790> taken<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.300> head<00:00:50.449> of

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
I should have just taken the head of

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.770 
I should have just taken the head of
cabbage<00:00:50.989> put<00:00:51.559> it<00:00:51.680> in<00:00:51.830> a<00:00:52.220> boiling<00:00:52.940> pot<00:00:53.239> of<00:00:53.479> water

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780

and<00:00:54.170> let<00:00:54.409> it<00:00:54.440> cook<00:00:54.620> our<00:00:55.190> simmer<00:00:55.699> for<00:00:56.089> 10<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.780> 20

and let it cook our simmer for 10 to 20

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.180 
and let it cook our simmer for 10 to 20
minutes<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:57.559> think<00:00:57.769> that<00:00:57.920> would<00:00:58.070> have<00:00:58.159> worked

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
minutes I think that would have worked

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.820 
minutes I think that would have worked
better<00:00:58.549> but<00:00:59.360> next<00:00:59.600> I'm<00:00:59.930> using<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.350> same<00:01:00.530> pot

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
better but next I'm using the same pot

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.030 
better but next I'm using the same pot
it's<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.129> nice<00:01:01.339> sized<00:01:01.610> pot<00:01:02.150> /<00:01:02.600> pan<00:01:03.019> but<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.710> just

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
it's a nice sized pot / pan but I just

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.580 
it's a nice sized pot / pan but I just
put<00:01:04.280> some<00:01:04.400> olive<00:01:04.820> oil<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.720> brown<00:01:06.080> some

just<00:01:09.770> let<00:01:09.950> them<00:01:10.040> get<00:01:10.159> a<00:01:10.220> little<00:01:10.580> bit<00:01:10.700> soft

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
the box that seemed to be vegan

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.180 
the box that seemed to be vegan
it<00:01:41.300> didn't<00:01:41.660> say<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.810> contain<00:01:42.260> animal<00:01:42.710> products

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.720 
and it was supposed to be olive oil and
garlic<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:45.860> wasn't<00:01:46.160> like<00:01:46.280> chicken

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
to peel the head of lettuce you drain it

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.180 
to peel the head of lettuce you drain it
and<00:02:14.209> then<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.810> want<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.140> peel<00:02:15.440> off<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.980> leaves

stuff and just falls all out so then I

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.170 
stuff and just falls all out so then I
put<00:02:39.409> them<00:02:39.739> in<00:02:39.859> the<00:02:39.950> frying<00:02:40.219> pan<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.579> want<00:02:40.969> them

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.140 
rolling plus the cabbage leaves weren't
cooperating<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:45.950> pour<00:02:46.249> all<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.760> extra

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
sauce on top of it and that's like a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.759 
sauce on top of it and that's like a
mushroom<00:02:53.299> something<00:02:53.959> type<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.379> spaghetti

much spaghetti sauce but it was
wonderful<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.269> seemed<00:03:26.540> balanced<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.409> the
