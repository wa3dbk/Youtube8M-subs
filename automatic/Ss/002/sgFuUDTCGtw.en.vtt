00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
ending of last year I thought I had a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.320 
ending of last year I thought I had a
really<00:01:40.830> nice<00:01:41.040> run<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.760> end<00:01:41.940> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> year

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
really nice run for the end of the year

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.090 
and just like to come back and build off
that<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.440> start<00:01:46.440> strong<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> then

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that and start strong and then

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859 
that and start strong and then
maintained<00:01:47.970> throughout<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> rest<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
maintained throughout the rest of the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.370 
maintained throughout the rest of the
team<00:01:49.560> expectations<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.460> think<00:01:50.750> we<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:52.200> weren't

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
team expectations I think we we weren't

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.399 
team expectations I think we we weren't
we<00:01:53.070> weren't<00:01:53.640> satisfied<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.240> last<00:01:54.479> year<00:01:54.780> we

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
we weren't satisfied with last year we

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
we weren't satisfied with last year we
were<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:55.920> spot<00:01:56.220> out<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:57.060> had<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> chance

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
were one spot out we had a chance

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.350 
were one spot out we had a chance
towards<00:01:57.899> end<00:01:58.080> make<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> run<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.250> kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.149> lost

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
towards end make a run and kind of lost

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.359 
towards end make a run and kind of lost
a<00:02:00.509> couple<00:02:00.690> key<00:02:00.960> games<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:02.040> year<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> think

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
a couple key games and this year I think

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.340 
a couple key games and this year I think
we<00:02:02.700> want<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.970> come<00:02:03.090> back<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:04.140> don't<00:02:04.259> want

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
we want to come back and we don't want

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.380 
we want to come back and we don't want
to<00:02:04.500> lose<00:02:04.710> those<00:02:04.920> key<00:02:05.130> games<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to lose those key games and we want to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.779 
to lose those key games and we want to
become<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.350> better<00:02:07.530> teams<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.220> in

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
become one of the better teams and in

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.790 
become one of the better teams and in
our<00:02:08.940> division<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.539> make<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> run<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.380> playoffs

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
our division and make a run in playoffs

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.460 
our division and make a run in playoffs
and<00:02:11.130> eventually<00:02:11.910> win<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.600> Clark<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.410> i

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and eventually win the Clark up so i

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.660 
and eventually win the Clark up so i
