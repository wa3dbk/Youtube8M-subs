 to the dressmaker welcome or girlfriend to me 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.620
 channel my name is Carlos for those who 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.629
 they do not know me and must make a new 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 portal called window of the networks 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.139
 of which I was carved by matías 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.840
 from the matías channel I see ash from 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.210
 paper that consists of giving a book to 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.859
 a social network if this is a series of 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.439
 characteristics if it was not understood 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 wait to see what the answers are and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.570
 they will already understand the truth that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.570
 pretty simple 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.660
 the first social networks twitter me 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.090
 book still short favorite book colleges 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.770
 living the girl by elisabeth scott 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.720
 extensive books about a girl that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.520
 they show up and I do not want to say anything else 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.860
 about the plot because it would ruin them 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.540
 history I chose this book because in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.699
 less than 200 pages made me feel 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.140
 all the books of eight hundred fails 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.180
 make me feel and sincerely 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.860
 completely shocked I did not have him 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.269
 many expectations to the story because 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.739
 I had read several that you have that were 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.199
 quite negative but the truth is that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.030
 ended up charming there are many others 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.579
 short books that I also like but 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 none at the level that he did to this one is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 the following social networks facebook 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.810
 with book that many people in are 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
 recommended that lauren deluren 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.039
 oliver this is a book that I am 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.500
 reading now we could say it of 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.500
 about two months ago because I the page 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.119
 300 if I had to leave you're 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.850
 unbearable I do not like absolutely 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.530
 nothing and if at any time I finish it goes 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.840
 to be one of the negative reviews that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 I have done because it honestly happens to me 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.380
 a lot of the protagonist of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 appears insufferable and although the idea is 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.090
 spectacular I think the author 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 I feel it is torture to move forward with 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.630
 this book every page that you read seems 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.270
 as if it had been hours and hours 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.820
 endless reading it and it does not pass 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 the time and I do not like and I hate 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.690
 abandon books but with this I had it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 what to do I will see when I take it back 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.410
 I hope the end does not disappoint me 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.060
 because if over the end of disappointments 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.820
 I would have absolutely nothing 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.440
 salvageable at least for me 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.030
 you what they like both 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.350
 the story I understand what can 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.909
 get to like but if only me 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.680
 fails to convince me 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.119
 following social networks also a 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.979
 book that you gave him before he went 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.690
 popular as everyone we set 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.030
 another same star that I did not want 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.950
 say also under the same star I'm going 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.650
 to say it's run or die or 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.239
 resonate for sensations since the two 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 first books about two years ago 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.280
 and a bit more even than me 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.989
 they had loved it so good for that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.140
 very recently the solar is 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.720
 much more is sada 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.670
 it was not exactly the opposite it ends 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.080
 sell and that's why I say that these are the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.720
 books that I enjoy that they were 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.410
 popular myspace a book that does not 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.760
 I remember if I liked it or not this is something 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.620
 strange because if I remember that I 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.650
 liked I even have the reviews for 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.400
 check it but checked crystal 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.650
 be aj more I spend a little strange yes 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.959
 I liked for more than bear in the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.250
 history and in the things that I remember 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.050
 of history because the law does 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.750
 long time about a year ago 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.330
 gave out there and I give back many things 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.250
 what I remember about her is common but this 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.840
 it was half in nothing but this I 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.340
 ends up convincing and now that what 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.800
 I think this was not so well done 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.269
 as I thought so that 's the subject 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.000
 with this book at the time there was no 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.130
 delighted but the more I think about it 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.989
 more after I did not if what I said in his 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.000
 moment what I thought at the time 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.560
 I still appear today or 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.750
 whether I reread layers that I do not like 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.890
 as much as in its moment to urge a 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.700
 book that the most beautiful cover and this 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.190
 do not 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.129
 do anything to me and all that book I'm going 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.190
 to take out with the follow-up I swear to you for my 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.680
 mom I was watching all over the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.750
 shelf to see if I found another 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.610
 book with the cover that I would like more 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.650
 that this serious part that brings us to 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.090
 where the trees sing of laura 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.580
 gallego garcía has the cover more 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.130
 beautiful of all the books of all the 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.130
 world is precious the issue above is 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.900
 He continued that this continued to fall 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.580
 and more the edition is beautiful inside 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.950
 and it's a beautiful book and the cover is 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.400
 beautiful and it is impossible that the cantes 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.860
 God I love you so much booklets all 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.079
 book that I would like to see in film is 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.370
 I was thinking a bit between all the 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.959
 books that I have that I would like that 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.790
 are movies in which I would like more 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.549
 that they did it if they respect it is 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.989
 exactly the same story is pure 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.940
 they plunder down I think the story 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.030
 has absolutely everything to make a 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.130
 great movie and if the cause of everything 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.350
 exactly like this with all the love things 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.290
 from this story it would be perfect me 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.270
 I would love it because you have two deformed and 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.490
 that story and everything 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.660
 to all but the first two 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.120
 parts of at least the technology 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.740
 they look excellent I'm hoping that 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.300
 be third I hope that the public of the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.700
 Argentina wins because there is no 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.350
 news about that but seriously this 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.990
 book if it were movie I think it would be 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.750
 absolutely great as long as I 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.880
 respect and finally build book 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.410
 that I am always recommending for 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.630
 everyone who knows me about what they are 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.670
 books is hunter shadows hunting 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.680
 of clearing the entire room not only 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.270
 this but also the origins and all 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.100
 the other things that you want 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.870
 writing this author apart is amazing 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.970
 and this saga and the world and everything is like 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.590
 very wow and I love her and that's the super 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.570
 I recommend and if you told me 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.280
 read it because the netflix we will dominate 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.410
 the world saga project is the best thing that 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.480
 exists and I love it and it's the best and I'm 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.640
 waiting for the following yes and I'm already 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.830
 saying the same thing many times and I do not 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.210
 it matters because we have plotted and if you 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.640
 is with a blanket in the middle because in 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.140
 seriously seriously burnett feeling before 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.850
 to finish this video and before leaving 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.410
 I want to carve label or whatever 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.360
 tell some people to 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.480
 make this video one of them is julieta 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.430
 of the channel of letters 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.850
 another is that watching the channel that today I and 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.230
 another is arianna de book and and tell 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.970
 all these people who are at odds 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.350
 channels will be in the box of 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.670
 the description but if you want to see it at 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.200
 like the matías channel of the 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.240
 files that I dedicate everything so 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.490
 I 'm sure you already know it but also 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.350
 I leave them in case it is not the case a kiss 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.850
 very very big and see you next 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.250
 video and most likely it's the 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.250
 raptor since I got hooked
