00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everyone this is apple style and today I show the key you have tv 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.270
 delegated dtt 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.600
 this key is used to watch digital terrestrial TV on your mac 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.789
 And of the very interesting features we will now see together 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.840
 then 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.550
 in the package we find 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.340
 obviously the jaw itself a small extension vs bin the adjustable antenna 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.109
 with standard connection 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.319
 the rai tv software tel. 0 the instruction manual 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.170
 since the direct equipped with a standard antenna connector 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.890
 hotel use the supplied antenna we can use directly 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.740
 the home antenna that would be the one with the classic white cable 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.500
 in this way the signal quality improves a lot compared to 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.570
 the duck antenna 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.170
 which is perhaps more suitable for outdoor use 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.620
 now let's take a look at haiti bittorrent software and what we do 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.020
 allows you to do 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 this in the main screen of the software that is very tidy 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.530
 It is easy to use 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.930
 on this Trojan column the channels are the electronic program guide 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.110
 Our favorite channels are our recordings 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.300
 favorite channels are displayed as a guide to the various 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.370
 transmissions 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.580
 and as you can see all the TV programs are shown spectively 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.490
 using different colors based on the transmission theme 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.960
 always from this screen we can program the recordings 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.950
 simply by clicking on the program that interests us 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.490
 here we have some additional information on the film and with that 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.720
 button the program is added 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.700
 an interesting thing is that even if our mac game stop 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.880
 hai tb records the same bet by activating the computer at the right time 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.900
 here instead we have our recordings that can be 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.310
 display directly or your ipod aifon ooh can be exported 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.830
 apple tv 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.160
 video quality is very good especially if we use antenna of 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.329
 home 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:15.109
 and for the chessonno omg channels there are four thirds if we are interested 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.349
 next to us we can adapt the image to our screen 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.649
 to prevent the black bands from coming in this proportion 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:24.889
 16 noni 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.139
 and the image is enlarged to full screen 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.979
 back to normal view 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.459
 and while we're in full-screen mode, I show that we can 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.019
 also use the apple remote app to control the television 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.809
 in this case, just hold down the menu button for a few seconds 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.189
 on the remote water 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.629
 to have this screen that allows us to browse through our own 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.489
 record our channels and electronic program guide in a very way 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.989
 comfortable intuitive 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.610
 another very comfortable thing for the break had it allowing us to put in 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.909
 break publishing turn what we were seeing on TV 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.639
 the price of this key is about 59 euros 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.449
 it works very well the video quality is excellent and above all offers some 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:18.159
 very interesting feature I am now using grimmie mecca 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.789
 by 27 inches and I must say that I completely replaced the TV 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.540
 however this was apple style as always 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.370
 do not hesitate to ask me your questions 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.849
 waves and above all subscribe to my channel and we'll see each other 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:33.400
 video
