00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
about the fact that time really happens

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.750 
about the fact that time really happens
in<00:00:59.280> two<00:00:59.460> dimensions<00:01:00.949> there's<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> horizontal

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
in two dimensions there's the horizontal

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
in two dimensions there's the horizontal
where<00:01:03.629> time<00:01:04.080> happens<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.739> beat<00:01:04.920> after<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
where time happens one beat after the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.120 
where time happens one beat after the
other<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.760> two<00:01:06.270> three<00:01:06.869> four<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.010> know

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
other one two three four one you know

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.700 
other one two three four one you know
just<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> goes<00:01:08.909> off<00:01:09.060> into<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> future

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
just kind of goes off into the future

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.630 
just kind of goes off into the future
but<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> vertical<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.760> I'm<00:01:11.939> beat<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:13.640> if

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
but in the vertical like I'm beat one if

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.830 
but in the vertical like I'm beat one if
you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.909> take<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.750> you're

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you can take like out like if you're

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620

tight<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.100> kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.430> mess

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
tight you know it's it's kind of a mess

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.460 
tight you know it's it's kind of a mess
but<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.329> everybody's<00:01:42.659> playing<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> exactly

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
but if everybody's playing it exactly

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
but if everybody's playing it exactly
the<00:01:43.590> same<00:01:43.649> instant<00:01:44.280> vertically<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the same instant vertically on the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.139 
the same instant vertically on the
downbeat<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.619> they're<00:01:47.310> lined<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.939> or

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
downbeat of one if they're lined up or

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.840 
downbeat of one if they're lined up or
in<00:01:48.450> alignment<00:01:48.720> vertically<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:50.220> everything

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
in alignment vertically then everything

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.389 
in alignment vertically then everything
sounds<00:01:51.180> clean<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> tight<00:01:52.280> when<00:01:53.280> you're

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
sounds clean and tight when you're

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.700 
sounds clean and tight when you're
playing<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.820> band<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.259> concepts

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
playing in a band this this concepts

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.889 
playing in a band this this concepts
really<00:01:56.070> useful<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.360> listen<00:01:57.750> down

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
really useful because if you listen down

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.050 
really useful because if you listen down
to<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> drummer<00:01:58.469> ferroans<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.640> everyone's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to the drummer ferroans if everyone's

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120 
to the drummer ferroans if everyone's
playing<00:02:00.299> their<00:02:00.509> their<00:02:00.990> horizontal<00:02:01.320> time<00:02:01.829> nice

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
playing their their horizontal time nice

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.459 
playing their their horizontal time nice
and<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.490> time<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.000> everybody<00:02:03.960> listens<00:02:04.259> down

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
and in time and everybody listens down

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.630 
and in time and everybody listens down
vertically<00:02:05.369> down<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.360> like

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
vertically down to the you know like

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.639 
vertically down to the you know like
whatever<00:02:07.420> lines<00:02:07.750> up<00:02:07.960> with<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.140> parts<00:02:08.560> that

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
whatever lines up with the parts that

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.650 
whatever lines up with the parts that
they're<00:02:08.860> playing<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:10.030> whole<00:02:10.179> band<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.539> going

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
they're playing the whole band is going

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.330 
they're playing the whole band is going
to<00:02:10.750> sound<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.020> lot<00:02:11.110> tighter<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.530> lot<00:02:11.709> quicker<00:02:12.010> if

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
to sound a lot tighter a lot quicker if

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.580 
to sound a lot tighter a lot quicker if
you<00:02:13.300> ignore<00:02:13.540> these<00:02:13.720> things<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.170> usually<00:02:14.440> just

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
you ignore these things it usually just

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.050 
you ignore these things it usually just
sounds<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:14.950> kind<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.310> big<00:02:15.490> mess<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.970> this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
sounds like kind of a big mess and this

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.840 
sounds like kind of a big mess and this
is<00:02:16.209> this<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.200> one<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.470> concepts<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.100> if<00:02:18.700> i

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
is this is one of the concepts that if i

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.350 
is this is one of the concepts that if i
can<00:02:18.880> get<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.740> band<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:20.860> young<00:02:21.040> players<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.640> think

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
can get a band of young players to think

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.510 
can get a band of young players to think
about<00:02:22.660> they<00:02:23.050> sound<00:02:23.590> tighter<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.370> lot

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
about they sound tighter and a lot

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.100 
about they sound tighter and a lot
better<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.880> lot<00:02:24.970> more<00:02:25.240> professional<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.900> lot

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
better a lot more professional a lot

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.870 
better a lot more professional a lot
quicker<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.400> actually<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.700> pretty

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
quicker and it's actually a pretty

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.250 
quicker and it's actually a pretty
simple<00:02:28.150> concept<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.959> have<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.140> make

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
simple concept you just have to make

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.370 
simple concept you just have to make
people<00:02:29.590> aware<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:31.420> know<00:02:31.570> time<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.350> know

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
people aware that you know time you know

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.229 
people aware that you know time you know
everyone's<00:02:33.010> playing<00:02:33.340> at<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.580> same<00:02:33.760> time<00:02:34.000> and

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
everyone's playing at the same time and

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.840 
everyone's playing at the same time and
you<00:02:34.300> need<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.540> pay<00:02:34.690> attention<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:36.160> make<00:02:36.790> sure

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
you need to pay attention and make sure

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.170 
you need to pay attention and make sure
that<00:02:37.000> you're<00:02:37.180> nice<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.300> tight<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:39.180> these

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
that you're nice and tight so these

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.080 
that you're nice and tight so these
exercises<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:41.200> page<00:02:41.440> 17<00:02:42.010> we<00:02:42.580> have<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.730> metronome

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
exercises on page 17 we have a metronome

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.449 
exercises on page 17 we have a metronome
on<00:02:43.209> 60<00:02:43.630> all<00:02:44.620> right<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.130> way<00:02:45.220> we're<00:02:45.370> going

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
on 60 all right and the way we're going

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.840 
on 60 all right and the way we're going
to<00:02:45.519> deal<00:02:45.700> with<00:02:45.880> our<00:02:46.030> vertical<00:02:46.390> time<00:02:46.720> alignment

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
to deal with our vertical time alignment

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.850 
to deal with our vertical time alignment
you<00:02:48.850> got<00:02:49.030> your<00:02:49.209> metronome<00:02:49.540> happening<00:02:50.140> we're

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
you got your metronome happening we're

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.880 
you got your metronome happening we're
going<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.070> tap<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.550> foot<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.810> click<00:02:53.140> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
going to tap your foot on that click so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.960 
going to tap your foot on that click so
that's<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.160> first<00:02:54.340> thing<00:02:54.519> that's<00:02:54.700> going<00:02:54.910> to

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
that's the first thing that's going to

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.210 
that's the first thing that's going to
happen<00:02:55.410> everything<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.830> play<00:02:57.040> you're

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
happen everything that you play you're

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.759 
happen everything that you play you're
feeling<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:57.640> quarter<00:02:58.450> note<00:02:58.630> pulse<00:02:58.930> with<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
feeling that quarter note pulse with the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.280 
feeling that quarter note pulse with the
metronome<00:03:00.480> you're<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.690> count<00:03:01.989> out<00:03:02.260> loud

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
metronome you're going to count out loud

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.759 
metronome you're going to count out loud
with<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.980> now<00:03:03.489> we're<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.750> meter<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.350> four

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
with that now we're in a meter of four

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.050 
with that now we're in a meter of four
we're<00:03:06.010> counting<00:03:06.400> four<00:03:06.610> beats<00:03:06.820> for<00:03:07.000> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
we're counting four beats for the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:17.240 
we're counting four beats for the
measure<00:03:10.290> 1234<00:03:12.299> 1234<00:03:14.910> make<00:03:15.910> sure<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.239> do<00:03:16.450> this

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
measure 1234 1234 make sure you do this

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.890 
measure 1234 1234 make sure you do this
get<00:03:18.250> used<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.790> time<00:03:19.000> happening<00:03:19.690> don't

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
get used to the time happening don't

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.330 
get used to the time happening don't

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
metronome you kind of want to look at at

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.259 
metronome you kind of want to look at at
time<00:03:23.410> as<00:03:23.680> almost<00:03:24.459> being<00:03:24.610> like<00:03:24.790> you're<00:03:25.060> staying

you're not feeling it you're not feeling
it<00:07:14.169> consistently<00:07:14.889> then<00:07:15.669> what<00:07:15.849> you're<00:07:16.000> playing

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150 
it consistently then what you're playing

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.550 
it consistently then what you're playing
musically<00:07:16.629> is<00:07:16.689> not<00:07:16.840> going<00:07:16.960> to<00:07:17.050> make<00:07:17.139> very<00:07:17.379> much

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 
musically is not going to make very much

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.790 
musically is not going to make very much
sense<00:07:18.330> the<00:07:19.330> next<00:07:19.659> lesson<00:07:20.020> after<00:07:20.469> this<00:07:20.590> is

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
sense the next lesson after this is

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.059 
sense the next lesson after this is
about<00:07:20.979> eighth<00:07:21.279> notes<00:07:21.669> and<00:07:22.199> if<00:07:23.199> you<00:07:23.620> can't<00:07:23.860> do

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:24.069 
about eighth notes and if you can't do

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.249 
about eighth notes and if you can't do
this<00:07:24.310> then<00:07:24.969> actually<00:07:25.389> subdividing<00:07:26.229> the

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:26.259 
this then actually subdividing the

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:28.409 
this then actually subdividing the
quarter<00:07:26.650> note<00:07:26.800> or<00:07:26.979> dividing<00:07:27.639> it<00:07:27.729> in<00:07:27.819> half<00:07:27.879> is

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:28.419 
quarter note or dividing it in half is

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.209 
quarter note or dividing it in half is
going<00:07:28.689> to<00:07:28.750> be<00:07:28.839> very<00:07:28.990> very<00:07:29.110> difficult<00:07:29.439> and<00:07:30.039> that

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:30.219 
going to be very very difficult and that

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:32.209 
going to be very very difficult and that
means<00:07:30.430> that<00:07:30.610> any<00:07:30.759> kind<00:07:31.029> of<00:07:31.120> strumming<00:07:31.479> or
