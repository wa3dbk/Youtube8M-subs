a new magazine or a new person will come
along<00:01:14.760> where<00:01:15.180> I'd<00:01:15.270> read<00:01:15.450> another<00:01:15.689> article

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
along where I'd read another article

online<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> different<00:01:17.580> way

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
online and I would see a different way

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.130 
online and I would see a different way
to<00:01:17.729> train<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> I'd<00:01:18.540> say<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.960> what

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
to train back and I'd say you know what

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.170 
to train back and I'd say you know what
I'm<00:01:19.320> not<00:01:19.920> seeing<00:01:20.189> results<00:01:20.220> currently<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> need

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I'm not seeing results currently I need

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
I'm not seeing results currently I need
to<00:01:21.270> switch<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.500> ended<00:01:22.740> up

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to switch to this so what ended up

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.469 
to switch to this so what ended up
happening<00:01:22.890> was<00:01:23.340> every<00:01:23.700> couple<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.090> weeks<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
happening was every couple of weeks I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.810 
happening was every couple of weeks I
would<00:01:24.659> totally<00:01:24.840> revamp<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.619> routine<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.340> in

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
would totally revamp my routine and in

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
would totally revamp my routine and in
the<00:01:26.939> end<00:01:27.090> what<00:01:27.420> happened<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.650> got

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the end what happened was I really got

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
the end what happened was I really got
away<00:01:29.009> from<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.369> basics<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.939> worked<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
away from the basics that worked the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.469 
away from the basics that worked the
best<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.439> doing<00:01:31.920> drop<00:01:32.159> sets<00:01:32.490> supersets<00:01:33.210> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
best because doing drop sets supersets I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
best because doing drop sets supersets I
didn't<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.170> far<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.650> people<00:01:34.950> go<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.189> see

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
didn't go as far as some people go I see

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.920 
didn't go as far as some people go I see
people<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> gym<00:01:36.150> doing<00:01:36.360> all<00:01:36.570> these<00:01:36.720> weird

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
people in the gym doing all these weird

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
people in the gym doing all these weird
exercises<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.829> stability<00:01:38.100> balls<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.850> whatnot

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
exercises on stability balls and whatnot

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.179 
exercises on stability balls and whatnot
but<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> looked<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.439> routine<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.009> got

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
but when I looked at my routine I got

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.819 
but when I looked at my routine I got
away<00:01:41.340> from<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.759> basics<00:01:42.210> bench<00:01:42.630> Rose<00:01:43.229> squats

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
away from the basics bench Rose squats

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.609 
away from the basics bench Rose squats
deadlifts<00:01:44.579> military<00:01:45.299> press<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.990> that's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
deadlifts military press and that's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.319 
deadlifts military press and that's
really<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> problem<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> time

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
really a problem that I see all the time

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.780 
really a problem that I see all the time
we<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.200> we're<00:01:49.350> doing<00:01:49.380> ourselves<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.250> service

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
we think we're doing ourselves a service

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.149 
we think we're doing ourselves a service
by<00:01:51.000> learning<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:52.079> implementing<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:52.950> these

gains<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.169> good<00:02:44.439> if<00:02:44.709> you're<00:02:45.189> in<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
gains and that is good if you're in a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.099 
gains and that is good if you're in a
routine<00:02:45.760> currently<00:02:46.299> where<00:02:46.540> you're<00:02:46.689> making

progress there's no reason in my opinion

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.199 
progress there's no reason in my opinion
to<00:02:49.629> switch<00:02:50.049> from<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.469> again<00:02:51.219> you<00:02:51.639> need<00:02:51.909> to<00:02:52.090> be

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
to switch from that again you need to be

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.330 
to switch from that again you need to be
consistent<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.079> you<00:02:53.319> need<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.620> have<00:02:53.799> patience

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
consistent and you need to have patience

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.159 
consistent and you need to have patience
you<00:02:54.819> don't<00:02:55.120> want<00:02:55.299> overcomplicate<00:02:56.139> things

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
you don't want overcomplicate things

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.559 
you don't want overcomplicate things
because<00:02:56.889> in<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.099> end<00:02:57.129> it<00:02:58.060> could<00:02:58.269> be<00:02:58.359> a<00:02:58.389> mistake

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
because in the end it could be a mistake

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.780 
because in the end it could be a mistake
you're<00:02:58.930> making<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.739> not<00:02:59.889> building<00:03:00.189> muscle<00:03:00.250> as

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
you're making and not building muscle as
