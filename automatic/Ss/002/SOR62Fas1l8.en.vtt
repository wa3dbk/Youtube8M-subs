this<00:01:52.320> into<00:01:52.829> place<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:54.060> into<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> engine

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
this into place down into the engine

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.280 
this into place down into the engine
until<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.170> seats<00:01:55.909> then<00:01:56.909> at<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.180> point<00:01:57.479> we'll

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
until it seats then at that point we'll

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.660 
until it seats then at that point we'll
take<00:01:59.180> this<00:02:00.180> piece<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:01.680> tip<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.189> put<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.520> in

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
take this piece this tip and put that in

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.399 
take this piece this tip and put that in
there<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:03.719> we'll<00:02:03.840> take<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.170> other

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
there and then we'll take this other

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.100 
there and then we'll take this other
piece<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.979> thread<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.969> down<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.570> then

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
piece and thread this down and then

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.510 
piece and thread this down and then
you're<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.439> thread<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.860> down<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
you're going to thread this down all the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.550 
you're going to thread this down all the
way<00:02:08.670> until<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.030> seats<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.959> what's<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.379> what

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
way until it seats now what's that what

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.059 
way until it seats now what's that what
that<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.430> is

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
that is going to do is

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.520 
that is going to do is
going<00:02:12.189> to<00:02:12.249> push<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.609> rest<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.999> this<00:02:13.120> porcelain

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
going to push the rest of this porcelain

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.470 
going to push the rest of this porcelain
down<00:02:14.530> through<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.459> plug<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.030> out<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.299> end

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
down through the plug and out the end

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.239 
down through the plug and out the end
you<00:02:16.689> can<00:02:16.840> see<00:02:17.019> it<00:02:17.139> there<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.650> porcelain<00:02:18.129> has

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:18.249 
you can see it there the porcelain has

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.949 
you can see it there the porcelain has
been<00:02:18.430> pushed<00:02:18.639> through<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.969> end<00:02:19.150> I've<00:02:19.629> already

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
been pushed through the end I've already

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.110 
been pushed through the end I've already
repaired<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.469> one<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.519> push<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.909> down

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
repaired this one so you push that down

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.940 
repaired this one so you push that down
until<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.599> fully<00:02:22.749> seats<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:25.260> then<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.709> take

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
until it fully seats and then you take

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.399 
until it fully seats and then you take
the<00:02:27.099> whole<00:02:27.280> body<00:02:27.609> out<00:02:27.939> again<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.019> unscrew

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
the whole body out again you unscrew

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.129 
the whole body out again you unscrew
this<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.010> take<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:31.329> whole<00:02:31.569> piece<00:02:31.870> out

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
this and take it this whole piece out

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.830 
this and take it this whole piece out
and<00:02:32.379> then<00:02:33.159> what<00:02:33.969> you've<00:02:34.090> got<00:02:34.299> left<00:02:34.329> is<00:02:34.719> this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and then what you've got left is this

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.660 
and then what you've got left is this
piece<00:02:35.109> with<00:02:35.409> a<00:02:35.439> Porsche<00:02:35.829> porcelain<00:02:36.430> push

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
piece with a Porsche porcelain push

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.149 
piece with a Porsche porcelain push
through<00:02:37.169> then<00:02:38.169> what<00:02:38.349> you'll<00:02:38.469> do<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.769> take<00:02:38.980> this

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
through then what you'll do is take this

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.009 
through then what you'll do is take this
sleeve<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.669> set<00:02:39.909> this<00:02:40.060> down<00:02:40.269> into<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:40.719> spark

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
sleeve and set this down into the spark

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.259 
sleeve and set this down into the spark
plug<00:02:41.260> tube<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.919> then<00:02:42.819> you're<00:02:42.909> going<00:02:42.999> to<00:02:43.060> take

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
plug tube and then you're going to take

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.569 
plug tube and then you're going to take
this<00:02:43.419> piece<00:02:43.749> which<00:02:44.349> is<00:02:44.500> going<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.739> thread<00:02:45.159> in

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
this piece which is going to thread in

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.559 
this piece which is going to thread in
to<00:02:46.359> what<00:02:46.989> remains<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.950> plug<00:02:48.219> this<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.329> left

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
to what remains of the plug this is left

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.780 
to what remains of the plug this is left
hand<00:02:49.780> these<00:02:49.989> are<00:02:50.139> left<00:02:50.290> handed<00:02:50.439> threads<00:02:50.889> so

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
hand these are left handed threads so

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.909 
hand these are left handed threads so
it's<00:02:52.090> going<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.269> thread<00:02:52.659> right<00:02:53.379> into<00:02:53.709> here

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
it's going to thread right into here

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.819 
it's going to thread right into here
create<00:02:54.280> its<00:02:54.430> own<00:02:54.549> threads<00:02:54.969> and<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.959> grip<00:02:56.590> on

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
create its own threads and and grip on

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.189 
create its own threads and and grip on
there<00:02:57.129> so<00:02:57.549> you<00:02:57.579> turn<00:02:57.909> it<00:02:58.060> left<00:02:58.540> it's<00:02:58.930> going<00:02:59.139> to

00:02:59.189 --> 00:02:59.199 
there so you turn it left it's going to

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.610 
there so you turn it left it's going to
feel<00:02:59.409> tight<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.579> turn<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.449> there<00:03:01.659> until

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
feel tight but turn that in there until

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.580 
feel tight but turn that in there until
you've<00:03:03.280> got<00:03:03.489> several<00:03:04.120> threads<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.840> good<00:03:05.349> grip

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
you've got several threads a good grip

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.399 
you've got several threads a good grip
on<00:03:05.769> there<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:07.510> what<00:03:07.689> you'll<00:03:07.810> do<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.230> take

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
on there then what you'll do is take

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.990 
on there then what you'll do is take
this<00:03:08.590> nut<00:03:08.859> and<00:03:08.889> put<00:03:09.219> it<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.579> end<00:03:09.730> these<00:03:09.939> are

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
this nut and put it on the end these are

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.330 
this nut and put it on the end these are
left<00:03:10.389> handed<00:03:10.540> threads<00:03:10.930> as<00:03:11.079> well<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.919> spin<00:03:12.189> this

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
left handed threads as well so spin this

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.250 
left handed threads as well so spin this
to<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.609> left<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.120> what's<00:03:13.719> going<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.900> happen

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
to the left and what's going to happen

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.780 
to the left and what's going to happen
is<00:03:14.379> this<00:03:14.500> going<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.189> going<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> push

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
is this going to this is going to push

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.949 
is this going to this is going to push
against<00:03:16.269> this<00:03:16.629> sleeve<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:18.659> eventually<00:03:19.659> pull

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
against this sleeve and eventually pull

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.069 
against this sleeve and eventually pull
this<00:03:20.199> whole<00:03:20.409> assembly<00:03:20.769> out<00:03:21.159> so<00:03:21.959> with<00:03:22.959> that

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
this whole assembly out so with that

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.219 
this whole assembly out so with that
gripped<00:03:23.409> on<00:03:23.560> there<00:03:23.799> you're<00:03:23.949> going<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.129> push

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
gripped on there you're going to push

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.170 
gripped on there you're going to push
turn<00:03:26.229> this<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.799> push<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:27.669> out<00:03:27.879> eventually

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
turn this and push this out eventually

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.999 
turn this and push this out eventually
the<00:03:28.419> whole<00:03:28.599> thing<00:03:28.780> will<00:03:28.900> loosen<00:03:29.259> you<00:03:29.680> can<00:03:29.829> pull

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:30.009 
the whole thing will loosen you can pull

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.979 
the whole thing will loosen you can pull
the<00:03:30.129> whole<00:03:30.310> assembly<00:03:30.340> out<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.479> spark<00:03:31.750> plug

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
the whole assembly out of the spark plug

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.929 
the whole assembly out of the spark plug
tube<00:03:32.229> so<00:03:32.889> now<00:03:33.009> let's<00:03:33.159> go<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.459> engine<00:03:33.819> and

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
tube so now let's go to the engine and

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.780 
tube so now let's go to the engine and
show<00:03:34.120> how<00:03:34.239> this<00:03:34.389> works<00:03:35.189> so<00:03:36.189> again<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.609> first

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
show how this works so again the first

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.490 
show how this works so again the first
thing<00:03:37.000> you'll<00:03:37.120> need<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.389> do<00:03:37.509> is<00:03:37.720> take<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.959> magnet

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
thing you'll need to do is take a magnet

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.300 
thing you'll need to do is take a magnet
and<00:03:38.650> pull<00:03:40.049> this<00:03:41.049> end<00:03:41.349> of<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.560> plug<00:03:41.829> that<00:03:42.069> broke

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
and pull this end of the plug that broke

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.390 
and pull this end of the plug that broke
off<00:03:42.519> pull<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.479> out<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.750> there<00:03:44.280> then<00:03:45.280> you'll

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
off pull that out of there then you'll

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.830 
off pull that out of there then you'll
need<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.579> take<00:03:45.790> some<00:03:46.000> pliers<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.540> then<00:03:46.629> pull

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
need to take some pliers and then pull

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.289 
need to take some pliers and then pull
this<00:03:47.019> end<00:03:47.259> of<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.439> plug<00:03:47.680> out<00:03:47.919> and<00:03:48.120> then<00:03:49.120> you'll

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
this end of the plug out and then you'll

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.629 
this end of the plug out and then you'll
have<00:03:49.479> the<00:03:50.049> electrode<00:03:50.530> part<00:03:50.829> stuck<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.549> the

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
have the electrode part stuck in the

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.249 
have the electrode part stuck in the
cylinder<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.209> then<00:03:52.479> we<00:03:52.629> can<00:03:52.780> use<00:03:52.900> our<00:03:53.079> tool

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:53.259 
cylinder and then we can use our tool

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.649 
cylinder and then we can use our tool
from<00:03:53.530> there<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.790> now<00:03:54.939> we<00:03:55.000> just<00:03:55.269> thread<00:03:55.540> the

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
from there so now we just thread the

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.249 
from there so now we just thread the
body<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:56.139> our<00:03:56.259> tool<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:57.870> thread<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.019> into

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
body of our tool in thread that into

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:04.709 
body of our tool in thread that into
place<00:04:00.959> until<00:04:01.959> it's<00:04:02.229> tight<00:04:03.239> then<00:04:04.239> we<00:04:04.359> take<00:04:04.509> the

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:04.719 
place until it's tight then we take the

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.180 
place until it's tight then we take the
other<00:04:04.870> end<00:04:04.989> we<00:04:05.590> put<00:04:06.009> the<00:04:06.159> tip

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
other end we put the tip

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.620 
other end we put the tip
down<00:04:07.850> there<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.300> then<00:04:08.750> we<00:04:09.670> take<00:04:10.670> this<00:04:10.880> end<00:04:11.210> and

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
down there and then we take this end and

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.790 
down there and then we take this end and
thread<00:04:12.020> it<00:04:12.170> in<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.700> again<00:04:13.700> thread<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.180> until

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
thread it in and again thread it until

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.720 
thread it in and again thread it until
this<00:04:15.800> fully<00:04:16.190> seats<00:04:16.580> with<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:17.510> other<00:04:17.690> nut<00:04:17.959> and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
this fully seats with the other nut and

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.800 
this fully seats with the other nut and
as<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:19.910> tighten<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:20.299> you're<00:04:20.450> going<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.600> hear

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
as you tighten this you're going to hear

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.780 
as you tighten this you're going to hear
some<00:04:20.840> crunching<00:04:21.709> noises<00:04:21.890> that's<00:04:22.340> normal

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
some crunching noises that's normal

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.910 
some crunching noises that's normal
that's<00:04:22.880> just<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> porcelain<00:04:23.810> getting<00:04:24.680> pushed

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
that's just the porcelain getting pushed

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.640 
that's just the porcelain getting pushed
out<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.370> way<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.730> then<00:04:26.690> once<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.500> have

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
out of the way and then once you have

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.580 
out of the way and then once you have
that<00:04:27.830> fully<00:04:28.070> seated<00:04:28.430> then<00:04:29.420> take<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:30.080> 19

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
that fully seated then take a 19

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.120 
that fully seated then take a 19
millimeter<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.720> loosen<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.960> whole<00:04:33.590> assembly

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
millimeter and loosen the whole assembly

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:42.310 
millimeter and loosen the whole assembly
and<00:04:34.310> pull<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.730> whole<00:04:34.850> assembly<00:04:35.360> out<00:04:41.290> okay<00:04:42.290> so

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
and pull the whole assembly out okay so

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.930 
and pull the whole assembly out okay so
that<00:04:42.590> tool<00:04:42.800> we<00:04:42.980> just<00:04:43.220> use<00:04:43.400> pushes<00:04:43.820> the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
that tool we just use pushes the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.670 
that tool we just use pushes the
porcelain<00:04:44.450> out<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.780> way<00:04:44.930> now<00:04:45.200> we<00:04:45.260> need<00:04:45.530> to

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
porcelain out of the way now we need to

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.650 
porcelain out of the way now we need to
create<00:04:46.370> some<00:04:46.760> new<00:04:46.910> threads<00:04:47.270> on<00:04:47.510> that

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
create some new threads on that

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.020 
create some new threads on that
electrode<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.500> pull<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.190> out<00:04:49.310> so<00:04:49.580> we<00:04:49.670> take<00:04:49.850> our

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
electrode and pull it out so we take our

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.410 
electrode and pull it out so we take our
sleeve<00:04:50.360> set<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.470> down<00:04:51.580> inside<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.640> spark<00:04:53.150> plug

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
sleeve set it down inside the spark plug

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.960 
sleeve set it down inside the spark plug
too<00:04:53.770> then<00:04:54.770> we'll<00:04:54.950> take<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.280> other<00:04:55.400> part<00:04:55.700> of

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
too then we'll take the other part of

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.860 
too then we'll take the other part of
this<00:04:56.480> tool<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.830> threaded<00:04:58.220> part<00:04:58.370> here<00:04:58.870> put

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
this tool and the threaded part here put

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.470 
this tool and the threaded part here put
that<00:04:59.900> in<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:00.860> you'll<00:05:01.460> turn<00:05:01.640> that<00:05:01.820> left-handed

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
that in and you'll turn that left-handed

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.000 
that in and you'll turn that left-handed
and<00:05:02.630> this<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.900> what's<00:05:03.200> going<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.470> grip<00:05:03.740> onto

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
and this is what's going to grip onto

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.540 
and this is what's going to grip onto
the<00:05:04.960> electrode<00:05:05.960> what's<00:05:06.200> broken<00:05:06.560> off<00:05:06.710> so<00:05:07.460> you

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
the electrode what's broken off so you

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.640 
the electrode what's broken off so you
you<00:05:08.180> turn<00:05:08.360> this<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:08.930> left<00:05:09.290> the

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
you turn this to the left the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.380 
you turn this to the left the
left-handed<00:05:10.160> threads<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:10.700> it's<00:05:11.210> going<00:05:11.330> to

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
left-handed threads and it's going to

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.760 
left-handed threads and it's going to
feel<00:05:11.570> kind<00:05:11.750> of<00:05:11.900> tight<00:05:12.080> but<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.350> want<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.620> make

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
feel kind of tight but you want to make

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.470 
feel kind of tight but you want to make
sure<00:05:12.800> you<00:05:13.040> get<00:05:13.220> plenty<00:05:13.490> of<00:05:13.700> thread<00:05:14.000> two<00:05:14.360> or

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
sure you get plenty of thread two or

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.240 
sure you get plenty of thread two or
three<00:05:14.660> threads<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:15.169> there<00:05:15.380> so<00:05:15.980> that<00:05:16.010> it's

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
three threads on there so that it's

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.750 
three threads on there so that it's
tight<00:05:16.460> enough<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:17.000> then<00:05:17.660> you'll<00:05:17.810> take<00:05:18.760> your

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
tight enough and then you'll take your

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.690 
tight enough and then you'll take your
nylon<00:05:20.060> washer<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:20.960> your<00:05:21.500> nut<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.890> thread<00:05:22.580> it

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
nylon washer and your nut and thread it

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.990 
nylon washer and your nut and thread it
left-handed<00:05:23.270> as<00:05:23.390> well<00:05:24.550> you'll<00:05:25.550> thread<00:05:25.850> that

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
left-handed as well you'll thread that

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.290 
left-handed as well you'll thread that
on<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:26.510> it<00:05:27.140> will<00:05:27.260> contact<00:05:27.850> this<00:05:28.850> part<00:05:29.120> of<00:05:29.210> the

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
on and it will contact this part of the

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.000 
on and it will contact this part of the
sleeve<00:05:29.600> and<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:30.110> keep<00:05:30.320> turning<00:05:30.560> that<00:05:30.860> and

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
sleeve and you keep turning that and

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.700 
sleeve and you keep turning that and
turning<00:05:31.220> that<00:05:31.510> until<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.990> whole<00:05:33.200> assembly<00:05:33.680> is

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
turning that until the whole assembly is

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.290 
turning that until the whole assembly is
loose<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.220> you<00:05:34.280> can<00:05:34.430> pull<00:05:34.610> everything<00:05:34.970> out

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
loose and you can pull everything out

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.510 
loose and you can pull everything out
the<00:05:35.600> end<00:05:35.780> of<00:05:35.900> that<00:05:35.990> electrode<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.800> this<00:05:37.340> whole

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
the end of that electrode and this whole

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.540 
the end of that electrode and this whole
thing<00:05:37.790> will<00:05:37.970> all<00:05:38.090> come<00:05:38.330> out<00:05:38.590> as<00:05:39.590> one<00:05:39.950> piece<00:05:40.220> and

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
thing will all come out as one piece and

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
in now this tool is designed so that

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.960 
in now this tool is designed so that
none<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.380> porcelain<00:05:45.890> breaks<00:05:46.160> off<00:05:46.400> inside

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
none of the porcelain breaks off inside

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.780 
none of the porcelain breaks off inside
the<00:05:47.000> cylinder<00:05:47.600> but<00:05:48.260> just<00:05:48.500> to<00:05:48.590> be<00:05:48.740> sure<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:49.280> just

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
the cylinder but just to be sure I just

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.220 
the cylinder but just to be sure I just
take<00:05:49.940> some<00:05:49.970> compressed<00:05:50.270> air<00:05:50.630> blow<00:05:50.960> it<00:05:51.110> out

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
take some compressed air blow it out

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.690 
take some compressed air blow it out
make<00:05:51.560> sure<00:05:51.710> there's<00:05:51.890> nothing<00:05:52.190> left<00:05:52.370> in<00:05:52.520> there

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
make sure there's nothing left in there

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.850 
make sure there's nothing left in there
then<00:05:53.330> we<00:05:53.450> can<00:05:53.570> go<00:05:53.660> ahead<00:05:53.780> and<00:05:53.930> put<00:05:54.200> our<00:05:54.410> spark

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
then we can go ahead and put our spark

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.100 
then we can go ahead and put our spark
our<00:05:55.040> new<00:05:55.190> spark<00:05:55.460> plug<00:05:55.669> in<00:05:55.850> there<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.180> hope<00:05:56.990> this

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
our new spark plug in there I hope this

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.810 
our new spark plug in there I hope this
