00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.760
 batista70phone friends to today vi 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.420
 I present the milk cover in quick circle 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.610
 originals for lg g3 we go to see them 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.419
 you can see we have different colors 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:29.119
 white red yellow and a classic black 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:31.769
 the magnet that is built well 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.480
 holds well closed so do not open 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.550
 they don't even do this in your pocket 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.199
 very beautiful skin 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.960
 as you see here the original writing 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.760
 linking we go to insert it let's try ad 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.089
 example already at the right a color a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.489
 little summer we see the inclusion a lot 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.690
 simple the moment we go to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.100
 close we double tap 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.619
 on the porthole and as you see it unlocks the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 cover as well as being functional for a long time 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.909
 protection also you can see from this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.369
 side is completely protected left 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.610
 free access to the keys then there is the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.770
 laser sensor for dual led camera 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.440
 flash are completely uncovered like this 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.630
 how the volume key above is open 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.850
 but if you notice, it remains a bit 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.710
 thickness therefore also in case of fall 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.210
 it should not be placed directly but rests 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.640
 first the cover 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.250
 ditto for the part below as you see 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.470
 double tap activates the quick circle 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.060
 we scroll down if they activate the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.820
 various functions for example we see the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.440
 possibility to take a picture with the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 camera directly from the app on 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.830
 circle we know is the photo is made 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.490
 or the call log e 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.600
 whatever else you have what various 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.000
 settings let's go from the settings 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.120
 we can for example change type of di 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.320
 clock we move we go to choose 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.080
 what 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.180
 the more we like for example this also has 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.670
 the baobab weather and this for the cover 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.030
 let's go and set this up 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.130
 back 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.990
 as you see when the notification arrives 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.630
 it is reported to us but for reasons of 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.190
 we can't see privacy 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.600
 sorry there is no shutdown time 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.360
 quite short as you can see 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.520
 we set the weather with there is the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.070
 the clock was the weather that to say only 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.750
 from the very beautiful and very cover 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.880
 protective I repeat very functional you have 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.040
 right here you see if you have any 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.200
 notifications if notification arrives comes 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.200
 reported and offers the possibility of 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.670
 perform various actions with this 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.800
