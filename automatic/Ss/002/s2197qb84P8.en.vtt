mentioned in my makeup face video that
i'm<00:04:39.370> using<00:04:39.430> an<00:04:40.710> acne<00:04:41.710> solutions<00:04:43.680> liquid

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680

makeup for my foundation so

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.339 
makeup for my foundation so
I<00:04:47.419> guess<00:04:48.379> it<00:04:48.530> works<00:04:48.919> on<00:04:49.819> you<00:04:50.750> know<00:04:50.870> preventing

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
I guess it works on you know preventing

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.679 
I guess it works on you know preventing
blemishes<00:04:51.979> while<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.400> wear<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.729> makeup<00:04:52.909> to

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:57.580 

allergy<00:04:56.689> tested<00:04:57.169> one<00:04:57.319> hundred<00:04:57.560> percent

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.149 
allergy tested one hundred percent
fragrance<00:04:58.520> free<00:04:58.969> so<00:04:59.449> that's<00:04:59.750> good<00:05:00.189> and<00:05:01.870> I

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159
