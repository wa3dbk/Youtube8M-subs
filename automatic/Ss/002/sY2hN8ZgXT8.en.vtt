00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:13.730
 hello girls and medium again here 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.730
 that's what gave me this bag that 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.009
 start with the most what more when 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 you look 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.369
 I even cried because he knew that I 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.599
 I wanted these two palettes are very much 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.230
 these were already eager to buy 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 the commercial SMEs or these planet and the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.210
 naked are I do not give them their look because I know 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.770
 that here on youtube there are hundreds and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.230
 hundreds of girls who use these palette 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
 it feels 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:48.270
 I say that you already know he gave me this in 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.370
 that is the fix the six plans of brand a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.190
 year when in the balloons that came to me and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.780
 the roses and everything there all when I looked at it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.750
 the no no what any woman already knows 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.840
 super happy and good 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.150
 s buy I bought for 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.290
 study conditions also fix the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.180
 dust the dust and I have already given them use 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.600
 Well, a few months ago, look, this is the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.160
 dust that he used all the time 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.110
 I'm fascinated with this one 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.680
 little things are really beautiful that are 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.990
 very good quality, I like you very much 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.000
 at the box office our truth and the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:30.610
 study end is to consider is this 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.610
 it's long-lasting it's like that 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.090
 tell them that this covers you up to a 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.780
 tattoo 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.210
 and it does not fall 100% recommended for these 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.950
 People who like long duration do not 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.280
 they really have a lot of things on their face 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.219
 as well as acne spots in want to cover 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:57.219
 perfect is to conciliate blond until I've 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:57.219
 given so is this world on the cake 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.319
 it's a pink well well fine beard 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.019
 this that they have fed that neither me anymore 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.700
 although I wanted it I wanted it and 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.610
 I really said they are never going to be having 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.110
 the key no no they can not lose the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.930
 opportunity 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.030
 This last one is nicki minaj 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:26.890
 wide he is a violet 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.340
 sup beautiful purple violet to the beautiful 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.580
 color and although that was all 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 also grab this brush that you do not give 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.440
 use in all the Malaysian powder and the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.950
 grip to be beyond the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.950
 corrector 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:02.490
 this would be to put a day to 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.490
 dismiss the cream base
