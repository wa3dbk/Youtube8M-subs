going to be exactly using a ton of

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.510 
going to be exactly using a ton of
attack<00:02:05.579> damage<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:06.090> wit<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.220> for<00:02:08.220> example

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
attack damage here wit and for example

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.089 
attack damage here wit and for example
trinity<00:02:08.879> force<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.690> gives<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.140> multiple

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
trinity force that gives you multiple

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.619 
trinity force that gives you multiple
layers<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.610> everything<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.420> want<00:02:12.599> a

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
layers of everything so you just want a

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.610 
layers of everything so you just want a
fair<00:02:12.840> balance<00:02:13.110> bill

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
fair balance bill

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.050 
fair balance bill
and<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:14.040> think<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.610> bill<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.819> does

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and I think this is the bill that does

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.550 
and I think this is the bill that does
it<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.159> his<00:02:17.310> stats<00:02:17.659> health<00:02:18.659> mana<00:02:19.019> armor
