00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.670
 she greets everyone knows SkyHeroes 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.050
 how is it going today for 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 a new gameplay on call of duty 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 ghost and snipers usr and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 peculiarities you will see that I 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.369
 do not use trigger anymore 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.780
 that's what I wanted to talk about 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.449
 today ace of the trigger 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
 an asset that is really dispensable on 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.019
 reflex we all have when we play 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 snipers we want to make scop shot etc 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.750
 we will aim faster we put ace of the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.030
 trigger first thing I did 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.480
 when i played snipe jamie as of the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.800
 trigger 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.850
 we saw that especially the gameplay to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 every time I said well I take 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.719
 that because there is trigger etc 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.000
 it allows me to aim faster 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.859
 frankly named do not put it anymore 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.840
 no use I can guarantee it 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.609
 does a test between 100 and this of the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.090
 trigger and had ce2 with ace of the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.469
 trigger 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.160
 you will see that eventually the time 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.539
 to aim and is almost the same 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.520
 frankly is pretty much the same 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.530
 and you will see that eventually in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.240
 lowering this time to aim it's going to see 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.500
 that benefits I will explain myself 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.080
 why then have I wanted to talk about 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 gameplay i'm on ps3 match to death 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.619
 on octane really a map that I love 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.720
 it's really a great map 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.830
 he does not have much on ghost messin though 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.259
 she is really happy 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.270
 and now on ps3 I wanted to 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.840
 change a little bit I always do a 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.399
 little bit xbox playstation xbox i'm 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.349
 not fixed on a platform and if 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.640
 finally it allows me to see 

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:37.289
 different communities did not 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.459
 exactly the same and finally there are some 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.399
 times it's many times it's not good 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.090
 and it was a brief we do not care 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.140
 the important thing is to play on this 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.660
 little my death match part that is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.130
 really nice to play and on those 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.660
 who ask me every time about the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.399
 strategies on travel etc. 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.539
 you will see that eventually 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.950
 places where I want to position myself on 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.470
 this map there are very beautiful places 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.179
 so if you look for the right places 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.440
 to put myself to the snipers I you 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.550
 advise to watch or is it 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.810
 never positioned and you will see 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.360
 that finally it works pretty well 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.220
 so I wanted to talk today about the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.899
 cough ace of the trigger why the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.759
 withdraw what benefits 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.349
 disadvantages firstly the moment where 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.390
 I removed them because today 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.370
 he's talking about patching snipers thing 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.959
 which is completely useless for me there 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.739
 there are other things on which he 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.720
 should focus 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.330
 but in short we can not do anything about it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.580
 that they do that so you have to adapt 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.170
 you have to see pretty much 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.940
 where is it going to go 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.110
 that you simply have to adapt 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.020
 here we did not talk further about that 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.640
 and so precisely on the legs this 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.410
 that they had planned and on the paws 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.540
 that have already been done they have no 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.340
 at on time to aim then I see 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.200
 really not much difference already 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.490
 between having there both the triggers 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.650
 and do not see her there are not a lot of 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.020
 difference then reduce a little time 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.070
 to aim at the snipe with the snipers with 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.770
 the trump asset 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.180
 frankly it's almost invisible a 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.040
 I do not even know if they already have 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.230
 what is certain is that they have 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.940
 no one at all concentration with 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.380
 snipers it's true that before when 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.940
 is touching the cough concentration 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.760
 allows us when we are in the process of 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.950
 aim of not too much if vied and with the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.360
 Sniper he thought it was a small 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.890
 little exaggeration because actually 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.770
 it's the only thing that is exaggerated 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.970
 in the game we did not have too much 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.270
 retreat now we have a little more 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.650
 retreat 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.540
 I advise you to put it when 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.890
 even because at the beginning I got good 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.200
 they did not kill I'm going to take it off but 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.970
 finally frankly without one sees 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.640
 clearly the difference even though they have 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.010
 a little reduced the effect put the saf and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.420
 it is very useful and it 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.910
 situation situation that allows us 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.470
 to manage the enemy well even if 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.010
 it was reduced I advise you when 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.930
 even to put it 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.090
 and that's it I'm saying we're going 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.340
 try without ace of the trigger the time 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.800
 to aim is almost the same 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.940
 we lose a little bit of speed on the 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.769
 targeted but ultimately we can still 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.360
 do it scop shot you see it at the 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.650
 gameplay that does not stop me from aiming 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.450
 that does not stop quickly to make 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.260
 scop cuts so eventually it's 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.940
 really not serious 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.610
 and there's all the trigger of that 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.680
 corresponds to three points 3 points that 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.360
 allow you to put assets that 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.980
 are really going to help you in the 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.630
 part and finally you will see that 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.920
 it's still a lot better already 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.930
 when I pulled the trigger 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.190
 I did 2 quad fidh in one hour 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.600
 something that had never happened to me 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.459
 now on ghost is finally 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.080
 shine that bah we fight the balls 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.070
 of the trigger that allows us that we 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.660
 still allows to put shots of 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.830
 thread for those who say yeah what if 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.300
 I do not put it I will always be able 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.739
 put phone calls the answer is 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.330
 yes and to prove it you will see 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.799
 that in this gameplay the quad league 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.169
 fidh so that's it finally you're going 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.669
 see that same sense of the trigger 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.800
 we can make phone calls so 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.419
 remove it with your eyes closed do you 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.979
 not worry and in addition the advantage that 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.560
 I saw in relation to that is that 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.660
 as we will not aim so fast we will have 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.470
 tend to much more secure his shot 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.270
 insured 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.220
 this was to ensure that he is one 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.170
 will gain in precision will win in 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.120
 efficiency we will gain in performance 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.430
 so finally you'll see that in 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.930
 lowering this small currency speed 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.420
 and finally we will be much more 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.590
 powerful and to fill those three 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.050
 gmi trumps and there a whole 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.550
 visible alas all reports and his two 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.710
 assets there compared to the community 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.990
 compared to the gaming system they have 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.880
 I can guarantee they are great 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.370
 super efficient here firstly the 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.200
 any reports that do not detect you 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.990
 drones etc all in fight we do not care 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.910
 but eggs and ei is really the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.170
 pelure of this game everyone uses 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.970
 all the campers at the small crossing 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.470
 Quad 8 happens you will see it 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.910
 is really fun boumelaha what you 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.590
 screw in trine here it's nice 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.390
 so the catch is everybody uses 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.980
 all campers to frankly the 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.600
 campers use all of those so if 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.430
 you see there is a camper in the corner 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.990
 so already that was doing it saves you from 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.580
 to make you stupidly kill by this this 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.320
 fucking shit assets that breaks us 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.400
 the balls systematically and in addition 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.660
 it lets you know that there is a 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.090
 camper in the corner so go there 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.370
 cautiously here is double advantage then 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.930
 the invisible cough protects you from 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.700
 turrets well does not really have much 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.840
 but the scrape protects you from oracles 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.650
 and the oracle is something that 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.870
 many people use it 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.640
 and as it's support even if the guy 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.800
 gets killed he continues his ion series 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.120
 it was like oneself w3 is finally 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.950
 the raku everyone unblocks a 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.870
 moment or another there is always a 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.180
 oracle by part and that's always the 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.740
 way to get killed really great 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.930
 super stupidly is so annoying that 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.450
 the guy knows exactly where you are he knows 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.580
 where do you go, and that's it 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.479
 in the end nothing but removing 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.820
 is the trigger 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.410
 it does not make you lose efficiency 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.240
 it makes you more precise 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.979
 and just for me I think it 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.290
 makes you more efficient because you 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.390
 earn this fire insurance 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.190
 it prevents you from being put by 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.990
 crappy lives and see where it 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.180
 that there are campers not to squeeze 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.690
 all this so finally removed ace of the 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.700
 trigger 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.050
 it's just a benefit I can tell you 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.000
 guarantee that's so it was my little ones 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.950
 tips of the day I hope this 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.720
 you liked it do not hesitate to give your
