00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.600 
inside
I<00:02:30.380> thought<00:02:31.380> they<00:02:31.560> put<00:02:31.709> way<00:02:31.920> more<00:02:31.950> crap<00:02:32.400> on

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.750 
I thought they put way more crap on
there<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:32.970> they<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.300> didn't<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.620> that's<00:02:35.610> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760

there but they really didn't so that's a
cheeseburger<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.570> think<00:02:37.560> oh<00:02:37.860> wait<00:02:38.520> he's<00:02:38.820> all
