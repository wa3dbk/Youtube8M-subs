00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
retro verse the og I don't know if it's

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.289 
retro verse the og I don't know if it's
just<00:03:44.540> because<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:44.989> age<00:03:45.549> or<00:03:46.549> if<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.090> is

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
just because of age or if it is

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.409 
just because of age or if it is
literally<00:03:48.019> just<00:03:48.560> different<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.730> think<00:03:50.299> it's

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
literally just different I think it's

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.330 
literally just different I think it's
because<00:03:50.660> it's<00:03:50.840> different<00:03:51.079> I<00:03:51.530> don't<00:03:52.130> think<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
because it's different I don't think the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.979 
because it's different I don't think the
age<00:03:52.489> is<00:03:52.790> going<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.000> make<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.299> wear<00:03:53.540> down<00:03:53.750> this

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
age is going to make this wear down this

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.199 
age is going to make this wear down this
is<00:03:54.109> basically<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.500> TS<00:03:54.950> pair<00:03:55.250> it's<00:03:55.790> been<00:03:55.910> tried

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
is basically a TS pair it's been tried

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.860 
is basically a TS pair it's been tried
on<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:57.079> it's<00:03:57.200> not<00:03:57.349> technically<00:03:58.340> DS<00:03:58.640> but<00:03:59.209> you

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
on so it's not technically DS but you

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.180 
on so it's not technically DS but you
know<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.079> has<00:04:00.230> been<00:04:00.409> worn<00:04:00.709> out<00:04:00.890> so

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
know it has been worn out so

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.030 
know it has been worn out so
I<00:04:02.310> think<00:04:02.910> it's<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.330> more<00:04:03.540> defined<00:04:04.050> on<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
I think it's just more defined on the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.070 
I think it's just more defined on the
retro<00:04:05.520> that's<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> big<00:04:06.180> difference<00:04:06.660> right

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
retro that's like a big difference right

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.440
