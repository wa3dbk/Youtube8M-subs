bad transaxle so I ripped this crap out
and<00:00:45.020> read<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> computer<00:00:46.530> geek<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.860> you're

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and read in a computer geek if you're

and read in a computer geek if you're
looking<00:00:47.340> that's<00:00:47.520> uh<00:00:47.899> seven<00:00:49.700> 1903<00:00:50.700> MTD<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
looking that's uh seven 1903 MTD and

looking that's uh seven 1903 MTD and
that's<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:52.890> screw<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.399> talking

that's the little screw I was talking
about<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.510> think<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
about I don't think it's going to be a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
about I don't think it's going to be a
problem<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.340> need<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
problem with what you need it what you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.170 
problem with what you need it what you
need<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.750> there's<00:00:58.710> no<00:00:58.890> actual<00:00:59.879> breaks

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180

need this for there's no actual breaks
in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> case<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.559> think<00:01:01.980> it'd<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.129> good<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550

do<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.920> lower<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.340> heck<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.939> of

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
do is I want to lower the heck out of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.630 
do is I want to lower the heck out of
this<00:02:03.149> thing<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.040> I'm<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.189> make<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> into

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
this thing and I'm going to make it into

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.219 
this thing and I'm going to make it into
another<00:02:05.759> speed<00:02:06.240> mower<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.719> speed<00:02:07.020> mower

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
another speed mower now the speed mower

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.510 
another speed mower now the speed mower
I<00:02:07.290> did<00:02:07.500> build<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:09.030> was<00:02:09.209> running<00:02:09.629> really<00:02:09.780> good

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
I did build it was running really good

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.710 
I did build it was running really good
the<00:02:11.520> only<00:02:11.700> problem<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.090> when

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the only problem is when

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.840 
the only problem is when
I<00:02:12.810> switch<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.650> transaxles<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.610> I'll<00:02:14.670> show

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
I switch the transaxles and I'll show

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.770 
I switch the transaxles and I'll show
you<00:02:14.880> real<00:02:15.150> quick<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:16.500> right<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
you real quick this right here is the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.500 
you real quick this right here is the
input<00:02:19.320> shaft<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.640> one<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.060> bigger<00:02:21.390> than

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
input shaft and this one is bigger than

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.960 
input shaft and this one is bigger than
the<00:02:21.780> input<00:02:21.990> shaft<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> other<00:02:23.130> transaxle

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the input shaft on the other transaxle

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.780 
the input shaft on the other transaxle
so<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.810> ended<00:02:25.170> up<00:02:25.290> having<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.740> not<00:02:26.340> be<00:02:26.550> able<00:02:26.640> to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so I ended up having to not be able to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.400 
so I ended up having to not be able to
use<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.120> same<00:02:27.300> pulley<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> had<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.260> this

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
use the same pulley that I had on this

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.010 
use the same pulley that I had on this
one<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.830> had<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.100> build<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.760> new<00:02:30.090> one<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.930> was

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
one I had to build a new one and it was

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.440 
one I had to build a new one and it was
a<00:02:31.050> slightly<00:02:31.380> bigger<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.090> instead<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.240> just

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
a slightly bigger and instead of just

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.530 
a slightly bigger and instead of just
putting<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.140> slightly<00:02:34.770> bigger<00:02:35.160> belt<00:02:35.700> that

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
putting on the slightly bigger belt that

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.890 
putting on the slightly bigger belt that
I<00:02:36.600> had<00:02:36.990> sitting<00:02:37.470> right<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.460> used<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
I had sitting right here I used this the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.290 
I had sitting right here I used this the
belt<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.320> bought<00:02:40.680> which<00:02:41.580> was<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.510> one<00:02:42.750> I

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
belt that I bought which was this one I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.699 
belt that I bought which was this one I
had<00:02:45.300> actually<00:02:45.480> bought<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> brand<00:02:46.170> new<00:02:46.290> belt<00:02:46.500> for

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
had actually bought a brand new belt for

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.280 
had actually bought a brand new belt for
the<00:02:46.770> speed<00:02:46.980> more<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.700> fit<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.600> pulley<00:02:48.959> that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the speed more to fit the pulley that

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.150 
the speed more to fit the pulley that
fit<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:50.070> transaxle<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.980> out<00:02:53.130> of

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
fit on this transaxle and just out of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.750 
fit on this transaxle and just out of
sheer<00:02:53.430> frustration<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:54.830> put<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.040> new<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.670> know

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
sheer frustration I put the new you know

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.180 
sheer frustration I put the new you know
pulley<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> back<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.959> new<00:02:58.190> transaxle

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
pulley on the back of the new transaxle

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.600 
pulley on the back of the new transaxle
on<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.550> speed<00:02:59.790> mower<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:02.100> was<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.459> too

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
on the speed mower and it was just too

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.340 
on the speed mower and it was just too
tight<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.000> even<00:03:03.570> though<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.720> push<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.170> clutch

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
tight so even though you push the clutch

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.590 
tight so even though you push the clutch
in<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.950> still<00:03:05.430> wouldn't<00:03:05.730> disengage<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:06.540> you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
in it still wouldn't disengage so you

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.560 
in it still wouldn't disengage so you
really<00:03:06.870> just<00:03:07.020> had<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.410> kind<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.890> force<00:03:08.570> force

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
really just had to kind of force force

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.900 
really just had to kind of force force
it<00:03:09.720> into<00:03:09.870> gear<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.470> just<00:03:10.890> hit<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.700> gas<00:03:11.880> pedal

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
it into gear and just hit the gas pedal

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.210 
it into gear and just hit the gas pedal
and<00:03:12.390> go<00:03:13.040> thing<00:03:14.040> was<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.270> engine<00:03:16.220> it

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
and go thing was the the engine it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.920 
and go thing was the the engine it
actually<00:03:17.670> had<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.910> governor<00:03:18.300> on<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
actually had a governor on it so it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.020 
actually had a governor on it so it
didn't<00:03:19.140> get<00:03:19.200> up<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.410> rpms<00:03:19.920> now<00:03:20.190> we<00:03:20.370> went<00:03:20.519> faster

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
didn't get up to rpms now we went faster

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.690 
didn't get up to rpms now we went faster
than<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.300> standard<00:03:21.800> lawn<00:03:22.800> tractor<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:23.550> it

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
than a standard lawn tractor but it

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.660 
than a standard lawn tractor but it
didn't<00:03:24.000> go<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.720> speed<00:03:25.110> Miller<00:03:25.140> fast<00:03:25.709> so

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
didn't go like speed Miller fast so

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.880 
didn't go like speed Miller fast so
while<00:03:26.880> i<00:03:26.910> was<00:03:27.120> there<00:03:27.200> amongst<00:03:28.200> fixing<00:03:28.739> all

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
while i was there amongst fixing all

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.620 
while i was there amongst fixing all
kinds<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.280> other<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.760> know<00:03:29.790> problems<00:03:30.420> with

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
kinds of other you know problems with

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.660 
kinds of other you know problems with
other<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.019> know<00:03:31.080> vehicles<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.070> tractors<00:03:32.459> and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
other you know vehicles and tractors and

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.850 
other you know vehicles and tractors and
lowers<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.150> lawn<00:03:33.840> chairs<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.500> all<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.709> kind

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
lowers and lawn chairs and all that kind

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.580 
lowers and lawn chairs and all that kind
of<00:03:34.920> stuff<00:03:34.980> i<00:03:35.519> got<00:03:36.300> in<00:03:36.510> there<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:37.230> removed

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
of stuff i got in there and I removed

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.490 
of stuff i got in there and I removed
the<00:03:37.709> governor<00:03:38.070> out<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.880> v-twin<00:03:39.500> and

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the governor out of the the v-twin and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.420 
the governor out of the the v-twin and
once<00:03:40.800> I<00:03:40.920> did<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:43.620> actually<00:03:44.040> ran<00:03:44.220> really

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
once I did that I it actually ran really

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.660 
once I did that I it actually ran really
fast<00:03:44.580> probably<00:03:45.390> too<00:03:45.510> fast<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.549> what<00:03:47.549> had

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
fast probably too fast and what had

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.550 
fast probably too fast and what had
happened<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.540> started<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.989> cook<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.320> belt

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
happened is it started to cook the belt

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.620 
happened is it started to cook the belt
and<00:03:49.920> one<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.000> belt<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:52.230> little<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:52.920> belt

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
and one of the belt a little like belt

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.720 
and one of the belt a little like belt
retainers<00:03:54.630> actually<00:03:55.230> broke<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.920> then<00:03:56.610> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
retainers actually broke and then the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.970 
retainers actually broke and then the
belt<00:03:56.910> came<00:03:57.180> off<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.720> instead<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.410> just<00:03:58.620> fixing

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
belt came off so instead of just fixing
