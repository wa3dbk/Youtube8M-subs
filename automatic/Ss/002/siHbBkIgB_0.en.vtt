the<00:02:08.459> 600<00:02:08.970> point<00:02:09.420> range<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.800> they<00:02:10.950> would<00:02:11.099> still

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
the 600 point range so they would still

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.100 
the 600 point range so they would still
be<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.670> second<00:02:12.510> slot

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
having this team which would give you a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
much easier or much bigger benefit and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.720 
much easier or much bigger benefit and
hopefully<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.590> chance<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.010> go<00:03:24.130> first<00:03:24.430> and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
hopefully the chance to go first and

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.660 
hopefully the chance to go first and
then<00:03:25.510> also<00:03:26.019> you<00:03:26.080> may<00:03:26.410> cancel<00:03:26.769> one<00:03:27.190> battlefield

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
then also you may cancel one battlefield

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.360 
then also you may cancel one battlefield
condition<00:03:28.330> so<00:03:28.810> if<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.230> map<00:03:29.590> has<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.890> special

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
condition so if a map has a special

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.240 
condition so if a map has a special
orange<00:03:30.790> battlefield<00:03:31.480> condition<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.860> can

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
orange battlefield condition you can

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.660 
orange battlefield condition you can
cancel<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.330> if<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.570> choose<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.310> then<00:03:36.459> also

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
cancel it if you choose so and then also

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.670 
cancel it if you choose so and then also
you<00:03:37.360> may<00:03:37.510> use<00:03:37.690> probability<00:03:38.410> control<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:40.680> each

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
you may use probability control and each

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.400 
you may use probability control and each
the<00:03:42.280> number<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.060> times<00:03:43.360> specific<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:44.260> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
the number of times specific to the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.360 
the number of times specific to the
theme<00:03:44.650> team<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.370> if<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.700> have<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.420> 300<00:03:47.350> up<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.340> a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
theme team so if you have a 300 up to a

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.430 
theme team so if you have a 300 up to a
300<00:03:48.640> point<00:03:49.090> theme<00:03:49.330> team<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:50.110> can<00:03:50.320> use

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
300 point theme team you can use

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.770 
300 point theme team you can use
probability<00:03:50.920> control<00:03:51.310> twice<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.880> it's<00:03:52.510> so

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
probability control twice and it's so

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.290 
probability control twice and it's so
it's<00:03:52.930> two<00:03:53.080> two<00:03:53.620> times<00:03:53.830> for<00:03:54.220> every<00:03:54.489> 300<00:03:55.000> points

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
it's two two times for every 300 points

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.870 
it's two two times for every 300 points
so<00:03:55.360> twice<00:03:56.050> up<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.470> 300<00:03:56.950> twice<00:03:57.220> up<00:03:57.459> or<00:03:57.640> four

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
so twice up to 300 twice up or four

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.830 
so twice up to 300 twice up or four
times<00:03:58.120> up<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.450> 600<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.110> six<00:03:59.860> times<00:04:00.160> from<00:04:01.150> 700

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
times up to 600 and six times from 700

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.210 
times up to 600 and six times from 700
up<00:04:02.019> to<00:04:02.200> 900<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:03.010> then<00:04:03.340> on<00:04:04.300> up<00:04:04.380> as<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.709> goes<00:04:05.890> from

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
up to 900 and then on up as it goes from

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.890

to use a theme team probability control

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.500 
to use a theme team probability control
they<00:04:14.140> must<00:04:14.440> have<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.830> key<00:04:15.040> word<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.489> then<00:04:16.150> no

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
they must have the key word and then no

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.190 
they must have the key word and then no
previous<00:04:17.019> non-free<00:04:17.650> actions<00:04:18.160> this<00:04:18.430> turn<00:04:18.760> and

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
previous non-free actions this turn and

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.599 
previous non-free actions this turn and
must<00:04:20.200> not<00:04:20.380> be<00:04:20.500> able<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.739> use<00:04:21.040> probability

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
must not be able to use probability

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.779 
must not be able to use probability
control<00:04:22.150> via<00:04:22.840> any<00:04:23.140> other<00:04:23.470> ability<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.220> then

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
control via any other ability and then

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.279 
control via any other ability and then
you<00:04:24.910> give<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.240> character<00:04:25.570> in<00:04:25.660> action<00:04:25.960> token

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
you give the character in action token

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.870 
you give the character in action token
so<00:04:26.740> yeah

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
so yeah

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.990 
so yeah
even<00:04:28.240> though<00:04:28.450> lucious<00:04:29.650> we<00:04:30.340> don't<00:04:30.490> use<00:04:30.670> Lucius

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
even though lucious we don't use Lucius

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.850 
even though lucious we don't use Lucius
Fox<00:04:31.180> but<00:04:31.540> I<00:04:31.780> don't<00:04:32.140> have<00:04:32.200> any<00:04:32.380> character<00:04:32.770> in

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
Fox but I don't have any character in

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.350 
Fox but I don't have any character in
front<00:04:32.980> of<00:04:33.100> me<00:04:33.190> but<00:04:33.310> let's<00:04:33.490> say<00:04:33.610> Lucius<00:04:33.940> Fox<00:04:34.090> had

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.640 
front of me but let's say Lucius Fox had
a<00:04:34.390> Batman

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
a Batman

can't<00:04:39.070> use<00:04:39.250> probability<00:04:39.730> control<00:04:40.090> if<00:04:40.210> he<00:04:40.390> is

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
can't use probability control if he is

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.450 
can't use probability control if he is

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
on the theme team of the Batman family

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.790 
on the theme team of the Batman family
and<00:04:42.760> possesses<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.420> keyword<00:04:43.750> he<00:04:44.320> is<00:04:44.440> able<00:04:44.620> to

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
and possesses that keyword he is able to

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.830 
and possesses that keyword he is able to
use<00:04:45.070> probability<00:04:45.700> control<00:04:47.160> once<00:04:48.160> per<00:04:48.790> turn<00:04:48.840> up

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
use probability control once per turn up

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.270 
use probability control once per turn up
to<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.170> number<00:04:50.410> of<00:04:50.440> times<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.830> can<00:04:50.980> use<00:04:51.130> it

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
to the number of times you can use it

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280 
to the number of times you can use it
per<00:04:51.490> game<00:04:51.760> so<00:04:52.090> if<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.360> have<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.570> 300<00:04:52.960> point<00:04:53.080> team

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
per game so if you have a 300 point team

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.720 
per game so if you have a 300 point team
you<00:04:53.410> can<00:04:53.530> only<00:04:53.620> use<00:04:53.770> probability<00:04:54.250> control

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
you can only use probability control

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.320 
you can only use probability control
twice<00:04:55.390> per<00:04:55.870> game<00:04:56.350> as<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.830> theme<00:04:57.340> team<00:04:57.670> prob<00:04:58.090> they

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
twice per game as a theme team prob they

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.460 
twice per game as a theme team prob they
call<00:04:58.570> it<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:58.900> then<00:04:59.320> this<00:04:59.890> specific<00:05:00.610> prob

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
call it and then this specific prob

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.170 
call it and then this specific prob
forces<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.620> get<00:05:02.950> an<00:05:03.130> action<00:05:03.550> token<00:05:03.970> for

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
forces you to get an action token for

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.670 
forces you to get an action token for
the<00:05:04.330> use<00:05:04.480> of<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.020> there<00:05:05.170> are<00:05:05.260> some

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
the use of it so there are some

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.740 
the use of it so there are some
drawbacks<00:05:05.980> but<00:05:06.580> overall<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.420> a<00:05:07.450> nice

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
drawbacks but overall it is a nice

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.570 
drawbacks but overall it is a nice
benefit<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:08.470> have<00:05:08.650> especially<00:05:09.370> when<00:05:09.460> you're

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
benefit to have especially when you're

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.030 
benefit to have especially when you're
in<00:05:09.670> a<00:05:09.730> sticky<00:05:10.030> situation<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:11.260> can<00:05:11.500> risk

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
in a sticky situation and you can risk

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.790 
in a sticky situation and you can risk
giving<00:05:12.670> a<00:05:12.850> character<00:05:13.270> like<00:05:13.450> Alfred<00:05:13.960> per<00:05:14.320> se<00:05:14.530> an

giving a character like Alfred per se an

giving a character like Alfred per se an
action<00:05:15.700> token<00:05:16.000> because<00:05:16.270> all<00:05:16.420> he<00:05:16.570> does<00:05:16.720> is<00:05:16.870> sit

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
action token because all he does is sit

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.050 
action token because all he does is sit

is to theme teams don't forget that when

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.250 
is to theme teams don't forget that when
creating<00:05:24.640> a<00:05:24.730> team<00:05:24.970> there<00:05:25.480> are<00:05:25.510> generic<00:05:25.990> and

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
creating a team there are generic and

there<00:05:26.650> are<00:05:26.860> themed<00:05:27.490> keywords<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.600> so<00:05:29.290> usually

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
there are themed keywords and so usually

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.650 
there are themed keywords and so usually
you<00:05:30.100> can<00:05:30.280> tell<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:31.000> difference<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.540> know
