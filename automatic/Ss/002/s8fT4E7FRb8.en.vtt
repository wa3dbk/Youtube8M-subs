00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.999
 in this video we are going to solve a 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.170
 selectivity problem appeared in 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:10.849
 the tests of madrid of the year 2009 in the 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.179
 which ask us to find the condition that 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.839
 produces the defined plane in the piece 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.920
 for the points 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.050
 ape yc as we see we have a piece and 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.640
 give us three points that will define the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.610
 plane from which we have to find the 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.940
 condition that it produces in this piece we see 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.630
 that these points are also located 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.300
 in the piece itself we see that point b 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.610
 and they are already points located in the piece 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.490
 but they are also points that are in the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.180
 own plans of the trilero in fact the 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.760
 point is in the two frontal planes 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.570
 front and the second front profile 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.640
 therefore it is on the z- axis the point c 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.250
 it would be in the second frontal plane 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.270
 flat profile as you want to call and the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.340
 point b is in the horizontal plane this 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.890
 it makes the first part easy 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.720
 of the exercise that simply trace the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.500
 plane from which then we have to find 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.930
 the section I will draw lines laid 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.659
 that both point a and point are 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.969
 is it so 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.179
 in the second front plane in the plane 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:22.750
 of profile not to determine the trace 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:27.369
 that produces this plane here we would have 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.400
 the trace that the plane produces in the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.650
 front plane 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.410
 well we have this cut point 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.590
 with the axis and that is going to be also a 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.080
 trace point in the horizontal plane 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.060
 and we have point b, which is a point 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.270
 located in the horizontal plane with what 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.720
 which we already have the trace with that plane and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.030
 and simply join these two points 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.940
 this we have it on the x axis with this 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.520
 that we have it on the z axis and we have the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.290
 three traces of the plane that define the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.980
 points sometimes I will name the traces 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.280
 not called p trust horizontal terrace 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.030
 frontal and traces of prefer 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.209
 as we see 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.910
 this post this line that goes from to 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.690
 up to six will already be part of the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.430
 section in the short part and that face 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.439
 then I will mark it and this line 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.019
 since the piece is resting on the 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.269
 frontal plane this line that starts from 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.670
 this point until this is going to be also 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.189
 part of the section so knowing 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.969
 this we can conclude that there will be a cut 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:41.750
 on this face from this time from the 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:44.870
 point from until that cut of the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.959
 trace the piece since this face 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.629
 is supported on the plane and we have the 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.840
 trace of the plane determines us point of 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:56.150
 cut with the edge of the plane and with the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.510
 face that is behind that we do not see would be 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.159
 to be cut as I said before 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.079
 we would have the continuation of the section 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:08.900
 around here and we would stay this face in 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.500
 definitive thanks to the traces we have 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.409
 located easily the section we see 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.659
 what you should do there is an obvious cut 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.489
 because they are two points of the piece and 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.260
 same plane time which we have 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.620
 there is a section on this side here 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.389
 we have one until the trace because the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.600
 face of the piece is supported on the 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.700
 own plane and we have the trace 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.470
 and here the same thing we have the trace of 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.890
 flat 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.370
 the profile and this face is there behind 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.530
 is supported on that plane whereby 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.900
 that trace would be a line also of the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.450
 section of the piece because we have already 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.190
 concluded this problem pretty easy 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.980
 he believed 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.420
 where I asked for it in the section of this 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.400
 piece 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.560
 isometric well I hope as always 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.250
 that the video is useful we see ourselves in 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.250
 the next video
