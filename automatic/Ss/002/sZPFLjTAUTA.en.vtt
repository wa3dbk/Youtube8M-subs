some sort for this it just makes it

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.160 
some sort for this it just makes it
easier<00:00:16.039> it's<00:00:17.039> five<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.460> go<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.570> seems

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
easier it's five if you go but it seems

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.330 
easier it's five if you go but it seems
to<00:00:19.320> help<00:00:19.410> connect<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.520> ends<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:22.189> let's<00:00:23.189> go

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
to help connect the ends and let's go

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.870 
to help connect the ends and let's go
sort<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.789> zip<00:00:24.390> down<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.670> should<00:00:26.820> be

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
sort of zip down so that it should be

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.610 
sort of zip down so that it should be
too<00:00:27.180> wide<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.539> want<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> take<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
too wide and then you want to take it I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.729 
too wide and then you want to take it I
just<00:00:34.620> fold<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> over<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.870> makes<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.290> two

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
just fold it over so that it makes a two

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.200 
just fold it over so that it makes a two
by<00:00:37.950> two<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:39.140> then<00:00:40.140> take<00:00:40.890> your<00:00:41.250> card<00:00:41.760> or<00:00:42.090> your

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
by two and then take your card or your

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.240 
by two and then take your card or your
figures<00:00:42.629> doesn't<00:00:43.590> matter<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:45.920> like<00:00:46.920> right<00:00:47.219> in

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
figures doesn't matter and like right in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
figures doesn't matter and like right in
the<00:00:47.489> middle<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.770> two<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.160> two<00:00:50.809> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the middle of the of the two by two you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.760 
the middle of the of the two by two you
want<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.350> split<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:57.230> see<00:00:58.230> how<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> started

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
want to split it and see how it started

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.000 
want to split it and see how it started
to<00:00:58.859> splay<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.870> 432<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.199> run<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:01.739> car

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to splay to the 432 just run your car

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.789 
to splay to the 432 just run your car
log<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:03.780> straighten<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.170> whole<00:01:04.260> thing<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
log it to straighten the whole thing and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
log it to straighten the whole thing and
here<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> end<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> want<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> put<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> in

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
here at the end you want to put it in

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.289 
here at the end you want to put it in
and<00:01:08.240> just<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.420> finish<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.869> end<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:11.090> fix<00:01:12.090> any

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and just to finish the end off fix any

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.810 
and just to finish the end off fix any
of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> ends<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.110> messed<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.390 

estimate<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.140> one-third<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> length

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
estimate about one-third of the length

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.820 
estimate about one-third of the length
or<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:21.810> precise<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> body<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.680> could

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
or if you're precise the body you could

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
or if you're precise the body you could
count<00:01:23.040> 18<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.509> quicker<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:26.750> just<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
count 18 but it's quicker just to just a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.380 
count 18 but it's quicker just to just a
guess<00:01:28.740> add<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:30.240> away<00:01:30.530> depending<00:01:31.530> on

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
guess add or take away depending on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.120 
guess add or take away depending on
whether<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.659> too<00:01:33.930> low<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.170> too<00:01:34.320> short<00:01:37.130> split

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
whether it's too low or too short split

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.260 
whether it's too low or too short split
it<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> makes<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.720> too<00:01:40.470> wide<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.880> if

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it so that it makes a too wide and if if

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.810 
it so that it makes a too wide and if if
they<00:01:45.659> don't<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:46.049> together<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.799> take<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
they don't go together just take it and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.359 
they don't go together just take it and
flip<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.270> over<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:52.009> just<00:01:53.009> join<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.729> side

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
flip it over I just join it to the side

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.969 
flip it over I just join it to the side
so<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> becomes<00:01:56.909> 6<00:01:57.450> wide<00:01:57.689> x<00:01:57.930> 36<00:01:58.409> long<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
so that it becomes 6 wide x 36 long and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.959 
so that it becomes 6 wide x 36 long and
I<00:01:59.990> guessed<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.759> leave

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
I guessed just right so I can just leave

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:10.510 
I guessed just right so I can just leave
it<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:04.759> count<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:07.789> six

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
it like this count out six

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.050 
it like this count out six
and<00:02:14.180> totally<00:02:15.180> spaced<00:02:15.569> out<00:02:15.780> real<00:02:15.930> quick<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:17.060> then

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
and totally spaced out real quick I then

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.020 
and totally spaced out real quick I then
fold<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.870> over<00:02:18.989> onto<00:02:19.530> itself<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.790> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
fold it over onto itself so that you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.930 
fold it over onto itself so that you
have<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.630> top<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.620> six<00:02:22.860> by<00:02:23.010> six<00:02:23.069> fold<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.849> on

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
have the top of a six by six fold it on

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.520 
have the top of a six by six fold it on
to<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> rest<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:26.300> keep<00:02:27.300> pulling<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:30.530> just

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
to the rest just keep pulling it just

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.800 
to the rest just keep pulling it just
turd<00:02:33.800> good<00:02:34.800> fold<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.780> fold<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:38.599> here's<00:02:39.599> your

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
turd good fold and fold and here's your

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.759 
turd good fold and fold and here's your
six<00:02:40.110> by<00:02:40.260> six<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:42.360> now<00:02:42.569> if<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.440> can
