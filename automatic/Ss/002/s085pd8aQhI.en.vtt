00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.429
 good staff a easy project 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.990
 construction but is experiencing some 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.230
 details for who really goes 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.180
 interested in building but already 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 which is indispensable services of a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.439
 locksmith is a project made 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.410
 basically with bicycle parts 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.900
 one of the principles for achieving 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.750
 900 degrees of rotation is the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.170
 transmission as pot emerge 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.660
 270 degrees and I got it through the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.690
 bike champion crown 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.660
 Let's go over this piece of the picture here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.780
 through which the place this tip 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.930
 would the handlebars and the other and the wheel to 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.870
 hold the 11-tooth pawn 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.870
 I used this piece of a 7 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:09.660
 Yesterday the cassette cube took that part. 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.730
 I closed the arms place fit it here 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.860
 of a few soldering points for those who 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.380
 goes nowhere 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.979
 here where 11 identifies seven docked and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.410
 soldering back here on the steering wheel 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.390
 the sports car steering wheel 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.880
 But for me, I could call him. 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.800
 I used it as a homemade cube that is a cube 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.030
 very expensive and selective car is 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.970
 must have a car 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.940
 truth is that organized dunga cut 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.670
 with only one inch of sheet 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.650
 this side and that side of the calculation for 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.460
 the steering wheel and the flowering to 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.080
 get into the old bicycle fork 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.050
 triple crown 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.090
 however I cut the larger crown using the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:00.600
 middle crown in 38 teeth and the minor crown 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.820
 served as a guide for the ball and this 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.420
 after the bar has been settled around the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.420
 detail 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:16.129
 here the central movement of the bicycle 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.470
 already adapted here would be the axis where 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.140
 would be screwed foot reveals here enter 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.680
 screw and screw hole served 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.620
 to put a potentiometer using a 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.049
 small bushes and effect with a sponge 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.510
 this part of a steering wheel that already had her 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.670
 It's a spring to come and I'm going today. 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.590
 to the center only in this case 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.360
 with 900 degrees of rotation the system of 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.010
 she can not have strength 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.409
 because the steering wheel is already back in the center 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.030
 but since it gave me trouble to put 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.860
 I'd rather not take it away 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.030
 responsible for bringing 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.720
 back to the center 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.750
 these two springs here with your bills 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.549
 connected to this art and the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.590
 Crown upstairs and one downstairs for 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.849
 to limit the course I used this belly 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.890
 sound of the crown it will spin and hit 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.730
 this stop in here has one in each 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.799
 side 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.540
 to regret the course not to allow 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.420
 that the potential brings him more than he 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.660
 should spoil the now test the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.500
 900 degree steering wheel happened in the 10k 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.419
 connected to my joystick 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.819
 of a playstation 2 is connected to the 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:29.329
 computer via adapt the sbt 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.660
 the game now 32 because it's a great game 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.880
 go do this test well here at 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.260
 steering wheel setting in dead zone 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.450
 let management is at zero 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.440
 in theory be dead zone 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.230
 but in practice here 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.810
 Are you seeing this clearance at the wheel? 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.690
 the more you try to increase the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.319
 amount of steering wheel turns will 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.319
 be this dead zone 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.520
 I believe I was not the first to try 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.070
 make this project that other people already 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.540
 tried to make him stop at this 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.910
 same obstacle 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.120
 you build a steering wheel to generate 900 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.500
 degrees and he gets his break here 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.990
 You did a job in vain that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.170
 really pleasurable to play so I did it 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.150
 video not to show how much my 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.820
 project went bad but I 'm here 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.940
 exposing for you there is the problem that 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.520
 that we have in trying to do with the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.400
 common joystick and comes also to show the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.280
 the solution that I found 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.590
 design is only compact plate one stargate 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.430
 mg that until recently did not even know that 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.000
 there bought and tested enjoy 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.770
 I recommend this not only for having 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.600
 well exceeded the needs in the project 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.430
 but also because it is a 100% 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.450
 you do not need to export from 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.290
 a country outside 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.550
 It is for you avoid welding on the board she has 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.370
 comes with a kit for you to mount the 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.520
 cars just like I put up who already paid 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.100
 today pots on the board you turn on 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.520
 up to 6 power the subway and also 24 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.520
 buttons 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.349
 also to turn the buttons come three 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.110
 flex cars just like this one is you 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.300
 connect directly to each other and 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.979
 They switched on the buttons as they will now 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.209
 in the second test this time using the 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.339
 door is warm 

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:25.279
 in these cars are linked in the 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:26.839
 potentiate hosting and in the other the 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:28.189
 potential inside the steering wheel the same 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:31.069
 used in the previous test 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:33.499
 is a potential of 10 kn to a game 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.179
 also the same number 32 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.739
 Let's go to the tests first thing that 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:38.719
 I want to show dead zone 

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:39.889
 not even to show dead zone because 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.979
 no dead zone 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:48.459
 the direction is perfect the second thing 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.459
 at 900 degrees 450 grams for each side 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.629
 but 90 can be 50 degrees 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.629
 all 900 degrees 

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:24.069
 the 900 degree steering wheel was great for 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:25.689
 simulation games but some games o 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.239
 ideal would be a steering wheel with maximum steering 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.830
 for this rather than 

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:31.659
 build a new steering wheel 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.539
 I can just free mine with 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:38.669
 How many degrees do you want to find here? 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:43.269
 two games property settings 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:46.869
 calibrate here I'll mark this 

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:48.729
 show raw data and 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:56.259
 I will generally drive the wheel 90 degrees to a 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:59.649
 side or memorize this information 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:01.989
 appears there on the axis of pee and I'm going to take 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:05.579
 a handwheel on the other hand until you 

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:05.579
 the same value being negative 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:12.899
 ok it's calibrated 

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:58.559
