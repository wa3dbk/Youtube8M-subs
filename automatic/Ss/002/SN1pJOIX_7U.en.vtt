you can be careful of what you need you
will<00:00:27.599> get<00:00:27.779> deal<00:00:27.990> yards<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> desktops<00:00:29.189> as

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
will get deal yards for the desktops as

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
will get deal yards for the desktops as
well<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.670> notebooks<00:00:30.090> again<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.840> two<00:00:30.990> dr

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
well and notebooks again you have two dr

well and notebooks again you have two dr
one<00:00:31.439> two<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.769> three<00:00:32.009> both<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.520> desktops<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
one two and three both in desktops and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.799 
one two and three both in desktops and
notebooks<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.600> video

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
notebooks you can see that in this video

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.139 
notebooks you can see that in this video
you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:38.010> longer<00:00:38.430> number<00:00:38.790> ones<00:00:38.969> up

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
you can see the longer number ones up

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.410 
you can see the longer number ones up
for<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.500> desktops<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> service<00:00:41.420> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
for the desktops of the service the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.020 
for the desktops of the service the
shorter<00:00:42.750> ones<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.469> used<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
shorter ones are used in the in the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.729 
shorter ones are used in the in the
notebooks<00:00:45.829> let's<00:00:46.829> look<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.300> DDR<00:00:48.300> one

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
notebooks let's look at the DDR one

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.990 
notebooks let's look at the DDR one
again<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.770> had<00:00:50.010> mentioned<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.370> earlier<00:00:50.460> video

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
again I had mentioned that earlier video

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.610 
again I had mentioned that earlier video
if<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.780> 184<00:00:52.710> pin<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:54.390> DDR<00:00:54.719> ones<00:00:54.960> but

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
if they are all 184 pin the DDR ones but

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
if they are all 184 pin the DDR ones but
you<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:55.920> notice<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.219> between<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.210> two

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you will notice that between the two

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.170 
you will notice that between the two
n'yar<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.379> GDR<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
n'yar one this one is GDR one this is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.709 
n'yar one this one is GDR one this is
GTR<00:01:00.539> 2<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.410> ddr3<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
GTR 2 and this is ddr3 the the thing you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.109 
GTR 2 and this is ddr3 the the thing you
want<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> watch<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.850> try<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
want to watch out for is when you try to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.890 
want to watch out for is when you try to
match<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:07.310> there<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> notch<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
match these there is a notch there is a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
match these there is a notch there is a
knot<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.100> middle<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> modules<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
knot in the middle of the modules and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.499 
knot in the middle of the modules and
they<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.020> different<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.560> each<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> TDRs

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
they are different for each of the TDRs

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.590 
they are different for each of the TDRs
so<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.350> buy<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.159> wrong<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.330> will<00:01:18.540> not

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
so if you buy the wrong one it will not

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.960 
so if you buy the wrong one it will not
fit<00:01:18.930> into<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.470> machine<00:01:19.670> especially<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
fit into your machine especially for the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
fit into your machine especially for the
server<00:01:21.240> guys<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> bind<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.350> server

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
server guys when you bind the server

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
server guys when you bind the server
server<00:01:23.100> memory<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.270> very<00:01:24.479> careful

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
server memory you will be very careful

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.460 
server memory you will be very careful
what<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.780> matching<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
what is in it and you are matching the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
what is in it and you are matching the

and<00:01:32.479> if<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.630> make<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.960> mistake<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.680> ordering

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and if you make this mistake of ordering

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.270 
and if you make this mistake of ordering
the<00:01:35.400> wrong<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.509> DDR<00:01:36.990> version<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.650> why

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the wrong and DDR version it will why

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.710 
the wrong and DDR version it will why
will<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.640> fill<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.090> very<00:01:39.270> frustrating

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
will not fill in to be very frustrating

for<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.020> let<00:01:40.920> me<00:01:40.950> move<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.610> notebook<00:01:42.030> guys

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
for you let me move to the notebook guys

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
for you let me move to the notebook guys
the<00:01:42.840> notebook<00:01:43.079> people<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.829> when<00:01:44.130> you're

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the notebook people in when you're

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.750 
the notebook people in when you're
buying<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.820> load<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> memory

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
buying a load of memory

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.250 
buying a load of memory
you're<00:01:46.030> wanted<00:01:46.480> here<00:01:46.660> to<00:01:46.840> an<00:01:46.960> even<00:01:47.230> more

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
you're wanted here to an even more

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.300 
you're wanted here to an even more
similar<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:49.060> TTR<00:01:49.480> 1<00:01:49.720> +<00:01:49.930> edr<00:01:50.050> two<00:01:50.530> are<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.130> close

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
similar the TTR 1 + edr two are so close

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.010 
similar the TTR 1 + edr two are so close
you<00:01:51.610> can<00:01:51.760> hardly<00:01:52.210> tell<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.480> difference<00:01:52.600> but

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
you can hardly tell the difference but

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.220 
you can hardly tell the difference but
it<00:01:53.170> is<00:01:53.320> like<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.800> hair<00:01:54.550> away<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.540> notch<00:01:55.780> if<00:01:56.050> I

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
it is like a hair away the notch if I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.810 
it is like a hair away the notch if I
don't<00:01:56.410> you<00:01:56.500> can<00:01:56.530> focus<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.220> but<00:01:57.400> if<00:01:57.760> you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
don't you can focus that in but if you

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.030 
don't you can focus that in but if you
focus<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.540> you'll<00:01:58.720> see<00:01:58.930> that<00:01:58.960> they<00:01:59.440> so

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
focus it to it you'll see that they so
