00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
alright here's my green house that I

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.700 
alright here's my green house that I
built<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.730> purchased<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.910> Harbor<00:00:06.390> Freight

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
built I purchased a Harbor Freight

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.700 
built I purchased a Harbor Freight
greenhouse<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:08.099> put<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.179> up<00:00:09.440> it's<00:00:10.440> very

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
greenhouse I put it up it's very

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.490 
greenhouse I put it up it's very
difficult<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.400> put<00:00:11.610> up<00:00:11.900> but<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:12.990> got<00:00:13.019> her<00:00:13.320> up

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
difficult to put up but we got her up

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.210 
difficult to put up but we got her up
and<00:00:13.650> then<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.070> built<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.400> frame<00:00:14.700> around<00:00:14.910> it

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
and then I built a frame around it

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.470 
and then I built a frame around it
basically<00:00:17.750> structure<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.740> protect<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.480> from

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
basically structure to protect it from

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.550 
basically structure to protect it from
the<00:00:21.570> elements

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.220 

I<00:00:26.650> wrap<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.580> in<00:00:27.699> a<00:00:27.820> poly<00:00:29.519> basic<00:00:30.930> high<00:00:31.930> gauge

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
I wrap it in a poly basic high gauge

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.280 
I wrap it in a poly basic high gauge
poly<00:00:32.529> mil<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:34.120> high<00:00:34.239> quality<00:00:34.720> poly<00:00:34.960> mil

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
poly mil or high quality poly mil

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.890 
poly mil or high quality poly mil
plastic<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.340> did<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.970> you<00:00:37.150> channels<00:00:37.629> here<00:00:37.870> on

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
plastic I did the you channels here on

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.420 
plastic I did the you channels here on
the<00:00:38.110> side<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:40.390> wrap<00:00:40.629> it<00:00:40.660> in<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.020> winter<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
the side and we wrap it in the winter to

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.180 
the side and we wrap it in the winter to
help<00:00:42.550> with<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.910> snow<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.839> it<00:00:44.620> helps<00:00:44.980> with

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
help with the snow and it helps with

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
help with the snow and it helps with
heating<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:47.110> I'm<00:00:47.260> doing<00:00:47.620> is<00:00:47.860> I<00:00:48.160> have<00:00:48.640> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
heating what I'm doing is I have a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.819 
heating what I'm doing is I have a
corrugated<00:00:50.710> panel<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.699> start<00:00:51.760> with<00:00:52.180> here<00:00:52.829> then

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
corrugated panel to start with here then

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.039 
corrugated panel to start with here then
I<00:00:53.860> have<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:57.040> frame<00:00:57.370> built<00:00:57.879> off<00:00:58.120> of<00:00:58.150> it<00:00:58.510> about

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
I have the frame built off of it about

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.630 
I have the frame built off of it about
eight<00:00:59.290> inches<00:00:59.769> and<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:03.010> when<00:01:03.159> I<00:01:03.190> put<00:01:03.549> the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
eight inches and then when I put the

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.179 
eight inches and then when I put the
plastic<00:01:04.180> on<00:01:04.360> that<00:01:04.720> actually<00:01:05.170> acts<00:01:05.409> as<00:01:05.830> air

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
plastic on that actually acts as air

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.730 
plastic on that actually acts as air
insulation<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.619> do<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.830> double<00:01:10.409> layer<00:01:11.409> of

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
insulation and I do a double layer of

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.700 
insulation and I do a double layer of
plastic<00:01:12.369> which<00:01:12.790> allows<00:01:13.150> me<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.659> get<00:01:13.869> double

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
plastic which allows me to get double

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.850 
plastic which allows me to get double
air<00:01:15.490> insulation<00:01:16.299> I<00:01:16.510> had<00:01:17.320> something<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.830> wanted

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
air insulation I had something I wanted

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.570 
air insulation I had something I wanted
to<00:01:18.250> try<00:01:18.520> out<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:19.570> how<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.750> would<00:01:20.049> work<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
to try out see how it would work and the

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.530 
to try out see how it would work and the
combination<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:23.460> Amish<00:01:24.460> insulation<00:01:25.360> is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
combination of Amish insulation is

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.109 
combination of Amish insulation is
called<00:01:25.780> where<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.320> build<00:01:26.560> off<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.189> at<00:01:28.060> a

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
called where you build off of it at a

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.130 
called where you build off of it at a
certain<00:01:28.630> distance<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.430> pairing<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:30.609> with

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
certain distance and pairing that with

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.899 
certain distance and pairing that with
the<00:01:32.140> air<00:01:32.380> bubble<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:34.299> seemed<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
the air bubble really seemed to be the

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.749 
the air bubble really seemed to be the
best<00:01:36.939> overall<00:01:37.869> option<00:01:38.469> for<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.369> winters

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
best overall option for the winters

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.599 
best overall option for the winters
around<00:01:40.149> here<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.890> Wisconsin<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:41.979> gets<00:01:42.159> pretty

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
around here in Wisconsin it gets pretty

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.219 
around here in Wisconsin it gets pretty
cold<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:44.140> there's<00:01:44.950> my<00:01:45.219> greenhouse<00:01:46.229> been

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
cold but there's my greenhouse been

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.830 
cold but there's my greenhouse been
meaning<00:01:47.619> to<00:01:47.649> do<00:01:47.859> a<00:01:47.890> video<00:01:48.189> for<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.670> while<00:01:48.880> here<00:01:49.270> I

meaning to do a video for a while here I
learned<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.390> stuff<00:01:52.630> about<00:01:52.749> gardening

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
learned a lot of stuff about gardening

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.959 
learned a lot of stuff about gardening
and<00:01:53.740> I'll<00:01:54.460> give<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.119> credit<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:56.549> first<00:01:57.549> up<00:01:57.759> my

accomplished I got some aeroponic

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.679 
accomplished I got some aeroponic
systems<00:02:30.730> going<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.310> for<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.270> majority
