actually<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> macro<00:00:50.550> lens

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
actually a macro lens

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.450 
actually a macro lens
you're<00:00:51.329> probably<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.809> well<00:00:52.230> duh<00:00:52.739> causes<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
back remains this is macro in the box

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.069 
back remains this is macro in the box
well<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> lot<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> manufacturers

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
well what a lot of manufacturers

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.520 
well what a lot of manufacturers
actually<00:00:58.260> do<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.399> call<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.120> lens<00:01:00.390> macro<00:01:01.109> just

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
actually do they call a lens macro just

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.950 
actually do they call a lens macro just
because<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.190> able<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:03.000> take<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.539> really

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
because it is able to take that really

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.969 
because it is able to take that really
close<00:01:04.260> distances<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:06.229> micro<00:01:07.229> doesn't<00:01:07.740> just

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
close distances but micro doesn't just

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.050 
close distances but micro doesn't just
mean<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.970> focus<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:10.350> close<00:01:10.920> distance<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
mean you can focus at close distance it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
mean you can focus at close distance it
also<00:01:12.270> means<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> one-to-one<00:01:13.680> scale

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
also means you get a one-to-one scale

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.539 
also means you get a one-to-one scale
and<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.840> lens<00:01:16.140> offers<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and this is what this lens offers so the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
and this is what this lens offers so the
first<00:01:17.850> thing<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.900> lens<00:01:19.140> is

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
first thing I like about this lens is

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.899 
first thing I like about this lens is
that<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> macro<00:01:20.490> lens

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that it's a macro lens

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.289 
that it's a macro lens
oh<00:01:21.000> yeah<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.590> weird<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
oh yeah it's a bit weird but I like that

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.420 
oh yeah it's a bit weird but I like that
it<00:01:24.600> has<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.110> one-to-one<00:01:25.590> scale<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it has that one-to-one scale this is a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.170 
it has that one-to-one scale this is a
true<00:01:26.909> macro<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:28.170> isn't<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> fake<00:01:28.829> macro<00:01:29.430> even

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
true macro this isn't a fake macro even

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.569 
true macro this isn't a fake macro even
though<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.570> has<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> capability<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.310> more

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
though it has a capability to be more

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.679 
though it has a capability to be more
than<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.909> macro<00:01:33.390> its<00:01:33.930> macro<00:01:34.729> features<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.150> its

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
than a macro its macro features and its

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.929 
than a macro its macro features and its
capability<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.829> are<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.670> powerful<00:01:39.650> but

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
capability you are really powerful but

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.609 
capability you are really powerful but
if<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.180> into<00:01:42.659> shooting<00:01:43.220> moving<00:01:44.220> macro<00:01:44.850> or

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
if you're into shooting moving macro or

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.060 
if you're into shooting moving macro or
shooting<00:01:46.939> insects<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.899> stuff<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.710> moving

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
shooting insects all stuff that's moving

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.580 
shooting insects all stuff that's moving
at<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:50.670> close<00:01:51.030> range<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.320> quite

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
at a very close range it will be quite

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100 
at a very close range it will be quite
difficult<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.460> lens<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.659> 40

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
difficult with this lens because it's 40

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.920 
difficult with this lens because it's 40
millimetres<00:01:55.799> you'll<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.210> too<00:01:57.509> close

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
millimetres you'll have to get too close

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.230 
millimetres you'll have to get too close
to<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> subject<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> work<00:01:59.490> if<00:02:00.000> you're

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
to the subject for it to work if you're

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.179 
to the subject for it to work if you're
trying<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> take<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> picture<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.500> an<00:02:01.649> insect

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
trying to take a picture of an insect

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.450 
trying to take a picture of an insect
it's<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> fly<00:02:03.570> away<00:02:03.890> before<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.159> can

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it's going to fly away before you can

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.970 
it's going to fly away before you can
get<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
get that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.670 
get that
shots<00:02:06.250> if<00:02:06.670> you're<00:02:06.880> into<00:02:07.360> taking<00:02:07.780> moving

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
shots if you're into taking moving

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.360 
shots if you're into taking moving
macros<00:02:09.190> then<00:02:09.790> perhaps<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:11.080> limited<00:02:11.860> focal

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
macros then perhaps the limited focal

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.180 
macros then perhaps the limited focal
length<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:12.910> lens<00:02:13.210> isn't<00:02:14.200> going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.710> be<00:02:14.890> so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
length of this lens isn't going to be so

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.080 
length of this lens isn't going to be so
good<00:02:15.460> for<00:02:15.490> you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
good for you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.650 
good for you
that<00:02:16.360> 40<00:02:16.900> millimeter<00:02:17.380> focal<00:02:17.740> length<00:02:18.660> it's

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that 40 millimeter focal length it's

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.160 
that 40 millimeter focal length it's
midway<00:02:20.170> between<00:02:20.830> 35<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.790> 50<00:02:22.270> millimeters

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
midway between 35 and 50 millimeters

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.760 
midway between 35 and 50 millimeters
more<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.680> towards<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.220> 35<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:26.440> think<00:02:26.650> this

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
more so towards the 35 and I think this

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.480 
more so towards the 35 and I think this
is<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> nice<00:02:27.460> sweet<00:02:27.940> spot<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:29.080> get<00:02:30.010> some<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
is a nice sweet spot you get some of the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.120 
is a nice sweet spot you get some of the
benefits<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.330> 50<00:02:32.110> millimetres<00:02:32.710> which<00:02:32.920> is

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
benefits of 50 millimetres which is

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.380 
benefits of 50 millimetres which is
perhaps<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.700> more<00:02:33.730> creative<00:02:34.950> limited<00:02:35.950> style

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
perhaps a more creative limited style

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.330 
perhaps a more creative limited style
but<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.510> get<00:02:37.690> some<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:37.990> those<00:02:38.110> benefits<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.800> 35

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
but you get some of those benefits of 35

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.100 
but you get some of those benefits of 35
the<00:02:39.790> more<00:02:40.420> versatility<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:42.010> greater

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
the more versatility the greater

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.250 
the more versatility the greater
wide-angle<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.340> 40<00:02:45.700> millimeter

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
wide-angle and so the 40 millimeter

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.050 
wide-angle and so the 40 millimeter
focal<00:02:47.260> length<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> bit<00:02:48.100> odd<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.760> think

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
focal length is a bit odd but I think

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.200 
focal length is a bit odd but I think
it's<00:02:49.240> a<00:02:49.360> really<00:02:49.780> nice<00:02:50.700> middle<00:02:51.700> ground<00:02:51.730> between

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
it's a really nice middle ground between

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.610 
it's a really nice middle ground between
35<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.050> 40<00:02:53.820> however<00:02:54.820> this<00:02:55.780> does<00:02:56.140> also<00:02:56.410> have

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
35 and 40 however this does also have

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.270 
35 and 40 however this does also have
its<00:02:57.220> own<00:02:57.430> problems<00:02:58.590> sometimes<00:02:59.590> it<00:03:00.040> does<00:03:00.250> feel

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
its own problems sometimes it does feel

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.120 
its own problems sometimes it does feel
a<00:03:00.610> bit<00:03:00.730> like<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> compromise<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:02.500> never<00:03:02.710> have<00:03:03.100> a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
a bit like a compromise you never have a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.180 
a bit like a compromise you never have a
35<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:03.940> never<00:03:04.180> have<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> 50<00:03:05.080> you're<00:03:05.590> always<00:03:05.770> in

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
35 you never have a 50 you're always in

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.250 
35 you never have a 50 you're always in
that<00:03:06.250> middle<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.360> sometimes<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.990> does<00:03:08.230> feel

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
that middle so sometimes it does feel

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.790 
that middle so sometimes it does feel
too<00:03:08.800> zoomed<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.580> sometimes<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.810> feels<00:03:11.050> too

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
too zoomed in and sometimes it feels too

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.040 
too zoomed in and sometimes it feels too
wide<00:03:12.100> now<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.670> personally<00:03:13.090> can<00:03:13.510> live<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.840> that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
wide now I personally can live of that

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.010 
wide now I personally can live of that
because<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.740> 40<00:03:15.670> millimeter<00:03:16.150> focal

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
because I like 40 millimeter focal

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.650 
because I like 40 millimeter focal
lengths<00:03:17.530> but<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.400> will<00:03:18.610> notice<00:03:18.910> at<00:03:19.360> times

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
lengths but you will notice at times

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.650 
lengths but you will notice at times
when<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.709> just<00:03:20.950> feels<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.340> bit<00:03:21.370> off<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:22.270> lens

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
when it just feels a bit off this lens

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.449 
when it just feels a bit off this lens
is<00:03:23.760> at<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:25.050> phenomenal<00:03:26.050> price<00:03:26.290> point<00:03:26.739> I'm<00:03:27.400> not

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
is at a phenomenal price point I'm not

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.580 
is at a phenomenal price point I'm not
going<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.850> mention<00:03:28.030> pricing<00:03:28.780> because<00:03:28.989> yeah

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
going to mention pricing because yeah

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.490 
going to mention pricing because yeah
you<00:03:29.650> know<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.400> changes<00:03:31.000> all<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.180> time<00:03:31.330> this<00:03:32.320> is

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
you know it changes all the time this is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.630 
you know it changes all the time this is
such<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.830> good<00:03:33.370> bang<00:03:34.330> for<00:03:34.360> buck<00:03:34.750> lens

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
such a good bang for buck lens

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.910 
such a good bang for buck lens
this<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.600> really<00:03:38.020> good<00:03:38.140> lens<00:03:38.350> for<00:03:38.560> amateur

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
this is a really good lens for amateur

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.559 
this is a really good lens for amateur
photographers<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.910> another<00:03:40.240> reason

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
photographers and this is another reason

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.880 
photographers and this is another reason
why<00:03:40.990> only<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:42.069> it<00:03:42.400> in<00:03:42.730> macro<00:03:43.170> Andy<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.740> know

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
why only is it in macro Andy you know

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.300 
why only is it in macro Andy you know
normal<00:03:45.310> prime<00:03:45.640> lens<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.690> also<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.800> really

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
normal prime lens it is also a really

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.630 
normal prime lens it is also a really
entry<00:03:48.760> level<00:03:49.090> lens<00:03:49.360> but<00:03:50.200> with<00:03:51.160> all<00:03:51.340> great

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
entry level lens but with all great

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.270 
entry level lens but with all great
things<00:03:51.970> there<00:03:52.300> are<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.569> few<00:03:52.900> issues<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.650> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
things there are a few issues and the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.610 
things there are a few issues and the
real<00:03:54.459> issue<00:03:54.820> I<00:03:54.850> see<00:03:55.240> with<00:03:55.270> this<00:03:55.480> lens<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:56.050> that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
real issue I see with this lens is that

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.580 
real issue I see with this lens is that
it<00:03:57.070> has<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.340> cheap<00:03:57.700> build<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:59.230> kind<00:03:59.500> of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it has a cheap build it's kind of

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.460 
it has a cheap build it's kind of
expected<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.459> get<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:00.970> really<00:04:01.420> good<00:04:02.020> piece<00:04:02.260> of

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
expected you get a really good piece of

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.720 
expected you get a really good piece of
glass<00:04:02.920> for<00:04:03.790> less<00:04:04.209> than<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:05.200> know<00:04:05.380> 300<00:04:06.130> pounds

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
glass for less than you know 300 pounds

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.690 
glass for less than you know 300 pounds
it's<00:04:07.420> not<00:04:07.989> going<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.319> be<00:04:08.440> built<00:04:08.890> out<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.130> metal

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
it's not going to be built out of metal

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.420 
it's not going to be built out of metal
but<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.270> does<00:04:10.450> feel<00:04:10.720> quite<00:04:10.900> cheap<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.500> wouldn't

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
but it does feel quite cheap I wouldn't

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.000 
but it does feel quite cheap I wouldn't
mind<00:04:12.760> paying<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.209> bit<00:04:13.450> more<00:04:13.750> if<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.530> did<00:04:14.739> feel<00:04:14.950> a

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
mind paying a bit more if it did feel a

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.699 
mind paying a bit more if it did feel a
bit<00:04:15.250> more<00:04:15.400> premium<00:04:15.970> but<00:04:16.209> certainly<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:17.410> think

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
bit more premium but certainly I think

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.690 
bit more premium but certainly I think
the<00:04:18.780> extra<00:04:19.780> photographic<00:04:20.769> benefits<00:04:21.310> really

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
the extra photographic benefits really

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.240 
the extra photographic benefits really
do<00:04:21.970> outweigh<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.960> cheap<00:04:23.200> feel<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.770> this<00:04:23.950> lens

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
do outweigh the cheap feel of this lens

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.570 
do outweigh the cheap feel of this lens
and<00:04:24.640> finally<00:04:25.540> this<00:04:25.840> lens<00:04:26.140> also<00:04:26.590> has<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.890> really

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
and finally this lens also has a really

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.409 
and finally this lens also has a really
good<00:04:28.680> aperture<00:04:29.680> range<00:04:29.950> goes<00:04:30.910> all<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.240> way

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
good aperture range goes all the way

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.130 
good aperture range goes all the way
from<00:04:31.800> f-22<00:04:32.800> which<00:04:33.040> is<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.570> really<00:04:34.570> small

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
from f-22 which is a really small

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.520 
from f-22 which is a really small
aperture<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:36.610> F<00:04:36.730> 2.8<00:04:37.510> which<00:04:37.750> allows<00:04:38.290> you<00:04:38.500> to

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
aperture to F 2.8 which allows you to

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.210 
aperture to F 2.8 which allows you to
get<00:04:38.860> loads<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.610> light<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.150> get<00:04:41.080> bokeh<00:04:41.890> and

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
get loads of light and get bokeh and

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.440 
get loads of light and get bokeh and
again<00:04:43.150> this<00:04:43.390> emphasizes<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:45.310> versatility<00:04:45.940> of

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
again this emphasizes the versatility of

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.890 
again this emphasizes the versatility of
this<00:04:46.930> lens<00:04:47.229> you<00:04:48.100> can<00:04:48.310> use<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:48.880> for<00:04:49.240> portraits

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
this lens you can use it for portraits

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.890 
this lens you can use it for portraits
and<00:04:50.410> at<00:04:50.650> F<00:04:50.830> 2.8<00:04:51.550> you're<00:04:52.000> going<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.270> get<00:04:52.419> really

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
and at F 2.8 you're going to get really

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.440 
and at F 2.8 you're going to get really

feel like a compromise at times and the

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.140 
feel like a compromise at times and the
build<00:05:45.640> is<00:05:45.910> rather<00:05:46.360> cheap<00:05:47.370> but<00:05:48.370> overall<00:05:48.790> I

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
build is rather cheap but overall I

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.210 
build is rather cheap but overall I
think<00:05:49.480> this<00:05:49.780> is<00:05:49.930> a<00:05:49.960> really<00:05:50.500> good<00:05:50.680> lens<00:05:50.890> for
