00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.290
 import 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.550
 I 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.030
 it's my boxing now because apart from that 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.480
 of what 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.850
 In a strong sport I like it very much 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.489
 it fills a lot is not that I'm strong 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.489
 aggressive or not quite the opposite 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.150
 Mayweather and Pacquiao fight is 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.200
 a success now before the fight 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.680
 I share with my friends rivers I like 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.619
 laugh talk about other things that are not 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.780
 of the fight tell jokes go out to 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.549
 walking I try not to think about that 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.549
 The moment of the fight is the only thing I do 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.860
 when I'm in the dressing room I think about 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.110
 get in the ring to leave because my people 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.399
 is waiting for me is waiting in that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.299
 moment they have been waiting for so much 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.299
 time as well as me 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.350
 according to the media instructions of my 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.429
 coach I listen to my mom who always 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 it's there that I did not neglect not to go down 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.890
 the guard that this one is on top of 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.120
 she is always listening to the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.209
 people who are in back 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.380
 so everything is there my mother always 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.010
 is there 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.129
 giving me the blessing 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.129
 to 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.850
 when he heard the national anthem the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.370
 hymn of my country is an emotion that 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.700
 runs through my body makes me bristle all 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.700
 skin 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.849
 I think of my country 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.740
 and already the benign listening 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.640
 I'm always with my eyes now 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:19.380
 I always think about taking the victory to 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.380
 my country and they know what 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.530
 that if we have people and this one because 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.600
 They know that we are Venezuelans and that we are 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.830
 good at what we do that not only 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.830
 we are athletes to forces 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.350
 when the bell rings at that moment 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.750
 all I think is 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.600
 and develop everything that I have come 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:52.470
 doing in the gym I always 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.470
 a person and I entrust myself to God 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.170
 At that moment , nothing happens in my mind 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.750
 I do not think anything, the only thing that I think is 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.060
 in her I look at her I concentrate on 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.680
 he did not hear anything for me in that 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.969
 there is no one in it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.969
 and he does not even want me 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.690
 now I am more aggressive than before 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.940
 true 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.950
 I do not think anymore I do not think so much for 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.970
 to get to my opponent I no longer have 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.970
 that compassion from before 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.020
 81 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:46.480
 I tell him it's not a violent sport is 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:50.970
 a sport where for themes like 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.970
 basketball as baseball is 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.909
 boxing changed my life a lot 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.120
 today I am another person a little more 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:10.139
 mature takes things with more maturity I 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.139
 It helps to change a lot 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.950
 and of course I have never lost the humility that 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.420
 I'm inside I 'm always with my people 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.420
 I never forget where I come from 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:25.669
 with a fight with emotion with enthusiasm 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.549
 is that I like boxing is something that 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.019
 I carry inside me and I live it to the fullest 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:33.319
 no to min 

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:36.100
 not to 2000 but to millions to millions 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:40.380
 percent is live 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.380
 I live inside of me at that moment 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.550
 why 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.550
 i 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.539
 and not
