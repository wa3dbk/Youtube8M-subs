00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.720
 all welcome on my channel and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.170
 today we will do pneumatic 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.000
 crossbow 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.580
 I often ask subscribers to do 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 some self-shooting and I still 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.570
 would decide to do take a little 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.119
 about 70 wooden plank 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.510
 centimeters and cut off a corner of it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.880
 will our pen further take a syringe on 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.250
 60 milliliters can buy it any 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.470
 medical equipment and under its ledges 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.720
 for finger we leave a small notch and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.940
 fix tightly syringe electrical tape 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 further open the syringe to 40 milliliters 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.290
 and put a label with a marker after 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.360
 what we take a small bar 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.610
 and drill two holes under it 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.620
 screws and fasten this bar 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.170
 near the mark further we take a steel twig 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.739
 and under its diameter we drill through 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.870
 hole 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.600
 next we need a little piece 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.820
 strips and drilled ukraine version and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.100
 We paste there against our next take 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 cut the bolt and glue it close 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 from the through hole that's basically 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 all our trigger is ready on 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
 you need to throw the string on the ledge with 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.520
 twigs and when you press the bottom bar 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.049
 twig goes down and thus 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.390
 frees the string further take 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.610
 medical harness we measure it in length to 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.420
 trigger so that it was 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.850
 stretching and folding it twice the edge 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.820
 we wrap tape and connect them with 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.220
 using fine rope and tie them up with 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.710
 using the knot knot and it turns out 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.270
 Here is such a powerful take 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.250
 a small piece of tube from under 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 dropper insert it into the syringe tip 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.229
 and glue glue on take the tube 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.750
 from under the blinds there just perfect 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.000
 suitable bullets for pneumatics and the same 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.500
 we repeat it with her and fasten her with 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.590
 using tape on the trunk 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.390
 Next, take a pen from a syringe and cut out 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.220
 she won't give such a form 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 slip off and you when fired and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.890
 it is necessary to lubricate the piston of the syringe 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.890
 oils 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.300
 case for our rifle for this we take 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.640
 ear stick and on the one hand we remove 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.920
 cotton wool further we take the gypsy igloo and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.619
 insert it into a tube and glue it 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.000
 tightly glue and now let's see 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.000
 how does our gun work 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.190
 like this 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:32.080
 now bullets for pneumatics flying 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.080
 through 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:44.150
 Jirga is all what I wanted to, in principle,
