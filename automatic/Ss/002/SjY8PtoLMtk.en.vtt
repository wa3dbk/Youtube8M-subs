8 9 10 11 12 13

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.289 
8 9 10 11 12 13
what<00:04:14.040> do<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.190> see<00:04:14.700> something<00:04:15.150> 18<00:04:15.480> 19<00:04:15.840> 21<00:04:16.260> 23<00:04:17.299> 24

25
so<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:21.180> see<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.539> get<00:04:21.690> no<00:04:21.960> residue<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:23.340> the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
so you see you get no residue on the

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.890 
so you see you get no residue on the
gloves<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.330> looks<00:04:25.200> just<00:04:25.590> as<00:04:25.890> if<00:04:26.190> there

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
gloves it looks just as if there

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.330 
gloves it looks just as if there
and<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.139> might<00:04:27.350> be<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.500> little<00:04:27.740> bit<00:04:27.860> shinier

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
and you might be a little bit shinier

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.670 
and you might be a little bit shinier
but<00:04:29.090> it's<00:04:29.360> pretty<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.930> clear<00:04:30.259> you<00:04:30.530> know

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
but it's pretty it's clear you know

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.480 
but it's pretty it's clear you know
nonetheless<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.479> grip<00:04:32.990> back<00:04:33.490> you

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
nonetheless so is the grip back you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.370 
nonetheless so is the grip back you
can't<00:04:34.790> tell<00:04:35.150> on<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.660> glove<00:04:35.900> but<00:04:36.139> when<00:04:36.289> you

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
can't tell on the glove but when you

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.260 
can't tell on the glove but when you
feel<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.889> football<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:37.639> actually<00:04:38.030> feel<00:04:38.240> a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
feel a football you actually feel a

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.080 
feel a football you actually feel a
little<00:04:38.570> bit<00:04:38.720> more<00:04:38.990> of<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.669> tackiness<00:04:40.669> on<00:04:41.000> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
little bit more of the tackiness on the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.340 
little bit more of the tackiness on the
glove<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.780> why<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.020> doesn't<00:04:42.199> work

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
glove so this is why it doesn't work

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.950 
glove so this is why it doesn't work
with<00:04:42.740> new<00:04:43.460> gloves<00:04:43.820> because<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.509> the<00:04:44.780> gloves

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
with new gloves because the the gloves

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.180 
with new gloves because the the gloves
are<00:04:45.110> already<00:04:45.350> going<00:04:45.500> to<00:04:45.530> have<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.800> tackiness

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
are already going to have the tackiness

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.850 
are already going to have the tackiness
but<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.270> can<00:04:47.419> already<00:04:47.570> see<00:04:48.020> like<00:04:48.289> there's

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
but you can already see like there's

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.550 
but you can already see like there's
more<00:04:49.100> stuff<00:04:49.430> sticking<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:50.030> it<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.470> don't<00:04:51.470> you

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
more stuff sticking to it I don't you

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.020 
more stuff sticking to it I don't you
guys<00:04:51.680> can<00:04:51.830> see<00:04:51.949> that<00:04:51.979> so<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:52.610> can<00:04:52.699> see<00:04:52.729> those

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
guys can see that so you can see those

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.020 
guys can see that so you can see those
prints<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.979> probably<00:04:54.979> need<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.250> let<00:04:55.580> them<00:04:55.759> dry<00:04:56.000> a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
prints I probably need to let them dry a

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.790 
prints I probably need to let them dry a
little<00:04:56.360> bit<00:04:56.479> longer<00:04:56.780> but<00:04:57.380> that's<00:04:57.560> where<00:04:57.740> you

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
little bit longer but that's where you

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.920 
little bit longer but that's where you
get<00:04:57.919> that<00:04:58.100> additional<00:04:58.610> teching<00:04:59.060> this<00:04:59.210> on<00:04:59.419> the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
get that additional teching this on the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.230 
get that additional teching this on the
glove<00:05:00.199> so<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:00.949> is<00:05:01.010> going<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.220> work<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:01.789> most

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
glove so this is going to work for most

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.500 
glove so this is going to work for most
gloves<00:05:03.080> I<00:05:03.520> did<00:05:04.520> not<00:05:04.669> try<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.000> on<00:05:05.120> my<00:05:05.270> leather

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510
