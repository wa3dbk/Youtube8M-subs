it or something but I really just want
to<00:03:29.639> keep<00:03:29.729> getting<00:03:30.000> kills<00:03:30.209> because<00:03:31.019> it's

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
to keep getting kills because it's

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.899 
to keep getting kills because it's
always<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:31.979> it<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.459> just<00:03:32.489> fun<00:03:34.519> we<00:03:35.519> got<00:03:35.639> there

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
always just it is just fun we got there

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.689 
always just it is just fun we got there
for<00:03:36.150> people<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.169> think<00:03:37.229> there's<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.280> few<00:03:38.519> guys

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
for people so I think there's a few guys

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.960 
for people so I think there's a few guys
up<00:03:39.299> licia<00:03:40.139> Phil<00:03:40.379> not<00:03:40.919> my<00:03:41.370> teammates<00:03:41.669> balls

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
up licia Phil not my teammates balls

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.039 
up licia Phil not my teammates balls
deep<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.419> spine<00:03:42.629> I<00:03:42.659> don't<00:03:42.810> think<00:03:42.930> he's

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
deep in the spine I don't think he's

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.869 
deep in the spine I don't think he's
gonna<00:03:43.109> let<00:03:43.379> him<00:03:43.500> out<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.889> i'll<00:03:44.579> just<00:03:44.609> keep

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
gonna let him out so i'll just keep

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.710 
gonna let him out so i'll just keep
getting<00:03:45.180> kills<00:03:45.449> there's<00:03:45.720> an<00:03:45.840> AGR<00:03:47.359> so<00:03:48.359> let's

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
getting kills there's an AGR so let's

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.270
