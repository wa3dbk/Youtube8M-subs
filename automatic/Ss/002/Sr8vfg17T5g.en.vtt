and screens used in water-based screen
printing<00:00:13.080> first<00:00:13.950> we're<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.280> discuss

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
printing first we're going to discuss

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
printing first we're going to discuss
the<00:00:14.759> chemicals<00:00:15.210> talk<00:00:15.540> about<00:00:15.780> screen<00:00:16.170> mesh<00:00:16.440> and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the chemicals talk about screen mesh and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.380 
the chemicals talk about screen mesh and
then<00:00:16.890> go<00:00:17.100> through<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> process<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:18.060> coating

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
then go through the process of coating

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
then go through the process of coating
the<00:00:18.480> screen<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:18.869> emulsion<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.529> then

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the screen with emulsion and then

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.970 
the screen with emulsion and then
exposing<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> screen<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.600> well<00:00:21.779> first<00:00:22.710> let's

water-based chemical starter kit right
now<00:00:36.570> we're<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> go<00:00:36.899> through<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
now we're going to go through the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
now we're going to go through the
chemical<00:00:37.649> starter<00:00:38.190> kit<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> kind<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.730> explain

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
chemical starter kit and kind of explain

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.780 
chemical starter kit and kind of explain
what<00:00:39.420> each<00:00:39.450> chemical<00:00:39.809> does<00:00:40.340> first<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.579> have

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
what each chemical does first we have

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.170 
what each chemical does first we have
our<00:00:42.120> SW<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.930> water<00:00:43.559> resistant<00:00:44.129> emulsion<00:00:44.460> now

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
our SW are water resistant emulsion now

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
our SW are water resistant emulsion now
because<00:00:45.539> water-based<00:00:46.140> inks<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.860> water

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
because water-based inks have water

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.850 
because water-based inks have water
properties<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:49.079> will<00:00:49.289> eat<00:00:49.590> down

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
properties in them they will eat down

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
properties in them they will eat down
and<00:00:50.160> tear<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> standard<00:00:51.300> plastisol

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and tear down a standard plastisol

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
and tear down a standard plastisol
emulsion<00:00:52.140> much<00:00:52.530> faster<00:00:53.190> than<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.399> plastisol

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
emulsion much faster than a plastisol

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
emulsion much faster than a plastisol
ink<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:55.079> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> use<00:00:55.590> specific

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
ink will you want to use specific

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.330 
ink will you want to use specific

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
water-based emulsion SGB r3 is a dual

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.709 
water-based emulsion SGB r3 is a dual
cure<00:00:59.609> emulsion<00:00:59.910> meaning<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.600> very

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
cure emulsion meaning that it's very

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.170 
cure emulsion meaning that it's very
user-friendly<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.859> strong<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.699> will<00:01:02.760> last<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
user-friendly it's strong it will last a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.230 
user-friendly it's strong it will last a
long<00:01:03.300> time<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> screen<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.489> it's<00:01:05.489> easy<00:01:06.000> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
long time on the screen and it's easy to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.810 
long time on the screen and it's easy to
use<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.140> we're<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> use<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.460> emulsion

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
use so we're going to use this emulsion

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
use so we're going to use this emulsion
typically<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.840> would<00:01:09.960> recommend<00:01:10.229> using<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
typically and we would recommend using a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.320 
typically and we would recommend using a
water<00:01:11.040> resistant<00:01:11.189> emulsion<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.210> you're

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
water resistant emulsion when you're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
water resistant emulsion when you're
printing<00:01:12.570> water-based<00:01:13.080> inks<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.159> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
printing water-based inks now if you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.010 
printing water-based inks now if you
have<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> very<00:01:14.520> short<00:01:14.850> run<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.840> use

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
have a very short run to do you can use

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
have a very short run to do you can use
a<00:01:16.049> plastisol<00:01:16.710> emulsion<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:18.210> not

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
a plastisol emulsion but you're not

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.480 
a plastisol emulsion but you're not
going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.960> than<00:01:19.170> maybe<00:01:19.320> 25<00:01:19.860> 30<00:01:20.159> at

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
going to get more than maybe 25 30 at

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
going to get more than maybe 25 30 at
max<00:01:20.909> 100<00:01:21.390> prints<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.830> last

over<00:01:23.900> 2,000<00:01:24.900> prints<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> put<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> heart

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
over 2,000 prints and if you put a heart

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
over 2,000 prints and if you put a heart
an<00:01:26.790> X<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:27.750> hardens<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
an X on it which actually hardens the

emulsion it can last up to 10,000 prints
so<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> definitely<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:31.860> going

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so this is definitely what you're going

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.620 
so this is definitely what you're going
to<00:01:32.040> want<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> use<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.820> water-based<00:01:33.240> screen

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
printing the next step in the screen

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
printing the next step in the screen
printing<00:01:37.680> process<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.340> always<00:01:38.700> degreasing

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
printing process is always degreasing

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.030 
printing process is always degreasing
you<00:01:39.869> always<00:01:40.110> want<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> clean<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.740> screens

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you always want to clean your screens

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.819 
you always want to clean your screens
with<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> greaser<00:01:41.939> before<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.680> the

talk<00:04:22.710> more<00:04:23.010> about<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.430> later<00:04:23.900> RC<00:04:24.900> inks<00:04:25.139> are

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
talk more about this later RC inks are

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.240 
talk more about this later RC inks are
fairly<00:04:25.409> user-friendly

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
fairly user-friendly

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.910 
fairly user-friendly
if<00:04:26.430> your<00:04:27.060> ink<00:04:27.300> feels<00:04:27.630> too<00:04:27.960> thin<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.710> need<00:04:28.890> a

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
if your ink feels too thin you need a

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.400 
if your ink feels too thin you need a
typically<00:04:29.640> up<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.270> mesh<00:04:30.510> on<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.200> your

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
typically up of the mesh on it so your

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.130 
typically up of the mesh on it so your
mesh<00:04:31.650> holds<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.130> ink<00:04:32.310> up<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:33.510> also<00:04:33.750> that

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
mesh holds the ink up but also that

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.420 
mesh holds the ink up but also that
depends<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.650> what<00:04:34.770> your<00:04:34.890> printing<00:04:35.220> if<00:04:35.310> you're

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
depends on what your printing if you're

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.890 
depends on what your printing if you're
printing<00:04:35.640> towels<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.240> want<00:04:36.450> your<00:04:36.600> ink<00:04:36.750> to

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
printing towels you want your ink to

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.050 
printing towels you want your ink to
saturate<00:04:37.470> through<00:04:37.890> through<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.460> towel<00:04:38.700> so

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
saturate through through the towel so

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.340 
saturate through through the towel so
we're<00:04:39.510> going<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.690> talk<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.840> little<00:04:39.990> bit<00:04:40.200> more

we're going to talk a little bit more
about<00:04:40.410> that<00:04:40.830> as<00:04:41.070> discussed<00:04:41.640> later<00:04:42.020> just

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
about that as discussed later just

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.150 
about that as discussed later just
talked<00:04:43.170> a<00:04:43.230> little<00:04:43.380> bit<00:04:43.530> about<00:04:43.770> what<00:04:43.980> type<00:04:44.130> of

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
talked a little bit about what type of

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.310 
talked a little bit about what type of
mesh<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.610> use<00:04:44.760> with<00:04:44.940> these<00:04:45.120> inks<00:04:45.540> now<00:04:45.960> keep<00:04:46.200> in

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
mesh to use with these inks now keep in

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.070 
mesh to use with these inks now keep in
mind<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.160> mesh<00:04:47.460> size<00:04:47.940> really<00:04:48.660> has<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.900> do

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
mind that the mesh size really has to do

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.660 
mind that the mesh size really has to do
with<00:04:49.230> your<00:04:49.320> artwork<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.010> whether<00:04:50.460> you're

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
with your artwork so whether you're

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.490 
with your artwork so whether you're
printing<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:51.090> fine<00:04:51.360> detail<00:04:51.720> image<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:52.170> really

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
printing a fine detail image you really

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.170 
printing a fine detail image you really
need<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:52.680> dictate<00:04:53.130> your<00:04:53.220> mesh<00:04:53.430> size<00:04:53.670> on<00:04:53.910> that

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
need to dictate your mesh size on that

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.570

structure for water-based printer you

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260 
structure for water-based printer you
can<00:05:07.290> use<00:05:07.530> either<00:05:07.680> wood<00:05:07.980> aluminum<00:05:08.310> or<00:05:08.700> roller

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
can use either wood aluminum or roller

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.210 
can use either wood aluminum or roller
frames<00:05:09.660> now<00:05:10.140> keep<00:05:10.380> in<00:05:10.500> mind<00:05:10.560> with<00:05:10.890> water-based

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
frames now keep in mind with water-based

printing<00:05:11.790> you're<00:05:11.970> going<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.210> be<00:05:12.330> using<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.750> lot

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
printing you're going to be using a lot

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.750 
printing you're going to be using a lot
of<00:05:12.960> water<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.590> have<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.830> wash<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.280> screen<00:05:14.580> out

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
of water you have to wash the screen out

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.940 
of water you have to wash the screen out
think<00:05:15.300> itself<00:05:15.720> has<00:05:15.930> water<00:05:16.200> in<00:05:16.290> it<00:05:16.590> so<00:05:16.830> if

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
think itself has water in it so if

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.409 
think itself has water in it so if
you're<00:05:17.040> using<00:05:17.220> wood<00:05:17.610> frames<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.210> frame

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
you're using wood frames the frame

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.300 
you're using wood frames the frame
itself<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.870> going<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.080> degrade<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:19.770> warp<00:05:20.160> a

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
itself is going to degrade and warp a

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.520 
itself is going to degrade and warp a
lot<00:05:20.490> faster<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.750> we<00:05:21.780> recommend<00:05:22.350> using

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
lot faster so we recommend using

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.720 
lot faster so we recommend using
aluminum<00:05:23.310> frames<00:05:23.610> for<00:05:23.910> water-based<00:05:24.150> printing
