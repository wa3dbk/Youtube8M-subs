00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.090
 and is that he presented my old visit in 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.810
 the old 6.0 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:24.650
 at that time of 2008 2009 in the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.650
 26-inch mountain range market 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.810
 and good as you can see this has had 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.730
 a lot of whiplash 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.730
 and then now I buy a new one 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:48.100
 I buy m-300 aluminum series which is about 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.100
 2,600 6061 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.210
 61 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.970
 well, take a fork x from that 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.700
 point that is lockable or is now 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.309
 itself is blocked so I would not have 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.309
 suspension and if we open it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.060
 if he wanted his suspension work by 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.060
 city 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.360
 It carries mechanical disc brake as 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.330
 you can see 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.090
 is the mechanic carries some good tires 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.409
 in white aluminum color also a 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.740
 good wheel of 2.10 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.479
 and when holding the bottle and a whole 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.650
 extra that I have put a bomb 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.940
 of fan of the pepero 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.580
 and put me 300 is also disc brakes 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.140
 it's also worth 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.159
 for himself as compared to 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.750
 another puts more arms of italy 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.000
 mate as not like that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 on the way back to see the issue of change 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.750
 what would 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.490
 the front change is magnet or gap 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.729
 gnosis is the same change as the one 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.560
 it's in that same behind the old 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.260
 take this bus every time is more modern 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.230
 logically it takes weeks and it is ahead and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.709
 back wearing a light week 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.060
 I do not know how it was I do not know leads to 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.060
 pedals and hand as you can see here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.640
 yes hand 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.850
 here also put on I do not know why 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.850
 do not 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.620
 here 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.780
 and good here after is also a 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.329
 odometer to count the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.720
 kilometers that I do and as you can see the 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.910
 way of changing gears 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.370
 they are quite rare the first time I go 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.650
 to use it so it's like that manu the handles 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.390
 and everything and very well that I do not know I do not know very 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.820
 well how are you going I think here it was going up that 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.020
 got off I'm not going to do it because I do not 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.650
 recommend 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.450
 and well that would be all worth 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.400
