century London to Edinburgh in

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.489 
century London to Edinburgh in
super-fast<00:00:12.820> time<00:00:13.059> that's<00:00:13.509> great<00:00:13.809> if<00:00:14.169> it<00:00:14.289> can

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:14.499 
super-fast time that's great if it can

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.010 
super-fast time that's great if it can
get<00:00:14.769> from<00:00:15.009> London<00:00:15.549> to<00:00:15.639> embera<00:00:16.030> as<00:00:16.510> fast<00:00:16.810> as

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
get from London to embera as fast as

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.929 
get from London to embera as fast as
that<00:00:17.050> I<00:00:17.199> mean<00:00:17.439> what<00:00:17.679> is<00:00:17.800> it's<00:00:17.949> just<00:00:18.189> a<00:00:18.369> fraction

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
that I mean what is it's just a fraction

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.700 
that I mean what is it's just a fraction
of<00:00:19.000> a<00:00:19.060> second

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.890 

no<00:00:26.710> no<00:00:27.669> that<00:00:27.849> what<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.330> after<00:00:28.419> train<00:00:28.689> wouldn't

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
no no that what the after train wouldn't

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.259 
no no that what the after train wouldn't
be<00:00:28.960> quite<00:00:29.169> as<00:00:29.349> fast<00:00:29.529> as<00:00:29.740> that<00:00:29.919> I<00:00:30.099> think<00:00:30.339> to

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
be quite as fast as that I think to

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.770 
be quite as fast as that I think to
embro<00:00:31.570> is<00:00:31.869> about<00:00:32.410> three<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:32.680> half<00:00:32.740> hours

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
embro is about three and half hours

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.920 
embro is about three and half hours
right<00:00:34.780> yes<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.200> course<00:00:36.270> sorry<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:37.390> should<00:00:37.750> say

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
right yes of course sorry I should say

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.380 
right yes of course sorry I should say
that<00:00:38.290> train<00:00:38.620> there<00:00:39.010> though<00:00:39.250> there's<00:00:39.970> no<00:00:40.180> way

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
that train there though there's no way

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.060 
that train there though there's no way
we<00:00:40.570> could<00:00:40.750> give<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:40.900> franchises<00:00:41.620> your<00:00:41.830> trains

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
we could give it franchises your trains

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:52.140 
we could give it franchises your trains
were<00:00:42.220> going<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.460> be<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:42.700> small<00:00:43.030> oh<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.940> a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
were going to be that small oh that's a

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.390 
were going to be that small oh that's a
this<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.570> model<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:53.050> Tod<00:00:53.410> if<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.160> Train<00:00:54.370> is

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
this is a model of Tod if the Train is

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.120 
this is a model of Tod if the Train is
the<00:00:54.610> actual<00:00:55.090> train<00:00:55.240> would<00:00:55.390> be<00:00:55.540> um<00:00:55.870> but<00:00:56.830> would

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
the actual train would be um but would

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.260 
the actual train would be um but would
well<00:00:57.370> be<00:00:57.490> the<00:00:57.580> size<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.880> normal<00:00:58.150> train<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
well be the size of a normal train of

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.720 
well be the size of a normal train of
course<00:01:01.510> yes<00:01:01.990> of<00:01:02.230> course<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:03.250> actual<00:01:03.370> train

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
course yes of course the actual train

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.300 
course yes of course the actual train
will<00:01:03.910> be<00:01:03.940> bigger<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.509> if<00:01:05.350> it's<00:01:05.500> bigger<00:01:05.740> then

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
will be bigger and if it's bigger then

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.250 
will be bigger and if it's bigger then
it<00:01:06.430> can<00:01:06.610> get<00:01:06.760> from<00:01:06.940> here<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.390> here<00:01:07.810> much

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
it can get from here to here much

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.990 
it can get from here to here much
quicker<00:01:08.620> because<00:01:08.980> that<00:01:09.340> really<00:01:09.610> isn't<00:01:09.730> such<00:01:09.970> a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
quicker because that really isn't such a

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.500 
quicker because that really isn't such a
big<00:01:10.210> distance<00:01:10.540> is<00:01:10.750> it<00:01:12.870> no<00:01:14.940> sorry<00:01:15.940> I<00:01:16.090> see<00:01:16.300> my

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
big distance is it no sorry I see my

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.620 
big distance is it no sorry I see my
soui<00:01:16.720> no<00:01:17.080> this<00:01:17.320> this<00:01:18.100> isn't<00:01:18.280> Britain<00:01:18.700> under

map of Britain and Britain the lot is

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.730 
map of Britain and Britain the lot is
bigger<00:01:22.720> than<00:01:22.930> this<00:01:23.460> yes<00:01:24.460> obviously<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:26.530> are

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
bigger than this yes obviously these are

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.890 
bigger than this yes obviously these are
all<00:01:26.770> obviously<00:01:27.280> smaller<00:01:28.090> versions<00:01:28.630> of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
all obviously smaller versions of

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.610 
all obviously smaller versions of
everything<00:01:29.860> but<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.930> doesn't<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:32.380> stand

question Rob you well if the trains are

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.460 
question Rob you well if the trains are
going<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.670> be<00:01:39.760> bigger<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.720> country<00:01:41.260> is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
going to be bigger and the country is

00:01:41.470 --> 00:02:01.500 
going to be bigger and the country is
bigger<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.850> won't<00:01:43.150> we<00:01:43.360> need<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:45.659> giant
