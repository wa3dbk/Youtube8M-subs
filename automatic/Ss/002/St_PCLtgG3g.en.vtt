00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.120
 Welcome friends once again to your 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.999
 electro club channel let's continue with 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.450
 Part 2 that talks about the 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.450
 engines 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.370
 direct current 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.370
 part 2 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.150
 this time we are going to talk about 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.779
 how to connect the current motors 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.920
 direct right now they are going to 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.489
 find with current motors 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.489
 direct that have four wires 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.630
 or you can also find one that 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.630
 has only two cables 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.440
 that's what they're going to fix that has 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.260
 four cables or having two cables 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.230
 the one with four wires means that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.690
 his field as we had already explained in 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.430
 the previous video the engines of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.280
 Direct current possess two fields 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:09.670
 magnetic one of them call it field 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.220
 campus its translation in english is field 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.190
 and that can do it 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.220
 if it's four cables, it's a 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.300
 winding 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.660
 so here what you put in f1 like that 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.510
 they will identify it on the cable and 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.390
 the other as efe 2 the efe is for this 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.700
 by field then those are the two 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.500
 cables f1 f2 and the other two are those of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.510
 the armor 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.410
 and that's how they're going to identify those 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.410
 changes as one as one to two 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.520
 that would be the four cables 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.320
 now 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.230
 The four-wire motor 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.580
 four wires running behind him 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:07.580
 they call direct current motor 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.580
 defeated defeated reeling 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.920
 precisely because its rotor is winding 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.400
 and in particular this this motor of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.860
 four wires was the first one that was born and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.070
 that emerged in the industry is still being followed 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.780
 using and if you can find it well 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.360
 but you can also find your engine 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.120
 direct current of only two cables 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.020
 if you only have two cables means 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.180
 that the field no longer does a winding 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.180
 now it makes a magnet 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.420
 untermann 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.530
 and the other field if it exists and continues 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.390
 existing that is the armor 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.900
 the armor as we said 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.420
 it's coming from the rotor that is in demand 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.720
 Now this direct current motor 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.079
 only two cables for the particular fact 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.830
 that he has a magnet, they call him the motor of 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:13.470
 magnet can stream 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.470
 permanent neiman 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.180
 permanent and this is the engine of 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.340
 most current direct current and what else 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.760
 you can get to find the solo 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.349
 two cables 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.689
 well once clarified this point we are going to 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.840
 see how to connect them as we had 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.640
 mentioned and we need necessarily 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.849
 electronics then in the engines 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.010
 industrially we need a 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.459
 speed variator 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.939
 I say forcefully because it can be 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.709
 rectifier bridges and if they are motors 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.930
 Direct current small no 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.700
 we need we can not start with 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.129
 simply with a battery a stack 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.620
 but industrial engines we need 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.640
 usually an inverter was used 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.680
 speed 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.819
 in the variable speed drive will come 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.519
 identified 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.269
 they have to be identified 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.420
 connections for field terminals 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:18.100
 be f1 and f2 and also the terminals 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.979
 for armor 1 and armor 2 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.080
 so it 's very simple if they have the 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.349
 four-phase direct current motor 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.389
 cables because only enough 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:36.080
 identify the cables of field efe 2 and 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:39.280
 f1 and connect them to those terminals and 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.280
 also those of armor 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.700
 those of armed in the same way 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.289
 identify the armor cables 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.880
 armor 1 and armor 2 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.320
 and with that is all 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.520
 this is for the current motor 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.000
 direct four wires 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.860
 but if they own or are found you are 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.080
 the current motor of such only two 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.759
 cables means that we created are going to 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.759
 have armor terminals 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.510
 and also 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.780
 2 for a 2- wire motor and only 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.230
 simply connect the terminals of the 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.230
 inverter 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.060
 is all they need of course 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.409
 how this two-wire cable does not have the 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.499
 field winding no longer connects 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:36.269
 well this video was simply the 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:39.239
 explanation no no no no deepen on 

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:41.819
 the speed drives because I'll do 

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:45.790
 an exclusive video for drives 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:48.010
 direct current speed and I want 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.630
 this explain some very characteristics 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.129
 interesting that they have in particular 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.889
 these mediators good friends 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:59.449
 for the moment it's all I say goodbye and we 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.449
 we see in the following video
