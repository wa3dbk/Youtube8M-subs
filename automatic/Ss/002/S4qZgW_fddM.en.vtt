00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.539 
makes sense that he they have plans for
the<00:01:46.380> character<00:01:46.770> further<00:01:47.040> down<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> road<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the character further down the road this

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.910 
the character further down the road this
makes<00:01:47.790> sense<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.689> good<00:01:48.930> idea<00:01:49.110> but

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
makes sense and it's a good idea but

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.590 
makes sense and it's a good idea but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
us who have some common sense we've kind

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.139 
us who have some common sense we've kind
of<00:01:55.380> figured<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.040> any<00:01:56.280> way<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.790> we

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
of figured and they have any way that we

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.789 
of figured and they have any way that we
never<00:01:57.360> saw<00:01:57.570> him<00:01:57.689> die<00:01:57.869> whose<00:01:58.079> only<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.500> scene

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
never saw him die whose only one scene

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
never saw him die whose only one scene
blah<00:01:59.040> blah<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.640> would<00:01:59.820> have<00:01:59.909> been<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.060> really

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
blah blah this would have been a really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.969 
blah blah this would have been a really
nice<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:01.020> tag<00:02:01.170> where<00:02:01.409> maybe<00:02:01.590> even<00:02:01.799> just

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
nice little tag where maybe even just

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.090 
nice little tag where maybe even just
before<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.490> credits<00:02:02.790> roll<00:02:03.000> instead<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.899> that

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
before the credits roll instead of that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.380

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
but this would have been a really really
