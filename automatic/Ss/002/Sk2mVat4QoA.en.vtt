anything<00:02:30.489> about<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.209> just<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:32.349> plow<00:02:32.590> you

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
anything about it this just the plow you

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.680 
anything about it this just the plow you
know<00:02:33.160> hopefully<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:34.150> know<00:02:34.209> there's<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.480> page

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
know hopefully you know there's a page

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.850 
know hopefully you know there's a page
that<00:02:34.720> he<00:02:34.900> learned<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.560> we<00:02:36.069> certainly<00:02:37.680> he<00:02:38.680> did

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
that he learned and we certainly he did

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.220 
that he learned and we certainly he did
some<00:02:39.040> things<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.430> cost<00:02:40.209> us<00:02:40.540> throughout<00:02:41.050> the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
some things that cost us throughout the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.550 
some things that cost us throughout the
game<00:02:42.180> yeah<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.300> got<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:44.140> got<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.530> better

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
game yeah we got it we got to do better

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.970 
game yeah we got it we got to do better
yeah<00:02:45.459> better<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:47.290> course<00:02:47.560> they<00:02:47.709> did<00:02:47.860> some

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
yeah better of course they did some

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.820 
yeah better of course they did some
things<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.750> could<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.840> cost<00:02:49.989> them<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.470> just

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
things that could have cost them to just

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.130 
things that could have cost them to just
one<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.069> those<00:02:51.130> kind<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.430> games<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.780> then<00:02:53.049> we

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
one of those kind of games and then we

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.460 
one of those kind of games and then we
illusion<00:02:53.620> attended<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.930> things<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.260> should

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
