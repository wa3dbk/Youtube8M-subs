show anything but you can still use the
flashlight<00:03:41.390> within<00:03:42.390> here<00:03:42.690> which<00:03:43.050> also<00:03:43.440> seems

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
flashlight within here which also seems

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.130 
flashlight within here which also seems
to<00:03:44.010> be<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> bit<00:03:44.280> glitchy<00:03:44.490> but<00:03:44.910> yeah<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.990> does

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
to be a bit glitchy but yeah it does

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.890 
to be a bit glitchy but yeah it does
have<00:03:46.320> some<00:03:46.590> features<00:03:47.370> down<00:03:47.520> with<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.730> camera

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
but what you're going to most likely

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.290

an<00:05:14.400> iPhone<00:05:14.760> but<00:05:14.970> it's<00:05:15.120> amorphous<00:05:15.480> as<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:15.810> can

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
an iPhone but it's amorphous as you can

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.580 
an iPhone but it's amorphous as you can
see<00:05:16.020> I'm<00:05:16.110> on<00:05:16.140> iOS<00:05:16.590> 8.4<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.990> iCloud<00:05:18.990> activation

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
is locked so yeah that is basically how

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.340

you<00:05:23.340> can<00:05:23.610> bring<00:05:24.330> back<00:05:24.480> some<00:05:24.750> functionality<00:05:25.320> to

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
you can bring back some functionality to

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.230 
you can bring back some functionality to
your<00:05:25.590> device<00:05:25.830> actually<00:05:26.100> it's<00:05:26.820> quite<00:05:27.060> like

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
your device actually it's quite like

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.500 
your device actually it's quite like
I've<00:05:27.360> stopped<00:05:27.630> in<00:05:27.780> here<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:28.760> yeah<00:05:29.760> now<00:05:30.420> I'm

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
going to talk about the other method

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.280 
going to talk about the other method
which<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.160> can't<00:05:32.370> actually<00:05:32.520> show<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.290> because

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
which I can't actually show you because

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.740 
which I can't actually show you because
it<00:05:34.410> doesn't<00:05:34.530> work<00:05:34.800> on<00:05:34.920> iOS<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.280> point<00:05:35.520> for<00:05:35.760> but

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
it doesn't work on iOS a point for but

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.540 
it doesn't work on iOS a point for but
if<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.410> guys<00:05:37.530> are<00:05:37.680> on<00:05:37.710> an<00:05:37.860> earlier<00:05:38.310> version

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
if you guys are on an earlier version

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.730 
if you guys are on an earlier version
then<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.360> can<00:05:39.540> probably<00:05:39.840> do<00:05:40.140> this<00:05:40.290> and<00:05:40.560> this

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
then you can probably do this and this

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.440 
then you can probably do this and this
is<00:05:40.860> going<00:05:40.980> to<00:05:41.070> be<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.190> permanent<00:05:41.520> removal<00:05:42.060> of

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450

we're on when we're setting up and the

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.650 
we're on when we're setting up and the
activation<00:06:18.040> lock<00:06:18.220> that's<00:06:19.000> actually<00:06:19.389> all

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
activation lock that's actually all

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.330 
activation lock that's actually all
within<00:06:19.990> an<00:06:20.139> application<00:06:20.290> although<00:06:21.160> it<00:06:21.250> may

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
within an application although it may

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.580 
within an application although it may
seem<00:06:21.400> like<00:06:21.639> it's<00:06:21.940> just<00:06:21.970> a<00:06:22.150> cell<00:06:22.440> system<00:06:23.440> is

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
seem like it's just a cell system is

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.560 
seem like it's just a cell system is
actually<00:06:24.460> an<00:06:24.520> application<00:06:24.639> that<00:06:25.240> allows<00:06:25.419> you

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
actually an application that allows you

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.750 
actually an application that allows you
to<00:06:25.690> set<00:06:25.900> up<00:06:25.930> your<00:06:26.020> device<00:06:26.320> so<00:06:27.010> the<00:06:27.100> idea<00:06:27.490> is

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
to set up your device so the idea is

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.490 
to set up your device so the idea is
that<00:06:28.060> we<00:06:28.240> have<00:06:28.330> to<00:06:28.450> crash<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:28.930> app<00:06:29.080> just<00:06:29.350> like

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
that we have to crash the app just like

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.620 
that we have to crash the app just like
any<00:06:29.650> other<00:06:29.800> app<00:06:30.010> can<00:06:30.190> crush<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:31.120> idea<00:06:31.419> is<00:06:31.510> to

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
any other app can crush the idea is to

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.510 
any other app can crush the idea is to
crush<00:06:31.900> the<00:06:32.110> setup<00:06:32.380> app<00:06:32.530> and<00:06:32.860> that<00:06:33.280> will<00:06:33.370> put

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
crush the setup app and that will put

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.150 
crush the setup app and that will put
you<00:06:33.610> on<00:06:33.729> the<00:06:33.820> home<00:06:33.970> screen<00:06:34.180> so<00:06:35.169> depending<00:06:36.100> on

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
you on the home screen so depending on

you'll be able to reboot and it won't
affect<00:07:16.810> it<00:07:17.200> so<00:07:17.470> that<00:07:18.460> is<00:07:18.610> the<00:07:18.729> only<00:07:18.940> other

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
affect it so that is the only other

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.279 
affect it so that is the only other
method<00:07:19.479> I<00:07:19.539> would<00:07:19.690> know<00:07:19.870> of<00:07:20.110> how<00:07:20.229> to
