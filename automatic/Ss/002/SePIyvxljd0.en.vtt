Landry the the game so you got to please
flash<00:00:16.890> green<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.490> loading<00:00:18.240> screen<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.869> then

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
flash green a loading screen and then

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.849 
flash green a loading screen and then
the<00:00:19.859> WebGL<00:00:20.279> engine<00:00:20.939> starts<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.810> load<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the WebGL engine starts to load so it

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.429 
the WebGL engine starts to load so it
really<00:00:23.130> works<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:24.150> attach<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.170> first

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
really works with attach the first

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.570 
really works with attach the first
things<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.800> need<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.189> create<00:00:26.490> a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
things you need to do to create a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
things you need to do to create a
Windows<00:00:27.000> Store<00:00:27.210> apps<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
Windows Store apps is to think about the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.710 
Windows Store apps is to think about the
multiple<00:00:28.949> views<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> support

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
multiple views so you have to support

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.130 
multiple views so you have to support
what<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.410> naming<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.520> step<00:00:32.759> mode<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
what we are naming the step mode so you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.250 
what we are naming the step mode so you
can<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.530> both<00:00:34.559> apps<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.969> same<00:00:36.210> times<00:00:36.510> so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
can have both apps and the same times so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
can have both apps and the same times so
if<00:00:37.559> I'm<00:00:37.770> reciting<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.520> windows<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.840> see

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
if I'm reciting the windows you can see

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
if I'm reciting the windows you can see
that<00:00:40.200> automatically<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.980> engine<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.489> taking

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
that automatically the engine is taking

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.569 
that automatically the engine is taking
care<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.160> tab<00:00:44.399> view

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
care of that I can have this tab view

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.450 
care of that I can have this tab view
over<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.480> still<00:00:45.809> working<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:47.309> other

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
over there it's still working the other

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.910 
over there it's still working the other
things<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.850> need<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.170> take<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> account

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
things you need to take it to account

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520 
things you need to take it to account
user<00:00:50.280> settings<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.510> doing<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:52.020> the

settings<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> other<00:00:54.449> game<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
settings of the other game you have a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.310 
settings of the other game you have a
different<00:00:56.399> way<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> control<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> camera<00:00:57.840> so

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
different way to control the camera so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.889 
different way to control the camera so
one<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.530> them<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.699> D<00:00:59.879> vector<00:01:00.180> rotation<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
one of them is the D vector rotation so

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.950 
one of them is the D vector rotation so
I<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.140> move<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.829> tablet<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.719> move

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
I can move the tablet that way to move

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
I can move the tablet that way to move
the<00:01:04.110> camera<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> first<00:01:05.640> way<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the camera so this is the first way to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.960 
the camera so this is the first way to
do<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.540> other<00:01:07.229> words<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.770> under<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
do it in other words you under that is a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.020 
do it in other words you under that is a
touch<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.659> course<00:01:10.409> ok<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.369> move<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.820> camera

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
touch of course ok I can move the camera

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.020 
touch of course ok I can move the camera
that<00:01:12.510> way<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.619> using<00:01:13.740> two<00:01:14.100> fingers<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.729> can
