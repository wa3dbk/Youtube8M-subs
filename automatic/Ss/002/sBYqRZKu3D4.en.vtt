 today is about reading is not it really 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.800
 Because it's a mistake today, let's talk about 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.259

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.300
 professional 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.070
 the spoken language 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:38.070
 she has certain characteristics she is 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 very spontaneous she is she builds 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.259
 according to the reaction of the interlocutor 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.940
 You have to realize the reaction to go. 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.240
 building your text 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.160
 she has marks of orality slang by 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.759
 example depends on where you are 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.460
 regionalisms talking with the Dada speaks

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:15.230
 I will write my goal with the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.230
 kind of language is more appropriate 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.760
 it is not a question of being a poet the author of 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.470
 books what we are talking about 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.140
 routine at work 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.480
 nowadays all companies use the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.120
 written communication as a tool for 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.760
 communication, what varies is the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.490
 intensity as writing is used more 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.700
 irrespective of the field of activity, write 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.110
 clearly and objectively is essential. 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.110
 for efficient communication 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.620
 known writing context formatting 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.570
 studio the format of your text analysis 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.570
 other texts with the same formatting 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.410
 letters memos fax reports 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.989
 business correspondence records 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.480
 diaries and emails with the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.610
 Digital communication also grew 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.190
 professional need to write 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.690
 never written communication was so 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.690
 important in the world of work 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.420
 planning plans of your text do 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.590
 a scheme with the main content to 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.840
 be presented 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.280
 remember not everything needs to be entered 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.110
 depends on the context the characteristics 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.320
 of written needle language 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.380
 unlike spoken language she 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.780
 It requires planning, you have time to 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.130
 make your writing text 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.620
 so you have to know first which 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.209
 are the objectives of your text which is 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.590
 your target audience 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.989
 How will you want to pass this? 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.140
 message according to the type of text 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.690
 written if it is narrative argumentative 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.870
 If it's a report then you have to 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.820
 have all the techniques of these texts and 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.190
 so you can put it to you 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.829
 Clear in written language 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.930
 you should use the grammar rules 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.220
 correct and punctuation that is extremely 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.039
 important 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.810
 I use the language figures sometimes 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:23.740
 it's not you exaggerate in some things 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.830
 you soften others you use metaphors 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.310
 But you have to be is very direct in the 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.310
 written text 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:41.770
 the language type choose and know the 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.830
 type of language appropriate to the context 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.389
 for this also the reading of different 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.759
 texts can be of great help 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:55.060
 because it is was the time in which to study 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.370
 only a school task but 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.620
 to enroll well the language itself is 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.599
 fundamental for good communication and 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.639
 for professional success 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.759
 Why do so many people have 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.469
 difficulty with writing 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.719
 if you write a good text 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:14.770
 you must observe three 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.879
 basic characteristics of the 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.180
 message 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.580
 the objectivity of the presentation and 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.860
 correct use of rules 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.460
 grammar and spelling that one of the 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.279
 mistakes students make is to try 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.590
 put in the written here the spoken language 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.509
 This can not happen, I have to 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.629

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.009

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.659
