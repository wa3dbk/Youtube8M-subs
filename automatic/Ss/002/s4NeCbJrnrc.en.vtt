00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
game and obviously that you can't just

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
game and obviously that you can't just
take<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> shows<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.540> every

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
up or possibly use in the game so the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
up or possibly use in the game so the
way<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.159> works<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> let's<00:01:11.700> say<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.090> didn't
