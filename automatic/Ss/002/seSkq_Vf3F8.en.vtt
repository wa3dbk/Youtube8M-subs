00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.400
Rolling Girl (ローリンガール)
(Wowaka)

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.320
(Translation from Project DIVA F 2nd)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.440
For lonely girls, it's always the same
(ronrii gaaru wa itsumademo)

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.580
Dreaming dreams that don't come true
(todokanai yume mite)

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.860
And churning, churning
(sawagu atama no naka o)

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.820
Through the clamor in their heads
(kakimawashite kakimawashite)

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.940
A lonely girl mutters "I'm fine"
("mondai nai" to tsubuyaite)

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.180
Have words failed her?
(kotoba wa ushina wareta?)

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.480
A failure, a failure
(mou shippai mou shippai)

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.440
Obsessing over her mistakes
(machigai sagashi ni owareba)

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.960
Makes everything spin again!
(mata mawaru no!)

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.340
One more time, one more time
(mou ikkai mou ikkai)

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.939
“I'll roll along today”
("watashi wa kyou mo korogarimasu" to)

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.239
The girl said, the girl said
(shoujo wa iu, shoujo wa iu)

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:30.839
Breathing life into the words!
(kotoba ni imi o kanadenagara!)

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.939
“How about now?”
("mou ii kai?")

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.480
“Not yet -
("mada desu yo -)

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.560
We still can't see what's ahead
(mada mada saki wa mienai no de)

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.860
Hold your breath, for now.”
(iki o tomeru no, ima")

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.209
This is how it ends for a Rolling Girl
(Rolling Girl no nare no hate)

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:00.479
Unable to reach the colors on the other side
(todokanai, mukou no iro)

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.780
The overlapping voices
(kasanaru koe to koe o)

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.340
They blend together, blend together
(maze awasete, maze awasete)

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.120
She mutters, "I'm fine."
("mondai nai" to tsubuyaita)

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.400
But the words fail her
(kotoba wa ushinawareta)

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.800
Not caring how it ends
(dou natta tte iin datte sa)

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.560
An upward climb that invites mistakes
(machigai datte okoshichao uto sasou, sakamichi)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.340
One more time, one more time
(mou ikkai, mou ikkai)

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.939
Please, get me rolling
(watashi o douka korogashite to)

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.240
The girl said, the girl said
(shoujo wa iu, shoujo wa iu)

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.840
With her intense silence!
(mukuchi ni imi o kasane nagara!)

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.909
“How about now?”
("mou ii kai?")

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.320
“Just a little more -
("mou sukoshi)

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.220
We should see something soon
(mou sugu nanika mieru darou to)

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.600
Hold your breath, for now.”
(iki o tomeru no, ima")

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.020
One more time, one more time
(mou ikkai, mou ikkai)

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.639
“I'll roll along again today”
("watashi wa kyou mo korogarimasu" to)

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.909
The girl said, the girl said
(shoujo wa iu, shoujo wa iu)

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.539
Breathing laughter into the words!
(kotoba ni emi o kanade nagara!)

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.840
“How about now? OK, you can look
("mou ii kai? Mou ii yo)

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.479
You must be exhausted too, right?”
(sorosoro kimi mo tsukaretarou, ne")

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:09.539
Stop breathing, now
(iki o yameru no, ima)
