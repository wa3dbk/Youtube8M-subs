00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 10 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 Fri 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 Swiss side 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.110
 the roughriders public thing 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.750
 and m and it's very hot saturday that tehran had until the year the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.660
 chance to have arteries that exceeds expectations 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.120
 it's a continuity of our sector 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.580
 so that's for sure this mandate to the election of house social theories 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.640
 when hands 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.770
 as for the primaries 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.780
 harder because it was expected this allows to follow his course falls when 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.860
 we can stretch out the program of the chairs 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 biggest rise 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.260
 secondly it's all 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.730
 of his brother 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.660
 the German sprinter arabic the repressive measures type of landscape that I 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.710
 do something 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.860
 12th 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.740
 I know that all private pilots 11% 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.770
 you actually have a place available elsewhere 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.000
 children 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.050
 so they listened to say it's a September 10 income 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.690
 I spent a lot of time with her 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.530
 difficult one of his spokespersons that in the name of this world are gathered 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.929
 m 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.319
 for that you have to think about it 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.769
 which therefore allows 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.720
 things but he never 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.500
 you never know how to force my family I do not know who strikes the right pole 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500
 which really left us the same problems 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.479
 he was the brother 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.379
 quirky stick me I do other things 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.389
 so we really 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.400
 to become priest his income and naturally he has bothered us force 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:54.699
 it did not really come from 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.619
 true lies of shock of the mythical heroes 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.339
 of gammarth% of the number 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:03.130
 it's when I saw that it's there I said to myself it's my vocation 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.630
 I think it's over 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.920
 for me can not fly and and the waves of several tens of tons 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.739
 it was for me it was normal to see him in uniform to see him 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.129
 in front of my brother pilot it's normal so it's not really a shock 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.980
 where I really happened 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.069
 at the same time the French market 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.339
 and that's nevertheless all the drivers it was yesterday his first times we are 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.429
 all alone on the plane 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:25.379
 is the famous so-called market 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.019
 where there we confide the first flight really alone my instructor 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.099
 descent of plane he will now make your first game on the ATP tour de 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.929
 track 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:35.279
 p is beautiful love the author 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.339
 after 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.439
 she 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.329
 m 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.389
 the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.120
 negotiations continue 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.229
 drawings he said to have when we start drawing the co2 in three years 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.090
 two years 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.950
 three years 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.040
 and could actually especially the first convoy drawings that date back to 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.400
 this time that has the sun and a plane to wed enough fun 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.020
 after the acquisition we know the pile of things 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.520
 general good-for-nothing hard drives that those who arrive in life they 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.939
 have donations in fact not that at all which is mostly much worked 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.520
 the fire had been to do I saw his first comic out 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.790
 I saw the time that passes that radeon that in the focus a voice 3 that 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.260
 actually but I have never been worried because and he has a lot 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.460
 worked and then more work more and drawings film themselves 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.550
 it was declared the house that dates back to the time he was 14 years old brown and a 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.639
 control of two schools more than I work 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.689
 and so that that if affinities 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.899
 but she knows the result especially many are constantly working under the 

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:06.110
 shot of people think of echining looking for a job you have to train 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.939
 I have this chance the dollar went up on the albums that I want to do a year 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:11.939
