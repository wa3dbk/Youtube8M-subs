writing<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.150> there<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.570> see<00:02:42.780> what<00:02:42.930> happens

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
writing it to there and see what happens

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.880 
writing it to there and see what happens
and<00:02:45.660> we're<00:02:45.930> gonna<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.320> if<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.650> works

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
and we're gonna see if that works

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.970 
and we're gonna see if that works

right<00:03:13.970> now<00:03:14.320> it's<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.500> little<00:03:15.830> bit<00:03:15.950> more<00:03:16.360> visible

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
right now it's a little bit more visible

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.560 
right now it's a little bit more visible
for<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:18.580> now<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:20.080> already<00:03:21.080> selected<00:03:22.570> my

I<00:03:45.680> mean<00:03:45.890> this<00:03:46.190> really<00:03:46.850> piss-poor<00:03:47.450> IDE<00:03:48.050> drive<00:03:48.440> I

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
I mean this really piss-poor IDE drive I

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.350 
I mean this really piss-poor IDE drive I
have<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:48.920> mean<00:03:49.250> I'm<00:03:49.370> probably<00:03:49.550> slowing<00:03:50.209> this
