00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
thumb rest air mattresses we have these

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.529 
thumb rest air mattresses we have these
little<00:00:39.260> micro<00:00:39.950> chambers<00:00:40.670> in<00:00:40.969> there<00:00:41.120> and

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
little micro chambers in there and

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.930 
little micro chambers in there and
that's<00:00:41.780> what<00:00:42.050> actually<00:00:42.410> gives<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:43.250> pad

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
that's what actually gives the pad

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.180 
that's what actually gives the pad
integrity<00:00:44.750> or<00:00:44.870> support<00:00:45.289> underneath<00:00:45.680> you<00:00:45.980> it's

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
integrity or support underneath you it's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.580 
integrity or support underneath you it's
not<00:00:46.340> like<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:47.359> everyone<00:00:47.840> slept<00:00:48.140> on<00:00:48.410> in

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
not like that that everyone slept on in

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.229 
not like that that everyone slept on in
a<00:00:48.620> relative's<00:00:49.370> house<00:00:49.609> where<00:00:49.940> you're<00:00:50.059> like

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
a relative's house where you're like

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.119 
a relative's house where you're like
you're<00:00:50.930> like<00:00:50.960> you're<00:00:51.109> fun<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.469> blow<00:00:51.770> up<00:00:51.920> that

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
you're like you're fun to blow up that

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.860 
you're like you're fun to blow up that
where<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.030> feel<00:00:53.180> like<00:00:53.300> you're<00:00:53.390> falling<00:00:53.600> off

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
where you feel like you're falling off

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.189 
where you feel like you're falling off
all<00:00:54.109> night<00:00:54.260> long<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.070> these<00:00:55.160> are<00:00:55.219> very<00:00:55.550> stable

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
all night long so these are very stable

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.950 
all night long so these are very stable
the<00:00:57.199> other<00:00:57.350> thing<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:57.649> we<00:00:57.980> do<00:00:58.219> is<00:00:58.250> in<00:00:58.910> most<00:00:59.809> of

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
the other thing that we do is in most of

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.750 
the other thing that we do is in most of
these<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.260> you'll<00:01:00.739> see<00:01:00.890> there's<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.160> reflective

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
these is you'll see there's a reflective

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.700 
these is you'll see there's a reflective
barrier<00:01:02.210> in<00:01:02.390> here<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.809> what<00:01:03.019> that<00:01:03.050> does<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.500> it

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
barrier in here and what that does is it

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.930 
barrier in here and what that does is it
actually<00:01:03.800> reflects<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.550> total<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.879> the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
actually reflects the total of the

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.090 
actually reflects the total of the
ground<00:01:05.269> away<00:01:05.449> from<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.870> reflects<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.860> warp

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
ground away from you reflects the warp

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.429 
ground away from you reflects the warp
through<00:01:07.340> your<00:01:07.580> body<00:01:07.759> back<00:01:08.090> up<00:01:08.330> towards<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.869> so

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
through your body back up towards you so

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.530 
through your body back up towards you so
that's<00:01:09.619> what<00:01:09.860> gives<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.189> added<00:01:10.400> more<00:01:10.759> for<00:01:11.479> all

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
that's what gives you added more for all

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.149 
that's what gives you added more for all
the<00:01:11.689> women<00:01:11.990> out<00:01:12.080> there<00:01:12.140> we<00:01:12.530> do<00:01:12.710> these<00:01:12.950> and

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
the women out there we do these and

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.070 
the women out there we do these and
women<00:01:13.430> versions<00:01:13.939> a<00:01:14.119> little<00:01:14.570> bit<00:01:14.659> shorter<00:01:15.049> but

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
women versions a little bit shorter but

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.880 
women versions a little bit shorter but
for<00:01:15.770> instance<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.310> win<00:01:17.890> ex-wife<00:01:18.890> has<00:01:19.670> two<00:01:20.270> of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
for instance to win ex-wife has two of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.899 
for instance to win ex-wife has two of
the<00:01:21.890> reflective<00:01:22.400> barriers<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.360> it's<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.630> woman

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
the reflective barriers so it's a woman

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.100 
the reflective barriers so it's a woman
what<00:01:25.909> any<00:01:26.180> guy<00:01:26.420> can<00:01:26.990> use<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.710> women's<00:01:27.860> bath<00:01:29.110> so

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
what any guy can use the women's bath so

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.520 
what any guy can use the women's bath so
there's<00:01:30.740> no<00:01:30.799> reason<00:01:31.159> you<00:01:31.310> can't<00:01:32.320> but<00:01:33.320> it's

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
there's no reason you can't but it's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.050 
there's no reason you can't but it's
allowing<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.040> go<00:01:34.220> lighter<00:01:34.460> weight<00:01:34.759> it

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
allowing you to go lighter weight it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.530 
allowing you to go lighter weight it
just<00:01:35.360> as<00:01:35.479> much<00:01:35.509> comfort<00:01:35.960> again<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.640> know<00:01:37.759> this

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
just as much comfort again you know this

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.270 
just as much comfort again you know this
isn't<00:01:38.930> going<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.110> be<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.860> know<00:01:40.070> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
isn't going to be but you know the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.800 
isn't going to be but you know the
entry-level<00:01:40.640> customers<00:01:41.210> think<00:01:41.450> about<00:01:41.689> going

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
entry-level customers think about going

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.109 
entry-level customers think about going
on<00:01:41.960> their<00:01:42.079> first<00:01:42.229> backpacking<00:01:42.920> trip<00:01:43.130> this<00:01:43.970> is

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
the first words that have an

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.850 
the first words that have an
understanding<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:47.119> gear

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
understanding of gear

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.430 
understanding of gear
I<00:01:47.950> will<00:01:48.370> take<00:01:48.520> care<00:01:48.790> of<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:49.330> heard<00:01:50.230> one

I will take care of it I heard one

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.140 
I will take care of it I heard one
concern<00:01:50.890> out<00:01:51.100> there<00:01:51.130> when<00:01:51.490> we<00:01:51.610> brought<00:01:51.910> these

concern out there when we brought these

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.870 
concern out there when we brought these
out<00:01:52.330> wisdom<00:01:53.020> with<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.530> noise<00:01:53.680> factor<00:01:54.040> some

what<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.459> got<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:19.240> is<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> different<00:02:20.500> face

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
what you got here is a different face

what you got here is a different face
fabric<00:02:21.040> ok<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.420> not<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.959> same

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
fabric ok so this is not that same

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
other thing that our little long diagram

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.229 
other thing that our little long diagram
is<00:03:17.769> showing<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.640> reflective

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
is showing you is the reflective

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.630 
is showing you is the reflective
technology<00:03:19.680> within<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:21.040> pads<00:03:21.280> themselves

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
technology within the pads themselves

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.420 
technology within the pads themselves
and<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.570> yes<00:03:22.989> these<00:03:23.200> are<00:03:23.260> air<00:03:23.530> pads<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.280> for

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
and so yes these are air pads and for

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.979 
and so yes these are air pads and for
any<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:24.730> have<00:03:24.910> been<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:25.209> an<00:03:25.330> air<00:03:25.480> pad<00:03:25.750> you

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
any of you have been on an air pad you

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.870 
any of you have been on an air pad you
know<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.010> conduct<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
know it's going to conduct the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.060 
know it's going to conduct the
temperature<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.870> ground<00:03:29.110> in<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.530> outside

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
temperature of the ground in the outside

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.370 
temperature of the ground in the outside
air<00:03:30.430> much<00:03:30.790> more<00:03:31.060> significantly<00:03:31.810> that's<00:03:32.140> the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
air much more significantly that's the

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.910 
air much more significantly that's the
was<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.430> original<00:03:33.880> downfall<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.870> air<00:03:35.590> pads

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
was the original downfall of air pads

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.160 
was the original downfall of air pads
versus<00:03:36.670> some<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.239> foam<00:03:37.540> that's<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:38.049> your

self<00:03:38.440> inflating<00:03:38.769> pads<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:40.330> so<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.600> thermarest

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
self inflating pads and so a thermarest

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.050 
self inflating pads and so a thermarest
is<00:03:41.410> done<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.709> address

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
is done to address

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.300 
is done to address
that<00:03:42.239> issue<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.870> develop<00:03:43.530> these<00:03:43.680> reflective

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
that issue is develop these reflective

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.330 
that issue is develop these reflective
barriers<00:03:44.910> inside<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.900> pod<00:03:46.140> itself<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:47.310> that

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
barriers inside the pod itself so that
