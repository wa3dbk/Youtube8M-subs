actually air filled not with foam the

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.170 
actually air filled not with foam the
only<00:00:32.529> reason<00:00:32.830> is<00:00:32.980> is<00:00:33.220> because<00:00:33.400> when<00:00:33.820> I<00:00:33.850> crawl

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
only reason is is because when I crawl

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.240

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
rocks and I'm out on the trail it's a

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.940 
rocks and I'm out on the trail it's a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
lot easier to get the Flex to happen in

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.870
