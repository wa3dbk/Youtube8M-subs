redstone and a button and then we have
our<00:01:51.990> actual<00:01:52.680> pressure<00:01:53.340> point<00:01:53.729> blocks<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.450> as

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
our actual pressure point blocks so as

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.450 
our actual pressure point blocks so as
you<00:01:54.659> guys<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.049> tell<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.190> have<00:01:56.280> all

you guys can tell right here we have all
of<00:01:56.549> our<00:01:56.640> pressure<00:01:56.880> point<00:01:57.180> blocks<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:57.750> they

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
of our pressure point blocks and they

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.230 
of our pressure point blocks and they
all<00:01:57.960> look<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> exact<00:01:58.710> same<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.240> regular

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
all look the exact same as regular

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
all look the exact same as regular
minecraft<00:02:00.810> blocks<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.260> also<00:02:01.409> perform<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
minecraft blocks they also perform the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.250 
minecraft blocks they also perform the
exact<00:02:02.430> same<00:02:02.670> way<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.630> guys<00:02:03.780> tried<00:02:04.110> to

exact same way so if you guys tried to

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.800 
exact same way so if you guys tried to
mine<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.490> pressure<00:02:05.760> point<00:02:06.119> bedrock

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
mine a you know pressure point bedrock

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
mine a you know pressure point bedrock
it<00:02:07.260> would<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.650> would<00:02:07.770> never<00:02:07.830> be<00:02:08.039> able<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.250> mine

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it would you would never be able to mine

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.979 
it would you would never be able to mine
it<00:02:08.549> so<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:08.879> all<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> same<00:02:09.479> properties

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
it so they all have the same properties

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.730 
it so they all have the same properties
which<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.289> cool<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.950> kind<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.250> hard<00:02:11.310> to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
which is cool so it's kind of hard to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
where the pressure points are so you can

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.670 
where the pressure points are so you can
see<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.540> have<00:02:37.630> one<00:02:37.930> right<00:02:38.050> here<00:02:38.110> when<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.530> right

puts<00:02:45.550> off<00:02:45.730> our<00:02:45.970> little<00:02:46.240> redstone<00:02:46.540> signal

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
puts off our little redstone signal

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.780 
puts off our little redstone signal
right<00:02:47.350> here<00:02:47.380> puts<00:02:48.010> off<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.190> redstone<00:02:48.520> signal

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
right here puts off a redstone signal

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.640 
right here puts off a redstone signal
and<00:02:49.210> then<00:02:49.540> right<00:02:49.720> here<00:02:49.750> obviously<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.470> puts

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.470 
one and they're kind of hard to click we
have<00:02:54.280> just<00:02:54.520> like<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.820> little<00:02:54.910> pixel<00:02:55.360> down

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
have just like one little pixel down

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.290 
have just like one little pixel down
there<00:02:55.690> but<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:57.070> actually<00:02:57.220> set<00:02:57.790> your<00:02:57.970> redstone

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
there but to actually set your redstone

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.550 
there but to actually set your redstone
signal<00:02:58.600> points<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.230> just<00:02:59.380> got<00:02:59.530> to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
signal points you just got to

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.230 
signal points you just got to
right-click<00:02:59.800> with<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.190> redstone<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:01.030> tells

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
right-click with a redstone and it tells

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.910 
right-click with a redstone and it tells
you<00:03:01.390> where<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.660> set<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.680> gives<00:03:02.770> you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
you where you set it and it gives you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.620 
you where you set it and it gives you
the<00:03:03.010> coordinates<00:03:03.310> as<00:03:03.640> well<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.210> you<00:03:04.480> just

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
the coordinates as well and you just

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.060 
the coordinates as well and you just
keep<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.320> you<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.800> only<00:03:05.830> have

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
keep going like this you can only have

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.520 
keep going like this you can only have
to<00:03:06.400> signal<00:03:06.790> ones<00:03:07.150> on<00:03:07.330> top<00:03:07.570> or<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.870> can<00:03:08.350> have

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
to signal ones on top or you can have

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.880 
to signal ones on top or you can have
one<00:03:09.490> double<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.030> believe<00:03:10.330> like<00:03:10.570> so<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.650> we<00:03:11.770> can

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
one double I believe like so so we can

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.080 
one double I believe like so so we can
put<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.190> there<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.520> can<00:03:12.640> have<00:03:12.730> two<00:03:12.910> doubles

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
put that there you can have two doubles

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.910 
put that there you can have two doubles
or<00:03:13.360> two<00:03:13.510> signals<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.020> up<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.440> guys<00:03:14.500> and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
or two signals it's up to you guys and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.160 
or two signals it's up to you guys and
dumped<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.850> remove<00:03:16.210> it<00:03:16.390> all<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.870> have<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.050> do

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
dumped to remove it all you have to do

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.570 
dumped to remove it all you have to do
is<00:03:17.380> just<00:03:17.410> right<00:03:17.770> click<00:03:18.010> with<00:03:18.190> your<00:03:18.220> pressure

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
is just right click with your pressure

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.430 
is just right click with your pressure
point<00:03:18.910> tool<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.510> but<00:03:19.690> right<00:03:19.840> now<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.080> can't

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
point tool on it but right now I can't

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.990 
point tool on it but right now I can't
because<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.770> says<00:03:20.920> I'm<00:03:21.040> not<00:03:21.070> allowed<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.460> to

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
because it says I'm not allowed to to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.460 
because it says I'm not allowed to to
change<00:03:22.270> that<00:03:22.510> all<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.840> have<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.050> do<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.320> go

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
change that all you have to do is go

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.080 
change that all you have to do is go
into<00:03:23.620> your<00:03:23.800> config<00:03:24.250> file<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.790> guys<00:03:24.910> will

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
into your config file and you guys will

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.210 
into your config file and you guys will
be<00:03:25.210> able<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.540> modify<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:26.800> that<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:27.010> can

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
be able to modify that so that you can

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.400 
be able to modify that so that you can
remove<00:03:27.460> pressure<00:03:27.790> points<00:03:28.270> but<00:03:28.930> that's<00:03:29.200> pretty

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
remove pressure points but that's pretty

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.750 
remove pressure points but that's pretty
much<00:03:29.530> how<00:03:29.740> you<00:03:29.770> do<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.100> so<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.430> red<00:03:30.580> stone

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
much how you do that so the red stone

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.370 
much how you do that so the red stone
gives<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.120> one<00:03:31.300> pressure<00:03:31.600> point<00:03:31.960> a<00:03:32.020> 1<00:03:32.200> x<00:03:32.350> 1

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
gives you one pressure point a 1 x 1

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.470 
gives you one pressure point a 1 x 1
pixel<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.250> then<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.610> redstone<00:03:33.970> torch<00:03:34.240> gives

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
pixel and then the redstone torch gives

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.450 
pixel and then the redstone torch gives
you<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.630> two<00:03:34.870> by<00:03:34.990> two<00:03:35.020> pixel<00:03:35.620> for<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> button<00:03:36.250> so

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
you a two by two pixel for a button so

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.430 
you a two by two pixel for a button so
you<00:03:36.490> can<00:03:36.670> see<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.970> right<00:03:37.450> here<00:03:37.510> when<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:38.350> do

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
you can see that right here when I do

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.440 
you can see that right here when I do
this<00:03:38.830> puts<00:03:39.550> off<00:03:39.700> our<00:03:39.850> redstone<00:03:40.180> signal

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
this puts off our redstone signal

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.480 
this puts off our redstone signal
alright<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:41.800> I'm<00:03:41.920> going<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.070> go<00:03:42.160> ahead<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.340> do

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
alright so I'm going to go ahead and do

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.130 
alright so I'm going to go ahead and do
it<00:03:42.610> on<00:03:42.730> our<00:03:42.820> block<00:03:43.120> right<00:03:43.330> here<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:43.870> I'm<00:03:44.020> going

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
it on our block right here so I'm going

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.260 
it on our block right here so I'm going
to<00:03:44.170> do<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.350> one<00:03:44.620> by<00:03:44.800> one<00:03:45.130> point<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.000> let's<00:03:46.120> just

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
to do a one by one point so let's just

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.180 
to do a one by one point so let's just
do<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.390> on<00:03:46.600> this<00:03:46.780> block<00:03:47.050> right<00:03:47.080> here<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:48.040> now

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
do it on this block right here so now

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.770 
do it on this block right here so now
after<00:03:48.430> I've<00:03:48.670> said<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:48.940> when<00:03:49.060> i<00:03:49.090> click<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.630> it

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
after I've said it when i click it it

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.270 
after I've said it when i click it it
puts<00:03:49.960> off<00:03:50.140> our<00:03:50.320> red<00:03:50.470> second<00:03:50.800> signal<00:03:51.040> which<00:03:51.160> is

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
puts off our red second signal which is

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.830 
puts off our red second signal which is
really<00:03:51.430> cool<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.820> guys<00:03:51.910> can<00:03:52.120> do<00:03:52.300> this<00:03:52.420> on<00:03:52.570> all

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
really cool you guys can do this on all

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.210 
really cool you guys can do this on all
your<00:03:53.020> different<00:03:53.260> blocks<00:03:53.620> right<00:03:53.860> here<00:03:54.070> so<00:03:54.190> I

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
your different blocks right here so I

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.010 
your different blocks right here so I
can<00:03:54.280> put<00:03:54.430> one<00:03:54.580> right<00:03:54.700> there<00:03:54.970> click<00:03:55.840> right

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
can put one right there click right

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.780 
can put one right there click right
there<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.350> goes<00:03:56.500> on<00:03:56.740> and<00:03:57.040> we<00:03:57.340> can<00:03:57.460> put<00:03:57.580> one

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
say right here right click it and it

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.340 
say right here right click it and it
goes<00:04:00.670> on<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.210> guys<00:04:01.360> like<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.840> said<00:04:02.050> also

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
goes on and you guys like I said also

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.990 
goes on and you guys like I said also
can<00:04:02.500> see<00:04:02.680> if<00:04:02.920> you<00:04:03.190> forget<00:04:03.490> where<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.730> put<00:04:03.880> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
can see if you forget where you put the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.790 
can see if you forget where you put the
point<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.390> can<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:04.780> put<00:04:05.020> on<00:04:05.110> f3<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.710> it

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
point you can just put on f3 and it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.290 
point you can just put on f3 and it
shows<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.670> that's<00:04:06.760> really<00:04:06.970> really<00:04:07.240> cool

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
shows you so that's really really cool

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.570 
shows you so that's really really cool
as<00:04:07.570> well<00:04:07.630> and

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
as well and

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.000 
as well and
yeah<00:04:10.210> I<00:04:10.240> think<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:11.020> think<00:04:11.290> that's<00:04:11.500> pretty<00:04:11.770> much

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
yeah I think I think that's pretty much

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.950 
yeah I think I think that's pretty much

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
it like I said the pressure point tool

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.350 
it like I said the pressure point tool
is<00:04:14.200> only<00:04:14.410> there<00:04:14.650> for<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.310> create<00:04:16.150> your

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.600 
is only there for you to create your
actual<00:04:16.720> blocks<00:04:17.110> and<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:18.040> heck<00:04:18.250> would<00:04:18.340> happen

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
actual blocks and the heck would happen

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.050 
actual blocks and the heck would happen
to<00:04:18.670> my<00:04:18.730> crafting<00:04:19.060> recipes<00:04:19.540> but<00:04:20.140> anyways<00:04:21.060> yeah

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
obviously you have to mess with the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.270 
obviously you have to mess with the
config<00:04:25.600> file<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:26.020> be<00:04:26.110> able<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.380> allow<00:04:26.890> yourself

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
config file to be able to allow yourself

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.860 
config file to be able to allow yourself
to<00:04:27.400> do<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.730> but<00:04:28.330> that's<00:04:28.480> pretty<00:04:28.630> much<00:04:28.810> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
to do that but that's pretty much the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.780 
to do that but that's pretty much the
mod<00:04:29.170> in<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.380> hole<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.950> guys<00:04:30.100> can<00:04:30.340> just<00:04:30.580> get

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
mod in the hole you guys can just get

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.550 
mod in the hole you guys can just get
invisible<00:04:31.180> pressure<00:04:31.510> points<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.110> when<00:04:32.470> you

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
invisible pressure points that when you

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.590 
invisible pressure points that when you
guys<00:04:32.680> trigger<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.370> correct<00:04:33.580> splice<00:04:34.000> it

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
guys trigger it in the correct splice it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.270 
guys trigger it in the correct splice it
puts<00:04:34.930> off<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.110> redstone<00:04:35.530> signal<00:04:35.860> which<00:04:36.130> is

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
puts off a redstone signal which is

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.250 
puts off a redstone signal which is
really<00:04:36.460> cool<00:04:36.730> just<00:04:37.450> so<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.630> guys<00:04:37.840> can<00:04:38.020> hide

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
really cool just so you guys can hide

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
better and you know obviously if I went

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.130 
better and you know obviously if I went

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
into into survival here on they go ahead

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.080 
into into survival here on they go ahead
and<00:04:44.230> show<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.410> guys<00:04:44.530> this<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.370> has<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.760> exact

and show you guys this it has the exact

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.750 
and show you guys this it has the exact
same<00:04:46.120> properties<00:04:46.930> as<00:04:47.170> a<00:04:47.800> regular<00:04:48.130> stone<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:48.640> no

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
same properties as a regular stone so no

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.520 
same properties as a regular stone so no
one<00:04:48.880> can<00:04:48.970> really<00:04:49.120> be<00:04:49.300> able<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.540> tell<00:04:49.750> what<00:04:49.990> what

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
one can really be able to tell what what

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.020 
one can really be able to tell what what
a<00:04:50.560> pressure<00:04:50.800> point<00:04:51.040> block<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.700> what's<00:04:51.820> not

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
a pressure point block is and what's not

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.090 
a pressure point block is and what's not
which<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:52.360> really<00:04:52.510> cool<00:04:52.780> but<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.650> think<00:04:53.920> that

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
which is really cool but I think that

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.410 
which is really cool but I think that
pretty<00:04:54.280> much<00:04:54.370> does<00:04:54.640> it<00:04:54.700> for<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:54.970> mod<00:04:55.180> guys
