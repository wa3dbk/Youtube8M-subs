00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.129 
colors to the objects that you create so
let's<00:00:12.070> create<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.400> few<00:00:12.639> objects<00:00:13.059> instead<00:00:14.049> of

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
let's create a few objects instead of

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.990 
let's create a few objects instead of
going<00:00:14.379> up<00:00:14.469> to<00:00:14.500> our<00:00:14.679> create<00:00:14.980> menu<00:00:15.370> let's<00:00:15.849> use

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
going up to our create menu let's use

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.019 
going up to our create menu let's use
our<00:00:16.090> shelf<00:00:16.480> this<00:00:16.660> time<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.980> your<00:00:18.340> shelf<00:00:18.759> look

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
our shelf this time on your shelf look

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.150 
our shelf this time on your shelf look
for<00:00:19.150> the<00:00:19.240> tab<00:00:19.419> that<00:00:19.450> says<00:00:19.630> polygons<00:00:20.320> and<00:00:20.619> click

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
for the tab that says polygons and click

on it and now you'll see the primitive

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.650 
on it and now you'll see the primitive
shapes<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:23.680> we<00:00:23.829> can<00:00:23.980> create<00:00:24.300> let's<00:00:25.300> create<00:00:25.570> a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
shapes that we can create let's create a

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.490 
shapes that we can create let's create a
cube<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:27.130> gonna<00:00:27.309> zoom<00:00:27.550> in<00:00:27.960> I'm<00:00:28.960> gonna<00:00:29.140> put

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
cube I'm gonna zoom in I'm gonna put

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.560 
cube I'm gonna zoom in I'm gonna put
this<00:00:29.590> on<00:00:29.739> smooth<00:00:30.099> shade<00:00:30.430> all<00:00:30.460> and<00:00:31.329> I'm<00:00:31.419> also

this on smooth shade all and I'm also
gonna<00:00:31.840> turn<00:00:32.110> on<00:00:32.259> wireframe<00:00:32.590> on<00:00:32.980> shaded<00:00:34.200> I'm

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
gonna turn on wireframe on shaded I'm

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.540 
gonna turn on wireframe on shaded I'm
gonna<00:00:35.320> use<00:00:35.440> my<00:00:35.559> move<00:00:35.739> tool<00:00:36.040> to<00:00:36.070> move<00:00:36.280> it<00:00:36.399> out<00:00:36.520> of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
gonna use my move tool to move it out of

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.400 
gonna use my move tool to move it out of
the<00:00:36.640> way<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:39.760> I'll<00:00:39.880> create<00:00:40.180> a<00:00:40.270> sphere<00:00:40.420> move<00:00:41.290> it

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
the way see I'll create a sphere move it

the way see I'll create a sphere move it
out<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.650> way<00:00:42.900> cylinder<00:00:43.900> a<00:00:44.340> cone<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:45.910> say<00:00:46.660> a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
out of the way cylinder a cone and say a

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.420 
out of the way cylinder a cone and say a
torus<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.410> got<00:00:48.340> five<00:00:48.550> objects<00:00:48.940> created<00:00:50.430> now

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
torus I got five objects created now

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.160 
torus I got five objects created now
let's<00:00:51.610> add<00:00:51.760> colors<00:00:52.150> it's<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.329> couple<00:00:52.510> of<00:00:52.570> ways

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
let's add colors it's a couple of ways

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.979 
let's add colors it's a couple of ways
we<00:00:53.320> can<00:00:53.440> do<00:00:53.620> this<00:00:53.650> easiest<00:00:54.280> way<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:55.510> gonna<00:00:55.780> be
