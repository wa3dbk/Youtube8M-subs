 self 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.619
 I'm already vasco 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.809
 arrested - just tamerlan 77 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.340
 by a group of experts who have seen fit to get together for 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.500
 marketing their product just in case the tomato 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.770
 after the first years of activity they realized that it was necessary anyway 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.430
 implemented and develop what was also a transformation process 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.020
 in 82 the rivarolo plant was born in front 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.040
 I think the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.290
 the success of these companies 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.430
 is also due very high 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.550
 human factor 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.860
 in the sense that 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.300
 those who work in this company 3d this company and put a lot of passion 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.940
 of their work 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.660
 personally I started my work here 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.120
 I live in this area so I know 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.780
 all our members 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.860

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.670

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.250
 so definitely live this 360 degrees 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.270
 experience and also my closest collaborators with me 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.280
 expensive of the Valasco has a great potential 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 to a group of young people with high professionalism 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.890
 even today they are bringing the company to a level of excellence and this 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.980
 I think it's still a determining factor today 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.240
 for the development of companies they have closed 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.890
 however, for continuous improvement comes from research 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.980
 in terms of product quality that I can still give 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.460
 which will meet the increasingly powerful needs of the consumer 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.790
 cooperative we have complete control over the entire supply chain therefore from 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.830
 seed at the table and this is certainly a big one today 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.970
 guarantees in terms of food safety quality 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.790
 in these years we have concentrated on market research we have invested vi 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.900
 I love what our production is diversified. We have invested in 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.929
 technologies that allow us to be at the forefront 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.239
 and today without any heretical ideas 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.999
 we are collecting these results and we undoubtedly place ourselves as the main ones 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.779
 interlocutors for tomato processing sauces production e 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:44.660

 dressing for us means not doing 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.929
 and therefore today we realize that 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:10.009
 in an increasingly blue market whale market increasingly competitive 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:14.229
 it is absolutely necessary to allocate human resources innovation 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.919
 innovation is not just about product quality it is not just about the process but 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.530
 especially also on the market 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.779
 therefore knowing how to grasp what the new needs are 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.159
 of consumers through actions 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.289

 diet for the moment of inertia 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:40.999
 a clear demonstration of what was undoubtedly the important thing 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.119
 performance that was made
