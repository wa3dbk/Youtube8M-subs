 said Carlos Monsivais that the great 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.670
 character of the city of mexico is the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.770
 city ​​itself 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.510
 and it is this same city ​​that today 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.230
 houses new interconnection centers 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.840
 that lead us to modernity because 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.460
 a modern city is one capable of 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.559
 improve the quality of life of 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.690
 people that make it up and that 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.879
 they work together and they work 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.920
 they move in it by various 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.140
 means of transport either individual 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.149
 collective or massive 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.210
 the multimodal transfer centers 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.579
 cetram commonly known as centers 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.620
 of interconnection are those spaces of the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.809
 urban infrastructure destined to 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.510
 facilitate the agile connection between two or 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.940
 more means of transportation today the government 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.530
 of the city ​​of mexico launches the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.199
 operation of two new and modern 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.050
 multimodal transfer centers in 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.810
 the eastern part of the city ​​the cetram 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.060
 Eastern peripheral and cetram tlahuac 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.369
 that will benefit mobility and 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.500
 daily transfer of more than 77 thousand 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.509
 people from the demarcations of tlahuac 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.910
 iztapalapa high milpa 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.740
 Chalco and Valle de Chalco their 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.610
 different sources of work and centers 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.429
 of studies through lines 2 3 8 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.920
 and 12 of the metro as well as other systems 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.490
 of public and collective transport of 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.830
 efficient agile shape safe and orderly 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.720
 the eastern peripheral cetram located in 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.350
 avenida tláhuac in the delegation 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.170
 iztapalapa has an area of 8 thousand 556 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.990
 square meters for an influx of 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.770
 more than 29 thousand users who will enjoy 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.869
 of comfort 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.850
 and security of the modern bays of 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.829
 ascent and descent that include 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.990
 conventional access stairs and 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.700
 mechanics with facilities for people 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.700
 with different capacities 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.310
 there was nothing of ramps pointing and 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.040
 now we are moving better and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.349
 we have the elevator we have the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.450
 signage for the reasons in the 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.120
 tickets there are no posts there is no 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.930
 traveling then we have the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.400
 step more freer for us 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.380
 previously I had to order 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.370
 this to the girl 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.940
 I wish step by step in all the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.520
 seasons 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.170
 Well now he travels more comfortable before he came 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.930
 with the fear that we would fall 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.340
 now not anymore because you already feel 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.480
 comfortable when we upload it to 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 elevators is more comfortable 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.250
 the tlahuac cetram is in 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.310
 avenue san rafael atlixco and riachuelo 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.099
 serpentine in the Tlahuac delegation with 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.709
 an area of 27 thousand 306 meters 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.409
 squares for an influx of more than 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.819
 48 thousand users and one capacity 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:12.040
 commercial for 147 stores both centers 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.860
 they have a connection to metro line 12 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.680
 and converge with 12 routes of the network of 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.709
 public transportation plus a park 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.870
 vehicular of more than 1,700 units and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.500
 vice parking for more than 300 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.500
 bikes 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.299
 also counting with all the measures 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.439
 necessary for protection 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.439
 civil and surveillance 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.099
 father not because to say to get out of 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.319
 the house is like 20 minutes by car 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.780
 even more sometimes better and with the bike 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.519
 buses the time that is already parked 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.010
 I can come seasonal to vis and go 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.049
 quietly to me to me what is the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.629
 study center both facilities 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.609
 will be self-sustaining thanks to the 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.829
 economic income that represent the 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.720
 generating jobs and income for 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.510
 city what poses an important 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.269
 model to follow the expectations that 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.879
 we all have as merchants at home 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.639
 personal and of my other colleagues is 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.769
 that this works as such as a 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.540
 commercial plaza everything works at 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.030
 perfection we have no problems at all 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.800
 I believe that all the premises that 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.590
 we have in this place are are viable not 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.370
 there is only one that runs out of place without 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.090
 fructify without having a 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.280
 a good a good capital enters the 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.040
 Operation of the peripheral peripheral cetram 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.750
 and the water will contribute directly 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.449
 to combat congestion and 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.090
 roadways auditory pollution and 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.000
 environmental favoring and doing more 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.540
 kind the time of the transfers and everything 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.190
 this translates into comfort comfort and 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.080
 better quality of life for 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.419
 inhabitants of the eastern part of the 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.940
 Mexico City fraction of these 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.660
 actions because this is at the forefront 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.850
 to the high 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.830
 I would invite them to come and see 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.810
 the benefits because the truth is a 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.020
 wonder to me the advantage is 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.570
 extraordinary and the peripheral cetram 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.360
 east and the uac are owned by 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.000
 federal district- operated by the center 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.490
 multimodal transfer and they were 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.010
 built with the coordination effort 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.930
 and address of the head of government for 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.320
 make this important project a reality 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.750
 whose design combines aesthetic innovation 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.120
 and technological to match the 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.270
 most important and modern cities of 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.270
 world 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.900
 deciding together
