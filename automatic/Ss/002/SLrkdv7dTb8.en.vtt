algeria<00:00:46.050> take<00:00:46.379> care<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.590> Slovenia<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.219> get

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
algeria take care of Slovenia I get

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.000 
algeria take care of Slovenia I get
through<00:00:48.149> I'd<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.840> nice<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> most<00:00:49.800> part

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
through I'd be nice for the most part

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
through I'd be nice for the most part
I'd<00:00:50.160> say<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.640> good<00:00:50.820> draw<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.329> us<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.660> think

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
I'd say it's a good draw for us I think

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.229 
I'd say it's a good draw for us I think
you<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.530> could<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.890> been<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> lot<00:00:53.070> worse

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
you know it could have been a lot worse

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.490 
you know it could have been a lot worse
and<00:00:54.239> sure<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.750> always<00:00:55.079> say<00:00:55.199> could<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and sure you can always say could be a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.200 
and sure you can always say could be a
little<00:00:55.649> bit<00:00:55.770> better<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> most<00:00:57.059> part

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
little bit better but for the most part

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.639 
little bit better but for the most part
you<00:00:57.510> got<00:00:57.629> leaning<00:00:57.930> towards<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.230> was<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> good

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you got leaning towards this was a good

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.860 
you got leaning towards this was a good
draw<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.550> a<00:01:00.030> country<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.570> got<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
draw and I think as a country we got to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.330 
draw and I think as a country we got to
be<00:01:00.960> exciting<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
be exciting you have to look at it as a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.579 
be exciting you have to look at it as a
positive<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.930> could<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.229> been<00:01:04.320> much

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
positive because it could have been much

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
positive because it could have been much
worse<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> same<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.299> people

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
worse at the same time I think people

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.469 
worse at the same time I think people
aren't<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.760> slovenia<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:08.909> Algeria

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
aren't going to know slovenia or Algeria

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
aren't going to know slovenia or Algeria
but<00:01:09.930> they're<00:01:10.140> very<00:01:10.470> very<00:01:10.979> good<00:01:11.340> teams

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
but they're very very good teams

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820 
but they're very very good teams
especially<00:01:11.909> Slovenia<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> saw<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.290> play

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
especially Slovenia I saw them play

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.289 
especially Slovenia I saw them play
against<00:01:14.100> Russia<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.180> very

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
against Russia and I think it's a very

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
against Russia and I think it's a very
solid<00:01:15.840> team<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.229> think<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> US<00:01:16.799> has<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.130> be

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
solid team I think the US has to be

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.620 
solid team I think the US has to be
happy<00:01:17.490> about<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.850> draw<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.270> mean<00:01:18.450> obviously

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
happy about the draw I mean obviously

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
happy about the draw I mean obviously

going to a World Cup every team as a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
going to a World Cup every team as a
quality<00:01:20.820> team<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.240> can't<00:01:21.450> can't<00:01:22.140> rely<00:01:22.470> on

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
well second gaming comes the pivotal

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that one you put yourself back in

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.210 
that one you put yourself back in
contention<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> driver's<00:02:12.510> seat<00:02:12.629> even<00:02:12.870> go

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
contention or the driver's seat even go

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.800 
contention or the driver's seat even go
to<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> third<00:02:13.580> game<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:14.210> know<00:02:14.480> what<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.780> have

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
to the third game you know what you have

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.720 
to the third game you know what you have
to<00:02:14.990> do<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.230> third<00:02:15.440> game<00:02:15.680> potentially<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
to do in the third game potentially the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.210 
to do in the third game potentially the
weakest<00:02:17.180> opponents<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:18.260> paper<00:02:18.500> again<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.100> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
weakest opponents on paper again in the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.780 
weakest opponents on paper again in the
third<00:02:19.580> game<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.210> i<00:02:20.270> think<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.510> order<00:02:20.810> actually

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
third game so i think the order actually

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.610 
third game so i think the order actually
you<00:02:22.790> hate<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.540> go<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> third<00:02:24.170> game<00:02:24.320> against

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
you hate to go to the third game against

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.320 
you hate to go to the third game against
england<00:02:24.980> having<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.520> get<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> result<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.300> I

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
england having to get a result so I

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.400 
england having to get a result so I
think<00:02:26.450> disorder<00:02:27.410> favors<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.880> United<00:02:29.210> States

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
think disorder favors the United States

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.760 
think disorder favors the United States
Algeria<00:02:30.410> has<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.590> good<00:02:30.830> team<00:02:31.070> they<00:02:32.030> beat<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
Algeria has a good team they beat the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.640 
Algeria has a good team they beat the
Egyptians<00:02:33.770> were<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.310> Africans<00:02:35.650> champions

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
Egyptians were the Africans champions

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.800 
Egyptians were the Africans champions
for<00:02:36.830> some<00:02:37.040> time<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.150> don't<00:02:38.570> think<00:02:38.690> it's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
for some time so I don't think it's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.950 
for some time so I don't think it's
gonna<00:02:38.960> be<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.230> easy<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:39.830> again<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.780> would<00:02:41.780> not

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
gonna be that easy but again I would not

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.740 
gonna be that easy but again I would not
worry<00:02:42.140> too<00:02:42.320> much<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:43.040> who<00:02:43.610> we<00:02:43.820> play<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:44.480> how

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
worry too much of who we play it's how

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.300 
worry too much of who we play it's how
we<00:02:44.810> gonna<00:02:45.140> play<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.709> most<00:02:45.860> important

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
we gonna play is the most important

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.490 
we gonna play is the most important
thing<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:46.600> they<00:02:47.600> should<00:02:47.810> be<00:02:47.930> able<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.350> beat

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
thing so they should be able to beat

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.350 
thing so they should be able to beat
algeria<00:02:48.920> slovenia<00:02:49.520> because<00:02:50.030> they're<00:02:50.209> not

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
algeria slovenia because they're not

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.120 
algeria slovenia because they're not
really<00:02:50.570> really<00:02:50.959> fit<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.530> u.s.<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.980> u.s.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
really really fit like the u.s. the u.s.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.670 
really really fit like the u.s. the u.s.
is<00:02:52.400> super<00:02:52.820> fitting<00:02:53.180> though<00:02:53.360> because<00:02:54.200> even

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
is super fitting though because even

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.350 
is super fitting though because even
their<00:02:54.830> young<00:02:55.100> like<00:02:55.400> national<00:02:55.910> teams<00:02:56.120> they're

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
their young like national teams they're

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.270 
their young like national teams they're
off<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.990> that's<00:02:57.320> one<00:02:57.560> good<00:02:57.740> thing<00:02:57.770> about<00:02:57.950> the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
off it that's one good thing about the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.160 
off it that's one good thing about the
u.s.<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.610> know<00:02:58.760> i<00:02:59.090> think<00:02:59.570> they're<00:02:59.900> gonna<00:02:59.990> do

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
u.s. you know i think they're gonna do

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.840 
u.s. you know i think they're gonna do
pretty<00:03:00.380> fine<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.800> they're<00:03:00.950> gonna<00:03:01.070> qualify<00:03:01.340> so

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
pretty fine and they're gonna qualify so

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.460 
pretty fine and they're gonna qualify so
i'm<00:03:01.940> looking<00:03:02.060> forward<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.570> see<00:03:02.750> them<00:03:02.900> qualify

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
i'm looking forward to see them qualify

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.699 
i'm looking forward to see them qualify
I<00:03:04.040> think<00:03:04.940> it's<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.209> fairly<00:03:05.420> good<00:03:05.660> draw<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.380> it's

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
I think it's a fairly good draw but it's

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.990 
I think it's a fairly good draw but it's
a<00:03:06.770> good<00:03:06.920> match<00:03:07.070> up<00:03:07.280> with<00:03:07.370> them<00:03:07.520> in<00:03:07.640> England

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
a good match up with them in England

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
think they've like a 50-50 chance I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.980 
think they've like a 50-50 chance I
think<00:03:13.550> it's<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.820> can<00:03:14.060> see<00:03:14.180> there's<00:03:14.420> Mr<00:03:14.690> England
