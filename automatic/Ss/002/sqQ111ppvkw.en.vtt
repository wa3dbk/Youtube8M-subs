I<00:02:12.739> feel<00:02:13.700> bad<00:02:13.909> for<00:02:13.939> them<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.569> way<00:02:14.659> because

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
I feel bad for them in a way because

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.569 
I feel bad for them in a way because
like<00:02:15.230> their<00:02:15.409> entire<00:02:15.650> life<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.040> dedicated<00:02:16.189> to

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
like their entire life is dedicated to

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.679 
like their entire life is dedicated to
serving<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.659> human<00:02:18.290> um<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.269> way<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.420> don't

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
serving a human um so in a way I don't

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.440 
serving a human um so in a way I don't
think<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:20.989> right<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:22.340> i<00:02:22.760> don't<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:23.209> if<00:02:23.269> i

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
think it's right but i don't know if i

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.670 
think it's right but i don't know if i
consider<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:24.290> like<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> hundred<00:02:24.829> percent<00:02:25.390> wrong

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
consider it like a hundred percent wrong

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.110 
consider it like a hundred percent wrong
because<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.010> Hamill's<00:02:28.310> always<00:02:28.579> seemed<00:02:28.730> happy

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
because the Hamill's always seemed happy

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.729 
because the Hamill's always seemed happy
so<00:02:29.150> it's<00:02:29.540> really<00:02:29.689> something<00:02:29.959> i'm<00:02:30.230> still<00:02:30.530> kind

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
so it's really something i'm still kind

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.259 
so it's really something i'm still kind
of<00:02:30.769> like<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.430> fence<00:02:31.579> about<00:02:31.700> as<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> vegan

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
you know it's like it's it's it's wrong

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.559
