00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello everyone and welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.779
 I am blessed in this video vi 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.830
 show how this soap was made 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.830
 road why 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.189
 the idea came to me walking around 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.650
 useless on the shore on the sand 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.480
 fine walk I noticed that the skin 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.369
 sailing ships and the soft and delicate 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.800
 then I thought of inserting into this 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.779
 soap sand and sea water 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.900
 let's see the ingredients on 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.900
 method 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.510
 first we have to do with a colander 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.590
 to sea water and sand for 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.590
 remove all impurities 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.689
 before starting we wear gloves and 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.259
 work glasses to protect hands 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.259
 and eyes 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:58.399
 with a sling we weigh 71 grams of 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.399
 caustic soda and 150 of sea water 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.369
 we pour the soda into the water and we do 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:09.129
 dissolve the solution together 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.840
 caustic will rise in temperature up to 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:16.390
 reach 80 degrees Celsius 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:22.870
 we aim at about another container 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:26.799
 fat 300 g of olive oil 50 g of 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.950
 sunflower oil and 150 grams of oil of 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.950
 coconut 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.319
 we pour the caustic solution e 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.330
 mix with a spatula until 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.860
 the heat of the caustic solution does not 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.860
 completely dissolves coconut oil 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.780
 when it's all completely dissolved 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.300
 we begin to blend with the mixer al 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.060
 reaching the tape we add a 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.830
 couple of teaspoons of activated charcoal the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.410
 activated carbon is an ingredient 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.840
 optional in this soap I wanted it 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.239
 insert for purifying properties and 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.090
 absorbents of these substances which 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.540
 help fight odor 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.299
 it also helps to improve 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.200
 the aesthetics of the soap conferring one 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.480
 very particular dark color 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.019
 so let's add either a fragrance or 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.019
 of essential oils 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.290
 at last when the soap is enough 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.810
 thick add the sand 8 10 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.770
 spoons about stirring with one 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.770
 spatula from time to time 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.250
 now we can put the soap on it 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.250
 molds 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.570
 to avoid air bubbles we bang and 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.570
 soap several times on the work surface 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.830
 we remove excess soap 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.930
 and we cover with film is a 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.930
 cloth 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:06.650
 the soap will have to rest 24 48 hours before 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.650
 to be reprinted 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.820
 when the soap is completely solid 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.820
 we can remove it from the molds 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.719
 once the soap has melted it must 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.349
 mature for 40 days in a place 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.539
 dry 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.029
 before the effect can be used 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.610
 sand scrub is very intense 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:04.309
 then a soap for the sole of the foot 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.849
 where very hard skin can be 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.979
 used 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.319
 what is a mind, for example on the elbows 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.089
 where are the same minds but it is not 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.949
 recommended the other parts of the 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:15.080
 body where the most delicate skin 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.059
 I hope you enjoyed the video and that 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.189
 may be useful to you if you do it
