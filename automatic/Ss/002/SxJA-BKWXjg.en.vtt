00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.060
 in me 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.050
 and 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.640
 for me work is a curse is 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.140
 better to stay at home doing what 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.849
 I like and tell me whether or not this is 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.590
 true that many people are 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.990
 working on activities that do not 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.330
 like to realize however not for that 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.780
 that means that the work is a 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.580
 curse also how would you feel 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.800
 working on something that you love and 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.640
 Also, if you get a job from that job 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.700
 retribution because I would feel good then 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.760
 if what you say is true my work 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.770
 Current is not to my liking despite that 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.079
 the bible gives us good advice to 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.390
 respect that can help you have the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.570
 appropriate attitude even when work 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.910
 what you have is not that you like it very much 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.309
 well tell me and made me want to 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.369
 know more look than the bible in 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.310
 proverbs chapter 22 the verse 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.220
 29 shows a great benefit of having 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.330
 a positive attitude towards work 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.850
 the kindness to read it thank you 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.820
 You have seen a skilled man in his 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.040
 work in front of kings is where he 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.660
 will bet will not be bet in front of 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.630
 common men 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.700
 The truth did not understand what is 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.740
 saying this verse is that when 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.260
 we become skilled people in 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.890
 our work is going to go so well that 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 we will have two benefits first in front 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.690
 the kings will settle or in other 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.820
 words could we make ourselves a good 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 name so much that we will be like 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.520
 trusted men of our bosses 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.760
 second we will not bet in front of 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.290
 common men or in other words 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.190
 we will have greater job stability 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.750
 Well, we will not be changing jobs 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.420
 the point to highlight is that with safety 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.220
 If you do your best you will have a 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.880
 good name before men but 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.130
 they have yours too, that's not a good thing 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.100
 what the Bible says yes is true 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.790
 besides instead of being work one 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.580
 damn 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.220
 the bible fosters it precisely in the 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.120
 letter to the Ephesians chapter 4 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.870
 verse 28 note what he mentions 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.420
 steal no longer you but rather that 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.360
 do hard work doing with your hands 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.430
 whatever is good work so you have 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.490
 something to distribute to someone who has 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.880
 need, this does seem good to me 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.020
 place that people steal that work 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.660
 correct and in addition there is the benefit 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.570
 You will be able to help people 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.490
 physical sense if you work hard and 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.510
 there is much happiness in giving and help 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.720
 others in case good is something they pay to 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.230
 one and one you can give your tastes or to 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.270
 least give gifts to others and as for 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.070
 confirm what it says it does work 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.050
 it's a good thing and not a bad thing 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.280
 curse in the goodness of looking 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.830
 ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 13 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.440
 that every man eats and really lives at 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.440
 well for everything hard work is the gift 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.480
 of God as you notice the benefits of 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.000
 work is that if one does it with enthusiasm 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.160
 one can feel the joy of seeing the fruit 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.090
 of it in addition to having the necessary 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.280
 for life as you can observe the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.489
 bible stresses that it is hard work 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.560
 not average or of poor quality so if 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.100
 we do our best had 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.140
 security that will go better is true 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.620
 thank you very much for explaining what the 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.090
 bible says about it I the truth 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.450
 I thought work was a curse 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.450
 but not well focused is a good thing
