up<00:00:15.120> making<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.509> foundations<00:00:16.020> taller<00:00:16.379> then

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
up making the foundations taller then

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.290 
up making the foundations taller then
they<00:00:16.949> kind<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.699> original

to get the rectangle in there with use

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.540 
to get the rectangle in there with use
of<00:00:24.570> stairs<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.170> then<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.710> started<00:00:26.039> working<00:00:26.250> my

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
win I find it looks a lot better than

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.010 
win I find it looks a lot better than
emerald<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> Emerald<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.480> too<00:00:51.719> bright

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
emerald the Emerald was just too bright

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
emerald the Emerald was just too bright
I<00:00:52.260> added<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.100> these<00:00:53.250> details<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
I added in all these details on the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.819 
I added in all these details on the
upper<00:00:54.239> floor<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.870> green<00:00:55.170> bit<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> try<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
upper floor of that green bit to try and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.740 
upper floor of that green bit to try and
simulate<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.550> look<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.789> tiles<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.390> in

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
simulate the look of tiles because in

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
simulate the look of tiles because in
the<00:00:58.079> original<00:00:58.440> building<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.829> made<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.129> tiles

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the original building it's made of tiles

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490 
the original building it's made of tiles
but<00:00:59.850> again<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.289> used

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
but again I can really do that so I used

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
but again I can really do that so I used
slabs<00:01:01.770> buttons<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.489> some<00:01:02.640> fence<00:01:02.879> posts<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
slabs buttons and some fence posts to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.210 
slabs buttons and some fence posts to
kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> simulate<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
kind of simulate that and then that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.950 
kind of simulate that and then that
little<00:01:05.339> room<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> top<00:01:06.240> left<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> just

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
little room on the top left that I just

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.570 
little room on the top left that I just
built<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> window<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.189> was<00:01:08.280> really

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
built with the window that was really

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
built with the window that was really
hard<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> shape<00:01:09.360> right<00:01:09.470> originally<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
hard to get the shape right originally I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.289 
hard to get the shape right originally I
trimmed<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.250> blue<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
trimmed it in blue like I have with the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.910 
trimmed it in blue like I have with the
roof<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> right<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> wouldn't<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
roof on the right but it wouldn't go the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.649 
roof on the right but it wouldn't go the
right<00:01:14.070> shape<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.549> looked<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> flat<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
right shape it looked kind of flat so I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.969 
right shape it looked kind of flat so I
stuck<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:15.960> sticker<00:01:16.320> blocks<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> front

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
stuck some sticker blocks on the front

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.320 
stuck some sticker blocks on the front
of<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> right<00:01:18.060> shape

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of that to kind get the right shape

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.090 
of that to kind get the right shape
which<00:01:18.810> meant<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> blue<00:01:19.320> kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.680> shows<00:01:19.860> less

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
which meant the blue kind of shows less

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.520 
which meant the blue kind of shows less
but<00:01:20.490> near<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> shaped<00:01:21.180> good<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> go

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
but near the shaped good so there you go

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
but near the shaped good so there you go
so<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> improvised<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> sides

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so I kind of improvised with the sides

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.420 
so I kind of improvised with the sides
of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> house<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:26.159> really

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
of the house here and as it's really

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.070 
of the house here and as it's really
hard<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> house<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> actual<00:01:27.840> film

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
hard to see the house in the actual film

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.929 
hard to see the house in the actual film
I<00:01:28.290> couldn't<00:01:28.619> find<00:01:28.770> many<00:01:29.070> very<00:01:29.280> screenshots

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I couldn't find many very screenshots

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
I couldn't find many very screenshots
showing<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.360> sides<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> house<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> kind

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
showing the sides of the house so I kind

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.679 
showing the sides of the house so I kind
of<00:01:32.009> tried<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.220> stick<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> style<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.570> I

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
of tried to stick to the style and I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.359 
of tried to stick to the style and I
think<00:01:33.930> yeah<00:01:34.110> overall<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> managed<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
think yeah overall I kind of managed to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
think yeah overall I kind of managed to
keep<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> theme<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.180> I'm<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.509> happy<00:01:36.720> with

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
keep the theme so I'm really happy with

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
keep the theme so I'm really happy with
how<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> size<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.770> turned<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.640> I've<00:01:38.729> added

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
how the size of turned out so I've added

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
how the size of turned out so I've added
loads<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.420> detail<00:01:39.570> into<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> house<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.590> kind

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
loads of detail into the house here kind

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
loads of detail into the house here kind
of<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.369> originally<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> building

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
of more than originally in the building

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
of more than originally in the building
but<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.409> Minecraft<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.009> find<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.520> detail

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
but in Minecraft I find the more detail

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.030 
but in Minecraft I find the more detail
you<00:01:45.030> add<00:01:45.180> most<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> time<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.680> better<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you add most of the time the better it

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.760 
you add most of the time the better it
looks<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.210> spiderweb<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.110> simulate<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
looks so I use spiderweb to simulate the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
looks so I use spiderweb to simulate the
strings<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.340> held<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> balloons<00:01:50.939> onto<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
strings that held the balloons onto the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
strings that held the balloons onto the
chimney<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.350> worked<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.040> huge

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
chimney and then worked on that huge

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
chimney and then worked on that huge
pile<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.939> balloons<00:01:54.390> by<00:01:54.689> using<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.140> framework

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
pile of balloons by using a framework

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
pile of balloons by using a framework
made<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> yellow<00:01:56.219> wool<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.149> went<00:01:57.329> through

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
made of yellow wool and I went through

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.959 
made of yellow wool and I went through
it<00:01:57.600> did<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.869> by<00:01:58.049> hand<00:01:58.369> filled<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.729> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it did that by hand filled it all in and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.429 
it did that by hand filled it all in and
then<00:02:00.090> went<00:02:00.270> through<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.600> colored<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.320> my

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
then went through and colored it so my

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.870 
then went through and colored it so my
hotbar<00:02:01.680> had<00:02:02.070> nine<00:02:02.280> different<00:02:02.310> colors<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
hotbar had nine different colors of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.459 
hotbar had nine different colors of
woollen<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.930> went<00:02:04.079> through<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
woollen and I just went through and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
woollen and I just went through and
randomly<00:02:04.890> slept<00:02:05.219> with<00:02:05.340> them<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.670> changed<00:02:06.090> all

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
randomly slept with them and changed all

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.550 
randomly slept with them and changed all
the<00:02:06.270> colors<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:07.020> probably<00:02:07.259> took<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the colors that probably took the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
the colors that probably took the
longest<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.310> entire<00:02:08.610> build<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.450> here

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
longest out of this entire build so here

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.059 
longest out of this entire build so here
you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:10.050> me<00:02:10.229> ham<00:02:10.560> building<00:02:10.950> that

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you can see me ham building that

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.140 
you can see me ham building that
framework<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
framework out of the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.059 
framework out of the
we'll<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.599> going<00:02:13.140> through<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.530> coloring<00:02:13.920> it

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
we'll then going through and coloring it

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.500 
we'll then going through and coloring it
with<00:02:14.099> all<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> other<00:02:14.579> colored<00:02:14.939> books<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
with all the other colored books and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.630 
with all the other colored books and
overall<00:02:16.349> I'm<00:02:16.739> really<00:02:16.799> happy<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.370> how<00:02:17.489> that

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
overall I'm really happy with how that

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.860 
overall I'm really happy with how that
turned<00:02:17.849> out<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.180> was<00:02:18.209> kind<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.569> worrying<00:02:18.750> I

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
turned out I was kind of worrying I

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.729 
turned out I was kind of worrying I
wouldn't<00:02:19.079> be<00:02:19.170> able<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.379> make<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> pattern

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
wouldn't be able to make the pattern

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.920 
wouldn't be able to make the pattern
random<00:02:20.159> enough<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.640> think<00:02:20.909> I<00:02:21.030> managed<00:02:21.360> so

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
random enough but I think I managed so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.119 
random enough but I think I managed so
here<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.140> am<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.590> adding<00:02:22.709> some<00:02:22.980> extra

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
here I am just adding some extra

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.949 
here I am just adding some extra
balloons<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.819> kind<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.060> gone<00:02:24.209> stray<00:02:24.569> from

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
balloons that kind of gone stray from

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.839 
balloons that kind of gone stray from
the<00:02:25.049> main<00:02:25.230> block<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.829> here<00:02:26.340> we<00:02:26.459> have<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
the main block and here we have the

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.119 
the main block and here we have the
finished<00:02:27.090> build<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:28.200> I'm<00:02:28.319> very<00:02:28.500> very<00:02:28.650> pleased

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
finished build so I'm very very pleased

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.770 
finished build so I'm very very pleased
with<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.579> think<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:29.909> finest<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.359> achieve

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
with this I think I finest to achieve

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.449 
with this I think I finest to achieve
exactly<00:02:31.049> what<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.500> was<00:02:31.560> looking<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.189> I

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
exactly what I was looking out to do I

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.309 
exactly what I was looking out to do I
mean<00:02:32.819> it's<00:02:32.939> not<00:02:33.060> quite<00:02:33.299> like<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.870> original<00:02:34.290> I

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
mean it's not quite like the original I

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.630 
mean it's not quite like the original I
mean<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.590> hope<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.829> chimney<00:02:35.189> a<00:02:35.220> bit<00:02:35.400> fatter

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
mean I hope the chimney a bit fatter

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640 
mean I hope the chimney a bit fatter
because<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.510> small<00:02:36.780> cherry<00:02:37.109> doesn't<00:02:37.230> didn't

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
because the small cherry doesn't didn't

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.800 
because the small cherry doesn't didn't
like<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:38.099> could<00:02:38.430> support<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:39.060> huge<00:02:39.569> way

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
like it so could support that huge way

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.490 
like it so could support that huge way
of<00:02:39.989> balloons

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
of balloons

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.020 
of balloons
well<00:02:40.890> blues<00:02:41.189> don't<00:02:41.400> weigh<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.489> lot<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:41.970> you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
well blues don't weigh a lot but you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270 
well blues don't weigh a lot but you
know<00:02:42.060> what<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.329> mean<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.870> also<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.010> balloon

know what I mean and also the balloon

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.580 
know what I mean and also the balloon
shape<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.909> found<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.480> much<00:02:45.810> much<00:02:46.230> bigger

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
shape I found it it was much much bigger

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.490 
shape I found it it was much much bigger
in<00:02:46.889> the<00:02:47.040> original<00:02:47.639> film<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.389> find<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.170> any

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
