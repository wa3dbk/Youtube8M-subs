and being in that world I don't know if

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.929 
and being in that world I don't know if
you<00:01:40.710> remember<00:01:40.890> before<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.820> was

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you remember before that but that was

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.350 
you remember before that but that was
the<00:01:42.090> whole<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.990> term<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> curse<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.740> Batman

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the whole the term the curse of Batman

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.969 
the whole the term the curse of Batman
because<00:01:45.360> there<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.720> decades<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.380> games<00:01:46.590> did

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
because there was decades of games did

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.800 
because there was decades of games did
not<00:01:47.189> deliver<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.820> were<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.360> character

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
not deliver and were not that character

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.210 
not deliver and were not that character
and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.320> Rocksteady<00:01:49.740> believed<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and then when Rocksteady believed that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.499 
and then when Rocksteady believed that
people<00:01:50.430> were<00:01:50.610> ready<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.210> people<00:01:51.360> were

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
people were ready for it people were

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.359 
people were ready for it people were
waiting<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.140> game<00:01:52.500> by<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.130> down

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
waiting for that game by this all down

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.679 
waiting for that game by this all down
it<00:01:53.549> wasn't<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> wasn't<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.600> then

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
it wasn't it wasn't put that and then

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.389 
it wasn't it wasn't put that and then
Rocksteady<00:01:55.140> blew<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> doors<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.040> Arkham

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
Rocksteady blew the doors off of Arkham

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.389 
Rocksteady blew the doors off of Arkham
Asylum<00:01:56.490> suddenly<00:01:57.390> there's<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.689> game<00:01:58.399> kind

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
Asylum suddenly there's this game kind

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.630 
Asylum suddenly there's this game kind
of<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> nowhere<00:02:00.240> who<00:02:01.170> had<00:02:01.259> gotten<00:02:01.640> not

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
of out of nowhere who had gotten not

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.600 
of out of nowhere who had gotten not
only<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.509> superhero<00:02:04.259> tone<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.280> Batman

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
only the the superhero tone the Batman

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.140 
only the the superhero tone the Batman
tone

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
tone

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.180 
tone
right<00:02:06.480> and<00:02:07.230> that<00:02:07.440> was<00:02:07.650> like<00:02:07.980> an<00:02:08.100> epiphany

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
right and that was like an epiphany

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.790 
right and that was like an epiphany
right<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.710> I<00:02:10.770> just

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
right it just like it can have it I just

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.200 
right it just like it can have it I just
nailed<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.280> one<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.730> biggest<00:02:11.880> memory

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
nailed it one of the biggest memory

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.790 
nailed it one of the biggest memory
clearest<00:02:12.600> memories<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.960> have<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.380> was

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
clearest memories I have in there was

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.720 
clearest memories I have in there was
the<00:02:13.920> moment<00:02:14.190> where<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> first<00:02:14.550> come<00:02:14.700> up

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the moment where you first come up

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.550 
the moment where you first come up
against<00:02:15.000> guys<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.330> guns<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:16.110> was<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> first

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
against guys with guns it was the first

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.080 
against guys with guns it was the first
kind<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.800> credits<00:02:17.100> or<00:02:17.190> tutorial<00:02:17.700> really<00:02:17.910> about

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
kind of credits or tutorial really about

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.060 
kind of credits or tutorial really about
how<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.240> grab<00:02:18.990> walk<00:02:19.200> above<00:02:19.410> guys<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.980> we're

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
how you grab walk above guys and we're

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.650 
how you grab walk above guys and we're
from<00:02:20.220> guard<00:02:20.430> off<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.670> gargoyle<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.240> drop<00:02:21.480> down

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
from guard off a gargoyle and drop down

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.270 
from guard off a gargoyle and drop down
behind<00:02:21.990> people<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.740> take<00:02:22.890> them<00:02:23.010> out<00:02:23.130> when

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
behind people and take them out when

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.590 
behind people and take them out when
their<00:02:23.400> bodies<00:02:23.610> can't<00:02:23.850> see<00:02:24.030> or<00:02:24.210> hear<00:02:24.390> you're

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
their bodies can't see or hear you're

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.440 
their bodies can't see or hear you're
doing<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.620> was<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.830> first<00:02:26.010> training

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
doing it and it was that first training

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.040 
doing it and it was that first training
guys<00:02:27.450> let<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.140> move<00:02:29.510> just<00:02:30.510> chop<00:02:30.780> them<00:02:30.900> out

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
guys let this move just chop them out

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.780 
guys let this move just chop them out
and<00:02:31.230> move<00:02:31.920> through<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.190> grip<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.490> was<00:02:32.610> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and move through the grip and it was it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.310 
and move through the grip and it was it
felt<00:02:33.120> very<00:02:33.180> organic<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.990> was<00:02:34.080> something<00:02:34.290> I

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
felt very organic that was something I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.300 
felt very organic that was something I
think<00:02:34.470> Rocksteady<00:02:34.830> have<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> really<00:02:35.220> good

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
think Rocksteady have a really good

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
think Rocksteady have a really good
grasp<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.880> making<00:02:36.450> tutorials<00:02:36.960> feel<00:02:37.140> like

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
grasp on is making tutorials feel like

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.810 
grasp on is making tutorials feel like
that<00:02:37.440> part<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.860> game<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:38.580> that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
that part of the game and I think that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.490 
that part of the game and I think that
they<00:02:38.940> did<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.720> great<00:02:39.960> job<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.350> with<00:02:40.410> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
they did a great job of that with a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.050 
they did a great job of that with a
bunch<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.830> complex<00:02:41.310> mechanics<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.970> have

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
bunch of complex mechanics that have

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.600 
bunch of complex mechanics that have
huge<00:02:42.600> depth<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.890> challenge<00:02:44.250> boards<00:02:44.490> are

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
huge depth the challenge boards are

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.640 
huge depth the challenge boards are
really<00:02:44.760> there<00:02:45.300> they<00:02:45.690> really<00:02:45.870> taught<00:02:46.170> me<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> lot

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
really there they really taught me a lot

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.260 
really there they really taught me a lot
and<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.340> think<00:02:47.400> they<00:02:47.580> taught<00:02:47.760> anyone<00:02:48.120> who

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
and I think they taught anyone who

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.910 
and I think they taught anyone who
places<00:02:48.510> them<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.900> lot<00:02:49.290> because<00:02:49.500> what<00:02:49.830> they

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
places them a lot because what they

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.320 
places them a lot because what they
teach<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.250> more<00:02:50.370> than<00:02:50.490> anything<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.880> you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
teach you more than anything is you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.580 
teach you more than anything is you
don't<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.690> how<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.870> play<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.230> game<00:02:52.410> when

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
don't know how to play the game when

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.870 
don't know how to play the game when
you're<00:02:52.710> playing<00:02:52.980> through<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> campaign<00:02:53.550> it's

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
you're playing through the campaign it's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.940 
you're playing through the campaign it's
a<00:02:54.000> beautifully<00:02:54.450> balanced<00:02:54.990> campaign<00:02:55.440> there's

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
a beautifully balanced campaign there's

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.770 
a beautifully balanced campaign there's
definitely<00:02:56.250> great<00:02:56.550> encounters<00:02:57.060> great<00:02:57.450> sites

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
definitely great encounters great sites

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.390 
definitely great encounters great sites
great<00:02:58.140> control<00:02:58.470> rooms<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.130> start<00:02:59.370> to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
great control rooms but you start to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280 
great control rooms but you start to
appreciate<00:02:59.730> just<00:03:00.090> how<00:03:00.210> deep<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.840> mechanics

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
appreciate just how deep the mechanics

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
appreciate just how deep the mechanics
are<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> game<00:03:01.800> when<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.010> play<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
are in the game when you play the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.160 
are in the game when you play the
challenge<00:03:02.730> rooms<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.480> something<00:03:03.840> we're

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170

them<00:03:14.760> with<00:03:14.940> pop-up<00:03:15.270> messages<00:03:15.720> but<00:03:15.900> adding<00:03:16.200> is

them with pop-up messages but adding is

them with pop-up messages but adding is
an<00:03:16.500> approach<00:03:17.040> which<00:03:17.340> which<00:03:17.760> lets<00:03:18.030> people

an approach which which lets people

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.850 
an approach which which lets people
become<00:03:18.810> more<00:03:18.989> aware<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.470> depth<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.770> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
it so we're not suddenly doubling the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.810 
it so we're not suddenly doubling the
difficulty<00:03:28.320> level<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.950> making<00:03:29.459> people

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
difficulty level and and making people

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.040 
difficulty level and and making people
throw<00:03:29.970> their<00:03:30.090> controller<00:03:30.420> then<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.840> smash

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
throw their controller then and smash

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.570 
throw their controller then and smash
them<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.350> frustration<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.370> we<00:03:32.459> are

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
them in frustration but what we are

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.729 
them in frustration but what we are
doing<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.000> trying<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.330> add<00:03:33.840> an<00:03:34.080> awareness<00:03:34.530> to

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
doing is trying to add an awareness to

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.949 
doing is trying to add an awareness to
tap<00:03:35.250> into<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.640> depth<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.270> want<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.900> I

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
tap into that depth if you want to and I

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:37.880 
tap into that depth if you want to and I
think<00:03:37.020> that's<00:03:37.290> something<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.680> would<00:03:37.739> be

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
think that's something that would be

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.290 
think that's something that would be
really<00:03:38.400> fun<00:03:38.640> it's<00:03:38.850> been<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.000> great<00:03:39.209> experience

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
really fun it's been a great experience

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.910 
really fun it's been a great experience
working<00:03:39.870> with<00:03:40.080> these<00:03:40.200> mechanics<00:03:40.680> and

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
working with these mechanics and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.340 
working with these mechanics and
paddling<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:42.030> memory<00:03:42.270> that<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.870> stands<00:03:43.230> up

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
paddling the memory that that stands up

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.580 
paddling the memory that that stands up
for<00:03:43.410> me<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.830> most<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.540> playing<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.780> mini<00:03:46.230> game

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
for me the most is playing the mini game

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.460 
for me the most is playing the mini game
the<00:03:46.860> feeling<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.730> rumble<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.540> you

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
the feeling of like the rumble and you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.199 
the feeling of like the rumble and you
know<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.890> camera<00:03:50.310> with<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.580> zoom<00:03:50.880> in<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
know the camera with like zoom in and

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.090 
know the camera with like zoom in and
Batman<00:03:51.600> would<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:51.900> pop<00:03:52.110> up<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.440> screen<00:03:52.470> and

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
Batman would like pop up the screen and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.699 
Batman would like pop up the screen and
he<00:03:53.550> would<00:03:53.700> sort<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:53.970> hack<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.480> door<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.110> and

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
he would sort of hack the door and and

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.979 
he would sort of hack the door and and
how<00:03:55.980> all<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.820> different<00:03:57.390> tools<00:03:57.600> came

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
how all of the different tools came

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.650 
how all of the different tools came
together<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.650> felt<00:03:59.100> like<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.430> was<00:03:59.790> Batman<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.390> was

friend of mine the designer I was
working<00:04:30.620> at<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.740> time<00:04:30.860> mentioned<00:04:31.669> that<00:04:31.729> he

thought good level design is like music

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.170 
thought good level design is like music
and<00:04:34.009> I<00:04:34.159> thought<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.490> was<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.639> really<00:04:34.879> sharp

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
and I thought that was a really sharp

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.209 
and I thought that was a really sharp
insight<00:04:35.569> what<00:04:35.779> you<00:04:35.870> meant<00:04:36.050> by<00:04:36.229> that<00:04:36.259> was<00:04:36.710> you

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 
insight what you meant by that was you

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.040 
insight what you meant by that was you
know<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.370> have<00:04:37.639> Rivera<00:04:38.389> Senor<00:04:38.719> chorus

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
know you have Rivera Senor chorus

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.809 
know you have Rivera Senor chorus
University<00:04:39.469> of<00:04:39.529> course<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.889> break<00:04:40.279> things<00:04:40.610> up

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
refreshed and it's just about enough of

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.119 
refreshed and it's just about enough of
it<00:05:08.930> where<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.199> could<00:05:09.349> almost<00:05:09.589> be<00:05:09.830> sick<00:05:09.979> of<00:05:10.009> it

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
it where you could almost be sick of it

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:11.529 
it where you could almost be sick of it
but<00:05:10.279> they<00:05:10.400> stopped<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.759> before<00:05:10.849> that<00:05:11.150> too

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
but they stopped it before that too

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.059 
but they stopped it before that too
and<00:05:11.629> you<00:05:11.900> always<00:05:12.110> with<00:05:12.439> every<00:05:12.560> part<00:05:12.919> of<00:05:12.949> the

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
and you always with every part of the

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:14.379 
and you always with every part of the
game<00:05:13.219> you<00:05:13.430> always<00:05:13.729> feel<00:05:13.939> like<00:05:14.060> you<00:05:14.150> could<00:05:14.300> have

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
game you always feel like you could have

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.529

had more you never you never fool and I

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.029 
had more you never you never fool and I
think<00:05:17.749> that's<00:05:17.930> something<00:05:18.169> which<00:05:18.319> Rocksteady

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
think that's something which Rocksteady

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.260 
think that's something which Rocksteady
with<00:05:19.219> both<00:05:19.370> of<00:05:19.490> those<00:05:19.580> games<00:05:19.789> taught<00:05:20.180> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
with both of those games taught the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.300 
with both of those games taught the
industry<00:05:20.779> a<00:05:20.810> lot<00:05:21.020> about<00:05:21.620> other<00:05:21.770> case<00:05:22.039> games
