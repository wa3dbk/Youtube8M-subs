00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
here's back this might be really bad

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.750 
here's back this might be really bad
because<00:00:47.710> mama<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.280> gotta<00:00:49.410> try<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.470> hold<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:52.650> okay

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
because mama I gotta try to hold it okay

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.320 
because mama I gotta try to hold it okay
so<00:00:54.930> originally<00:00:55.930> she's<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.310> el<00:00:57.310> hartwig<00:00:57.910> but<00:00:58.300> I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
so originally she's a el hartwig but I

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.860 
so originally she's a el hartwig but I
cut<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.930> lace<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.890> make<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.160> part<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:01.210> put<00:01:01.720> my

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
cut the lace to make the part and put my

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.410 
cut the lace to make the part and put my
hair<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.710> make<00:01:02.830> part<00:01:03.190> look<00:01:03.340> more<00:01:03.580> real<00:01:04.059> and

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
hair and to make part look more real and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.710 
hair and to make part look more real and
natural<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:05.860> it's<00:01:06.100> better<00:01:06.280> because<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.480> part

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
natural so it's better because the part

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.900 
natural so it's better because the part
was<00:01:07.870> really<00:01:08.170> small<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.590> really<00:01:09.160> fake<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.850> me
