you

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.380 
you
I'll<00:00:08.320> continue<00:00:08.830> on<00:00:09.160> to<00:00:09.340> the<00:00:09.370> legs<00:00:09.670> and<00:00:09.910> braces

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:10.390 
I'll continue on to the legs and braces

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.570 
I'll continue on to the legs and braces
under<00:00:10.720> the<00:00:10.840> building

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.890 

now<00:00:13.730> the<00:00:13.790> reason<00:00:14.120> that<00:00:14.450> you<00:00:14.540> want<00:00:14.750> the

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
now the reason that you want the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.320 
now the reason that you want the
underlying<00:00:15.320> paint<00:00:15.650> bone-dry<00:00:16.250> is<00:00:16.700> that<00:00:17.150> when

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
underlying paint bone-dry is that when

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.780 
underlying paint bone-dry is that when
it<00:00:17.360> comes<00:00:17.630> time<00:00:17.990> to<00:00:18.020> peel<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.710> masking<00:00:19.189> off<00:00:19.369> it

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
it comes time to peel the masking off it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.700 
it comes time to peel the masking off it
will<00:00:19.910> be<00:00:20.060> less<00:00:20.330> likely<00:00:20.689> to<00:00:20.900> lift<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:21.500> paint

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
will be less likely to lift the paint

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:34.410 
will be less likely to lift the paint
with<00:00:21.950> it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.950 

in<00:00:36.010> these<00:00:37.010> congested<00:00:37.820> areas<00:00:38.210> I'll<00:00:38.450> just<00:00:38.630> mask

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
in these congested areas I'll just mask

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.220 
in these congested areas I'll just mask
the<00:00:39.260> spots<00:00:39.560> of<00:00:39.770> lights<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.280> shine<00:00:40.310> through

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.989 

once<00:00:53.350> I've<00:00:53.589> gone<00:00:53.829> across<00:00:54.159> with<00:00:54.550> all<00:00:54.730> the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
once I've gone across with all the

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.930 
once I've gone across with all the
masking<00:00:55.570> I'll<00:00:55.780> rub<00:00:56.500> off<00:00:56.710> any<00:00:56.949> dried<00:00:57.370> drops<00:00:57.730> of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
masking I'll rub off any dried drops of

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.729 
masking I'll rub off any dried drops of
masking<00:00:58.390> that<00:00:58.510> may<00:00:58.629> have<00:00:58.750> accidentally<00:00:59.350> ended

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
masking that may have accidentally ended

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.979 
masking that may have accidentally ended
up<00:00:59.890> in<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.129> area<00:01:00.429> below<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.820> horizon<00:01:01.089> line<00:01:01.629> I

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
up in the area below the horizon line I

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:12.270 
up in the area below the horizon line I
can<00:01:02.739> easily<00:01:02.920> feel<00:01:03.489> these<00:01:03.760> drops<00:01:04.119> with<00:01:04.360> my<00:01:04.570> hand

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040 

next<00:01:13.280> I'll<00:01:13.400> work<00:01:13.880> in<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.300> sky<00:01:14.570> colors

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
next I'll work in the sky colors

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.500 
next I'll work in the sky colors
for<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:18.070> I'll<00:01:18.370> use<00:01:18.670> ryllion<00:01:19.360> blue<00:01:20.040> rose

remember<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.220> painting<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.820> also

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
remember that this painting is also

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.720 
remember that this painting is also
tilted<00:01:43.630> forward<00:01:43.870> so<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.620> water<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.400> paint

will<00:01:46.090> flow<00:01:46.330> down<00:01:46.360> I'll<00:01:47.040> pick<00:01:48.040> up<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.280> rich<00:01:48.550> mix

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
will flow down I'll pick up a rich mix

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.910 
will flow down I'll pick up a rich mix

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
of cerulean blue and I'll begin working

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.940 
of cerulean blue and I'll begin working
it<00:01:51.250> into<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.580> wet<00:01:51.760> sky<00:01:52.120> area<00:01:54.210> I'll<00:01:55.770> work<00:01:56.770> it

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
it into the wet sky area I'll work it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.850 
it into the wet sky area I'll work it
right<00:01:57.220> up<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.670> masked<00:01:58.150> horizon<00:01:58.750> area<00:01:59.050> now

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
right up to the masked horizon area now

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.740 
right up to the masked horizon area now
I<00:01:59.890> don't<00:02:00.010> want<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.460> fully<00:02:00.640> cover<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.300> sky<00:02:01.540> with

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
I don't want to fully cover the sky with

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.840 
I don't want to fully cover the sky with
cyrill<00:02:02.110> Ian<00:02:02.320> I'll<00:02:02.500> leave<00:02:03.070> some<00:02:03.100> white<00:02:03.610> at

cyrill Ian I'll leave some white at

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.470 
cyrill Ian I'll leave some white at
first<00:02:03.880> I'll<00:02:05.160> very<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.370> value<00:02:06.820> somewhat<00:02:07.300> of

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
first I'll very the value somewhat of

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.540 
first I'll very the value somewhat of
the<00:02:07.510> blue<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.460> I'll<00:02:09.460> add<00:02:09.730> in<00:02:09.940> some<00:02:10.149> rose<00:02:10.390> I'll

mix much of it with blue right on the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.250 
mix much of it with blue right on the
wet<00:02:14.710> paper

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.190 

now<00:02:19.220> I'll<00:02:19.400> be<00:02:19.549> careful<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.239> not<00:02:20.420> Center<00:02:21.019> this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
now I'll be careful to not Center this

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:31.040 
now I'll be careful to not Center this
prominent<00:02:21.769> bright<00:02:22.010> color

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.839 

and<00:02:32.050> I'll<00:02:32.410> add<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.890> rich<00:02:33.130> mix<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.640> yellow

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
and I'll add in a rich mix of yellow

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.900 
and I'll add in a rich mix of yellow
ochre<00:02:34.620> primarily<00:02:35.620> around<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.190> mask<00:02:36.430> sky

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
ochre primarily around the mask sky

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:51.350 
ochre primarily around the mask sky
areas

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.530 

and<00:02:52.250> I'll<00:02:53.250> add<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.580> some<00:02:53.790> transparent<00:02:54.390> yellow

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
and I'll add in some transparent yellow

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.770 
and I'll add in some transparent yellow
as<00:02:54.840> well<00:02:55.110> again<00:02:55.920> around<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.580> mask<00:02:56.820> sky<00:02:57.270> areas

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.390 

then<00:03:00.780> I'll<00:03:01.020> wipe<00:03:01.260> off<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.740> excess<00:03:01.770> paint

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
then I'll wipe off the excess paint

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.980 
then I'll wipe off the excess paint
along<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.880> border<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> does<00:03:03.960> not

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
along the border so that it does not

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.210 
along the border so that it does not
roll<00:03:04.470> back<00:03:04.830> onto<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.370> dry<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.610> sky<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:07.220> think

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
roll back onto the dry and sky I think

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.170 
roll back onto the dry and sky I think
that<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.370> need<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.610> little<00:03:08.850> more<00:03:09.030> rows<00:03:10.970> that's<00:03:11.970> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
that I need a little more rows that's a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.240 
that I need a little more rows that's a
little<00:03:12.420> too<00:03:12.630> intense<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.440> I'll<00:03:13.560> water<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.010> back

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
little too intense so I'll water it back

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:28.090 
little too intense so I'll water it back
