00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.900 
technology here how does it look from
inside<00:02:07.650> right<00:02:08.250> let's<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
inside right let's have a look at the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.350 
inside right let's have a look at the
inside<00:02:09.269> now<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.080> active<00:02:10.619> technology<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:12.209> as

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
inside now the active technology and as

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.080 
inside now the active technology and as
you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.700> anatomically<00:02:14.700> placed

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
you can see here is anatomically placed

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.860 
you can see here is anatomically placed
silicon<00:02:15.989> print<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.750> strategically

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
silicon print and and it's strategically

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.620 
silicon print and and it's strategically
placed<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.160> item<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.420> really

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
placed on the item so that it really

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.650 
placed on the item so that it really
enhances<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.410> movement<00:02:22.890> off<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.850> athletes

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
enhances the movement off the athletes

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.120 
enhances the movement off the athletes
when<00:02:25.170> doing<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.470> sports<00:02:25.709> when<00:02:25.950> playing

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
when doing the sports when playing

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.590 
when doing the sports when playing
football<00:02:26.400> actually<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.030> particularly<00:02:27.330> in

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
football actually and particularly in

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.620 
football actually and particularly in
this<00:02:27.959> case<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.769> does<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.880> other<00:02:30.060> effects

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
this case and does it have other effects

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.920 
this case and does it have other effects
like<00:02:30.930> cooling<00:02:31.560> or<00:02:32.510> finance<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.600> effect<00:02:33.810> of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
like cooling or finance the effect of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.440 
like cooling or finance the effect of
cooling<00:02:34.170> when<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.860> wear<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.340> when<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.209> first

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
cooling when you wear it when you first

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.660 
cooling when you wear it when you first
wear<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.280> main<00:02:38.900> idea<00:02:39.900> behind<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
wear it but the main idea behind the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.640 
wear it but the main idea behind the
active<00:02:42.000> technology<00:02:42.269> is<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.870> bring<00:02:43.140> back<00:02:43.350> bring

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
active technology is to bring back bring

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.750 
active technology is to bring back bring
together<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:46.049> idea<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.620> compression<00:02:47.220> so

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
together the the idea of compression so

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.810 
together the the idea of compression so
when<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> muscle<00:02:48.420> fatigue<00:02:48.930> sets<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.670> it

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
when the muscle fatigue sets in that it

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.670 
when the muscle fatigue sets in that it
really<00:02:50.970> compresses<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.690> muscle<00:02:52.049> but<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
really compresses the muscle but in the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.930 
really compresses the muscle but in the
same<00:02:52.920> time<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.430> also<00:02:53.610> has<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.330> support

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
same time it also has the support

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.760 
same time it also has the support
attributes<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> muscle<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.290> also<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
attributes to the muscle and also to the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.460 
attributes to the muscle and also to the
athlete<00:02:59.099> where<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.849> needs<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:01.140> how

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
athlete where it needs so how

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.530 
athlete where it needs so how
did<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.890> take<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.460> actually<00:03:02.580> develop<00:03:03.120> such<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
did it take to actually develop such a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.470 
did it take to actually develop such a
shirt<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.530> technology<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.670> more<00:03:06.090> than<00:03:06.270> two

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
shirt the technology is more than two

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.420 
shirt the technology is more than two
years<00:03:06.840> when<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.320> look<00:03:07.500> at<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.740> technology<00:03:08.250> we

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
years when we look at the technology we

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.120 
years when we look at the technology we
make<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.730> first<00:03:08.910> research<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.500> about<00:03:10.740> you

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
make the first research so about you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.820 
make the first research so about you
know<00:03:11.250> two<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.180> one<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.450> half<00:03:12.570> years<00:03:12.870> before

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
know two to one and a half years before

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.460 
know two to one and a half years before
it<00:03:13.920> really<00:03:14.160> can<00:03:15.000> come<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.270> life<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.810> whether

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
it really can come to life and whether

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.800 
it really can come to life and whether
you<00:03:16.620> take<00:03:16.860> those<00:03:17.100> ideas<00:03:17.250> from<00:03:17.820> we<00:03:18.360> look<00:03:18.510> at<00:03:18.660> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
you take those ideas from we look at the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.750 
you take those ideas from we look at the
sports<00:03:19.260> itself<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:20.250> also<00:03:20.400> look<00:03:20.610> at<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
sports itself you also look at the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.390 
sports itself you also look at the
culture<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.390> sports<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:23.130> make<00:03:23.370> sure

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
culture of the sports and then make sure

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.640 
culture of the sports and then make sure
that<00:03:23.580> we're<00:03:23.880> able<00:03:24.090> with<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.050> technologies<00:03:25.620> to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
that we're able with the technologies to

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.650 
that we're able with the technologies to
support<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.520> athlete<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.030> really<00:03:27.360> perform

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
support the athlete to really perform

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.160 
support the athlete to really perform
better

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
better

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.140 
better
how<00:03:28.260> much<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.590> technology<00:03:28.950> really<00:03:29.460> driving<00:03:29.880> as

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
how much is technology really driving as

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.680 
how much is technology really driving as
well<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.990> success<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.950> football<00:03:32.550> team<00:03:32.880> what

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
well the success of a football team what

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.410 
well the success of a football team what
do<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.440> think<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.580> it's<00:03:35.910> it's<00:03:36.330> very

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
do you think I think it's it's it's very

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.720 
do you think I think it's it's it's very
important<00:03:37.140> because<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:38.070> athlete<00:03:38.370> wants<00:03:38.640> to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
important because the athlete wants to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.280 
important because the athlete wants to
be<00:03:38.850> supported<00:03:39.480> from<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.990> technological

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
be supported from a technological

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.290 
be supported from a technological
perspective<00:03:40.770> from<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.730> physical<00:03:42.150> perspective

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
perspective from a physical perspective

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.140 
perspective from a physical perspective
but<00:03:43.110> also<00:03:43.290> emotionally<00:03:44.070> an<00:03:44.250> athlete<00:03:44.790> wants<00:03:45.030> to

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
but also emotionally an athlete wants to

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.690 
but also emotionally an athlete wants to
go<00:03:45.300> out<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.750> feel<00:03:46.200> right<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:47.190> Jersey<00:03:47.580> that

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
go out and feel right in the Jersey that

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.750 
go out and feel right in the Jersey that
he<00:03:47.790> wears<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.540> right<00:03:48.720> now<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.110> is<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.440> most

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
he wears so right now this is the most

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.000 
he wears so right now this is the most
technology<00:03:50.760> advanced<00:03:51.270> shirt<00:03:51.570> we<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:51.960> get<00:03:52.200> for

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
technology advanced shirt we can get for

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.920 
technology advanced shirt we can get for
a<00:03:53.040> football<00:03:53.370> player<00:03:53.580> so<00:03:54.150> looking<00:03:54.600> into<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
a football player so looking into the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.610 
a football player so looking into the
future

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
future

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.890 
future
could<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:56.100> happened<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.420> regulator

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
could it happened that the regulator

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.580 
could it happened that the regulator
might<00:03:58.170> step<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.770> if<00:03:59.190> you're<00:03:59.400> getting<00:04:00.140> far<00:04:01.140> more

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
might step in if you're getting far more

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.380 
might step in if you're getting far more
advanced<00:04:02.100> than<00:04:02.340> perhaps<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.910> shirt<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.270> more

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
advanced than perhaps the shirt is more

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.420 
advanced than perhaps the shirt is more
important<00:04:03.780> than<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.960> player<00:04:04.310> well<00:04:05.310> we

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
important than the player well we

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.890 
important than the player well we
certainly<00:04:05.670> will<00:04:05.940> continue<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.540> explore

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
certainly will continue to explore

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.010 
certainly will continue to explore
technology<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.860> find<00:04:08.790> new<00:04:09.000> ways<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.270> help<00:04:09.810> the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
technology and find new ways to help the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.020 
technology and find new ways to help the
athlete<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.380> perform<00:04:10.739> better<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.520> we<00:04:11.640> do<00:04:11.790> by

athlete to perform better but we do by
the<00:04:12.090> way<00:04:12.300> have<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:13.550> innovations<00:04:14.550> team<00:04:14.760> that

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
the way have a innovations team that

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.240 
the way have a innovations team that
takes<00:04:15.090> care<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.130> going

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
takes care of that and and that is going

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.159 
takes care of that and and that is going
to<00:04:17.310> influence<00:04:17.459> also<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.120> future<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.989> in

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
to influence also the future but in

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.420 
to influence also the future but in
reality<00:04:19.350> you're<00:04:19.739> looking<00:04:19.950> at<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.130> future

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
we felt we want to make to sort of

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.590 
we felt we want to make to sort of
portray<00:05:15.460> exactly<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.180> you<00:05:16.390> know<00:05:16.480> the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
passion of the joy and the fun that goes

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.760 
passion of the joy and the fun that goes
into<00:05:19.000> football<00:05:19.420> and<00:05:19.690> therefore<00:05:20.380> we've<00:05:20.590> picked

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
into football and therefore we've picked

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.650 
into football and therefore we've picked
these<00:05:20.890> two<00:05:20.950> colours<00:05:21.400> Romney's<00:05:22.240> food<00:05:22.510> a

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
these two colours Romney's food a

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.660 
these two colours Romney's food a
technology<00:05:23.320> which<00:05:23.560> is<00:05:23.740> hidden<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.520> those

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
technology which is hidden in those

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.760 
technology which is hidden in those
shoes<00:05:24.970> with<00:05:25.360> these<00:05:25.510> shoes<00:05:25.870> which<00:05:26.260> is<00:05:26.380> evil

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
shoes with these shoes which is evil

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.450 
shoes with these shoes which is evil
power<00:05:27.010> technology<00:05:27.820> we<00:05:28.510> wanted<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:28.930> explore

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
power technology we wanted to explore

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.910 
power technology we wanted to explore
barefoot<00:05:30.460> kicking<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.410> if<00:05:32.410> we<00:05:32.590> look<00:05:32.740> at<00:05:32.830> the

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
barefoot kicking and if we look at the

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.670 
barefoot kicking and if we look at the
tooling<00:05:33.340> it<00:05:33.490> has<00:05:33.790> a<00:05:34.270> spine<00:05:34.990> running<00:05:35.440> through

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
tooling it has a spine running through

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.610 
tooling it has a spine running through
and<00:05:36.090> very<00:05:37.090> high<00:05:37.270> level<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.690> flexibility<00:05:38.320> in

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
and very high level of flexibility in

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.840 
and very high level of flexibility in
both<00:05:39.130> ways<00:05:39.520> for<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:40.420> plate<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:41.830> therefore<00:05:42.310> you

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
both ways for the plate so therefore you

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.880 
both ways for the plate so therefore you
really<00:05:43.270> sort<00:05:43.540> of<00:05:43.600> mimic<00:05:44.110> their<00:05:44.380> foot<00:05:44.620> kicking

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
really sort of mimic their foot kicking

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.240 
really sort of mimic their foot kicking
which<00:05:45.700> optimizes<00:05:46.360> power<00:05:47.230> but<00:05:47.950> they

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
which optimizes power but they

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.510 
which optimizes power but they
nevertheless<00:05:48.520> they<00:05:49.030> seem<00:05:49.480> to<00:05:49.630> be<00:05:50.080> also<00:05:50.520> having

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
nevertheless they seem to be also having

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.630 
nevertheless they seem to be also having
a<00:05:52.000> certain<00:05:52.510> control<00:05:53.050> here<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:53.740> that's<00:05:54.160> part

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
a certain control here and that's part

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.130 
a certain control here and that's part
of<00:05:54.730> the<00:05:54.910> shoe<00:05:55.120> that's<00:05:55.480> right<00:05:55.690> there's<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.960> high

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
of the shoe that's right there's a high

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.800 
of the shoe that's right there's a high
level<00:05:56.410> of<00:05:56.560> stability<00:05:56.800> on<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:58.180> lateral<00:05:58.510> side

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
level of stability on the lateral side

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.920 
level of stability on the lateral side
and<00:05:59.200> the<00:06:00.160> upper<00:06:00.400> material<00:06:00.550> is<00:06:01.060> flexible<00:06:01.660> in<00:06:01.840> a

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
and the upper material is flexible in a

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.500 
and the upper material is flexible in a
horizontal<00:06:02.170> right<00:06:02.680> and<00:06:03.010> therefore<00:06:03.640> you<00:06:04.420> know

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
horizontal right and therefore you know

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.410 
horizontal right and therefore you know
this<00:06:04.660> again<00:06:05.260> sort<00:06:05.650> of<00:06:05.680> enables<00:06:06.370> you<00:06:06.520> to<00:06:06.550> have<00:06:07.030> a

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
this again sort of enables you to have a

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.440 
this again sort of enables you to have a
higher<00:06:07.870> level<00:06:07.900> of<00:06:08.380> control<00:06:09.370> or<00:06:09.610> accuracy<00:06:10.210> as

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
higher level of control or accuracy as

higher level of control or accuracy as
well<00:06:11.020> as<00:06:11.140> power<00:06:11.380> what's<00:06:11.950> really<00:06:12.250> important<00:06:12.610> is

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
well as power what's really important is

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.860 
well as power what's really important is
also<00:06:13.030> the<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:14.050> foam<00:06:14.710> that's<00:06:15.070> applied<00:06:15.630> at<00:06:16.630> the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
also the the foam that's applied at the

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.830 
also the the foam that's applied at the
bent<00:06:17.080> of<00:06:17.290> the<00:06:17.410> shoe<00:06:17.640> and<00:06:18.640> at<00:06:19.090> the<00:06:19.420> moment<00:06:19.750> of

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
bent of the shoe and at the moment of

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.350 
bent of the shoe and at the moment of
impact<00:06:20.080> it<00:06:20.650> has<00:06:21.220> a<00:06:21.250> very<00:06:21.520> good<00:06:21.670> distribution

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
impact it has a very good distribution

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.660 
impact it has a very good distribution
of<00:06:22.480> force<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:23.170> therefore<00:06:24.160> they're<00:06:24.370> all<00:06:24.460> media

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
of force and therefore they're all media

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.190 
of force and therefore they're all media
strike<00:06:25.000> you<00:06:25.240> have<00:06:25.360> a<00:06:25.390> very<00:06:25.660> high<00:06:25.810> level<00:06:26.020> of

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
strike you have a very high level of

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.020 
strike you have a very high level of
accuracy<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.920> really<00:06:27.340> gives<00:06:27.490> a<00:06:27.610> player<00:06:27.820> an
