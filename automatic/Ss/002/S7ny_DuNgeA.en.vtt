00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.400 
doing here you're gonna want to rotate
around<00:00:25.029> the<00:00:25.210> middle<00:00:25.419> of<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.540> map<00:00:25.720> and<00:00:26.230> keep

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
around the middle of the map and keep

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.049 
around the middle of the map and keep
alternating<00:00:27.009> between<00:00:27.160> these<00:00:27.489> two<00:00:27.640> alleyways

00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:28.059 
alternating between these two alleyways

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:29.370 
alternating between these two alleyways
and<00:00:28.210> you're<00:00:28.300> gonna<00:00:28.390> pick<00:00:28.660> up<00:00:28.809> a<00:00:28.930> lot<00:00:29.079> of<00:00:29.169> people

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
and you're gonna pick up a lot of people

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.810 
and you're gonna pick up a lot of people
running<00:00:29.619> in<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:29.919> out<00:00:30.040> of<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.160> alleyways<00:00:30.579> such

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
running in and out of the alleyways such

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.240 
running in and out of the alleyways such
as<00:00:30.969> you<00:00:31.090> see<00:00:31.119> here<00:00:31.599> it's<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.559> really<00:00:32.800> big<00:00:32.950> spawn

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
as you see here it's a really big spawn

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.310 
as you see here it's a really big spawn
point<00:00:33.520> where<00:00:33.700> I'm<00:00:33.790> at<00:00:33.910> right<00:00:34.210> now<00:00:34.270> in<00:00:34.899> that

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
point where I'm at right now in that

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.750 
point where I'm at right now in that
back<00:00:35.530> left<00:00:35.800> corner<00:00:35.950> back<00:00:36.219> there<00:00:36.430> that's<00:00:36.579> where

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
back left corner back there that's where

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.130 
back left corner back there that's where
they<00:00:36.879> spawn<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.180> lot<00:00:37.450> of<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.630> time<00:00:37.840> if<00:00:38.020> your

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
they spawn a lot of the time if your

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.600 
they spawn a lot of the time if your
team's<00:00:38.380> on<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.620> other<00:00:38.770> side<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.220> map<00:00:39.400> so

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
team's on the other side of the map so

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.550 
team's on the other side of the map so
rotating<00:00:40.210> back<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.570> forth<00:00:40.810> between<00:00:41.260> the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
rotating back and forth between the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.230 
rotating back and forth between the
hillside<00:00:41.950> and<00:00:41.980> this<00:00:42.280> side<00:00:42.490> is<00:00:42.640> very<00:00:42.730> useful

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
hillside and this side is very useful

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.510 
hillside and this side is very useful
tip<00:00:43.960> number<00:00:44.140> two<00:00:44.410> don't<00:00:45.070> hang<00:00:45.220> around<00:00:45.310> the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
tip number two don't hang around the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.190 
tip number two don't hang around the
spawn<00:00:45.790> points<00:00:46.180> for<00:00:46.300> too<00:00:46.450> long<00:00:46.660> you<00:00:46.840> see<00:00:47.050> me

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
spawn points for too long you see me

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.590 
spawn points for too long you see me
sort<00:00:47.470> of<00:00:47.530> backing<00:00:47.770> up<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.340> not<00:00:49.210> really

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
sort of backing up and not really

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.180 
sort of backing up and not really
pushing<00:00:50.020> their<00:00:50.170> spawns<00:00:50.470> to<00:00:50.710> aggressively

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
pushing their spawns to aggressively

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.069 
pushing their spawns to aggressively
like<00:00:51.430> laying<00:00:51.700> down<00:00:51.940> laying<00:00:52.570> down<00:00:52.810> watching

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
like laying down laying down watching

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.200 
like laying down laying down watching
the<00:00:53.290> alleyways<00:00:53.620> such<00:00:53.829> as<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.250> am<00:00:54.400> here<00:00:54.760> because

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
the alleyways such as I am here because

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.210 
the alleyways such as I am here because
if<00:00:55.989> you<00:00:56.050> hang<00:00:56.290> around<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.590> spawns<00:00:56.860> for<00:00:57.070> too

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
if you hang around the spawns for too

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.010 
if you hang around the spawns for too
long<00:00:57.399> they're<00:00:58.149> gonna<00:00:58.239> smart<00:00:58.660> up<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:58.930> they're
