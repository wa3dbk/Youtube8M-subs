are<00:02:15.490> those<00:02:15.640> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.240> work<00:02:16.420> together<00:02:16.600> yes<00:02:17.350> so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
are those going to work together yes so

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.750 
are those going to work together yes so
we<00:02:17.650> think<00:02:17.830> about<00:02:17.950> place<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.250> small<00:02:18.310> stars

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
we think about place a small stars

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.090 
we think about place a small stars
basically<00:02:19.180> as<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.330> platform<00:02:19.840> agnostic<00:02:20.230> game<00:02:20.770> so

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
basically as a platform agnostic game so

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.040 
basically as a platform agnostic game so
it's<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.910> game<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.210> you<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.360> play<00:02:22.480> on<00:02:22.990> your

a<00:03:03.940> health<00:03:04.120> bar<00:03:05.130> instead<00:03:06.130> what<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.459> do<00:03:06.580> is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
a health bar instead what you do is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.340 
a health bar instead what you do is
while<00:03:06.910> you're<00:03:07.060> fighting<00:03:07.330> you're<00:03:08.050> constantly

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
while you're fighting you're constantly

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.199 
while you're fighting you're constantly
building<00:03:08.590> up<00:03:08.770> this<00:03:08.860> energy<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.520> you<00:03:09.910> use<00:03:10.060> this

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
building up this energy and you use this

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.790 
building up this energy and you use this
energy<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.750> perform<00:03:10.840> super<00:03:11.350> attack<00:03:11.530> super

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
energy to perform super attack super

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.990 
energy to perform super attack super
attack<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.130> actually<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.430> only<00:03:12.550> way<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.820> can

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
attack so actually the only way you can

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.759 
attack so actually the only way you can
kill<00:03:13.239> opponents<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.780> game<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.140> killing

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
kill opponents in the game and killing

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.810 
kill opponents in the game and killing
opponents<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.280> way<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.580> score

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
opponents is the way that you score

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.340 
opponents is the way that you score
points<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.480> whoever<00:03:16.840> has<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.170> highest

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
points and whoever has the highest

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.660 
points and whoever has the highest
number<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.769> points<00:03:17.920> at<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.160> end<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.519> match

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
number of points at the end of the match

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.550 
number of points at the end of the match
wins<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.750> little<00:03:20.019> different<00:03:20.200> there's

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
wins it's a little different there's

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.660 
wins it's a little different there's
perhaps<00:03:20.709> an<00:03:20.950> extra<00:03:21.250> layer<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.489> abstraction

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
perhaps an extra layer of abstraction

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.180 
perhaps an extra layer of abstraction
from<00:03:22.660> your<00:03:22.840> traditional<00:03:23.230> fighting<00:03:23.470> game<00:03:23.739> but

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
from your traditional fighting game but

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.530 
from your traditional fighting game but
we<00:03:24.640> really<00:03:24.880> like<00:03:25.030> what<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.299> did<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.450> the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
we really like what it did to the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.759 
we really like what it did to the
gameplay<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:26.260> something<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.530> we

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
gameplay and it's something that we

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.690 
gameplay and it's something that we
think<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.010> kind<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.370> new<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.580> interesting

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700
