it it just feels nice but i'll wait i
will<00:02:28.920> wait<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:30.380> tomorrow<00:02:31.380> I'll<00:02:31.740> wear<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
will wait and tomorrow I'll wear it a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.660 
will wait and tomorrow I'll wear it a
little<00:02:32.400> longer<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.800> maybe<00:02:34.800> cinch<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.490> up<00:02:35.550> a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
little longer and maybe cinch it up a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.740 
little longer and maybe cinch it up a
little<00:02:35.790> more<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.710> I<00:02:37.710> was<00:02:37.950> afraid<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.750> getting

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
little more and I was afraid of getting

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.890 
little more and I was afraid of getting
the<00:02:39.870> 22<00:02:40.440> because<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:42.000> seemed<00:02:42.690> like

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the 22 because it just it seemed like

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.080 
the 22 because it just it seemed like
that<00:02:43.740> was<00:02:43.800> kind<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.250> pushing<00:02:44.460> it<00:02:44.700> because<00:02:44.880> my

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
that was kind of pushing it because my

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.320 
that was kind of pushing it because my
natural<00:02:45.450> measurements<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.350> 28<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.460> it

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
natural measurements like I'm 28 and it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.010 
natural measurements like I'm 28 and it
says<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.530> good<00:02:50.100> for<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:51.720> your

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
says that this is good for if your

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.250 
says that this is good for if your
natural<00:02:52.590> measurement<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:53.210> 26<00:02:54.210> or<00:02:54.360> 27<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.200> you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
natural measurement is 26 or 27 so you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.410 
natural measurement is 26 or 27 so you
know<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.530> know<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.920> pushing<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.270> think

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
know I know it's pushing it but I think

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.830 
know I know it's pushing it but I think
it's<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.900> be<00:02:58.050> okay<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.650> mean<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.840> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
it's going to be okay I mean because and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.760 
it's going to be okay I mean because and
I<00:03:01.710> got<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.100> feel<00:03:02.460> so<00:03:02.730> good<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.470> much

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.550 
I got it feel so good this is so much
nicer<00:03:04.830> than<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.390> other<00:03:06.510> thing<00:03:06.780> um<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.690> I'm

you<00:03:30.480> know<00:03:30.750> there<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.320> guess<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.160> rule<00:03:32.310> of

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
you know there I guess that the rule of

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.940 
you know there I guess that the rule of
thumb<00:03:32.640> with<00:03:33.060> some<00:03:33.300> corset<00:03:34.080> company<00:03:34.230> seems<00:03:34.739> to

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
thumb with some corset company seems to

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.460 
thumb with some corset company seems to
be<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:36.300> service<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.810> great<00:03:36.989> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
be that if the service is great the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.760 
be that if the service is great the
corsets<00:03:37.920> probably<00:03:38.340> aren't<00:03:40.370> if<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.670> services

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
corsets probably aren't if the services

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.670 
corsets probably aren't if the services
has<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.800> few<00:03:44.100> challenges<00:03:44.310> then<00:03:45.270> okay<00:03:46.110> you're
