 directly directs us to a page that 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.780
 this new one we want but it 's that good 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.640
 we have a very important thing here that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.680
 they are the good skins that are assigned to us 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.260
 once every three days and they are thrown 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.030
 free roulette roulette then 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.800
 we can touch all these things in the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.490
 good roulette we go to the mess that the one who is 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.410
 this page is free we can see 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.060
 clearly money with our inventory 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.880
 that is here is the option of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 inventory we can get him 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.520
 whatever skin we have we do 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.520
 click click click click 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.810
 we put skins and so we can 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.130
 add money to our counter but 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.350
 that's not mandatory to use because 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.200
 we have is free pins every three 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.120
 days we can also invite friends 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.300
 I'm going to leave my friends link below that 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.240
 it costs us nothing I do not think it costs you 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.149
 something log in under my name 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.450
 and that generates a free spin also 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.549
 once a week as you remember good 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.500
 we also have a market that with the 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.210
 money that we earn on this page 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.329
 we can exchange it in the market that 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.150
 they have about 17 bots as you are seeing 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.920
 with skins and we can redeem them 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.830
 selecting and changing if we have 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.620
 good money let's explain the game 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.800
 now if you have any doubt by the way 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.090
 we have support and the terms and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 conditions of the page but good 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.630
 we go to the games the first game is the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.950
 roulette to the roulette that we have in the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.170
 counter the typical roulette that is to give and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.900
 starts spinning and works with bonus 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.030
 speed or money put the minimum bet 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.330
 they are 5 cents and the prizes are these 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.330
 from here double shot that is to say throws us two 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.690
 Sometimes we put 5 cents 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.010
 play here and shoot again twice 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.690
 can play double the amount bet 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.459
 we can select the money that 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.890
 we want to bet and if we get double 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.940
 from the side, as you will already be 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.010
 imagining 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.890
 they will double us the bet if they are five 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.680
 cents will return us better 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.900
 that what is expected are that they return what 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.360
 we have bet more half that is to say 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.730
 I got it once and they gave me back 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.120
 88 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.159
 because the accumulation of the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.230
 half of 5 is two and a half 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.019
 this round times 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.400
 so I spent it and spent 5 cents and I 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.760
 3 were left 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.440
 5 out of 8 that is 5 - is equal to 3 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.000
 masisa 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.000
 we also have the jumpiness that is 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.390
 return to throw away nation that is nothing 15 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.390
 good spirits that is thrown 15 times 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.220
 this same here everything all these is what 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.190
 same is to say 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.950
 the good spins where I put it is to say 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.320
 this one and I think there's no more then 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.510
 they are free of charge in plan we are 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.790
 put in the auto spin for free 15 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.960
 times and you throw ping ping ping ping all 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.330
 with the balance that we had bet 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.720
 a cow can also touch us 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.390
 knife a m 4 and the jackpot that the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.610
 jackpot in currently are 900 euros in 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.490
 skins that varies all the time 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.860
 well they can also touch us in the 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.330
 multipliers as we call me that is 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.010
 that is, multiply what we have 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.110
 bet we are five cents 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.580
 can not multiply with by two as already 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:10.780
 I explained before or by 30 20 50 100 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.880
 even or all of this because it's not your 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.730
 probability and to play as the thing 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.859
 is to spend a good spin and put it here 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.859
 one more to this and give him to play 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.370
 I do not know what happened here but good and 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.000
 supposedly you have to touch something 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.700
 You see how you see I was touched 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.760
 I have touched this almost I have a cow 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.190
 by the way my eyes go up 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.480
 to the forehead almost but I was not 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.640
 understanding what happens but good 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.500
 they have touched this as you see they have returned 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.750
 the money and I have added half of 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.750
 the xii we restart the page 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.350
 you see we have 11 cents here and it 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.539
 I have saved the bonus I do not understand 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.680
 what but good has been a book of the 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.139
 page I suppose 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.440
 this totally sure this this is 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:06.169
 proven it has been open for a long time and 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:10.190
 well let's go back to give it twice 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.509
 even that is to say auto spin twice and 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.590
 it turns us we are worth a good skin 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.310
 before I guess it was a bug 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.000
 now he's going to touch the nothing and he 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.200
 throw again good 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.090
 ok we are subtracted another 5 cents 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.010
 and to see that it touches us can not touch us 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.320
 something incredible look at this look 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.550
 this almost touched the knife but 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.360
 good a dollar with 56 this this like 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.610
 you see what we can exchange all this what 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.500
 I'm recording and as you can see, it's real and 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.180
 all this can also be invested in 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.050
 skins ie let's go to the market now 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.270
 same 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.120
 as it says none and I can select 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.060
 for example this gun and they 're going to 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.060
 give if I give a brown 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.790
 they return it to me I do not want to take the 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.500
 time money and good indeed we 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.440
 our one that has touched us here 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.969
 we also have a live screen of this 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.849
 it's a live screen 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.189
 and then what else do we have a lot more 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.019
 we have I do not know if they come out well and around here and 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:19.879
 we also have the last two games 

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:21.949
 that are what I call bingo not 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:25.699
 this means that you choose the tickets 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:29.540
 that you want to buy here at the price of 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:32.240
 20 cents let's say and then 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.910
 are bought when you buy them 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.280
 when I fill this up I guess it 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.410
 100 euros raffled good will be raffled 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.580
 100 dollars and 100 dollars on skis 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.920
 and whoever wins them then takes 100 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.990
 dollars here eye not in esteem here in 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.610
 your account and they can be exchanged for 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.159
 skills and also you have the option d 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.740
 of bingo equal but with a prize of 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.530
 300 that here we have more expensive tickets and 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.169
 cheaper and then with this we can 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.150
 conclude the mini tutorial this I leave you
