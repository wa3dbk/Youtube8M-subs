00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.280
 theme of today's lesson reversal 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.769
 extreme right position itself 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.000
 an incident 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.810
 drive all his car and wants 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.869
 turn around on the road from 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.180
 rightmost row 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.580
 behind the blue car is a bus and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.769
 as much as possible limits visibility 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.449
 roads 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.280
 despite this blue car 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:38.589
 starts turning practical dark 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.940
 the driver of the red car moves in 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.330
 in the same direction 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.500
 far right food standing bus 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.400
 closes the blue car approaching 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.100
 to the bus 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.400
 red car offends him by 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.000
 to the extreme left really catching up with 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.699
 bus he sees unfolding 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.729
 blue car brakes 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.640
 but late red car practically 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.720
 not extinguishing speed beats blue 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.670
 car to port 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.799
 what do the rules of the road say 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.189
 on this occasion 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.579
 point 85 before turning the driver 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.119
 obliged to take an extreme early 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:28.960
 position on the roadway 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.280
 point 8 8 if when turning out 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.049
 intersection width of the carriageway 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.929
 not enough to maneuver 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.789
 from the extreme left of his 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.109
 allowed to produce 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:46.749
 from the right edge of the carriageway while 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:51.240
 the driver must give way to the passing 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:53.850
 and oncoming vehicles 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.310
 our comment 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 the driver of the blue car has a bouquet 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.759
 violations in the first place was quite enough 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.679
 to turn from the leftmost row on 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.470
 old when turning 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:12.160
 to skip, we not only counter 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.190
 passing transport and thirdly it is impossible 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.320
 perform no maneuvers 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.940
 have a blind spot on the road 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.000
 driver in a red car 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.630
 standing bus completely closes 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.170
 review that did not allow him on time 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:36.480
 see the danger our recommendations 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.060
 performing any mana and more so 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.910
 difficult as a turnaround driver should 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.040
 make sure it is safe that is 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.860
 make sure that it does not create interference 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.820
 traffic in all directions 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.920
 and for this you need to have a position 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:58.020
 allowing you to view all the way to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.870
 both directions to driver red 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.510
 the car does not need to fly on the road 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.270
 besides him there are other drivers not 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.790
 always discipline 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.980
 speed of 60 kilometers per hour 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.980
 allowed settlements
