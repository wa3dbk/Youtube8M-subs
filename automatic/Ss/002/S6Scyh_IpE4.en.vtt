 battiston of mastercard manager 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.890
 general in Italy but because we are with 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.439
 her we're talking about us Technology 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.880
 here to announce the launch to the market 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.740
 of a new service developed by 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.410
 cariparma in collaboration with 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.390
 mastercard and cartasi 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.699
 is called for smart and is a solution 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.580
 to make payments by phone 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.920
 very good cell phone I have one in my hand 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.159
 in reality it is a rechargeable card if 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.960
 no mistake contactless that can be 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.699
 glued on the back of virtually every 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.790
 correct mobile phone 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.540
 exact is a very simple solution and 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.210
 if we want smart because practically 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.820
 this this small sticker incorporates 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.830
 a new generation card 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.320
 contactless that can be used 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.420
 among tens of thousands of merchants 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.330
 that in Italy already laccetto nor that 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.090
 will be more and more in the coming years 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.630
 and with this card it is possible to do 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.340
 payments quickly and easily 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.570
 can be applied on the back of a 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.450
 phone on a phone of course 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.710
 quail only the central piece 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.920
 see from here this is the size 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.140
 of the dark part sticks onto the 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.390
 phone network and then you can 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.219
 pay with a single gesture approaching the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.999
 phone these new terminals 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.460
 generation 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.810
 if the amount of the imperia payment 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.130
 of 25 euros is not even necessary 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.899
 enter the pin 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.539
 in this way payment is much more 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.880
 fast for the fastest merchant for the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.909
 consumer the phone always remains 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.080
 in his hand there is no risk of 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.200
 lose it 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.730
 but instead, it also happens with 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.620
 the cards that are sometimes forgotten 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.170
 if I were a masochist I could not 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.420
 also stick to the arm absolutely 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.090
 you can stick it on anything and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.040
 made the smart element of this 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.470
 solution that works 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.960
 let's say with any object though 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.030
 looking at the world of mobile payments 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.160
 it works with any phone then 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.370
 of new old generation with 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.230
 any operating system of any 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.020
 so there is a telephone operator 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.390
 solution that can afford and already today 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.750
 to let the Italians experience 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.300
 this type of exact payments will speak 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.190
 of NFC technology that's behind in 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.110
 this card and above all of how in 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.170
 future intends to implement this network 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.740
 technology or this payment 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.480
 contactless with milk a feces gene that is 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.500
 already present in many exact cell phones 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.690
 then the nfc technology is the same 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.780
 type of technology that uses this 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.239
 card the terminals that are installed 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.670
 the weight of the exhibitors is the same nfc 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.160
 or tell her knows 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.739
 we are doing so many pilot projects 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.370
 together with banks and telephone operators 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.620
 in order to allow virtualization 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.910
 a card inside the phone 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.730
 inside the sim which is an element 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.530
 sure with these phones you can 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.180
 obviously not just having a card but 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.739
 have more than one consumer 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.720
 you can choose those from time to time 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.480
 can use or can also 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.230
 virtualize for example i 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.730
 season tickets and tickets 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.220
 subway 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.560
 these types of solutions are being developed 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.190
 perfecting is a little bit more 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.590
 complex require telephones 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.100
 specific nfc and specific sim 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.930
 they will see their say entry on 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.739
 market points I'm trading in the course 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.049
 next year 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.480
 technically excellent because this is 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.910
 disconnected from the npc phone and I can't 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.010
 use the unplugged phone nfc 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.819
 by the operator disconnected from the sim are 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.010
 safety issues 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:59.470
 yes because today the safe element in which 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.310
 go and memorize a card of 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.650
 credit 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.940
 the most widespread from conquest of 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.829
 technology is still the sim 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.900
 of the telephone operator 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.180
 so these are the solutions that a 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.510
 today they are available then in the future yes 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.220
 will see 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.220
 what time it promises 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.590
 in the context of in the course of 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.480
 next year we will see some projects 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.480
 commercial please thank you
