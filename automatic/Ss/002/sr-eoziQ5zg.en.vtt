00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.280
 today's question when you talk to other people 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.679
 eat or go to other people 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.750
 Home invited are then works 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.490
 also with the high k blofeld vegan 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.250
 Nutrition or you have to do your things 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.230
 bring your own as it looks like 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.580
 can you ever talk to people at one 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.080
 sitting in a different diet 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.750
 for example, eating meat and so on 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.189
 does that work so i mean that works 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.670
 you fight or sit now 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:36.180
 next to banana and tell you so 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.550
 so first term heiko 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.450
 paeth vegan diet which means 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 that means carbohydrate-rich often 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 low fat vegan pure herbal 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.190
 Nutrition that means I feed on 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.920
 plant as they grow out of the ground 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 yes of unprocessed plants 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.730
 mainly here at home when i go for 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.789
 I cook for myself again 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.199
 oil 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:06.290
 who is not invited to other people 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.090
 I am usually always on top of that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.119
 a little less oil so for me 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.950
 who cool and if you still 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 could completely cook as a free and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.490
 for others then add salt yet 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.290
 Much better, yes, they always have something 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.509
 for me at home or I have something to me 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.890
 bring with it so that I 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.259
 So hey hesse 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.710
 staple rice noodles 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.530
 potatoes couple flakes of muesli fruit 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.619
 Everyone actually has something for me 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.659
 because those are things that everyone is like that 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.170
 in certain quantities , of course, is more 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.700
 from that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.979
 So I have to let you know in advance 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 finally say so if I'm there 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.040
 so that you would come home then 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.290
 It makes sense if you tell me that about 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 report four times the amount of a 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.320
 could the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.850
 the others eat so if that works and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.250
 usually at the table is always 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.110
 the talk topic so not even 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.799
 why are no animal products with you 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.800
 on the plate 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.130
 that becomes a by-thing as soon as the people 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.790
 See how much I eat so at the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:26.819
 normal citizen sitting on the plate like this 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:28.530
 so meat potatoes and vegetables 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.290
 with me on the plate looks like this 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.440
 meat down quadruple amount 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.739
 potatoes on and a little bit more 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.010
 Vegetables and that's why people ask 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.390
 In general already why you can so many 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.970
 eat carbohydrates I thought 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.530
 Carbohydrates make you fat and then start 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.250
 stop the discussion or 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.959
 it starts that I hold myself 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.940
 must explain if others ask me 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.680
 otherwise if no question hears me 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.380
 already know as I of course 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.480
 not so me yes so I urge others 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.209
 I do not think so 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.829
 only stress and rhede against a wall 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.200
 in the people do not know that 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:12.180
 I just wanted to sleep okay 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.590
 if others ask why are you then 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.600
 not fat front how does it work 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.609
 why do you have so much energy? 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.000
 Do you do so much sport for that? 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.440
 then I explain the whole 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.109
 and ultimately that ends in a whole 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.290
 cool conversation so and there comes a 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.760
 theme why so why I feel so 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.139
 I like it when I'm with others 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.239
 is synonymous if the older part 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.310
 I have no problem with that at all 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.109
 It does not happen that often , but me 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.980
 I already have in my circle 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.209
 eat meat 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.980
 definitely and if that inspires 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.079
 from me then I'm really happy 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.760
 and if it is not then it is not 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.200
 So I mean I have just that too 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.870
 had time in my life where i am 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.790
 thought you will never become vegan 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.450
 or you are never a vegetarian if I am 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.519
 never vegetarian but then thought 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.170
 No, that's not for you because I am 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.579
 maybe that did not know and 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.109
 because at the time I am in mine 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.629
 life has fit so why should i 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.390
 condemn other people 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.859
 for me, rubbish is like that and I want 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.390
 do not save it now either 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.280
 any illnesses or something 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.919
 Of course it is hard to see and you 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.840
 Of course you also see what's up 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.650
 his plate death what diseases the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.139
 has vidic thats how thin you look 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.120
 already more so than the normal one 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.470
 man is not concerned with the topic 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.919
 nutrition and nutrients 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:38.220
 but it makes no sense now synonymous 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.750
 wanting to save people because they are not 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.520
 yes the genes want to be saved 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.199
 that they do everything right and 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.710
 because everyone else know this makes it 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.949
 even so and that's why he is better if 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.570
 you instead of being the lifeboat anymore 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:57.180
 that's what you're supposed to be then that 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.520
 radiant example is the total amount 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.070
 energy, the is super slim it 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.320
 For years no longer at the doctor was there 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.720
 no coffee brown and every meal 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.430
 damn it can eat so much 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.430
 he is tired and not thickens 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:18.090
 that is what people want because they are 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.710
 want to think yourself oha that has me 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.960
 Yes, I made the step 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.060
 all alone I was inspired 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.000
 let and become vegan who want 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.440
 not be drawn but want 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.440
 say I was that 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.690
 point of this video actually generated 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.730
 I have as a normal vegan 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.900
 so to speak, because if you are nutrient 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.290
 cut through the plant world 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.330
 would 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.710
 for unit most often 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.520
 staple occurrences 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.280
 who does not protein very little fat so 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.010
 that 's just like the plant world 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.480
 life is built and therefore find 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.950
 I everywhere because everyone is one 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.950
 planting a certain share
