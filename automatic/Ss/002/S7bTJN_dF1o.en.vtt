00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
is actually more significant in terms of

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.300 
is actually more significant in terms of
what<00:02:00.109> actually<00:02:00.439> did<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.829> French<00:02:01.069> for<00:02:01.280> the

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
family at that time what is even more

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.410 
family at that time what is even more
interesting<00:02:03.859> though<00:02:04.639> is<00:02:04.819> that<00:02:04.969> there<00:02:05.270> was

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
interesting though is that there was

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.779 
interesting though is that there was
actually<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.899> conspiracy<00:02:06.499> theory<00:02:07.039> about<00:02:07.249> this

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
actually a conspiracy theory about this

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.210 
actually a conspiracy theory about this
about<00:02:07.939> who<00:02:08.240> organized<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.530> it's<00:02:09.979> all

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
about who organized it and it's all

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.190 
about who organized it and it's all
based<00:02:10.490> around<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.910> guy<00:02:11.090> called<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:11.690> flee<00:02:12.020> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
2nd Duke of Orleans as being somehow

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.250 
2nd Duke of Orleans as being somehow
responsible<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.550> event<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.260> basically

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
responsible for the event and basically

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.680 
responsible for the event and basically
the<00:02:18.620> theaters<00:02:18.980> ago<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.670> he<00:02:19.850> was<00:02:20.000> behind<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the theaters ago that he was behind the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.900 
the theaters ago that he was behind the
scenes<00:02:20.959> he<00:02:21.200> was<00:02:21.319> manipulating<00:02:22.100> events<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
scenes he was manipulating events and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.790 
scenes he was manipulating events and
that<00:02:23.030> he<00:02:23.210> saw<00:02:23.480> himself<00:02:23.690> as<00:02:24.110> being<00:02:24.470> a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
that he saw himself as being a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.650 
that he saw himself as being a
replacement<00:02:25.730> for<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:25.970> king<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.570> he

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
replacement for the king and he

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.559 
replacement for the king and he
certainly<00:02:26.930> did<00:02:27.110> have<00:02:27.320> a

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
certainly did have a

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.280 
certainly did have a
lot<00:02:27.719> of<00:02:27.870> support<00:02:28.349> he<00:02:29.010> was<00:02:29.219> in<00:02:29.340> favor<00:02:29.609> of

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
lot of support he was in favor of

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.869 
lot of support he was in favor of
constitutional<00:02:31.290> monarchy<00:02:32.129> something<00:02:32.760> that

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
constitutional monarchy something that

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.479 
constitutional monarchy something that
differed<00:02:33.269> from<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:34.040> present<00:02:35.040> monarchy<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
differed from the present monarchy and

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.429 
differed from the present monarchy and
it<00:02:35.579> was<00:02:35.670> good<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:35.939> guess<00:02:36.389> almost<00:02:36.659> a<00:02:36.989> halfway

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
it was good I guess almost a halfway

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.369 
it was good I guess almost a halfway
house<00:02:37.650> between<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.370> full<00:02:38.609> out<00:02:39.079> democracy<00:02:40.079> the

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
house between the full out democracy the

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.270 
house between the full out democracy the
Republic<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.310> France<00:02:41.579> became<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
Republic that France became and the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.770 
Republic that France became and the
constitute<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.329> monarchy<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.599> had

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
constitute the monarchy that it had

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.660 
constitute the monarchy that it had
previously<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:46.500> give<00:02:46.769> us<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.920> constitutional

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
previously so give us a constitutional

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.369 
previously so give us a constitutional
monarchy<00:02:47.819> something<00:02:48.689> along<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.019> lines<00:02:49.170> is

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
monarchy something along the lines is

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.959 
monarchy something along the lines is
later<00:02:49.590> developed<00:02:50.099> in<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.340> United<00:02:50.609> Kingdom

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:50.969 
later developed in the United Kingdom

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.209 
later developed in the United Kingdom
now<00:02:51.840> do<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.170> wanna<00:02:52.349> stress<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.859> is<00:02:52.920> only

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:53.219 
now do you wanna stress this is only

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.520 
now do you wanna stress this is only
conjecture<00:02:53.519> obviously<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.480> have<00:02:54.959> absolutely

going to see in game I am getting really
excited<00:03:12.150> as<00:03:12.989> always<00:03:13.439> there's<00:03:13.650> speculation

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
excited as always there's speculation

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.970 
excited as always there's speculation
and<00:03:14.689> speculation<00:03:15.689> about<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.870> word<00:03:16.139> unity<00:03:16.680> has

and speculation about the word unity has

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.349 
and speculation about the word unity has
been<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.730> Templars<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.180> the

Brotherhood of gonna unite but doesn't

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.399 
Brotherhood of gonna unite but doesn't
seem<00:03:21.000> anything<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.480> back<00:03:21.659> that<00:03:21.719> up<00:03:21.900> if<00:03:22.319> you

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
seem anything to back that up if you

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.869 
seem anything to back that up if you
look<00:03:22.530> at<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.650> posters<00:03:23.159> on<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.280> wall<00:03:23.519> here<00:03:23.730> we

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
look at the posters on the wall here we

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.240 
look at the posters on the wall here we
can<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.269> how<00:03:24.480> well<00:03:24.659> it<00:03:24.689> matches<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.590> poster

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
can see how well it matches the poster

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.670 
can see how well it matches the poster
from<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.579> French<00:03:26.819> Revolution<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.719> think<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
from the French Revolution I think the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.259 
from the French Revolution I think the
only<00:03:28.799> thing<00:03:28.889> we<00:03:29.129> can<00:03:29.250> really<00:03:29.310> infer<00:03:29.879> from<00:03:29.909> this

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
only thing we can really infer from this

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.210 
only thing we can really infer from this
is<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.689> our<00:03:30.870> assassin<00:03:31.319> is<00:03:31.530> going<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.889> be<00:03:32.009> on

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
is that our assassin is going to be on

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.119 
is that our assassin is going to be on
the<00:03:32.370> side<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:33.209> Revolutionists<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.199> one

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
the side of the Revolutionists a one

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.490 
the side of the Revolutionists a one
little<00:03:35.430> thing<00:03:35.579> of<00:03:35.729> note<00:03:35.939> is<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.269> we<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.349> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
little thing of note is that we have the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.089 
little thing of note is that we have the

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
good couple of centuries before this and
