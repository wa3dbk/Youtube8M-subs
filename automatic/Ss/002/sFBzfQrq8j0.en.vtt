let's try it out yeah man doesn't and

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:36.410 
let's try it out yeah man doesn't and
then<00:03:26.700> reseat<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.680> screw<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.209> go<00:03:36.360> you

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
then reseat the screw there you go you

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.990 
then reseat the screw there you go you
can<00:03:36.690> adjust<00:03:37.110> this<00:03:37.890> clip<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.489> once<00:03:38.670> it's<00:03:38.850> on

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
spotting out further that 160 lumens is

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.650 
spotting out further that 160 lumens is
gonna<00:03:46.260> come<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.620> handy<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:48.150> want<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.420> spot

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
out further so there's a couple of modes

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
out further so there's a couple of modes
there<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.910> main<00:03:54.090> mode<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:54.900> brightness<00:03:55.290> so

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
there is the main mode for brightness so

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.580 
there is the main mode for brightness so
that's<00:03:56.220> one<00:03:56.459> press<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.780> can<00:03:57.810> press<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.530> hold
