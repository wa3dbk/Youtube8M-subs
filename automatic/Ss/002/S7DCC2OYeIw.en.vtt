 mario i'm living well because thanks to the direction of the spice kick 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.449
 Operative heroes who 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.859
 I gave myself the opportunity to take this soccer school course 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.380
 and above all them 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.919
 sclera 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.380
 mauro bravo piero alberici 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.230
 I'm allowed here 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.940
 to talk to boy 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.960
 and to speak first extras 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.100
 because it would also now be in a cell 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.120
 e4 made alallero per day is not easy 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.890
 more with overcrowding and everything 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.180
 it's difficult 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.460
 we are many uncertain 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.750
 ver there are not 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.750
 many problems both economic and 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.420
 temperamentally too many Italian immigrants mixed up there are like-minded 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.269
 motorcycle that if nothing else 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.450
 so much text together there is always confusion 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.769
 instead it was 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.469
 pea mauro bravo and piero alberi they succeeded with their course to put 25 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.700
 heads 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.280
 of any nationality 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.540
 and let us follow the rules for the first time 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.990
 playing soccer for the first time that was not easy 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.969
 we are people who have followed the rules we say 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.969
 and they have succeeded, I have even had fun 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.190
 nice extra torrent 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.280
 3 I had to make a first-person appeal 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.090
 to the state anyone what can I do to improve the lives of prisoners 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.860
 good question could do so many things 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.470
 meanwhile many things 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.550
 many prisoners work at low salaries 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.960
 lower salaries 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.030
 I have to say thank you really 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.150
 then the director bg 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 I have known a very person for a very long time 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.540
 and help to prisoners 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.409
 for done. at the prison having these courses makes us follow these courses 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.640
 to politics especially now that we talk about justice 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.069
 I would like to say or to open new prisons to raise overcrowding 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.129
 I would say an amnesty 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.449
 to get us all off 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.449
 because many prisoners are in jail that they are 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.870
 excuse the word sorry for the show of the unfortunates 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.419
 sumo lake are not criminals on the wall 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.829
 little things miller 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.699
 and they shouldn't even star 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.629
 they are people who 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.249
 I have lived two 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.279
 two prison moments from the 90s now 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.769
 now there's just a bit of despair in the prison 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.879
 furtarello script of the cooperative 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.339
 euro take two years for a theft to have it so 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.370
 so there are twenty on the crowd 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.199
 I would say 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.909
 also for magistrates 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.909
 to evaluate the various crimes 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.050
 because they are the football of you fill up safe 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.100
 just flock for nothing and to say the state of 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:12.339
 of salary to send funds for the prison 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:13.950
 to give more salary 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.499
 weapons to prisoners who work in it 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.900
 because there are many economic problems, not all prisoners do the interviews 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.449
 and many inmates and for this reason also who they are 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.939
 konoha bad humor in the cell because maybe there's no food 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.419
 to see what he eats he arrives at the talk there is packages bye love hello 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.779
 the daughter 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.879
 then the bad moods grow 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.419
 and chris cole problems 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.789
 you heard about suicides and suicide attempts and text 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:45.629
 if you decide to reno 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.419
 not seen many 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.829
 however also 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.609
 eheheh lately 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.249
 we screamed from the cell peru guys from outside the EU to let the kids go 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.589
 agents that you 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.199
 is climbing 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.650
 to lift it sure the various the neck rope 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.439
 all these are problems 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.959
 unexpected maybe the day before they laugh and joke then suddenly or 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.439
 during the night I don't know they have their thoughts and their problems get up 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.439
 in the morning they get suicidal 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.060
 that's why there are too many problems in prison 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.599
 and they are people who should not be in prison 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:26.130
 it would be better to make the law as we spoke now I don't know if it exists ono 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.370
 propose people should not even in between football and maybe we should go 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.080
 directly in the community 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.010
 and I really want to die out of prison 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.599
 because I really am 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:36.879
 to say 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.860
 I'm ashamed of being in jail 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.729
 what a shame for how things are working 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.940
 once nights I don't want now 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.290
 tap speeches 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.379
 prison 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.750
 but sometimes jails 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.720
 - made by criminals, let's say now about facts to despair 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.230
 from people who should never have thought about site employees who steal like I have you 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.689
 said first a cheese a ham a cone 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:04.129
 and I take 1 2 3 years from uncensored do not come out of the possibility and these 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.050
 detainees 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.439
 then they come out angry 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.289
 they come out even more angry 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.019
 and then they no longer know how to do it because I have left prison many times 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.530
 however it is not easy to find a job, I have brought many job questions but you 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.310
 ask for precedents not to notice you find black baldini even a little 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.979
 tapped 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.669
 it's not easy 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.669
 I can afford because they took you 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.520
 but now for now 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.120
 uploaded for a signature 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.689
 they stopped me for now for drugs 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:41.669
 we say by smuggling or there was nothing concrete about the first few precedents 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.800
 according to them, who knows what 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.830
 from a simple movie taken 4 years 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.580
 from the simple film oko really took 4 years 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.670
 but the 3-year pardon of the first offense arrived 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.040
 but the revocation of the conditional of 18 years ago arrived 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.680
 goodbye bucchi esto kindly to the judge 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.689
 since 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.069
 it is not easy now to say it here in front of the toro television 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.490
 it will be because sometimes it seems that we are on their side are on the other 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.520
 judges part 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.789
 but I have many power prisoners 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.009
 they say they are innocent "they are innocent" so many say and then 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.430
 they did it offense I've never been in a bill center ato 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.480
 but it has always been enlarged even more 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.369
 I always brought my own 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.889
 but no one committed it a judge has ever wanted what dates of evidence 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:31.240
 to say 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.810
 go and see the cameras if at that time 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.770
 when I said of the carabinieri carola I was really the 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.659
 it says with accused of state that the camera has to say that I was sure of myself 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.259
 not only but go and see and so it happens to many other prisoners 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.000
 mint 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.800
 many magistrates do not rely on what winter says 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.939
 the inmate let's say what goes on trial 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:56.490
 they are based only a little on the previous ones 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.490
 I have only on the report of the carabinieri 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:03.639
 the carabinieri are the state 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:08.400
 however, the good and the bad exist from all sides we are appreciating people 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.089
 human 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:10.349
 and you have to understand it
