some of the reasons that you're doing
this<00:04:07.000> there<00:04:08.000> are<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.239> couple<00:04:08.449> of<00:04:08.720> reasons<00:04:08.930> why

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
this there are a couple of reasons why

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.530 
this there are a couple of reasons why
we<00:04:09.319> do<00:04:09.739> this<00:04:09.949> first<00:04:10.639> reason<00:04:11.120> is<00:04:11.269> that

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
we do this first reason is that

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.749 
we do this first reason is that
shortened<00:04:12.019> time<00:04:12.439> in<00:04:12.799> the<00:04:13.040> final<00:04:13.459> cooking

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:13.759 
shortened time in the final cooking

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:17.319 
shortened time in the final cooking
process<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:15.259> do<00:04:15.409> this<00:04:15.680> choose<00:04:16.579> an<00:04:16.820> ingredient

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
process to do this choose an ingredient

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.409 
process to do this choose an ingredient
that<00:04:17.419> longer<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.440> cook<00:04:18.680> than<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.669> rest<00:04:19.940> of<00:04:20.120> the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
that longer to cook than the rest of the

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.810 
that longer to cook than the rest of the
other<00:04:20.599> ingredients<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.409> your<00:04:21.739> dish<00:04:21.820> for

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
other ingredients in your dish for

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.120 
other ingredients in your dish for
example<00:04:23.300> if<00:04:24.080> you're<00:04:24.259> cooking<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.770> piece<00:04:24.949> of

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
example if you're cooking a piece of

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.490 
example if you're cooking a piece of
broccoli<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:26.590> carrots

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
broccoli and carrots

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.100 
broccoli and carrots
we<00:04:28.560> would<00:04:28.800> choose<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:30.210> plant<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.690> carrot

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
we would choose to plant the carrot

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.110 
we would choose to plant the carrot
first<00:04:31.320> because<00:04:32.010> it's<00:04:32.280> more<00:04:32.550> dense<00:04:32.820> and

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
first because it's more dense and

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.710 
first because it's more dense and
heavier<00:04:33.630> than<00:04:33.990> broccoli<00:04:35.030> second<00:04:36.030> reason<00:04:36.330> is

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
heavier than broccoli second reason is

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.110 
heavier than broccoli second reason is
the<00:04:37.410> color<00:04:37.890> of<00:04:38.010> product<00:04:38.640> will<00:04:38.760> be<00:04:38.880> more

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the color of product will be more

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.840 
the color of product will be more
vibrant<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.900> have<00:04:40.620> more<00:04:40.890> crunchy<00:04:41.460> texture

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
vibrant and have more crunchy texture

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.650 
vibrant and have more crunchy texture
for<00:04:42.780> example<00:04:42.810> if<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.920> plan<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.190> Peapod<00:04:44.790> become

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
for example if you plan to Peapod become

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.470 
for example if you plan to Peapod become
brighter<00:04:45.960> green
