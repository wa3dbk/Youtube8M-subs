00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.279
 hello i am a classic the player of 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.140
 dream 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.509
 I already had many of the sega islands 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.970
 in those old days but since the 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.279
 sonic has moved to three of his games if 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.379
 transformed garbage including those 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.260
 sonic adventure games that 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.540
 everybody see talking I hate almost 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.820
 all the modern games of sonic parei 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.129
 to play their games for a long time 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.949
 which one day I found in the old master 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.170
 system and miraculously 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.090
 working perfectly when I tried 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.250
 my final game tape of the day 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.590
 however when I put my sonic 2 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.300
 Unfortunately it did not work so I went 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.530
 look for this game in all stores 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.270
 possible 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.280
 after hours of searching finally 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.530
 I found the cartridge and a store that sells 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.560
 games used for a very cheap price 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.390
 very lucky I did not buy the cartridge and went 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.759
 running to my house to play 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.200
 my beautiful master system everything was 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.210
 perfectly normal 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.550
 I was playing and having a lot of fun. 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.979
 and my nostalgic trip in history 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.320
 This game we have is kidnapped and head 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.869
 sonic rescue him from the evil in turn the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.390
 time if you find all the best 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.290
 chaos you save athens and get to the end 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.470
 scored 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.200
 but if you get on the scramble ect stage 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.840
 without it you will simply fight against 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.509
 the sonic metal and have will be given as 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.700
 dead since credits shows sonic 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.979
 rabbit by some planets until he 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.049
 to the end and look at the sky and a 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.570
 photo of text is seen with the word 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.430
 underneath it i'll be the game being 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.869
 izmailov in chaos because he was with 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.520
 tendency to look for them 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.290
 everything was normal until the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.420
 sony credits that was apparently 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.189
 crying while running through the planet 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.630
 he looked very sad and there was 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.640
 tears in your eyes 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.369
 after the text image appeared in the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.409
 sky the game returned to the screen of the mowing logo 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.840
 At the beginning of the game I was waiting 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.269
 the title screen looks like but when it 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.519
 finally appeared I was totally 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.410
 favor of sony quitenhos were in 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.690
 title screen but was made 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.400
 completely gray and my holes 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.860
 black instead of your eyes 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.880
 he looked like a zombie I hit start 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.040
 I started the game more 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.080
 once more to my surprise at 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.970
 image showing sony what god who 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.960
 usually appears before you start 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.240
 some phase 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.010
 God was not there only the sony that 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.050
 was inside the mining cart 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.120
 photo of the first phase and when the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.550
 first act began the sonic one more 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.560
 time I was crying like the credits but 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.540
 The difference is that I could control 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.940
 usually when I got to one of the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.190
 places where there was originally the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.110
 chaos there was nothing there I had not 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.560
 choose not to finish the level without 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.600
 she 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.240
 the third act of the first phase there 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.890
 He was also the head of the insect robot 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.720
 tongs from your head 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.300
 at this time he could no longer control 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.550
 the sonic he just jumped on the boss 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.190
 and to my surprise was cut the law 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.170
 by their pincers then froze on 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.850
 a black screen and I had to initial 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.950
 when the title screen appeared 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.640
 again we will be gray as a 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.770
 zombie 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.240
 but the sonic was different he did not 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.250
 had facial expression 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.170
 his eyes were completely white 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.940
 and he also had no mouth in that 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.750
 Now I knew it was the game. 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.700
 hacked 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.400
 but I started to play again 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.380
 so after pressing the start button on the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.390
 the title screen until it cut to the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.250
 black background and the image showing 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.890
 before the first phase there was no longer any 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.110
 No one's even sonic, my God. 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.850
 finally decided to turn off the game to 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.280
 screen completely black again 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.480
 and a text in red blood appeared 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.480
 in the middle with the acronym
