00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
getting a section through this from and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.510 
getting a section through this from and
this<00:01:15.209> is<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.450> gonna<00:01:15.600> split<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.020> into<00:01:16.109> three

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
this is all gonna split it into three

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.980 
this is all gonna split it into three
and<00:01:17.520> we're<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.819> to<00:01:17.880> loosely<00:01:18.090> plat<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.719> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and we're going to loosely plat that to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.599 
and we're going to loosely plat that to
join<00:01:19.139> into<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.679> area<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.069> we're<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.369> back

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609
