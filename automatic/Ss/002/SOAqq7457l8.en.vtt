00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 all the people as you are today we are 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.819
 here with the lord here nature that for 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 that does not know what it is let's say it's a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.870
 program that has a high rate of 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 plurality of guess what 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.580
 character are you thinking I do not know 3 am 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.670
 too much I am somewhat skeptical with this not 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.500
 I believe that this guesses in the person 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.750
 in which I'm thinking is worth this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.480
 will ask a series of questions and circle 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.550
 guess so I'm saying one thing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.349
 yes already the divine the person to the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.619
 that I'm thinking I'm reading a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.619
 bridge 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.580
 so I 'll do quentin let's go we've 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.970
 endowed with still for objects and today 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:44.450
 this forgetfulness forgot so is the chair worth 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.850
 that is a little palenque character 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.620
 I can think for I do not know why but I 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.590
 has come to the head of the child are home 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.460
 do not ask why but it's called 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.460
 mccully col king 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.579
 I think I want here not all divine 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.579
 what am I thinking in public here like this 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.990
 that we go to all alone 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.360
 Mr. Dry Pere, let's go there, your character 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.570
 sincerely if your character is very 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.950
 close this bricoking frame lately 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.670
 he does not call me so he is not a character 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.430
 that is part of the world of the song 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.200
 I think mccurry calquÃ­n no 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.710
 it has nothing to do with the song let's go 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.710
 submitted to the rapper I did not want her 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.630
 his character owes his fame internet not the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.700
 background of your character is related 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.119
 with the world of football not his character 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.119
 she is a woman 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.720
 it costs you a little 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.470
 if your character is an actor 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.310
 if your character is Mexican public 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.310
 Mexican 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:06.580
 your character for editing but if your 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.580
 character of everything 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.899
 is bald 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.990
 because the sky looks a piece of his 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.070
 character is over 40 years old 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.820
 It has 33 public and only child 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.920
 case is 33 years old we get older 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.500
 yes remember your character act more 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.850
 beyond television I think it's not 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.510
 so I do not know much either they would have 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.510
 alcohol and any 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.640
 now this man voice actor 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.170
 his character has acted in some 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.170
 movie of the saga 'twilight' 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.050
 his character is more than 30 years old if his 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.330
 character saw it 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.330
 marcolli cal who his person 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.920
 line channel characters jolie me 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.900
 was going to say the pgje is helping neither 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.750
 in leonor di caprio ni a sprout is a 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.630
 superhero of marvel comics not his 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.710
 character is very muscular mccully cold 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.680
 king 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.160
 rather the truth is famous above all 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.160
 as a child 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.110
 be careful, I think this 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.360
 question is already very influential vale 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.180
 because michael and carole king highlighted 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.580
 like in the movie just at home 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.130
 we go to a rich kid and he went famous 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.570
 especially for her time as a child if her 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.140
 character debuted at the cinema while still 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.830
 a child and if his character I have to see 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.830
 with magic 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.590
 his character has gained bad reputation 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.020
 yes because having more fame let's say more 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.260
 cool and culkin was a child prodigy of the 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.180
 acting and then done to the drug and 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.209
 that the truth that reverberated a lot in his 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.930
 image I think it is not good shape 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.930
 wins a lot of truth 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.200
 the mother who gave birth 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.200
 there are two daughters that the divine 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:34.370
 to me it is worth to me retirement what said the gentleman 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.650
 here born is the fucking the fucking master I'm going to 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.650
 have to pull over a bridge 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.230
 two 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.000
 it has worked for me I 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.979
 could look for a more elaborate character 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.210
 but I found that cooler and culkin already 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:58.539
 he was not a very character in the world of 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.780
 now the truth but do not see 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.590
 Nothing has to meet the challenge 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.590
 soon you will see me 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.700
 with her she died 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.700
 that's well know the spikes 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.530
 for me to sleep
