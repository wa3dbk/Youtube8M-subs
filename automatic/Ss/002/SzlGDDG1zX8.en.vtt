this<00:00:17.190> we're<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> add<00:00:17.789> layers<00:00:18.150> different

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
this we're going to add layers different

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.429 
this we're going to add layers different
layers<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.230> ice<00:00:19.380> caps<00:00:19.740> icebergs<00:00:21.289> alright<00:00:22.289> so

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
layers of ice caps icebergs alright so

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.880 
layers of ice caps icebergs alright so
let's<00:00:22.619> begin<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:24.350> went<00:00:25.350> ahead<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.560> spread<00:00:25.830> my

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
let's begin I went ahead and spread my

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.990 
let's begin I went ahead and spread my
colors<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> sheet<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.420> white<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.900> blue

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000

colors on the sheet just white and blue
now<00:00:30.000> I'm<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.390> creating<00:00:30.599> an<00:00:30.990> iceberg<00:00:33.710> all

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
now I'm just creating an iceberg all

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.870 
now I'm just creating an iceberg all
right<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.520> so

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.330 

okay<00:00:40.880> and<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.200> see<00:00:42.350> by<00:00:42.530> tapping<00:00:42.980> on<00:00:43.130> at

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
okay and so see by tapping on at

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.000 
okay and so see by tapping on at
different<00:00:43.790> times<00:00:44.380> you<00:00:45.380> create<00:00:45.620> different

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
different times you create different

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.070 
different times you create different
textures<00:00:46.460> that's<00:00:47.180> why<00:00:47.390> I<00:00:47.420> go<00:00:47.600> back<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.020> forth

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
textures that's why I go back and forth

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.580 
textures that's why I go back and forth
on<00:00:48.440> it<00:00:49.660> all<00:00:50.660> right<00:00:50.930> this<00:00:51.080> is<00:00:51.140> going<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.410> be<00:00:51.500> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.100 

icebergs<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.190> different<00:01:24.580> places<00:01:24.820> i<00:01:25.240> believe

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
icebergs in different places i believe

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.740 
icebergs in different places i believe
our<00:01:26.200> placement<00:01:26.619> warm<00:01:26.770> here<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:28.509> how<00:01:28.600> that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
our placement warm here see how that

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.930 
our placement warm here see how that
gives<00:01:28.869> me<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.080> same<00:01:29.229> effect<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.759> one

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
gives me the same effect is the the one
