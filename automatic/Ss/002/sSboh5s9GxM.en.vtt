to<00:00:21.279> the<00:00:22.000> natural<00:00:22.540> gemstone<00:00:23.050> itself<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.700> an

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
to the natural gemstone itself it is an

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.589 
to the natural gemstone itself it is an
iron<00:00:25.180> oxide<00:00:25.509> and<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:30.340> color<00:00:30.579> of<00:00:31.029> the

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
iron oxide and the the color of the

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.560 
iron oxide and the the color of the
natural<00:00:31.869> version<00:00:32.410> of<00:00:32.680> this<00:00:32.829> is<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:34.360> it's

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
natural version of this is when it's

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.720 
natural version of this is when it's
ground<00:00:34.899> up<00:00:35.079> into<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.350> powder<00:00:35.620> it<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:36.399> actually

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
ground up into a powder it is actually

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.140 
ground up into a powder it is actually
red<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.950> got<00:00:39.100> its<00:00:39.280> name<00:00:39.460> from<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:40.000> word

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
red so it got its name from the word

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.450 
red so it got its name from the word
Hemi<00:00:40.630> which<00:00:40.990> is<00:00:41.170> for<00:00:41.410> blood<00:00:41.680> so<00:00:42.010> it's<00:00:42.130> a<00:00:42.220> blood

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
Hemi which is for blood so it's a blood

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.840 
Hemi which is for blood so it's a blood
red<00:00:42.760> when<00:00:43.060> you<00:00:43.300> grind<00:00:43.930> it<00:00:44.080> up<00:00:44.200> into<00:00:44.380> a<00:00:44.500> powder<00:00:44.850> a
