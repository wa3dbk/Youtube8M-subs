 we will learn with you 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.410
 make beautiful slide shows 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.910

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.160

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.869
 as hard as it seems well, let 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.670
 let's see what sliders can do 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:40.890
 this is the main page slider here 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:43.090
 you can change the width, you can change its type 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.670
 that is, the pictures will change 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.790
 you can put the inscription in different ways 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.490
 you can put the sidebar on the left to the right without 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.010
 inscriptions in general can do it 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.190
 do the kind of accordion check and since we 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.950
 we will do this for a start we need 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.180
 customize our sliders for this to us 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.520
 need to open 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.399
 less acute king which is called 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.649
 slide show and see what kinds 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.200

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.590
 what is the name of the posts that will be 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.030
 the slider will be clickable and the names 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.560
 portfolio portfolio sections here on 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.899
 this site is not new to someone 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.020
 there are four kinds of useful here 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.450
 the slider is not his slider rotator 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.650
 accordion slider and sliders they are funk 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.460
 he has a lot of slider here 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.549
 setting 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.890
 here are two kinds of it and you can embed 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.570
 not only the main home page 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.830
 or rather, anywhere in the site 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.850
 here it is important for us to install 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.159
 select the height of the slider and how it will be 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 change pictures you can 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.570
 experiment with any of these 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.220
 functions the number of column segments and 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.090
 so on here i'm especially nothing 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.880
 I touch if you do not understand 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.469
 English menu can be switched 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.719
 google chrome browsers translate to 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.350
 Russian you can set transparency 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.780
 transparency strips labeled and also 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.670
 in each kind of slider here too 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.899
 set the height and so on the amount 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.780
 segments to be rotated 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.640
 on let's now see how we are 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.160
 we will actually add ours 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.410
 slideshow to add 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.590

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.830
 homepage category is set 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.459
 the main thing is that we need to have some 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.319
 category and pictures and refer specifically to 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.040
 then you can give it a name 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.950
 This pro and 2 slider and he will 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.360
 appear in the right place 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.090
 to add a picture you need to click 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.890
