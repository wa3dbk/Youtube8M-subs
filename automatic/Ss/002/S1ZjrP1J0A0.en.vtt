00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.590
 I will make coffee today on two cups 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.739
 so will need about 30 grams 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.920
 coffee should always be used fresh 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.920
 grinding 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 grinding for the Turks, we will be like flour 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 it will almost not be felt 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.010
 on the fingers now need to pour coffee 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.739
 water we need a temperature of about 93 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.899
 degrees pour slow thin 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.260
 first trickle a bit and mix 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.539
 how would we prepare coffee stir 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.900

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.710
 hit the water in about 30 seconds we wait 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.119
 and after that we add volume 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.150
 always fill up to the narrowest part 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.159
 our firebox while we can prepare 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.930
 vanilla for this coffee is best 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.090
 use vanilla string because 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.610
 that you are not to blame vanilla sugar will not give 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.560
 you exactly the fragrance to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.200
 pull vanilla called us sticks 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.869
 you need to cut it and inside you will see 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.870
 such black grains that we like 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.950
 since such need 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.420
 and just send it to Turku I twist 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.690

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.920
 coffee as it were, I help him 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.260
 brewing help extraction 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.730
 we have the right coffee 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.850
 warmed up and begin to add 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.460
 ingredients take cane sugar i 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.230
 add a little somewhere and a half tea 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.780
 spoons 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:00.220
 some ground cinnamon somewhere 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.900
 spoon cinnamon will give us vigor and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.660
 the most important and most probably 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.820
 suddenly it's a little salt and u need 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.500
 we are quite a bit 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.700
 after that we need to mix it all up 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.680
 neatly here it is very important not to break 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.400
 this pillow which was created during 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.070
 brewing 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.300
 so quietly drop the spoon and 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.870
 we start to mix 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.900
 so that all the spices go inside and 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.780
 continued to brew with coffee 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.330
 gently pull out the spoon we 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.490
 keep stirring the coffee giving it 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.140
 motion 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.150
 he starts breathing already it means that 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.400
 it's time to shoot and after that we have it 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.350
 I strolled a bit as it were, as a 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.900
 call it just because i'm trying it 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.599
 cool with such movements and further 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.340
 put it on the stove 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.530
 again the same thing about three times 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:04.290
 so that we have coffee tight 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:10.460
 thick final walk a little bit 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:13.190
 heat up all last breath and 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.140
 give a little while to stand while he stands on 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.460
 heat our dishes 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.560
 always remember for hot drinks 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.390
 need hot to do because from 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.000
 temperature variable taste will always be 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.890
 get worse 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.140
 for this kind of coffee you can still serve 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.770
 use cinnamon sticks laying 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.830
 cups and pouring coffee directly 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.310
 coffee is ready for them and it's time to pour it 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.310
 on the cup 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.799
 do it carefully to thicker 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.510
 stayed inside our coffee is ready he 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.129
 turned out to be very correct on it 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.859
 warbler is very important for coffee 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:56.030
 Oriental and he has a scent for me 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:58.280
 cinnamon attack coffee spicy and it is for sure 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.319
