and<00:00:03.389> today<00:00:03.600> we<00:00:03.840> are<00:00:03.990> back<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:04.350> spin<00:00:04.650> tires<00:00:04.890> with

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
and today we are back in spin tires with

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.860 
and today we are back in spin tires with
a<00:00:05.930> Camaro<00:00:06.930> zl1<00:00:07.429> now<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.059> obviously<00:00:09.570> not

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
a Camaro zl1 now this is obviously not

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.450 
a Camaro zl1 now this is obviously not
something<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.410> would<00:00:10.500> normally<00:00:10.920> see<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.160> spin

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
something you would normally see in spin

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.070 
something you would normally see in spin
tires<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:11.849> well<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> take<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.450> back<00:00:12.599> it's<00:00:12.960> not

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
tires but well I take that back it's not

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.600 
tires but well I take that back it's not
exactly<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> zl1<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.009> doesn't<00:00:14.190> have<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> zl1

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
exactly the zl1 it doesn't have the zl1

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.640 
exactly the zl1 it doesn't have the zl1
badging<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.420> grille<00:00:15.690> or<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> side<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.560> it

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
badging on the grille or the side but it

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.390 
badging on the grille or the side but it
does<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:18.000> cowl<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.779> mean<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.710> is

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
does have it on the cowl so I mean it is

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
does have it on the cowl so I mean it is
kind<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.119> zl1<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.810> kind<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.080> isn't

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
kind of a zl1 and it kind of isn't

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.929 
kind of a zl1 and it kind of isn't
really<00:00:22.500> what<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.220> Camaro<00:00:23.519> body

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
really what it is is it's a Camaro body

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.140 
really what it is is it's a Camaro body
with<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.140> performance<00:00:25.980> file<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.789> kind<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
with a performance file just kind of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.820 
with a performance file just kind of
slapped<00:00:27.480> onto<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.470> not<00:00:28.590> really

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
slapped onto it so it's not really

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.230 
slapped onto it so it's not really
representative<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.460> any<00:00:29.580> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.849> realistic

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
representative of any kind of realistic

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.799 
representative of any kind of realistic
camaro<00:00:30.720> performance<00:00:31.460> but<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.510> one

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
camaro performance but you do have one

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.930 
camaro performance but you do have one
option<00:00:34.079> then<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.100> customization<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:35.760> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
option then for customization that's it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.880 
option then for customization that's it
you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.180> switch<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> wheels<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.559> stock

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you can switch the wheels to the stock

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.459 
you can switch the wheels to the stock
zl1<00:00:38.309> wheels<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.960> switch<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.290> back<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
zl1 wheels or you can switch it back to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.959 
zl1 wheels or you can switch it back to
these<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.129> actually<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.610> going<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.790> stick<00:00:41.940> with

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
these I actually I'm going to stick with

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.010 
these I actually I'm going to stick with
these<00:00:42.120> because<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.600> look<00:00:42.629> kind<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
these because I think they look kind of

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.220 
these because I think they look kind of
cool<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.579> are<00:00:44.700> but

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
cool just kind of for what they are but

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.569 
cool just kind of for what they are but
we're<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.530> how<00:00:46.680> something<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> was

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
we're gonna see how something that was

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.600 
we're gonna see how something that was
never<00:00:48.239> meant<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.020> spin<00:00:49.350> tires<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.920> even

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
never meant to be in spin tires or even

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.889 
never meant to be in spin tires or even
something<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> likes<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:51.750> never

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
something the likes of which was never

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.970 
something the likes of which was never
meant<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.289> spin<00:00:52.500> tires<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
meant to be in spin tires we're going to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.130 
meant to be in spin tires we're going to
see<00:00:53.100> how<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.610> works<00:00:54.030> now

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
see how it actually works now

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.299 
see how it actually works now
right<00:00:55.649> off<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> bat<00:00:55.920> I've<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
right off the bat I've got the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.330 
right off the bat I've got the
differential<00:00:56.820> locked<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.559> it's<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.859> mean<00:00:59.070> it's

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
differential locked and it's I mean it's

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
differential locked and it's I mean it's
you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.390> tell<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.079> its<00:01:01.170> comfort

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you can tell it's not in its comfort

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.650 
you can tell it's not in its comfort
zone<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.010> gets<00:01:02.640> mud<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.000> over<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.359> immediately

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
zone it gets mud all over it immediately

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.870 
zone it gets mud all over it immediately
and<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.049> only<00:01:04.199> has<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.470> damage<00:01:05.309> point<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and it only has one damage point as you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
and it only has one damage point as you
can<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.170> look<00:01:07.320> at

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
can see right there when you look at

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.039 
can see right there when you look at
damage<00:01:07.530> zero<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:09.960> I've

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
damage zero out of one and what I've

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.270 
damage zero out of one and what I've
found<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:10.439> about<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.770> thing<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> it's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
found out about this thing is that it's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.789 
found out about this thing is that it's
really<00:01:11.729> hard<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.119> damage<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.680> do

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
really hard to damage it but if you do

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.700 
really hard to damage it but if you do
damage<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.250> you're<00:01:14.820> done<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.240> dead<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
damage it you're done it's dead so I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
damage it you're done it's dead so I
haven't<00:01:16.979> actually<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.400> tested<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.270> for

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
haven't actually I tested it out for

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.060 
haven't actually I tested it out for
maybe<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.259> minutes<00:01:19.590> before<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
maybe I don't know two minutes before I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
maybe I don't know two minutes before I
started<00:01:20.310> recording<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.780> thing

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
started recording this and the thing

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.370 
started recording this and the thing
about<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.740> slammed<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.790> into<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.380> mud

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
about it was I slammed it into like mud

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.499 
about it was I slammed it into like mud
banks<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.130> stuff<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.330> weird

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
banks and stuff like that and the weird

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.999 
banks and stuff like that and the weird
thing<00:01:27.570> about<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.320> didn't<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.680> damaged

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
thing about it was it didn't get damaged

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.170 
thing about it was it didn't get damaged
so<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
so I don't know what kind of the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450 
so I don't know what kind of the
threshold<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:30.900> damages<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.710> thing<00:01:31.920> but

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
threshold for damages on this thing but

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.950 
threshold for damages on this thing but
I'm<00:01:32.579> assuming<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.299> due<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.750> it's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I'm assuming that due to that it's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.560 
I'm assuming that due to that it's
actually<00:01:34.350> pretty<00:01:34.590> high<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.570> considering

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
actually pretty high and considering

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.420 
actually pretty high and considering
what<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.680> bad<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> mud

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
what it is it's not bad in the mud

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.670 
what it is it's not bad in the mud
either<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.939> actually<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> pretty<00:01:40.590> much

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
either it actually kind of pretty much

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.450 
either it actually kind of pretty much
tore<00:01:41.040> its<00:01:41.220> way<00:01:41.369> through<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> mud<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:42.060> here

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
tore its way through the mud up here

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.499 
tore its way through the mud up here
ahead<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.520> me<00:01:44.700> at<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.909> little<00:01:45.090> stretch<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
ahead of me at this little stretch this

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.580 
ahead of me at this little stretch this
is<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.720> same<00:01:45.869> stretch<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.229> took<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.470> down

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
is the same stretch that took it down

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
is the same stretch that took it down
when<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.340> testing<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.820> before<00:01:48.030> recording

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
when I was testing it before recording

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.080 
when I was testing it before recording
and<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.500> funny<00:01:49.740> thing<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.399> there

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and the funny thing about it was there

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.870 
and the funny thing about it was there
there<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.540> no<00:01:52.070> there<00:01:53.070> was<00:01:53.189> no<00:01:53.310> hesitation<00:01:53.460> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
there was no there was no hesitation it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
there was no there was no hesitation it
kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.090> drove<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.680> like<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> u-az

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
kind of drove like a like a u-az

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.950 
kind of drove like a like a u-az
might've<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.299> weird<00:01:57.479> thing<00:01:57.540> about<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
might've and the weird thing about it is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
might've and the weird thing about it is
that<00:01:58.079> even<00:01:58.170> though<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.619> got<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> only

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that even though it's got like the only

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.090 
that even though it's got like the only
option<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.659> diff<00:02:00.930> lock<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:01.469> thinking<00:02:01.920> it's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
option is diff lock I'm thinking it's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.620 
option is diff lock I'm thinking it's
got<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.460> wheel<00:02:02.610> drive<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:02.909> all<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> time

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
got all wheel drive on all the time

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.569 
got all wheel drive on all the time
which<00:02:03.840> again<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.320> why<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.070> nowhere<00:02:05.369> close

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
which again is why this is nowhere close

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.740 
which again is why this is nowhere close
to<00:02:05.610> being<00:02:05.729> representative<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.390> an<00:02:06.509> actual

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
to being representative of an actual

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.359 
to being representative of an actual
Camaro<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> nice<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> have

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
Camaro but it is kind of nice to have

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.110 
Camaro but it is kind of nice to have
that<00:02:08.640> body<00:02:09.289> just<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.319> body<00:02:10.560> style<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.310> just

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that body just the body style and just

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.220 
that body just the body style and just
to<00:02:12.180> kind<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.390> also<00:02:12.629> be<00:02:12.750> able<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.959> say<00:02:13.080> that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
to kind of also be able to say that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.880 
to kind of also be able to say that
you've<00:02:13.319> monitor<00:02:13.650> come

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you've monitor come

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
you've monitor come
to<00:02:14.190> spintires<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:14.880> actually<00:02:15.210> kind<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.450> cool

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
to spintires it's actually kind of cool

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900 
to spintires it's actually kind of cool
but<00:02:16.230> as<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:16.800> see<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.070> slam<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.580> right

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
but as you can see just slam it right

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.720 
but as you can see just slam it right
into<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.240> mud<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:19.560> actually<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.400> is

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
into the mud and it actually it is

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.100 
into the mud and it actually it is
pulling<00:02:21.090> from<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.330> front<00:02:21.540> end<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> front

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
pulling from the front end the front

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.480 
pulling from the front end the front
wheels<00:02:22.260> are<00:02:22.410> turning<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.160> all-wheel

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
wheels are turning so it is all-wheel

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.730 
wheels are turning so it is all-wheel
drive<00:02:23.730> all<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> time<00:02:24.000> then<00:02:24.960> all<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.530> do

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
drive all the time then all you can do

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.110 
drive all the time then all you can do
really<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.250> toggle<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.610> diff<00:02:26.730> lock<00:02:26.910> on

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
really is just toggle the diff lock on

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.390 
really is just toggle the diff lock on
and<00:02:27.210> off<00:02:27.330> which<00:02:27.510> helps<00:02:27.810> quite<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> bit<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and off which helps quite a bit but I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.110 
and off which helps quite a bit but I
mean<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:29.910> pulling<00:02:30.240> itself<00:02:30.570> through<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.810> mud

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
mean it's pulling itself through the mud

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.400 
mean it's pulling itself through the mud
impressively<00:02:33.120> well<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:37.020> gets<00:02:37.140> us<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
impressively well it gets us to the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.540 
impressively well it gets us to the
other<00:02:37.530> side<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.740> mean<00:02:38.070> it's<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.280> you're<00:02:38.430> good

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
other side I mean it's like you're good

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.930 
other side I mean it's like you're good
to<00:02:38.640> go

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
to go

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.390 
to go
the<00:02:39.500> wheels<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.680> tires<00:02:40.860> are<00:02:41.070> absolutely

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
the wheels and tires are absolutely

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.030 
the wheels and tires are absolutely
covered<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.150> coated<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.720> mud<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
covered and coated in mud and the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.590 
covered and coated in mud and the
interior<00:02:44.459> cam<00:02:44.640> doesn't<00:02:44.910> really<00:02:45.120> work<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.420> does

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
interior cam doesn't really work it does

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.890 
interior cam doesn't really work it does
that<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.790> yeah<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.030> mean<00:02:48.209> unless<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.690> want<00:02:48.840> to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that so yeah I mean unless you want to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.240 
that so yeah I mean unless you want to
look<00:02:49.080> at<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.350> steering<00:02:49.680> wheel<00:02:49.860> like

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
look at this steering wheel like

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.949 
look at this steering wheel like
directly<00:02:50.730> down<00:02:50.970> at<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.360> steering<00:02:51.570> wheel<00:02:51.810> and

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
directly down at the steering wheel and

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.590 
directly down at the steering wheel and
the<00:02:52.050> shifter<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> don't<00:02:54.120> really

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
the shifter then I don't really

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.330 
the shifter then I don't really
recommend<00:02:54.959> using<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.590> because<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:56.130> not

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
recommend using it because it's not

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.130 
recommend using it because it's not
really<00:02:56.640> going<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.820> help<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.270> any<00:02:57.390> real<00:02:58.110> way

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
really going to help you in any real way

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.570 
really going to help you in any real way
shape<00:02:58.770> or<00:02:58.920> form<00:03:00.739> but<00:03:01.739> as<00:03:01.860> far<00:03:02.070> as<00:03:02.100> off-road

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
shape or form but as far as off-road

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.610 
shape or form but as far as off-road
exploration<00:03:03.180> vehicles<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:04.470> is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
exploration vehicles go this is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.580 
exploration vehicles go this is
definitely<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.570> more<00:03:06.570> odd<00:03:06.750> side<00:03:07.410> of

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
definitely on the more odd side of

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.229 
definitely on the more odd side of
things<00:03:07.770> for<00:03:07.950> sure<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.640> not<00:03:08.820> something

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
things for sure it's not something

you're going to see on the trails out at
Moab<00:03:12.000> or<00:03:12.180> anything<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:13.020> not

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
something that you're going to see at an

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.120 
something that you're going to see at an
off-road<00:03:15.450> park<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:16.080> not<00:03:16.260> something<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.980> is

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
off-road park it's not something this is

off-road park it's not something this is
something<00:03:17.160> you're<00:03:17.459> going<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.610> see<00:03:17.670> out<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
something you're going to see out on the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.520 
something you're going to see out on the
highway<00:03:18.299> out<00:03:18.330> on<00:03:18.600> drag<00:03:18.840> strips<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.320> mean<00:03:19.440> if

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
highway out on drag strips I mean if

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.800 
highway out on drag strips I mean if
it's<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.709> zl1<00:03:19.950> or<00:03:20.340> 1le<00:03:20.820> handling<00:03:21.360> package<00:03:21.660> then

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
it's a zl1 or 1le handling package then

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.479 
it's a zl1 or 1le handling package then
you're<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.110> see<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.320> on<00:03:22.380> backroads<00:03:22.830> but

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
you're going to see it on backroads but

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.320 
you're going to see it on backroads but
you're<00:03:23.610> not<00:03:23.700> going<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.910> see<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.239> this

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
you're not going to see it in this

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.229 
you're not going to see it in this
environment<00:03:24.630> absolutely<00:03:25.070> not<00:03:26.070> but<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.090> is

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
environment absolutely not but it is

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.729 
environment absolutely not but it is
cool<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.570> know<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.750> when<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> game

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
cool to know that when you have a game

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.140 
cool to know that when you have a game
like<00:03:28.799> spin<00:03:29.190> tires<00:03:29.370> where<00:03:29.580> we<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:29.940> such

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
like spin tires where we can do such

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.100 
like spin tires where we can do such
things<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.470> thing<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.950> again<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.820> water

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
things and the thing is again the water

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.270 
things and the thing is again the water
also<00:03:34.110> doesn't<00:03:34.470> really<00:03:34.530> even<00:03:34.769> damage<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.160> at

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
also doesn't really even damage it at

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.470 
also doesn't really even damage it at
all<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.400> mean<00:03:35.580> right<00:03:35.730> there<00:03:35.850> dangerous<00:03:36.299> water

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
all I mean right there dangerous water

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.970 
all I mean right there dangerous water
level<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:36.870> only<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.110> tiny<00:03:37.440> little<00:03:37.650> bit<00:03:37.860> it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
level but only a tiny little bit it's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.039 
level but only a tiny little bit it's
not<00:03:38.040> even<00:03:38.220> giving<00:03:38.430> me<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.580> red<00:03:38.850> dangerous<00:03:39.750> water

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
not even giving me a red dangerous water

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.150 
not even giving me a red dangerous water
level<00:03:40.320> warning<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:40.890> giving<00:03:41.070> me<00:03:41.130> a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
level warning it's just giving me a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.620 
level warning it's just giving me a
white<00:03:41.400> dangerous<00:03:42.000> water<00:03:42.180> level<00:03:42.420> warning

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
white dangerous water level warning

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.210 
white dangerous water level warning
which<00:03:42.720> means<00:03:42.900> there's<00:03:43.380> very<00:03:43.709> low<00:03:43.980> probability

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
which means there's very low probability

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.360 
which means there's very low probability
of<00:03:44.790> actually<00:03:45.630> sinking<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.019> car<00:03:46.230> now<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:47.100> mean

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
of actually sinking the car now I mean

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.920 
of actually sinking the car now I mean
we<00:03:47.459> don't<00:03:47.549> even<00:03:47.640> have<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.970> winch<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.420> was

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
we don't even have to winch I was

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.150 
we don't even have to winch I was
expecting<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.769> winch<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.040> those

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
expecting to have to winch to those

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.620 
expecting to have to winch to those
trees<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.730> don't<00:03:50.850> even<00:03:50.970> have<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.209> winch<00:03:51.390> it's

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
trees we don't even have to winch it's

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.610 
trees we don't even have to winch it's
just<00:03:51.840> pulling<00:03:52.080> itself<00:03:52.440> through<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:55.590> just

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
just pulling itself through it just

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.560 
just pulling itself through it just
grabs<00:03:56.070> traction<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.700> really<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.150> digs<00:03:57.420> a

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
grabs traction and really just digs a

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.440 
grabs traction and really just digs a
massive<00:03:58.049> trench<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:59.000> goes<00:04:00.000> it's<00:04:00.269> like<00:04:00.420> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
massive trench and goes it's like a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.390 
massive trench and goes it's like a
freaking<00:04:00.870> bulldozer<00:04:01.320> it<00:04:01.590> really<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.250> just

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
freaking bulldozer it really is it just

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.940 
freaking bulldozer it really is it just
just<00:04:03.390> bulldoze<00:04:03.840> is<00:04:03.989> this<00:04:04.110> massive<00:04:04.500> trench

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
just bulldoze is this massive trench

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.030 
just bulldoze is this massive trench
through<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.220> mud<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:06.260> then<00:04:07.260> eventually<00:04:07.590> once

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
through the mud and then eventually once

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.229 
through the mud and then eventually once
you<00:04:08.130> get<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.430> edge<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.730> mud<00:04:08.880> which<00:04:09.060> I

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
you get to the edge of the mud which I

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.370 
you get to the edge of the mud which I
think<00:04:09.750> we<00:04:09.870> may<00:04:10.049> get<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.829> in<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> couple<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.340> years

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
think we may get to in a couple of years

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.199 
think we may get to in a couple of years
once<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.530> does<00:04:13.739> get<00:04:13.950> there<00:04:14.190> provided<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.150> not

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
once it does get there provided it's not

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.949 
once it does get there provided it's not
blocked<00:04:15.570> by<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.810> rock<00:04:16.140> well<00:04:17.450> it's<00:04:18.450> still<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.720> slow

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
blocked by a rock well it's still a slow

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.990 
blocked by a rock well it's still a slow
go<00:04:19.290> but<00:04:19.560> honestly<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.010> think<00:04:20.220> we<00:04:20.430> might<00:04:20.609> back<00:04:20.790> up

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
go but honestly I think we might back up

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.159 
go but honestly I think we might back up
just<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.269> bit<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.570> see<00:04:21.720> if<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:21.840> can<00:04:21.930> come<00:04:22.049> at<00:04:22.140> it

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
just a bit and see if we can come at it

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.620 
just a bit and see if we can come at it
from<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.380> different<00:04:22.500> angle

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
from a different angle

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.890 
from a different angle
just<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.750> slightly<00:04:26.139> avoid<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.710> rocks<00:04:30.449> whoo<00:04:31.449> no

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
just to slightly avoid the rocks whoo no

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.860 
just to slightly avoid the rocks whoo no
I<00:04:31.930> don't<00:04:32.289> think<00:04:32.349> so<00:04:32.560> oh<00:04:33.419> yeah<00:04:34.419> I<00:04:34.449> think<00:04:34.630> we're<00:04:34.840> a

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
I don't think so oh yeah I think we're a

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.230 
I don't think so oh yeah I think we're a
little<00:04:34.960> bit<00:04:35.169> out<00:04:35.199> of<00:04:35.289> luck<00:04:35.530> on<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.860> one<00:04:36.240> but

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
little bit out of luck on that one but

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.430 
little bit out of luck on that one but
we<00:04:37.389> do<00:04:37.479> have<00:04:37.569> winch<00:04:37.780> points<00:04:38.110> which<00:04:38.199> means<00:04:38.380> we

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
we do have winch points which means we

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.210 
we do have winch points which means we
can<00:04:38.560> do<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.800> oh<00:04:41.789> yeah<00:04:42.789> oh<00:04:43.620> yeah<00:04:44.620> no<00:04:44.889> problem

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
can do this oh yeah oh yeah no problem

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.100 
can do this oh yeah oh yeah no problem
at<00:04:45.490> all<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.849> while<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.389> Camaro<00:04:46.810> is<00:04:46.960> not

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
at all and while a Camaro is not

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.230 
at all and while a Camaro is not
generally<00:04:47.440> regarded<00:04:47.830> as<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.009> light<00:04:48.430> vehicle<00:04:49.030> it

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
generally regarded as a light vehicle it

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.210 
generally regarded as a light vehicle it
is<00:04:49.840> lightweight<00:04:50.410> compared<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.949> the<00:04:51.039> normal

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
is lightweight compared to the normal

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.559 
is lightweight compared to the normal
stuff<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.490> drive<00:04:51.819> in<00:04:51.940> spin<00:04:52.150> tires<00:04:52.330> like<00:04:52.509> the

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
stuff you drive in spin tires like the

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:53.939 
stuff you drive in spin tires like the
eight<00:04:52.720> by<00:04:52.900> eight<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.349> six<00:04:53.530> by<00:04:53.650> six<00:04:53.830> is

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
eight by eight and the six by six is

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.650 
eight by eight and the six by six is
this<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:54.550> pretty<00:04:54.729> lightweight<00:04:55.030> compared<00:04:55.569> to

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
this is pretty lightweight compared to

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.390 
this is pretty lightweight compared to
those<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.440> as<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.770> can<00:04:56.889> imagine<00:04:56.979> the

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
those so the as you can imagine the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.760 
those so the as you can imagine the
winch<00:04:57.610> works<00:04:57.940> surprisingly<00:04:58.330> well<00:04:59.169> with<00:04:59.620> this

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
winch works surprisingly well with this

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.560 
winch works surprisingly well with this
car<00:05:00.039> oh<00:05:01.289> come<00:05:02.289> on<00:05:02.320> it's<00:05:03.039> really<00:05:04.000> trying<00:05:04.389> hard

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
car oh come on it's really trying hard

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.270 
car oh come on it's really trying hard
to<00:05:04.690> dig<00:05:04.840> its<00:05:04.990> way<00:05:05.020> out<00:05:05.289> I<00:05:10.889> mean<00:05:11.889> you<00:05:11.979> know<00:05:12.070> I'm

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
to dig its way out I mean you know I'm

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.400 
to dig its way out I mean you know I'm
gonna<00:05:12.400> actually<00:05:12.729> put<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.180> in<00:05:13.360> too<00:05:13.599> low<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.259> see

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
gonna actually put it in too low and see

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.020 
gonna actually put it in too low and see
if<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.590> makes<00:05:14.740> any<00:05:14.889> difference<00:05:17.340> no<00:05:18.340> I<00:05:18.370> mean

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
if that makes any difference no I mean

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.629 
if that makes any difference no I mean
well<00:05:19.210> it's<00:05:19.449> thing<00:05:20.320> is<00:05:20.409> it's<00:05:20.560> making<00:05:20.919> like<00:05:21.340> it's

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
well it's thing is it's making like it's

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.589 
well it's thing is it's making like it's
making<00:05:22.180> progress<00:05:22.419> in<00:05:23.009> really<00:05:24.009> tiny

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
making progress in really tiny

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.640 
making progress in really tiny
increments<00:05:25.599> really<00:05:26.229> tiny<00:05:28.289> it's<00:05:29.289> like<00:05:29.440> one<00:05:29.560> of

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
increments really tiny it's like one of

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.020 
increments really tiny it's like one of
those<00:05:29.740> things<00:05:29.889> where<00:05:30.009> it'll<00:05:30.220> eventually<00:05:30.490> pull

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
those things where it'll eventually pull

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.490 
those things where it'll eventually pull
itself<00:05:31.240> out<00:05:31.419> but<00:05:31.630> you<00:05:31.750> don't<00:05:31.780> necessarily

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
itself out but you don't necessarily

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.800 
itself out but you don't necessarily
want<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.770> wait<00:05:32.979> for<00:05:33.250> it<00:05:33.280> I<00:05:33.580> mean<00:05:34.419> it's<00:05:34.599> almost

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
want to wait for it I mean it's almost

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.420 
want to wait for it I mean it's almost
there<00:05:35.229> we<00:05:35.560> just<00:05:35.680> have<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.830> little<00:05:36.070> bit<00:05:36.159> more<00:05:36.340> of

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
there we just have a little bit more of

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.920 
there we just have a little bit more of
this<00:05:36.550> like<00:05:36.759> swampland<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.449> cover<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:37.840> then

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
this like swampland to cover and then

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.709 
this like swampland to cover and then
we'll<00:05:38.020> be<00:05:38.139> back<00:05:38.289> on<00:05:38.320> actual<00:05:38.949> ground<00:05:39.719> solid

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
we'll be back on actual ground solid

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.480 
we'll be back on actual ground solid
ground<00:05:40.990> anyway<00:05:41.289> well<00:05:41.469> maybe<00:05:41.770> not<00:05:41.889> solid<00:05:42.280> for<00:05:42.460> a

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
ground anyway well maybe not solid for a

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.770 
ground anyway well maybe not solid for a
little<00:05:42.729> while<00:05:42.849> because<00:05:43.060> it's<00:05:43.300> really<00:05:43.479> muddy

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
little while because it's really muddy

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.570

because the automatic transmission

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.860 
because the automatic transmission
decided<00:06:37.669> to<00:06:37.730> be<00:06:37.850> a<00:06:37.880> little<00:06:38.090> bit<00:06:38.240> funky<00:06:38.480> like

don't entirely impede this thing's

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.200 
don't entirely impede this thing's
progress<00:06:59.290> which<00:07:00.290> I<00:07:00.410> think<00:07:00.620> they<00:07:00.740> may<00:07:00.890> have

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
progress which I think they may have

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.030 
progress which I think they may have
yeah<00:07:02.210> it's<00:07:02.540> just<00:07:02.780> spinning<00:07:03.080> it's<00:07:03.830> just

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
yeah it's just spinning it's just

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.280 
yeah it's just spinning it's just
entirely<00:07:04.370> spinning<00:07:05.030> I<00:07:05.180> feel<00:07:05.930> like<00:07:06.050> I'm<00:07:06.140> gonna

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
entirely spinning I feel like I'm gonna

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.570 
entirely spinning I feel like I'm gonna
have<00:07:06.410> to<00:07:06.530> cut<00:07:06.680> this<00:07:06.800> test<00:07:07.010> short<00:07:07.310> because

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
have to cut this test short because

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.640 
have to cut this test short because
there's<00:07:08.090> not<00:07:08.330> much<00:07:08.600> you<00:07:08.630> can<00:07:09.020> do<00:07:09.290> with<00:07:09.470> this

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
there's not much you can do with this

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.250 
there's not much you can do with this
thing<00:07:09.860> it's<00:07:10.070> not<00:07:10.220> a<00:07:10.280> very<00:07:10.640> like<00:07:11.450> it's<00:07:11.810> not<00:07:12.020> very

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260 
thing it's not a very like it's not very

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.830 
thing it's not a very like it's not very
focused<00:07:12.770> to<00:07:13.010> its<00:07:13.460> actual<00:07:13.790> environment<00:07:14.300> but<00:07:14.510> I

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
focused to its actual environment but I

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.480 
focused to its actual environment but I
mean<00:07:15.140> it<00:07:15.229> is<00:07:15.320> a<00:07:15.350> bit<00:07:15.500> of<00:07:15.590> a<00:07:15.650> laugh<00:07:15.860> but<00:07:16.340> at<00:07:16.430> the

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
mean it is a bit of a laugh but at the

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.010 
mean it is a bit of a laugh but at the
same<00:07:16.640> time<00:07:16.880> I<00:07:17.150> can<00:07:17.479> definitely<00:07:17.660> think<00:07:17.960> of

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
same time I can definitely think of

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.390 
same time I can definitely think of
other<00:07:18.140> vehicles<00:07:18.260> that<00:07:18.500> I<00:07:18.530> rather<00:07:18.740> using<00:07:19.160> spin

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
other vehicles that I rather using spin

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.070 
other vehicles that I rather using spin
tires<00:07:19.580> but<00:07:19.760> I<00:07:19.820> mean<00:07:19.970> if<00:07:20.060> it<00:07:20.150> was<00:07:20.270> like<00:07:20.390> it<00:07:20.630> was<00:07:21.020> a

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
tires but I mean if it was like it was a

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.330 
tires but I mean if it was like it was a
different<00:07:21.350> game<00:07:21.470> where<00:07:21.650> you<00:07:21.740> had<00:07:21.860> like<00:07:22.040> say<00:07:22.160> I

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.340 
different game where you had like say I

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.040 
different game where you had like say I

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
don't know tarmac then it would be a lot

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.420 
don't know tarmac then it would be a lot
