00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.839
 hello youtube friends good now you 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.430
 I will present how to make your own 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.680
 for the cases so that they do not 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.380
 rajan and then to have them 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.660
 protected in a folder like me the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.199
 I have good materials that we are going to 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.970
 need is going to be a leaf protector 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.119
 to preferably be thick 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.390
 because the skinny ones bend very 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:30.039
 easy and they do not serve we're going to need a 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:33.680
 cutter of any size does not matter a 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.820
 black down or any color 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.490
 a metal ruler and a soldering iron 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.470
 pencil good for the divisions of the 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.960
 cases we are going to need a paper 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.080
 letter size illustration and we're going to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.510
 four-by-five grid for the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.590
 classic or metallic tazos of the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.440
 small and 3 x 4 for gigas and 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.870
 mega tazos good let's start doing 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 what is the mica we are going to put what 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.980
 is the sheet of paper illustration in the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.980
 protective 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.640
 Once we're in, we're going to 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.790
 to use what is the cutter and the rule of 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.630
 good metal let's cut what they are 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.270
 these horizontal lines and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.789
 well I'm going to start cutting them 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.060
 since once we finish we're going to 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.390
 start using what is the type soldering iron 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.390
 pencil 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.280
 Well I finished doing what are the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.710
 cuts we take out the sheet of paper 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.090
 illustration and we put it below 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.090
 our leaf protector 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.609
 we line here with the lines 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.090
 horizontals that we cut nothing else for 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.179
 that the divisions fit us well 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.630
 and with the metal rule we are going to align 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.869
 the 1 or 2 centimeters as a centimeter 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.280
 above the line that we cut 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.280
 to do the divisions 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.269
 well this is a very easy way and 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.260
 cheap to do it that are our 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.959
 own crumbs 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.200
 good since we have the rule well-off 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.200
 to make the divisions with the soldering iron 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.159
 pencil type let's do like dots 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.900
 in what is this the line of the rule 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.340
 we're going to do them not so close together or so 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.849
 followed so that the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.849
 divisions 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.569
 good the soldering iron must be hot 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.620
 it must be connected so that it 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.620
 the holes are fine 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.210
 well we continue with all the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.610
 separation lines 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.240
 I'm going to finish it fast so you can see 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.240
 how are they 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.650
 just remember to subscribe to my 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.070
 youtube channel to get them 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.860
 my new videos and good 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.390
 remember to like it and even the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.990
 Facebook page 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.350
 so that 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.170
 your doubts and your comments leave them to me 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.870
 there and there I will be uploading the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.370
 new videos also so that they are at 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.530
 pending of those who connect a lot 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.530
 on facebook to social networks 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.079
 how do you 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.900
 I tell them the most I like about 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.879
 more subscribe to my channel because they give me 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.879
 more reasons to continue uploading videos 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.620
 yellow says what are the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.210
 and horizontal pointing 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.670
 now we leave half as it is and 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.340
 let's make the vertical lines 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.410
 Like the dots are not so close together 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.770
 separated so that there is a good mica 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.770
 made 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.050
 As you can see, it's not that slow and it's 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.700
 quick to make our own micas and 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.919
 well we are not going to spend on what is 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.810
 a mica and with simple materials 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.199
 we can do them in our own 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.199
 houses 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.120
 same if they have doubts of any material 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.690
 or anything that complicates 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.580
 can comment there in the video in the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.639
 facebook page and I gladly 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.030
 I will help as fast as I can 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.449
 good since I finished doing them the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.219
 I scored the half well done and good 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.560
 I'm going to try them with a look for 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:00.270
 that they see 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.270
 yes yes it looks good 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.120
 already with this they will have their strokes 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.840
 always woven and they will not scratch 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.720
 to me then it's a way to have them 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.880
 form this one 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.880
 as you burn to collect not 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.990
 mona installed that is half of the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.990
 cases 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.070
 and good remember subscribe to the channel 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.460
 and then look do not leave the tazos and 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.340
 there is a single list to be saved in 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.010
 what is the collector's folder to 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.910
 the folder can be anybody not 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.910
 there is no this
