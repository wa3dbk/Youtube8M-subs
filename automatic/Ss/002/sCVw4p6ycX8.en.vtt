00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.130
 I have returned margas thematic dotcom 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.230
 we are in barcelona in the mobile world 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.070
 congress specifically at stand 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.900
 lenovo and with me I have the to 7000 is one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.670
 of the products that lenovo is 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.230
 presenting here in this event that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.029
 has especially at 7000 apart 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.310
 after things that we then 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.279
 we find standard in your phones 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.839
 category as 5.5-inch screens 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.699
 a great processor so that things 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.349
 work faster etcetera is that 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.480
 This is the first phone in the market 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.100
 that has a system that we are 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 starting to see what is being installed 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.350
 in theaters that is called dolby atmos no 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.539
 we forget the idea of this system is that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 you can hear the sounds from 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.770
 any address like the famous 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.719
 home theater or sound sound without 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.620
 need for special equipment simply 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 Well, conventional hearing aids 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.010
 ordinary the phone looks 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.899
 thin you see a phone that well with 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.070
 faith is according to what we can 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.110
 wait in your category is very light 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.180
 and in this case this is yellow 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.500
 here is the camera is a camera of 8 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.450
 megapixels that we find by a 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.590
 little bit short for a phone the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.290
 category and with a new technology 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.680
 as dolby to both but it's the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.270
 front that I'm going to haunt now is 5 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.970
 megapixels and for the fis it is 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.070
 fantastic but the interesting matter the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.270
 phone as missions is dolby atm and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.610
 Ok here 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.650
 lenovo has provided hearing aids for 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.479
 that one then have the opportunity 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.000
 after being able to test the sound here is 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.100
 all of training xeneize and I had the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.690
 opportunity to try it and tell them about 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 that finding the phone was heard 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.050
 very short despite the sound was going to be 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 more and more presence with more strength and 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.280
 another thing that you notice I do not know if it's the guy 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.229
 of programming that I had here 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 although it was supposed to be specifically 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.430
 designed to show the dolby we give 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.830
 that the sound really could not 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.560
 distinguish anything beyond the stereo 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.330
 I do not know if these products are still 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.890
 they are not ready, we do not have 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.900
 information but the reality is that 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.080
 we will have to wait if in fact we forget 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.820
 it's good enough for 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 consider buying this phone as 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.900
 such from the stand of the new here in 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.980
