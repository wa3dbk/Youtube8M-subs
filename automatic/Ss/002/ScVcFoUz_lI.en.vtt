00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:27.310
 the cake with dried figs ingredients 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:30.130
 dried figs honey almond nuts 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.829
 surely many of you have heard 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.700
 use the expression the wedding with figs 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.970
 dry 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.829
 what it means means that you don't 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.000
 they normally do the wedding with figs 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.340
 dry 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.790
 why make weddings with dried figs 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.680
 means being not having money at all 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.000
 be poor poor just don't have 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.060
 not even the possibility of making a cake 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.310
 decent bridal though the cake with i 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.190
 dried figs 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.690
 a treat that is really worth it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.980
 to actually try it was used 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.410
 from the poorest families when 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.909
 they had to celebrate something 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:15.469
 so poor that they didn't even have 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.990
 eggs, flour to bake a cake 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.579
 to make any cake clearly and 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.859
 they serve dried figs 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.649
 now September is the month of beans 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:26.899
 there is no farmhouse in Tuscany not 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.539
 there is a campania house that does not have 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.310
 at least one fig tree is so true 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.109
 that the fig jam is 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.819
 those more heroes jam 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.950
 the two jams are wild 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.049
 however, typical of our countryside 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.539
 our grandmothers are not actually called 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.420
 so much to make jams or at least 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.030
 our great-grandmothers already after the war 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.640
 figs had changed in things 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.399
 normally also not to do it that way 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.369
 eat and from the birds and above all 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.250
 to the members who are very fond of it 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.770
 they used to collect and dry that there 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.609
 they are the children here of the trees and I have to 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.269
 say they are exceptional you collect the 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:13.760
 children opens a goal that you put to 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:17.980
 to dry on these old ones is yes 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:22.170
 may still find it at the market 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.730
 in two they put themselves in the sun in full sun 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.769
 covered if you also want a small one 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.400
 light cotton to keep away 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:36.040
 insects and brought back to collect them in the evening 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.049
 before they fall moisture and put them 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.610
 in the room warmer and drier 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.459
 of the house and then resort again 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.739
 out the next day in the south is also done 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.989
 with tomatoes this is never done in Tuscany 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.049
 normally with children and also with children 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.140
 apricots helping perhaps in the last one 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.269
 part and drying also with ovens 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.519
 with the bottom of the wood stove when 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.829
 light up in the first series of knots 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.250
 September fresh nor will it be turned on yes 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.290
 lit the wood stove or even 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.620
 helping himself with the oven where he had been 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.920
 baked bread right at the end when 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.540
 the oven had lost all of its 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.819
 vehemence and its high temperature 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.420
 the fig cake is nothing more than one 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.590
 composition of figs held together by 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.489
 honey 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.769
 and enriched with almonds and walnuts 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.660
 these were the basic ingredients then yes 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.340
 you can do without almonds you can 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.280
 in short, to do without nuts 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.069
 almond nuts in country houses le 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.440
 we have always always had in time 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.739
 this could have been ancient for example 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.680
 a container suitable for making the cake 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.950
 for practical reasons I will assemble a fate 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.950
 riina uses honey 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:05.310
 and then it begins to rest on 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.310
 base of the cake our children 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.280
 we put on each fig a hand of the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.880
 as a second layer 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.570
 is 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.570
 maybe we use nuts 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.190
 then we continue with a third layer 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.860
 and more almonds 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.350
 so let's continue with a layer later 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.950
 the other until it completely fills the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.980
 at the end we fill the spaces 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.210
 between fig and fig with some more 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.820
 almond we add some more honey 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.390
 which in this case also serves as 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.080
 glue 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.349
 think well even a little bit 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.840
 let's base the philosophy of the fort 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.840
 because after that it covers itself 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.720
 yes pre 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.110
 bordeaux 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:31.120
 strong lets it rest with a weight 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:35.350
 great above this pot also of 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.230
 full of water here is perfect is so and 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.220
 let it rest for some time 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.640
 now it's time to use the 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.640
 cake 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:05.160
 we are in a kind of malaria magic 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.160
 removed with dried figs
