iPad now it's not a live preview like if

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.530 
iPad now it's not a live preview like if
you<00:02:02.280> look<00:02:02.369> at<00:02:02.490> my<00:02:02.579> mouth<00:02:02.729> talking<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
phone it's it's a little bit behind I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.229 
phone it's it's a little bit behind I
put<00:02:06.869> my<00:02:06.930> hand<00:02:07.140> over<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.459> takes<00:02:08.670> what<00:02:09.060> 2

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
put my hand over it and it takes what 2

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.089 
put my hand over it and it takes what 2
seconds<00:02:09.690> let's<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.289> move<00:02:10.470> my<00:02:10.619> hand<00:02:10.800> now

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
seconds let's see you move my hand now

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.520 
seconds let's see you move my hand now
1001<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
1001 with that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.310 
1001 with that
-<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.490> it's<00:02:13.610> about<00:02:13.760> two<00:02:13.970> seconds<00:02:14.300> behind<00:02:14.480> which

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
- so it's about two seconds behind which

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.010 
- so it's about two seconds behind which
means<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.590> don't<00:02:15.710> get<00:02:15.890> live<00:02:16.130> action<00:02:16.900> like<00:02:17.900> you

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
means you don't get live action like you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.020 
means you don't get live action like you
would<00:02:18.140> with<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.350> LCD<00:02:18.770> screen<00:02:18.940> adapter<00:02:19.940> that

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
would with the LCD screen adapter that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.420 
would with the LCD screen adapter that
you<00:02:20.180> can<00:02:20.300> put<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.630> back<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.140> GoPro<00:02:21.860> but

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
you can put on the back of the GoPro but

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.280 
you can put on the back of the GoPro but
you<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.940> frame<00:02:23.360> your<00:02:23.540> shots<00:02:23.810> with<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.170> which

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.780 
you can frame your shots with it which
is<00:02:24.440> great<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.710> hate<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.100> when<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.340> with<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.670> old

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
GoPro when you would put it somewhere

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.690 
GoPro when you would put it somewhere

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
away or too close and it would kind of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.580 
away or too close and it would kind of
screw<00:02:32.300> up<00:02:32.390> your<00:02:32.480> whole<00:02:32.600> video<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.410> way
