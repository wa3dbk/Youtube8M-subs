above<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:35.600> suborbital<00:00:36.600> you're<00:00:36.840> right

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
above your suborbital you're right

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
above your suborbital you're right
you're<00:00:37.110> actually<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:38.219> guys<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> dawn

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you're actually these guys have the dawn

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
you're actually these guys have the dawn
spacesuits<00:00:39.480> great<00:00:39.899> you're<00:00:40.230> suborbital<00:00:40.800> at

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
spacesuits great you're suborbital at

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250 
spacesuits great you're suborbital at
this<00:00:40.980> point<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.730> um<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.719> demonstrates

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
this point now um what this demonstrates

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
this point now um what this demonstrates
I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.500> immediately<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.610> know<00:00:44.700> earlier

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
I think immediately is you know earlier

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.910 
I think immediately is you know earlier
in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> show<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.660> saw<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> helicopter<00:00:46.440> just

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
in the show we saw a helicopter just

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
in the show we saw a helicopter just
blown<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> crap<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> everything<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.930> are

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
blown the crap out of everything you are

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
blown the crap out of everything you are
going<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.590> different<00:00:49.800> careers<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
going from very different careers that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
going from very different careers that
except<00:00:50.760> from<00:00:50.879> level<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> level<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.660> mean<00:00:51.690> what's

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
except from level to level I mean what's

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110 
except from level to level I mean what's
much<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.100> writing<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.879> expect

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
much of a little writing can we expect

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
much of a little writing can we expect
from<00:00:54.239> black<00:00:54.510> ops<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.410> know<00:00:55.530> that's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
from black ops that is you know that's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.930 
from black ops that is you know that's
actually<00:00:56.190> something<00:00:56.430> we've<00:00:56.640> been<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.910> for

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
actually something we've been going for

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479 
actually something we've been going for
level<00:00:57.390> variety<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.020> pacing<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.829> there's

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
level variety so pacing in this there's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.490 
level variety so pacing in this there's
a<00:00:59.579> setup<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.180> obviously<00:01:00.500> completely

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
a setup here obviously completely

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
a setup here obviously completely
different<00:01:02.250> than<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> all-out<00:01:02.670> action<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
different than the all-out action you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.640 
different than the all-out action you
just<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.899> saw<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.290> payback

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
just that you saw it with payback

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
just that you saw it with payback
earlier<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.880> we're<00:01:06.000> doing<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.240> setup<00:01:06.450> here

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
earlier so we're doing this setup here

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
earlier so we're doing this setup here
and<00:01:06.900> you're<00:01:07.320> controlling<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.860> squad<00:01:08.189> but

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and you're controlling this squad but

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
and you're controlling this squad but
then<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.810> couple<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.080> seconds<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.500> we're

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
then in a couple of seconds what we're

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.390 
then in a couple of seconds what we're
going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> bring<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.369> down

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
going to do is going to bring you down

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.810 
going to do is going to bring you down
and<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.750> manually<00:01:13.610> right<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and make you manually right on the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.789 
and make you manually right on the
ground<00:01:15.000> you've<00:01:15.810> done<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.229> now<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.619> you've

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
ground you've done so now that you've

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.039 
ground you've done so now that you've
made<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.610> controlling<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.270> squad<00:01:18.659> now

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
made in controlling that squad now

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:19.850 
made in controlling that squad now
you're<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> reap<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
you're gonna have to reap the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.560 
you're gonna have to reap the
consequences<00:01:20.030> that's<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.270> that's<00:01:21.479> right

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
consequences that's right that's right

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.770 
consequences that's right that's right
so<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> saw<00:01:22.909> you<00:01:23.909> were<00:01:24.000> positioned<00:01:24.509> here

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so as you saw you were positioned here

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.950 
so as you saw you were positioned here
right<00:01:25.320> before<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:26.580> Soviet<00:01:26.970> space<00:01:27.659> knots

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
right before this Soviet space knots

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.929 
right before this Soviet space knots
squad<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.979> coming<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.280> before<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
squad was coming right before you and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.080 
squad was coming right before you and
you've<00:01:30.030> been<00:01:30.150> placed<00:01:30.390> safely<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:32.090> they

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you've been placed safely as they

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.450 
you've been placed safely as they
approach<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.619> playing<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> series

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
approach now are you playing as a series

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.710 
approach now are you playing as a series
of<00:01:35.549> different<00:01:35.700> characters<00:01:36.030> from<00:01:36.299> level<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
of different characters from level to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.569 
of different characters from level to
level<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.920> modern

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
you keep what you don't expect is you

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.979
