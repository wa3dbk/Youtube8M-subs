in the interior as well plenty of power
under<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> hood<00:00:12.750> its<00:00:13.139> fuel<00:00:13.410> efficient<00:00:13.889> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
under the hood its fuel efficient and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.829 
under the hood its fuel efficient and
it's<00:00:14.370> also<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.849> safest<00:00:15.210> cars<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
it's also one of the safest cars on the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.870 
it's also one of the safest cars on the
road<00:00:16.049> now<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.710> was<00:00:16.859> redesigned<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.670> few

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
road now it was redesigned just a few

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.480 
road now it was redesigned just a few
years<00:00:18.119> ago<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> 2007<00:00:19.500> model<00:00:19.529> year<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.310> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
years ago for the 2007 model year and I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.160 
years ago for the 2007 model year and I
really<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.090> lines<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.900> latest

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
really like the lines in the latest

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.200 
really like the lines in the latest
redesign<00:00:22.650> you've<00:00:22.800> got<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.070> really<00:00:23.580> sloping

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
redesign you've got this really sloping

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.300 
redesign you've got this really sloping
roofline<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.109> squat<00:00:25.590> rear-end<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
roofline here in a squat rear-end and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.980 
roofline here in a squat rear-end and
it's<00:00:26.430> raised<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> little<00:00:27.359> bit<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> car

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
it's raised up a little bit so the car

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
it's raised up a little bit so the car
sort<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.380> dives<00:00:28.890> forward<00:00:29.460> has<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.939> nice

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
sort of dives forward has a really nice

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.299 
sort of dives forward has a really nice
athletic<00:00:30.300> stance<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.920> 18-inch

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
athletic stance to it and the 18-inch

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.860 
athletic stance to it and the 18-inch
wheels<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> limited<00:00:33.300> also<00:00:33.600> give<00:00:33.750> it

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
wheels here on the limited also give it

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
wheels here on the limited also give it
I<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> really<00:00:34.500> nice<00:00:34.739> Road<00:00:35.010> presence<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I think a really nice Road presence and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
I think a really nice Road presence and
dress<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.390> bit<00:00:36.660> under<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.440> skin

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
dress it up a little bit under the skin

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.940 
dress it up a little bit under the skin
on<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.059> Sebring<00:00:39.059> there's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.780> very<00:00:40.140> rigid<00:00:40.530> body

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
on the Sebring there's a very rigid body

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.619 
on the Sebring there's a very rigid body
structure<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> engineers<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.390> used<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
structure the engineers really used a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.690 
structure the engineers really used a
lot<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.899> high-strength<00:00:43.469> steel<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.160> having

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
lot of high-strength steel and having

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.220 
lot of high-strength steel and having
that<00:00:44.820> rigid<00:00:45.149> body<00:00:45.329> structure<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:45.960> pays

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
that rigid body structure really pays

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.869 
that rigid body structure really pays
off<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> number<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> ways<00:00:47.280> first<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.730> all

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
off in a number of ways first of all

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
off in a number of ways first of all
really<00:00:48.420> good<00:00:48.539> ride<00:00:48.809> quality<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.559> down<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
really good ride quality going down the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
really good ride quality going down the
road<00:00:50.010> very<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.610> vibration<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.510> harshness

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
road very little vibration or harshness

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
road very little vibration or harshness
on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> rougher<00:00:52.500> roads<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.190> also<00:00:53.340> makes<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
on the rougher roads it also makes the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
on the rougher roads it also makes the
car<00:00:53.940> turn<00:00:54.300> very<00:00:54.629> well<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.230> into<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
car turn very well as you go into the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
car turn very well as you go into the
corners<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> very<00:00:56.340> confident<00:00:56.850> vehicle

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
corners it's a very confident vehicle

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
corners it's a very confident vehicle
and<00:00:57.510> finally<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> nice<00:00:58.559> rigid<00:00:58.890> body

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
and finally with the nice rigid body

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
and finally with the nice rigid body
structure<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.329> reduce<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> amount

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
structure you really reduce the amount

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.569 
structure you really reduce the amount
of<00:01:01.050> squeaks<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.770> rattles<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> hear

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
of squeaks and rattles that you hear

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
of squeaks and rattles that you hear
especially<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.719> rack<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.229> miles<00:01:04.439> on

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
especially as you rack up your miles on

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380 
especially as you rack up your miles on
the<00:01:04.799> vehicle<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> years<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.030> engineers

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the vehicle over the years the engineers

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
the vehicle over the years the engineers
also<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> lot<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> polyurethane<00:01:07.920> foam

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
also put a lot of polyurethane foam

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
also put a lot of polyurethane foam
throughout<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> body<00:01:09.180> cavities<00:01:09.720> again<00:01:10.020> so

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
throughout the body cavities again so

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.350 
throughout the body cavities again so
you<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> nice<00:01:10.799> quiet<00:01:11.070> ride<00:01:11.430> now<00:01:12.030> under<00:01:12.270> the
