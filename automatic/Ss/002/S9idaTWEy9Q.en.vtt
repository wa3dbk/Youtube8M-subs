00:00:06.957 --> 00:00:10.832
 Alliance of Five Eyes, an agreement to share information 

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:16.086
 between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.415
 During World War II Britain and the US shared information about the Nazis. 

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:29.355
 They had an agreement called BRUSA, 

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:31.372
 which allowed them to exchange staff, 

00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:35.359
 and both countries have set rules for handling secret information. 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.957
 And this deal won them so much, 

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:43.256
 that they used it after the war under the original name of the British-American Agreement. 

00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:46.990
 The agreement has expelled news agencies so much 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.718
 that they spread it to the other three peoples of the British Commonwealth - 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.336
 Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 

00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:56.062
 And here is the Alliance of Five Eyes. 

00:00:56.907 --> 00:01:01.460
 They were supposed to help share information about the Soviet Union and China, 

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.581
 but the agreement has not been used for this purpose all the time. 

00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:07.805
 Five eyes created a system called Echelon. 

00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:10.674
 It is a system for sharing signal information. 

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:14.927
 Echelon was a project to share bugged phone calls 

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:19.176
 satellite information and fiber optic communication. 

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:22.153
 The project was allegedly printed in 1971, 

00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:25.457
 developed as new technologies. 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.401
 Nobody is 100% sure who is the target and how often, 

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:32.139
 because it is very secret. 

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:35.856
 When politicians began to ask in 1992, 

00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:39.061
 Britain and the US refused to exist, 

00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:43.388
 and refuse to this day, even though Australia and New Zealand admit it. 

00:01:43.744 --> 00:01:50.554
 Today it is considered the ultimate global spy network capable of listening to every call 

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:53.681
 or read every email around the world. 

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:03.503
 We know that this system has existed since 2000, 

00:02:03.504 --> 00:02:10.792
 in 1997, a BBC documentary was broadcast by a man named Duncan Campbell, 

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:14.736
 He had a source from this place in Menwith Hill, North Yorkshire. 

00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:21.250
 His work was part of the Echelon system in strange structures known as "Radoms." 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.119
 And here was spying. 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.451
 At that time they could capture 2 million records every hour. 

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:34.089
 They looked at the key words and formulas in the news to uncover terrorist plans and cross-border crimes 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.885
 and every communication stream was passed to the intelligence analyst. 

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:43.347
 This base was associated with the future of the US National Security Agency and GCHQ. 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.078
 And it's not the only place. 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.135
 The Alliance of Five Eyes has listener locations around the world. 

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:52.538
 Even in 1999, when politicians began to ask, 

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:58.789
 there were concerns that these places could easily abuse their powers 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.439
 especially by spying on people, or by conveying information to certain companies 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.605
 to have an advantage when applying for contracts. 

00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:15.196
 Even then, they blamed the NSA and its allies for controlling the police system and disrupting Americans' privacy. 

00:03:15.197 --> 00:03:16.845
 Sounds familiar, doesn't it? 

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:21.422
 Thanks to Edward Snowden's whistleblowing, we know about PRISM 

00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:25.081
 and to some extent GCHQ Tempora. 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:31.738
 Both programs have allowed agencies to store and analyze large amounts of data, metadata, emails, etc ... 

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:39.937
 British Foreign Minister William Hague has refused to comment on whether the information collected by these programs is shared. 

00:03:39.972 --> 00:03:42.045
 And the same goes for GCHQ. 

00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:44.809
 And then the NSA spokesman said: 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.654
 "Any accusation that the NSA relies on its foreign partners to circumvent US law 

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:51.552
 they are completely false. 

00:03:51.553 --> 00:03:56.494
 NSA will ask its foreign partners to perform any news activity 

00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:00.774
 which the US government is forbidden to implement by law. " 

00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:04.608
 But even if all our news agencies collect information, 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.310
 must the NSA ask for them? 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.425
 What Five Eyes and Echelon Show Us 

00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:14.356
 that our governments have been able to collect this information for a long time, 

00:04:14.357 --> 00:04:16.948
 and that there are legal grounds for sharing them. 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.362
 So, when these programs spread so much without public awareness, 

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:26.488
 should we trust them when they say they don't share information? 

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:28.673
 Tell us what you think down in the comments 

00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:31.211
 and check out our playlist about Edward Snowden. 

00:04:31.212 --> 00:04:38.340
 If you want more information about NSA and PRISM, there are also some videos about this topic, 

00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:39.625
 there should also be video descriptions. 

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:43.321
