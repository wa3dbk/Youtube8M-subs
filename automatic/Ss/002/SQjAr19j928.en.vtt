00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
we'll take a look and see if we need to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.980 
we'll take a look and see if we need to
use<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.049> immersion<00:04:18.709> blender<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:23.600> we've<00:04:23.810> been

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
use the immersion blender so we've been

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.730 
use the immersion blender so we've been
boiling<00:04:24.350> for<00:04:24.620> about<00:04:25.190> 70<00:04:26.180> minutes<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:26.960> what

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
boiling for about 70 minutes and what

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.140 
boiling for about 70 minutes and what
you<00:04:27.860> can<00:04:28.040> do<00:04:28.190> if<00:04:28.610> you<00:04:28.669> don't<00:04:28.910> have<00:04:29.030> an

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
you can do if you don't have an

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.090 
you can do if you don't have an
immersion<00:04:29.600> blender<00:04:29.630> don't<00:04:30.380> want<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.800> chop

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
immersion blender don't want to chop

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.280 
immersion blender don't want to chop
them<00:04:31.280> up<00:04:31.430> just<00:04:32.240> take<00:04:32.479> them<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.870> ones<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:33.200> are

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
them up just take them the ones that are

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.379 
them up just take them the ones that are
floating<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:34.180> press<00:04:35.180> them<00:04:35.300> against<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.780> side

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
floating and press them against the side

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.700 
floating and press them against the side
so<00:04:38.389> that<00:04:38.600> they<00:04:38.750> flatten<00:04:39.169> out<00:04:39.289> a<00:04:39.320> little<00:04:39.560> bit

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
so that they flatten out a little bit

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.560 
so that they flatten out a little bit
those<00:04:39.979> are<00:04:40.160> usually<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.610> ones<00:04:40.729> that<00:04:41.210> aren't

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
those are usually the ones that aren't

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.350 
those are usually the ones that aren't
quite<00:04:41.690> as<00:04:41.810> right<00:04:42.610> that'll<00:04:43.610> kind<00:04:43.850> of<00:04:43.940> float<00:04:44.180> on

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
quite as right that'll kind of float on

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.860 
quite as right that'll kind of float on
the<00:04:44.389> top<00:04:44.690> there<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:47.000> don't<00:04:47.180> want<00:04:47.389> chop<00:04:47.690> them

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
the top there you don't want chop them

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.650 
the top there you don't want chop them
all<00:04:48.050> up<00:04:48.320> or<00:04:48.560> anything<00:04:48.650> like<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:49.039> because
