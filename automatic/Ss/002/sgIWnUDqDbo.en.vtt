 adds beets 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.270
 the situation with himself but a bit we still 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.280

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.800
 just season with salt 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.770
 states 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.870
 x 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.110
 when the beet starts to fry it 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.180
 getting stronger and satiating 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.070
 backlit 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.850
 now balsamic vinegar 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.360
 he will give amazing pieces from him 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.689
 beetroot will start caramelization 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.710
 so add vinegar 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.500
 and now you need it in historical fact 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.380

 but not very gentle and change 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.010
 I think the British are already up 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.700

 canned food 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.790
 thinly sliced 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.520
 but it is 32 thousand 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.240

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.040

 here look it smells great 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.939
 excess water 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.809
 now and fry sesame you base 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.419
 we take a clean, dry pan with a lid 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.979
 be careful with sesame porch he 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.629
 very small burns very relevant when 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.339
 family warms they will start to burst 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.869
 which pop the root so look like this 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:54.379
 is happening 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.109

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.239
 butter is too hard for beet talk a 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.809
 if you take the seeds 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:07.669
 in this story is obtained and butter 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.599
 makeup AWOL function is very gentle 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.009

 very soft small auctions and bishop 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.279
 Florida second half recommendation 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:19.509
 Italy 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.349
 so now interpol pours sesame in 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.910

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.809
 these pillars of saturation a bit 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.059
 sour but creamy 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.199

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.989
 sponsorship with beet sesame gives 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.859
 amazing combination from here and 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:48.789
