the<00:00:15.660> teep<00:00:15.839> forum<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.949> part<00:00:17.279> two<00:00:17.609> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the teep forum this is the part two so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.750 
the teep forum this is the part two so
this<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.510> animated<00:00:18.930> vision<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
this is an animated vision of what the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.330 
this is an animated vision of what the
wood<00:00:21.029> assembly<00:00:21.779> would<00:00:21.960> look<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
wood assembly would look like so here it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.790 
wood assembly would look like so here it
is<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.699> assembled<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.600> some<00:00:24.869> shots<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
is all assembled just some shots of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.310 
is all assembled just some shots of
views<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.490> kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.420> around<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.199> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
views just kind of going around it in a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169 
views just kind of going around it in a
panoramic<00:00:28.949> view<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.310> show<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.000> all

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
panoramic view to show you kind of all

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.310 
panoramic view to show you kind of all
the<00:00:30.300> different<00:00:30.599> angles<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:32.750> can<00:00:33.750> see<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> lot

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the different angles you can see a lot

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
the different angles you can see a lot
of<00:00:34.500> extra<00:00:34.980> bracing<00:00:35.550> that's<00:00:35.760> put<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.120> place<00:00:36.149> on

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of extra bracing that's put in place on

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
of extra bracing that's put in place on
it<00:00:36.809> that's<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.170> keep<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.559> true<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.329> precise

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
it that's to keep it true and precise

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.440 
it that's to keep it true and precise
while<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.590> engraving<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> cutting<00:00:41.850> there

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
while it's engraving and cutting there

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
while it's engraving and cutting there
is<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.960> quite<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> force<00:00:43.829> put

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
is going to be quite a bit of force put

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.049 
is going to be quite a bit of force put
on<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:45.059> any<00:00:45.329> real<00:00:45.899> extreme<00:00:46.590> force<00:00:47.059> no

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
on it but not any real extreme force no

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.360 
on it but not any real extreme force no
jerking<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:48.899> anything<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.950> of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
jerking or anything like that because of

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.850 
jerking or anything like that because of
how<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> cam<00:00:51.149> screws<00:00:51.539> react<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.710> don't

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
how the cam screws react so we don't

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.709 
how the cam screws react so we don't
have<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> worry<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.489> shock<00:00:54.030> low<00:00:54.300> value

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
have to worry about shock low value

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.660 
have to worry about shock low value
walls

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.529 

this<00:00:59.660> next<00:01:00.109> set<00:01:00.289> of<00:01:00.579> photos<00:01:01.579> here<00:01:01.940> is

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
this next set of photos here is

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.689 
this next set of photos here is
basically<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.260> coming<00:01:03.649> apart<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.400> can<00:01:04.549> see

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
basically it coming apart so you can see

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.160 
basically it coming apart so you can see
how<00:01:04.790> all<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.239> different<00:01:05.269> pieces<00:01:05.689> fit

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
how all the different pieces fit

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.389 
how all the different pieces fit
together<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.860> how<00:01:07.000> you<00:01:08.000> would<00:01:08.240> assemble<00:01:08.570> it

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
together and how you would assemble it

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.700 
together and how you would assemble it
individual<00:01:10.399> parts<00:01:10.729> wise<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:15.140> can<00:01:15.259> see<00:01:15.500> all<00:01:15.680> of

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
individual parts wise you can see all of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.740 
individual parts wise you can see all of
the<00:01:15.950> different<00:01:16.310> joints<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:16.850> lot<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.210> these<00:01:17.360> I've

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
the different joints a lot of these I've

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.990 
the different joints a lot of these I've
made<00:01:18.020> very<00:01:18.320> simplistic<00:01:19.190> so<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.820> can

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
made very simplistic so that we can

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.990 
made very simplistic so that we can
attach<00:01:20.330> them<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:20.930> cut<00:01:21.590> them<00:01:21.770> out<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.130> staunton

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
attach them and cut them out of staunton

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.139 
attach them and cut them out of staunton
standard<00:01:23.390> stock<00:01:23.689> material<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.640> basically

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
standard stock material and basically

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.170 
standard stock material and basically
butt<00:01:26.930> joints<00:01:27.409> or<00:01:27.590> standard<00:01:28.280> miter<00:01:28.549> cuts<00:01:28.909> is

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
butt joints or standard miter cuts is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.169 
butt joints or standard miter cuts is
the<00:01:29.869> assembly<00:01:30.320> process<00:01:31.030> everything<00:01:32.030> will

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
the assembly process everything will

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.450 
the assembly process everything will
eventually<00:01:32.750> be<00:01:32.899> glued<00:01:33.319> and<00:01:33.649> screwed<00:01:34.069> together

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
eventually be glued and screwed together

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.850 
eventually be glued and screwed together
from<00:01:35.149> various<00:01:35.569> angles<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:36.259> add<00:01:36.409> strength

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
from various angles to add strength

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.580 
from various angles to add strength
you'll<00:01:37.819> notice<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.240> all<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.659> end<00:01:38.929> joints

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
you'll notice that all the end joints

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.700 
you'll notice that all the end joints
have<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.830> cross<00:01:40.369> joint<00:01:41.030> put<00:01:41.450> on<00:01:41.600> them<00:01:41.840> as<00:01:42.020> well

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
have a cross joint put on them as well

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.639 
have a cross joint put on them as well
so<00:01:43.190> one<00:01:43.490> butt<00:01:43.789> joint<00:01:44.179> overlaps<00:01:44.810> another<00:01:45.080> butt

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
so one butt joint overlaps another butt

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.039 
so one butt joint overlaps another butt
joint<00:01:45.979> which<00:01:46.280> interlocks<00:01:46.880> them<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.450> causes<00:01:47.899> a

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
joint which interlocks them and causes a

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.350 
joint which interlocks them and causes a
W<00:01:48.590> formation<00:01:49.250> which<00:01:49.819> is<00:01:50.000> one<00:01:50.179> of<00:01:50.209> the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
W formation which is one of the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.630 
W formation which is one of the
strongest<00:01:50.780> butt<00:01:51.020> joints<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.470> can<00:01:51.500> have<00:01:51.920> that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
strongest butt joints you can have that

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.580 
strongest butt joints you can have that
way<00:01:52.819> we<00:01:53.030> add<00:01:53.209> in<00:01:53.450> strength<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.200> overall

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
way we add in strength of the overall

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:03.640 
way we add in strength of the overall
piece<00:01:54.890> without<00:01:55.369> adding<00:01:56.090> complexity

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.430 

notice<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.670> all<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.090> plywood<00:02:05.300> is<00:02:05.870> also

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
notice that all the plywood is also

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.810 
notice that all the plywood is also
doubled<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:08.470> vision<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.610> the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
doubled up the vision that I have of the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.270 
doubled up the vision that I have of the
one<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.120> I'm<00:02:11.270> making<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:12.350> going<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.920> be<00:02:13.070> made

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
one that I'm making is going to be made

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.570 
one that I'm making is going to be made
out<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.550> oak<00:02:13.850> plywood<00:02:14.600> but<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:15.740> also<00:02:16.040> what's

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
out of oak plywood but it's also what's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.940 
out of oak plywood but it's also what's
called<00:02:16.790> Lumbergh<00:02:17.390> or<00:02:17.630> plywood<00:02:17.930> which<00:02:18.680> means

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
called Lumbergh or plywood which means

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.460 
called Lumbergh or plywood which means
it's<00:02:19.220> thick<00:02:19.580> slices<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.630> oak<00:02:20.990> that's<00:02:21.320> all

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's thick slices of oak that's all

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.820 
it's thick slices of oak that's all
laminated<00:02:22.100> together<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.640> make<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.000> plug<00:02:23.830> this

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
laminated together to make the plug this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.340 
laminated together to make the plug this
