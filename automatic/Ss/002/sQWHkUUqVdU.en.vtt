Rex here welcome back and today I've got
something<00:00:11.880> really<00:00:12.059> cool<00:00:12.179> for<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.780> that

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
something really cool for you and that

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.799 
something really cool for you and that
is<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> mob<00:00:13.559> proof<00:00:13.830> door<00:00:14.130> now<00:00:15.059> when<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> say<00:00:15.599> mom

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is the mob proof door now when I say mom

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.750 
is the mob proof door now when I say mom
proof<00:00:16.020> door<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.680> talking<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.070> just<00:00:17.609> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
proof door I'm not talking about just a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.519 
proof door I'm not talking about just a
something<00:00:18.390> like<00:00:18.510> an<00:00:18.690> iron<00:00:19.020> door<00:00:19.260> with<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
something like an iron door with a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.019 
something like an iron door with a
button<00:00:19.859> where<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.310> can<00:00:20.430> go<00:00:20.609> through<00:00:20.850> because

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
button where you can go through because

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.519 
button where you can go through because
you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.270> press<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> button<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> mobs

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you can press the button but the mobs

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.609 
you can press the button but the mobs
can't<00:00:22.800> I'm<00:00:23.220> talking<00:00:23.789> about<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.320> door<00:00:25.320> that's

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
can't I'm talking about a door that's

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.349 
can't I'm talking about a door that's
always<00:00:25.859> open<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.119> always

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
always open for you so you can always

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.179 
always open for you so you can always
walk<00:00:27.599> through<00:00:27.840> whatever<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.230> want<00:00:28.410> except

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
walk through whatever you want except

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.479 
walk through whatever you want except
mobs<00:00:29.429> can't<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:31.080> let's<00:00:31.679> start<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.160> two

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
mobs can't so let's start with these two

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
mobs can't so let's start with these two
designs<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.360> these<00:00:33.719> two<00:00:33.899> designs<00:00:34.140> were

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
designs here these two designs were

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.549 
designs here these two designs were
possible<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> make<00:00:35.100> before<00:00:36.559> one-point-six

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
possible to make before one-point-six

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.639 
possible to make before one-point-six
came<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.570> actually<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.079> these<00:00:40.379> doors

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
came out and actually all of these doors

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.170 
came out and actually all of these doors
are<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:41.190> AI<00:00:41.579> exploits<00:00:42.649> which<00:00:43.649> means<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.190> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
are all AI exploits which means that it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.900 
are all AI exploits which means that it
uses<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.260> zombies<00:00:46.620> path<00:00:46.860> finding<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> finds

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
uses the zombies path finding and finds

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.560 
uses the zombies path finding and finds
ways<00:00:48.120> around<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.590> zombie<00:00:50.180> or<00:00:51.180> any

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
ways around that so the zombie or any

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.110 
ways around that so the zombie or any
mob<00:00:51.809> can't<00:00:52.260> does<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.000> go

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
mob can't does not think they can go

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.580 
mob can't does not think they can go
through<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> place<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.410> actually

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
through a place that they can actually

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.270 
through a place that they can actually
go<00:00:55.860> through<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.070> first

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
go through so they don't so this first

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000 
go through so they don't so this first
design<00:00:59.579> works<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.180> has<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.510> two<00:01:00.840> block<00:01:01.379> gap<00:01:01.649> here

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
design works it has a two block gap here

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.630 
design works it has a two block gap here
with<00:01:02.250> half<00:01:02.520> slabs<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.640> actually

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
with half slabs but it's not actually

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.359 
with half slabs but it's not actually
two<00:01:05.850> blocks<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.619> more<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.040> one

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
two blocks really it's one more like one

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.210 
two blocks really it's one more like one
and<00:01:08.580> two<00:01:08.670> half<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:10.170> full<00:01:10.710> block<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and two half so one here full block and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.510 
and two half so one here full block and
two<00:01:11.850> half<00:01:12.210> blocks<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.110> walk<00:01:13.320> through

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
two half blocks so you can walk through

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.700 
two half blocks so you can walk through
and<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.330> zombies<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.409> they

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and but the zombies what they do is they

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.609 
and but the zombies what they do is they
see<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.210> they<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.570> half<00:01:21.720> slabs<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.290> full

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
see this they see the half slabs as full

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.710 
see this they see the half slabs as full
blocks<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.570> block

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
blocks so they see it as a one block

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600 
blocks so they see it as a one block
hole<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.100> can't<00:01:26.400> walk

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
hole and they see that they can't walk

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.440 
hole and they see that they can't walk
through<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.770> put<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.159> zombie<00:01:30.119> here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
through here so if I put a zombie here

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.590 
through here so if I put a zombie here
and<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:31.619> villager<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.220> he'll<00:01:32.850> try<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> get<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and a villager here he'll try to get to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.149 
and a villager here he'll try to get to
the<00:01:33.689> villager<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.200> he<00:01:34.409> won't<00:01:34.530> go<00:01:34.710> past<00:01:34.860> here

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the villager but he won't go past here

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.350 
the villager but he won't go past here
because<00:01:35.369> he<00:01:35.490> doesn't<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.909> he<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.150> go

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
because he doesn't think he can go

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.740 
because he doesn't think he can go
through<00:01:36.770> now<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.979> design<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:39.180> simple

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
through now this design is really simple

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.580 
through now this design is really simple
to<00:01:39.840> build<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.140> stuff

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to build and stuff

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
to build and stuff
but<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> doesn't<00:01:41.520> work<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.909> spiders<00:01:42.450> because

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
but it doesn't work with spiders because

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
but it doesn't work with spiders because
spiders<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.829> able<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.369> through<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
spiders will be able to go through the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.639 
spiders will be able to go through the
one<00:01:44.790> black<00:01:44.939> hole<00:01:45.119> unless<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:46.049> only<00:01:46.229> make<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
one black hole unless you only make it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.760 
one black hole unless you only make it
one<00:01:46.829> wide<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:48.290> I'll<00:01:49.290> explain<00:01:49.560> why<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
one wide which I'll explain why you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.660 
one wide which I'll explain why you
don't<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.189> later<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:51.600> design<00:01:52.670> what

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
don't want to do later this design what

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.300 
don't want to do later this design what
it's<00:01:54.140> uses<00:01:55.140> fences<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.619> nether<00:01:55.770> brick<00:01:55.920> fences

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it's uses fences and nether brick fences

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.719 
it's uses fences and nether brick fences
to<00:01:56.430> create<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> hole<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.810> through

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
to create a hole that you can go through

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.359 
to create a hole that you can go through
pretty<00:01:59.729> easily<00:02:00.290> but<00:02:01.290> zombies<00:02:01.500> can't<00:02:02.250> go

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
pretty easily but zombies can't go

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.219 
pretty easily but zombies can't go
through<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.570> did<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> same<00:02:03.960> thing

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
through there so if I did the same thing

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.139 
through there so if I did the same thing
the<00:02:04.469> zombie<00:02:04.829> does<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:05.310> see<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> hole

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the zombie does not see that as a hole

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.550 
the zombie does not see that as a hole
that<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.570> walk<00:02:06.750> through<00:02:06.780> even<00:02:07.380> though<00:02:07.439> if

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that you can walk through even though if

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.419 
that you can walk through even though if
you<00:02:07.649> push<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> through

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
you push it through

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.350 
you push it through
I<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:09.270> show<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.509> if

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
I can show you if

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.750 
I can show you if
like<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.530> pushes<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.190> me<00:02:15.340> through<00:02:15.550> he

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
like that if I pushes on me through he

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.560 
like that if I pushes on me through he
will<00:02:15.910> actually<00:02:16.240> be<00:02:16.300> able<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.510> get<00:02:16.630> through

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
will actually be able to get through

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.740 
will actually be able to get through
like<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.340> they're<00:02:21.520> AI<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.850> does<00:02:22.630> not

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
like that but they're AI just does not

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.870 
like that but they're AI just does not
see<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.050> as<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> valid<00:02:23.500> place<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.310> go<00:02:24.400> through

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.060 

so<00:02:27.880> these<00:02:28.330> two<00:02:28.600> designs<00:02:28.960> what<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.620> really<00:02:29.860> don't

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
so these two designs what I really don't

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.980 
so these two designs what I really don't
like<00:02:30.160> about<00:02:30.220> them<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:31.020> they're<00:02:32.020> very<00:02:33.990> small

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
like about them is they're very small

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.100 
like about them is they're very small
like<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.650> has<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.550> limited<00:02:37.240> size<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.870> very

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
like this has a limited size of very

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.600 
like this has a limited size of very
small<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.710> it's<00:02:38.920> hard<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.130> walk<00:02:39.340> through

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
small and it's hard to walk through

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.440 
small and it's hard to walk through
sometimes<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.420> this<00:02:41.290> design<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.800> really<00:02:41.980> ugly

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
sometimes and this design is really ugly

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.120 
sometimes and this design is really ugly
now<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.600> design<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:46.060> also<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:47.170> has<00:02:47.830> a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
now this design it's also it has a

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.330 
now this design it's also it has a
unlimited<00:02:48.700> width<00:02:48.940> but<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.270> limited<00:02:49.720> height<00:02:50.340> and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
unlimited width but a limited height and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.830 
unlimited width but a limited height and
it<00:02:51.520> doesn't<00:02:51.790> work<00:02:51.850> with<00:02:52.060> spiders<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.630> don't

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
it doesn't work with spiders so I don't

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.790 
it doesn't work with spiders so I don't
really<00:02:53.110> like<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:54.840> then<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:55.990> is<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.410> design

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
really like it and then this is a design

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.340 
really like it and then this is a design
I<00:02:57.010> found<00:02:57.220> on<00:02:57.340> reddit<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.870> can<00:02:58.990> put<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.140> link

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
I found on reddit and I can put a link

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
reddit post if I manage to find it if I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.260 
reddit post if I manage to find it if I
can<00:03:03.280> then<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:03.959> probably<00:03:04.959> won't<00:03:05.140> but<00:03:06.150> well<00:03:07.150> how

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
can then I probably won't but well how

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.520 
can then I probably won't but well how
it<00:03:07.390> works<00:03:07.600> is<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:09.490> have<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:10.110> fence<00:03:11.110> or<00:03:11.350> called

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
it works is if I have a fence or called

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.320 
it works is if I have a fence or called
some<00:03:11.709> wall<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.070> cannot<00:03:12.340> jump<00:03:12.640> on<00:03:12.790> top<00:03:12.940> because

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
some wall I cannot jump on top because

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.120 
some wall I cannot jump on top because
the<00:03:13.450> hitbox<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:14.080> one<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> half<00:03:14.650> blocks<00:03:14.800> tall

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
the hitbox is one and a half blocks tall

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.729 
the hitbox is one and a half blocks tall
but<00:03:15.730> if<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:15.880> could<00:03:16.060> put<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.269> carpet<00:03:16.630> on<00:03:16.750> top<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:17.200> can

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
but if I could put a carpet on top I can

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.259 
but if I could put a carpet on top I can
actually<00:03:17.860> jump<00:03:18.220> on<00:03:18.430> top<00:03:18.580> of<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.760> carpet<00:03:18.940> first

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
actually jump on top of the carpet first

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.590 
actually jump on top of the carpet first
and<00:03:19.570> then<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.170> can<00:03:20.680> walk<00:03:20.950> up<00:03:21.269> onto<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.360> fence

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
and then I can walk up onto the fence

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.830 
and then I can walk up onto the fence
and<00:03:22.810> then<00:03:22.959> walk<00:03:23.110> over<00:03:23.580> but<00:03:24.580> thing<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.269> mobs

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
and then walk over but thing is mobs

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.729 
and then walk over but thing is mobs
don't<00:03:26.170> see<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:27.060> carpet<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.720> valid<00:03:29.110> place<00:03:29.350> that

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
don't see a carpet as a valid place that

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.560 
don't see a carpet as a valid place that
they<00:03:29.890> can<00:03:30.070> actually<00:03:30.280> walk<00:03:30.910> on<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.300> they<00:03:31.420> don't

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
they can actually walk on so they don't

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.449 
they can actually walk on so they don't
see<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:31.989> as<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.170> thing<00:03:32.500> they<00:03:32.680> can<00:03:32.830> walk<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.040> and

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
see it as the thing they can walk on and

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.030 
see it as the thing they can walk on and
then<00:03:34.090> they<00:03:34.330> just<00:03:34.600> see<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.840> fence<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.470> they

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
then they just see the fence and they

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.350 
then they just see the fence and they
don't<00:03:36.220> think<00:03:36.310> they<00:03:36.519> can<00:03:36.550> jump<00:03:36.820> over<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.120> which

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
don't think they can jump over it which

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.070 
don't think they can jump over it which
they<00:03:37.570> can't<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.700> once<00:03:40.239> again<00:03:40.330> if<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.630> put<00:03:40.810> a

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
they can't so once again if I put a

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.680 
they can't so once again if I put a
zombie<00:03:41.500> here<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.010> villager<00:03:42.610> here<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.330> zombie

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
zombie here and villager here the zombie

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.780 
zombie here and villager here the zombie
cannot<00:03:43.900> get<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.170> villager<00:03:44.560> except<00:03:45.550> if<00:03:45.670> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
cannot get the villager except if the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.610 
cannot get the villager except if the
villager<00:03:46.120> climbs<00:03:46.540> over<00:03:46.720> because<00:03:47.380> if<00:03:47.470> it's

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
villager climbs over because if it's

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.970 
villager climbs over because if it's
stairs<00:03:47.860> here<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.400> usually<00:03:48.610> get<00:03:48.940> out<00:03:49.980> you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
stairs here so you usually get out you

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.400 
stairs here so you usually get out you
can<00:03:51.100> also<00:03:51.220> move<00:03:51.400> stairs<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:51.880> now<00:03:52.870> this<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.320> a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
can also move stairs so now this is a

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.150 
can also move stairs so now this is a
really<00:03:53.530> cool<00:03:53.739> design<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.489> came<00:03:54.550> up<00:03:54.760> with

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
really cool design that I came up with

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.050 
really cool design that I came up with
one<00:03:57.160> thing<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.370> should<00:03:57.430> mention<00:03:57.550> about<00:03:57.880> this

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
one thing I should mention about this

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.030 
one thing I should mention about this
first<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.600> you<00:03:58.989> can<00:03:59.290> expand<00:03:59.709> it<00:03:59.830> to<00:03:59.860> an

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
first is that you can expand it to an

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.949 
first is that you can expand it to an
infinite<00:04:00.430> width<00:04:00.670> however<00:04:01.330> you<00:04:01.630> do<00:04:01.720> have<00:04:01.840> to

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
infinite width however you do have to

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.910 
infinite width however you do have to
jump<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.440> get<00:04:02.560> up<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.959> my<00:04:05.440> design<00:04:05.739> is

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
jump to get up it this my design is

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.710 
jump to get up it this my design is
really<00:04:06.040> cool<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.519> can<00:04:06.549> expand<00:04:07.299> it<00:04:07.390> infinitely

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
really cool you can expand it infinitely

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.690 
really cool you can expand it infinitely
high<00:04:07.989> infinitely<00:04:08.530> wide<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:09.430> doesn't<00:04:09.640> even

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
high infinitely wide it doesn't even

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.100 
high infinitely wide it doesn't even
have<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:10.030> be<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.150> doorway<00:04:10.420> as<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> matter<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:10.900> fact

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
have to be a doorway as a matter of fact

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.070 
have to be a doorway as a matter of fact
you<00:04:11.260> can<00:04:11.380> just<00:04:11.530> be<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> flat<00:04:11.890> area<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.959> how<00:04:13.959> it

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
you can just be a flat area and how it

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.680 
you can just be a flat area and how it
works<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.590> there<00:04:15.459> assigns<00:04:15.850> suspending

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
works is there assigns suspending

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.719 
works is there assigns suspending
carpets<00:04:17.109> now<00:04:17.650> remember<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.310> said<00:04:18.400> that

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
carpets now remember that I said that

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.170 
carpets now remember that I said that
moms<00:04:19.150> do<00:04:19.359> not<00:04:19.510> see<00:04:19.660> carpets<00:04:20.169> as<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:21.489> thing<00:04:22.030> they

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
moms do not see carpets as a thing they

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.440 
moms do not see carpets as a thing they
can<00:04:22.330> walk<00:04:22.600> on<00:04:22.810> so

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
can walk on so

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.950 
can walk on so
all<00:04:23.480> they<00:04:23.600> see<00:04:23.660> is<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:24.050> big<00:04:24.260> hole<00:04:24.440> here<00:04:24.880> they<00:04:25.880> see

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
all they see is a big hole here they see

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.870 
all they see is a big hole here they see
this<00:04:26.960> they<00:04:27.620> see<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:28.100> big<00:04:28.250> hole<00:04:28.430> but<00:04:28.790> they

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
this they see the big hole but they

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.390 
this they see the big hole but they
don't<00:04:29.060> see<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.510> carpet<00:04:30.220> Africa<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.310> build

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
don't see the carpet Africa to build

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.280 
don't see the carpet Africa to build
this<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.730> do<00:04:31.790> need<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.090> make<00:04:32.120> this<00:04:32.630> hole<00:04:32.870> at

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
this you do need to make this hole at

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.260 
this you do need to make this hole at
least<00:04:33.560> three<00:04:33.740> blocks<00:04:33.950> deep<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.700> mobs<00:04:34.910> see

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
least three blocks deep so the mobs see

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.430 
least three blocks deep so the mobs see
it<00:04:35.360> as<00:04:35.510> a<00:04:35.540> hole<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.990> they<00:04:36.110> shouldn't<00:04:36.320> walk

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
it as a hole that they shouldn't walk

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.830 
it as a hole that they shouldn't walk
into<00:04:37.510> now<00:04:38.510> if<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:40.130> put<00:04:40.460> his<00:04:40.550> on<00:04:40.700> me<00:04:40.880> here<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.360> a

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
into now if I put his on me here and a

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.680 
into now if I put his on me here and a
villager<00:04:42.200> here<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:43.100> zombie<00:04:43.490> sees<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.910> hole<00:04:44.210> he

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
villager here the zombie sees a hole he

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.840 
villager here the zombie sees a hole he
sees<00:04:44.990> he<00:04:45.560> does<00:04:45.830> not<00:04:45.920> think<00:04:46.160> he<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.340> cross<00:04:46.670> this

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
sees he does not think he can cross this

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.370 
sees he does not think he can cross this
hole<00:04:47.030> even<00:04:47.390> though<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.750> doesn't<00:04:48.140> really<00:04:48.230> exist

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
hole even though it doesn't really exist

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.930 
hole even though it doesn't really exist
and<00:04:48.940> then<00:04:49.940> he<00:04:50.270> will<00:04:50.570> not<00:04:50.780> go<00:04:51.530> through<00:04:51.910> which<00:04:52.910> is

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
and then he will not go through which is

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.520 
and then he will not go through which is
pretty<00:04:53.270> cool<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.690> then<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.170> can<00:04:54.290> make<00:04:54.410> this

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
pretty cool and then you can make this

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.780 
pretty cool and then you can make this
as<00:04:54.680> big<00:04:54.710> as<00:04:54.950> you<00:04:55.040> want<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:57.580> another<00:04:58.580> cool

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
as big as you want and another cool

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.610 
as big as you want and another cool
thing<00:04:58.850> about<00:04:59.030> this<00:04:59.300> is<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.720> works<00:04:59.960> with

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
thing about this is it works with

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.110 
thing about this is it works with
spiders<00:05:01.340> so<00:05:01.750> if<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.930> go<00:05:03.260> in<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.620> serve<00:05:03.830> Walt<00:05:04.340> it

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
spiders so if I go in to serve Walt it

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.470 
spiders so if I go in to serve Walt it
works<00:05:05.330> with<00:05:05.540> spiders<00:05:06.610> except<00:05:07.610> if<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.210> spider

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
works with spiders except if the spider

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.840 
works with spiders except if the spider
does<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:09.230> jump<00:05:09.590> attack<00:05:09.890> because<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.430> spiders

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
does the jump attack because the spiders

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.880 
does the jump attack because the spiders
do<00:05:11.090> not<00:05:11.270> actually<00:05:11.510> count<00:05:11.990> cliffs<00:05:12.440> in<00:05:12.680> when

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
do not actually count cliffs in when

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.470 
do not actually count cliffs in when
they<00:05:12.980> do<00:05:13.040> jump<00:05:13.370> attack<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:13.850> they<00:05:13.970> will<00:05:14.120> do<00:05:14.240> jump

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
they do jump attack so they will do jump

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.420 
they do jump attack so they will do jump
attack<00:05:14.720> into<00:05:14.960> lava<00:05:15.260> into<00:05:15.590> cliffs<00:05:16.010> that'll<00:05:16.310> do

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
attack into lava into cliffs that'll do

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.730 
attack into lava into cliffs that'll do
it<00:05:16.550> into<00:05:16.790> whatever<00:05:16.970> so<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:18.020> if<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.350> they<00:05:18.680> do

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
it into whatever so that if the they do

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.290 
it into whatever so that if the they do
do<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.220> jump<00:05:19.430> attack<00:05:19.670> they<00:05:19.850> will<00:05:20.000> be<00:05:20.090> able<00:05:20.210> to

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
do the jump attack they will be able to

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.220 
do the jump attack they will be able to
get<00:05:20.390> in<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:21.790> attack<00:05:22.790> you

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
get in and attack you

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
get in and attack you
however<00:05:24.230> that's<00:05:24.410> one<00:05:24.560> good<00:05:24.830> thing<00:05:24.860> about<00:05:24.980> this

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
however that's one good thing about this

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.980 
however that's one good thing about this
design<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.730> spiders<00:05:26.150> will<00:05:26.330> not<00:05:26.450> be<00:05:26.660> able<00:05:26.750> to

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
design is spiders will not be able to

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.370 
design is spiders will not be able to
attack<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.620> because<00:05:28.720> we'll<00:05:29.720> just<00:05:29.750> file<00:05:30.080> here

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
attack you because we'll just file here

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.140 
attack you because we'll just file here
they<00:05:31.100> well<00:05:31.790> maybe<00:05:32.120> they<00:05:32.270> can<00:05:32.510> never<00:05:33.350> mind<00:05:33.650> I

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
they well maybe they can never mind I

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.310 
they well maybe they can never mind I
was<00:05:35.150> thinking<00:05:35.210> they<00:05:35.510> get<00:05:35.660> stuck<00:05:35.960> on<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.200> edge

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
was thinking they get stuck on the edge

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.840 
was thinking they get stuck on the edge
of<00:05:36.470> the<00:05:36.530> carpet<00:05:36.890> but<00:05:37.070> apparently<00:05:37.550> that's<00:05:37.730> not

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
of the carpet but apparently that's not

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.020 
of the carpet but apparently that's not
the<00:05:37.970> case<00:05:38.920> so<00:05:39.920> anyways<00:05:40.460> some<00:05:40.790> of<00:05:40.940> the

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
the case so anyways some of the

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.170 
the case so anyways some of the
applications<00:05:41.660> of<00:05:41.840> this<00:05:42.110> design<00:05:42.440> is<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:43.640> horse

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
applications of this design is a horse

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.930 
applications of this design is a horse
stable<00:05:44.510> here<00:05:44.960> now<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.800> horse<00:05:46.250> there's

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
stable here now the horse there's

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.230 
stable here now the horse there's
actually<00:05:48.010> the<00:05:49.010> signs<00:05:49.310> underneath<00:05:49.790> here<00:05:50.090> so

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
actually the signs underneath here so

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.100 
actually the signs underneath here so

a way to get out but if you get all the
horse<00:05:55.670> you<00:05:56.240> can<00:05:56.360> just<00:05:56.540> write<00:05:56.810> about<00:05:56.900> whenever

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200

you<00:05:57.380> want<00:05:57.530> which<00:05:58.490> is<00:05:58.610> pretty<00:05:58.760> cool

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
you want which is pretty cool

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
and also here I have a bridge so if I

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.660 
and also here I have a bridge so if I
put<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.240> uses<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:05.930> same<00:06:06.110> technique<00:06:06.500> here<00:06:06.800> put

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
put it uses the same technique here put

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.540 
put it uses the same technique here put
some<00:06:07.700> zombies<00:06:08.270> go<00:06:08.780> into<00:06:08.960> survival<00:06:09.320> I'll<00:06:10.220> tack

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
some zombies go into survival I'll tack

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.110 
some zombies go into survival I'll tack
me<00:06:11.620> except<00:06:12.620> if<00:06:12.890> I<00:06:13.070> walk<00:06:13.250> onto<00:06:13.430> here<00:06:13.670> they<00:06:13.940> will

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
me except if I walk onto here they will

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.370 
me except if I walk onto here they will
not<00:06:14.180> attack<00:06:14.390> me<00:06:14.630> anymore<00:06:14.810> because<00:06:15.020> I<00:06:15.140> don't

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
not attack me anymore because I don't

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.970 
not attack me anymore because I don't
see<00:06:15.740> that<00:06:15.920> as<00:06:16.100> something<00:06:16.370> they<00:06:16.700> can<00:06:16.820> walk<00:06:16.970> on

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.100 

so<00:06:20.980> I<00:06:21.370> think<00:06:21.490> that<00:06:21.850> about<00:06:22.180> wraps<00:06:22.390> up<00:06:22.810> today's

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
so I think that about wraps up today's

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.870 
so I think that about wraps up today's
video<00:06:23.410> it's<00:06:23.710> pretty<00:06:24.040> obvious<00:06:24.400> how<00:06:24.550> to<00:06:24.610> build

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880
