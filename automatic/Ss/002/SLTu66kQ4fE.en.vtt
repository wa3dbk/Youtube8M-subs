00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
right but short lifespan you know our

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.700 
right but short lifespan you know our
average<00:02:05.430> lifespan<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.939> 20<00:02:06.299> years<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.560> average

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
average lifespan was 20 years on average

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.760 
average lifespan was 20 years on average
our<00:02:08.160> breeding<00:02:08.459> age<00:02:08.759> yeah<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.259> lifespan

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
our breeding age yeah so lifespan

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.500 
our breeding age yeah so lifespan
doesn't<00:02:11.069> set<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> lived<00:02:11.520> at<00:02:11.640> 70<00:02:12.030> right<00:02:12.270> so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
doesn't set up to lived at 70 right so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.730 
doesn't set up to lived at 70 right so
like

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
like

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.220 
like

everybody<00:03:01.250> have<00:03:01.520> three<00:03:01.820> kids<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.210> they

everybody have three kids that they

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.670 
everybody have three kids that they
can't<00:03:02.540> afford<00:03:02.630> all<00:03:03.050> they<00:03:03.170> know<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.320> they<00:03:03.500> got<00:03:03.620> a

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
can't afford all they know is they got a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.230 
can't afford all they know is they got a
boner<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.280> they<00:03:04.370> want<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.580> put<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.880> somewhat

sander<00:03:05.990> drum<00:03:06.290> good<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.460> I<00:03:07.760> think<00:03:08.510> that's<00:03:08.840> why

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
sander drum good so I think that's why

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.900 
sander drum good so I think that's why
they<00:03:09.350> have<00:03:09.560> more<00:03:09.800> kids<00:03:10.100> but<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.520> does<00:03:10.730> not

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
they have more kids but it does not

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.760 
they have more kids but it does not
answer<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.450> question<00:03:11.960> is<00:03:12.110> why<00:03:12.320> do<00:03:12.380> they<00:03:12.590> rate

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
answer the question is why do they rate

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.890 
answer the question is why do they rate
for<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.040> say<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.340> again<00:03:13.460> you<00:03:13.600> recreate<00:03:14.600> your

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
for this say it again you recreate your

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.350 
for this say it again you recreate your
drug<00:03:15.770> lipitor<00:03:15.920> your<00:03:16.550> breeding<00:03:16.790> environment

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
drug lipitor your breeding environment

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.990 
drug lipitor your breeding environment
yeah<00:03:17.710> what<00:03:18.710> what<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.220> advantage<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.850> that

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
yeah what what is the advantage to that

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.430 
yeah what what is the advantage to that
from<00:03:20.300> an<00:03:20.390> evolutionary<00:03:20.480> sample<00:03:21.170> from<00:03:21.320> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
from an evolutionary sample from a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.780 
from an evolutionary sample from a
simple<00:03:21.680> evolutionary<00:03:21.890> standpoint<00:03:22.400> if<00:03:22.700> you

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
simple evolutionary standpoint if you

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.790 
simple evolutionary standpoint if you
reach<00:03:22.940> breeding<00:03:23.390> age<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:24.170> want<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.470> recreate

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
reach breeding age you want to recreate

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.010 
reach breeding age you want to recreate
the<00:03:25.040> breeding<00:03:25.340> environment<00:03:25.900> all<00:03:26.900> right

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
the breeding environment all right

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.650 
the breeding environment all right
interesting<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.430> what<00:03:28.580> Robert<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.060> saying<00:03:29.360> and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
interesting so what Robert is saying and

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.560 
interesting so what Robert is saying and
I'll<00:03:29.900> get<00:03:30.080> back<00:03:30.110> to<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.500> animal<00:03:30.830> kingdom<00:03:31.280> is

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
I'll get back to the animal kingdom is

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.300 
I'll get back to the animal kingdom is
animals<00:03:32.570> all<00:03:32.780> do<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.140> same<00:03:33.170> thing<00:03:33.680> exactly<00:03:33.980> i

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
animals all do the same thing exactly i

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.670 
animals all do the same thing exactly i
mean<00:03:34.340> they<00:03:34.610> go<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.510> den<00:03:35.810> they<00:03:36.170> go<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.410> the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
mean they go to the den they go to the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.560 
mean they go to the den they go to the
nest<00:03:37.160> they<00:03:37.460> go<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.670> wherever<00:03:37.940> they<00:03:38.150> go<00:03:38.180> and

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
nest they go to wherever they go and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.080 
nest they go to wherever they go and
they<00:03:38.660> all<00:03:39.200> do<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.590> same<00:03:39.620> same<00:03:40.550> thing<00:03:40.820> so<00:03:41.030> if

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
they all do the same same thing so if

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.840 
they all do the same same thing so if
your<00:03:41.240> parents<00:03:41.810> were<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:43.160> know<00:03:43.280> getting<00:03:43.580> it<00:03:43.730> on

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
your parents were you know getting it on

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.060 
your parents were you know getting it on
and<00:03:44.600> had<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.960> when<00:03:45.170> they<00:03:45.260> were<00:03:45.320> too<00:03:45.560> young<00:03:45.590> or

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
and had you when they were too young or

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.100 
and had you when they were too young or
had<00:03:46.280> too<00:03:46.460> many<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:46.970> or<00:03:47.090> whatever<00:03:47.270> when

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
had too many of you or whatever when

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.460 
had too many of you or whatever when
you're<00:03:48.260> 15<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:49.640> biological<00:03:50.630> urge<00:03:50.780> kicks<00:03:51.230> in

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
you're 15 that biological urge kicks in

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.290 
you're 15 that biological urge kicks in
to<00:03:51.560> reproduce<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.460> want<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.120> the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
to reproduce and you want to have the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.300 
to reproduce and you want to have the
same<00:03:53.480> bad<00:03:53.720> rust<00:03:54.020> color<00:03:54.290> carpet<00:03:54.800> and<00:03:55.010> have<00:03:55.160> it

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
same bad rust color carpet and have it

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.640 
same bad rust color carpet and have it
in<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.430> same<00:03:55.640> trailer<00:03:56.060> home<00:03:56.270> and<00:03:56.750> do<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.470> same

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
in the same trailer home and do the same

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.770 
in the same trailer home and do the same
what's<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.580> environment<00:03:59.240> other<00:03:59.480> with

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
what's the environment other with

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.210 
what's the environment other with
necessarily<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> biological<00:04:00.860> urge<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:01.070> think

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
necessarily a biological urge I think

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.620 
necessarily a biological urge I think
it's<00:04:01.310> trained<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:02.090> know<00:04:02.180> what<00:04:02.420> is<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
it's trained you know what is the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.360 
it's trained you know what is the

teleology behind that why is that why

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.020 
teleology behind that why is that why
does<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.470> improve<00:04:06.470> survival<00:04:06.980> well<00:04:07.700> unlit

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
does that improve survival well unlit

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.490 
does that improve survival well unlit
improve<00:04:08.360> survival<00:04:08.660> but<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.020> just<00:04:09.170> increases

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
improve survival but it just increases

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.960 
improve survival but it just increases
the<00:04:09.890> chances<00:04:10.220> you're<00:04:10.400> going<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.580> recreate

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
the chances you're going to recreate

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.270 
the chances you're going to recreate
your<00:04:11.390> breeding<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.140> but<00:04:12.380> what<00:04:12.530> drew<00:04:12.770> is<00:04:12.890> looking

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
your breeding I but what drew is looking

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.250 
your breeding I but what drew is looking
for<00:04:13.550> is<00:04:13.790> from<00:04:14.030> an<00:04:14.150> evolutionary<00:04:14.300> standpoint

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
for is from an evolutionary standpoint

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.820 
for is from an evolutionary standpoint
why<00:04:15.950> because<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.030> seems<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.540> us<00:04:17.650> sitting<00:04:18.650> here

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
why because it seems to us sitting here

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.440 
why because it seems to us sitting here
night<00:04:19.010> after<00:04:19.190> night<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.730> this<00:04:19.880> country<00:04:20.150> is

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
night after night that this country is

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.090 
night after night that this country is
coming<00:04:20.960> apart<00:04:21.229> at<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.410> seams<00:04:21.530> because

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
coming apart at the seams because

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.920 
coming apart at the seams because
there's<00:04:22.550> too<00:04:22.700> much<00:04:22.850> of<00:04:23.060> this<00:04:23.150> going<00:04:23.390> on<00:04:23.660> I

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
there's too much of this going on I

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.870 
there's too much of this going on I
think<00:04:24.440> it's<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.590> government<00:04:25.040> right<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.610> blame

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
think it's the government right I blame

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.320 
think it's the government right I blame
the<00:04:25.940> government

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
the government

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.969 
the government
the<00:04:26.539> logical<00:04:26.870> standpoint<00:04:27.110> it's<00:04:27.470> awful<00:04:27.860> but

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
the logical standpoint it's awful but

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.219 
the logical standpoint it's awful but
from<00:04:28.159> a<00:04:28.250> straight<00:04:28.819> breeding<00:04:29.539> perspective

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
from a straight breeding perspective

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.789 
from a straight breeding perspective
it's<00:04:30.379> perfect<00:04:31.220> right<00:04:31.610> now
