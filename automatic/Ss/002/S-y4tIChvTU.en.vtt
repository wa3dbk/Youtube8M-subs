00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.350
 it is very important to point the folio of the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.840
 activation since it will serve us for 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.790
 release it later also we 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.010

 previously the cell phone us 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.850
 we selected realizon then we 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.700
 ask if we had already tried 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.680
 Activate the cell phone in our case 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.930
 we wrote you no and the model 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.930
 we wrote htc thunder volts 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.170
 already to finalize we consulted the number 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.530
 which is the genre of activation in the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.530
 main screen of www of points the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.210
 active dotcom we position ourselves below 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.910
 of the automated form of 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.100
 activations in the yellow box that 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.410
 says activations query click here 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.570
 we click on it if the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.430
 activation number will show us a 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.590
 notice that says activation still 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.540
 is in process if the activation is 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.610
 generates the number of the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.100
 activation and a series of steps for the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.810
 simple cell phone programming but 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.430
 if our cell is 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.280
 blocked we must perform the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.530
 programming via usb if we do not know how 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.630
 do we have a help forum where 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.730
 you can look for the schedules now 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.010
 resolved or ask about the new 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.320
 schedules that are not just visit 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.730
 forum single point active dotcom 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.200
 I repeat forum point is what active dotcom 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.720
 remember the law when they notice 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.400
 we fill the automated form in it 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.140
 mentions that to request the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.090
 activation first you have to inform us 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.700
 in the forum on the programming of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.080
 cell phones and then request the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.030
 active 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.040
 and then you have to program it to 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.990
 finish the activation you have to reload 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.390
 time on the same day that it 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.850
 the numbers otherwise generated a 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.950
 60 in fort will cancel on the line only 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.710
 can be activated by going personally 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.380
 to a customer service center where 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.840
 they did not program the cell phone they will only generate 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.609
 a high in prepayment for the line them 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.920
 I repeat, you have to know how to program the 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.720
 cellular is 0 should load the same good 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.390
 that the activation number is received 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.280
 so that the whole line is not canceled 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.710
 it must be done the same day it is 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.570
 they receive the numbers of the activation if 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.970
 they do not do it the next day it 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.970
 will cancel the line they can only be activated 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.310
 in a customer service center 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.900
 personally he is active he thanks his 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.000
 time to watch this video and 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.950
 remember that if you do not know how to program your 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.530
 cellular because it's blocked can 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.750
