sansamp<00:00:45.050> bass<00:00:45.530> driver<00:00:45.830> deluxe<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:46.820> know<00:00:46.910> but

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
sansamp bass driver deluxe you know but

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.030 
sansamp bass driver deluxe you know but
I<00:00:47.090> don't<00:00:47.210> have<00:00:47.540> one

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
I don't have one

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.120 
I don't have one
basically<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.880> use<00:00:50.330> that<00:00:50.600> because<00:00:51.130> something

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
basically I use that because something

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.010 
basically I use that because something
that's<00:00:52.250> really<00:00:52.430> interesting<00:00:52.610> about<00:00:53.020> mixing

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
that's really interesting about mixing

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.530 
that's really interesting about mixing
is<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:55.010> same<00:00:55.520> principle<00:00:55.730> if<00:00:56.150> you<00:00:56.180> record

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
is the same principle if you record

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.940 
is the same principle if you record
guitars<00:00:57.110> loads<00:00:57.560> again<00:00:57.830> yeah<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:59.390> can<00:00:59.770> you<00:01:00.770> can

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
guitars loads again yeah you can you can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.770 
guitars loads again yeah you can you can
like<00:01:01.130> mold<00:01:01.520> them<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:02.390> if<00:01:02.480> there's<00:01:02.600> too<00:01:02.750> much

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
like mold them but if there's too much

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.109 
like mold them but if there's too much
gain<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.290> can't<00:01:03.470> take<00:01:03.650> it<00:01:03.770> away<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.000> can

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
gain you can't take it away so you can

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.490 
gain you can't take it away so you can
always<00:01:05.240> add<00:01:05.449> it<00:01:05.690> but<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:05.930> can<00:01:06.050> never<00:01:06.200> take<00:01:06.350> it

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
always add it but you can never take it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.859 
always add it but you can never take it
away<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.770> same<00:01:06.979> base<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.700> if<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.450> record<00:01:08.750> a

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
away it's the same base so if I record a

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.960 
away it's the same base so if I record a
bass<00:01:09.050> turn<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:09.619> like<00:01:09.860> that's<00:01:10.220> quite<00:01:10.430> not

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
bass turn that I like that's quite not

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.680 
bass turn that I like that's quite not
very<00:01:11.210> bassy

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
very bassy

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.570 
very bassy
I've<00:01:11.869> come<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.229> add<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.680> frequencies<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.400> give

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
I've come to add the frequencies to give

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.880 
I've come to add the frequencies to give
it<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.820> rounded<00:01:14.270> bass<00:01:14.540> tone<00:01:14.930> yeah<00:01:15.410> but<00:01:15.740> if<00:01:15.830> I

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
it the rounded bass tone yeah but if I

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.130 
it the rounded bass tone yeah but if I
recorded<00:01:16.220> with<00:01:16.340> loads<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.700> bass<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.690> right

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
recorded with loads of bass is a right

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.960 
recorded with loads of bass is a right
