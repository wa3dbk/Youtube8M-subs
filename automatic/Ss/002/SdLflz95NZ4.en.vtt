00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.350

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.609
 they have a diagram with all the measures 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 on my site there is a link in the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.180
 description of the video or you can click 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.790
 here where he says crafts for all 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 net point let's start with the drawer 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.520
 and we are going to adhere the parts we begin 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.520
 by the sides 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:01:01.430
 and then the next lateral and then the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.430
 front and the back 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.670
 in the same way let's do the other 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.310
 drawer once the two drawers are ready 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.320
 we went to make the shelf we are going to 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 mark on the sides 2 centimeters 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.200
 from the edge to be able to do the part 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.200
 curve 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.909
 we help ourselves with a plate to make the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.909
 part of the end in this way 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.759
 and we are going to cut it with a cutter 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.350
 the first one that we cut is going to 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.040
 use as a mold to do it exactly 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.040
 same in the second 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.860
 already having the two sides cut 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.420
 let's move on to adhere we're going to 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.420
 stick on the sides of the rectangle 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.819
 once the two sides are adhered 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.939
 let's move on to adhere the part of 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.939
 behind 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.430
 ah 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.790
 now we would have to calculate the 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.310
 instant location has to enter 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.430
 under the shelf the two drawers and go 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.160
 to leave from the edge down two 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.590
 centimeters as 8 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.710
 in this way where are we going to be able to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.000
 trace with the glue a line what 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.000
 same we will do on the sides 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.130
 once it is well located what 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.210
 we adhere well and let it dry 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.280
 little bit 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.510
 We can check that the drawers 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.510
 they fit perfectly 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.049
 Now let's move on to decorating to make 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.889
 the decoration we are going to adhere the paper 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.319
 decorative with stick glue let's go 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:18.859
 to place glue on the box and 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.430
 locate the decorative paper on it what 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.430
 we adhere well 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.989
 we do the same with the 2 drawers and 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.010
 we are going to place in the center a 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.420
 trinket this will serve as a little hand 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.459
 then we continue decorating the rest of the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.849
 box or shelves with the same paper 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.849
 decorative 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.450
 once we adhere around all 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.489
 the little box we would have to cut the 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.489
 leftovers in the curved part of the lateral 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.060
 ah 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.650
 We can also place decorative paper 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.860
 on the top shelf 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.269
 then to improve the termination 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.819
 we can cut strips of medium 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.519
 centimeter which is the thickness of the cardboard 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.109
 truman 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.009
 and we will adhere with the same 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.009
 glue in mud 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.370
 this we are going to do in all 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.970
 edges that look either from above or from 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.970
 the sides 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.099
 Once this is done we will place the 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.659
 boxes inside and we would be left 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.659
 finished our craft
