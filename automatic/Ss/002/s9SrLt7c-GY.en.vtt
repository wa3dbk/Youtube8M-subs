00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.540
 which for me is already in life 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.330
 all i have is what i'm with 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:39.739
 childhood itself began to do so far 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:48.290
 continue for me hockey is life all 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:52.010

00:00:48.290 --> 00:01:00.589
 that's all i do i eat sleep 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:03.830
 I breathe hockey as hockey gives to life on 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.620
 all my life they all wanted me unequivocally 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.750
 this life even is all that is not 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:15.040
 remember myself without him family hockey 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.040
 nothing else in my head 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.250
 for each person the main thing of his life 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.170
 is his family I have these symmetries 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.270
 it's all me which consists of mine 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.770
 close and take off that spend a large 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.830
 part of my time in the locker room and on 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.000
 the ice 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.000
 Sanya come on 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.440
 now the whole will be dragged for his beloved 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.440
 the car 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.590
 what is so hard to be there such I will become there 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.550
 such loads are all of us but it is with 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.840
 childhood is all as accumulates and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.200
 climb the ladder of politics century 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.330
 you go-go it already you step it 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.550
 reflecting on the fact that hard sought 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.280
 only to play any 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.810
 got up in the morning workout work every 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.930
 day. 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.520
 I quietly and did not see action childhood 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.010
 constant workouts workload 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:26.580
 fatigue school it every day I was 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.580
 five years I constantly comedies said 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.650
 10-15-20 you should still kobik 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.100
 put 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.160
 it is better 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.070
 never think that complexity is just 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:47.660
 I'm leaving I'm afraid that the most important thing here 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.660
 or higher if but not easy 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.250
 it takes a lot of work to try that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.250
 for conversations and stepping on yourself 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.850
 overcome and 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.230
 people do not see the back of the success of the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.030
 what remains behind the scene daily 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.239
 training on the ice in the gym 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.410
 Of course, psychologically it is very difficult 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.010
 can it be every day 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.590
 every nerkee does not fall below 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.880
 kinda always need to be in good shape 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.930
 always so difficult 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.340
 yourself always have to be that way 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.870
 but 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.670

 coaches must meet which we 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.290
 should trust the pen very always together 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.989
 in the same boat but the most important person 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.489
 our team man who should 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:12.189
