 studied here at in the university of 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.809
 deusto or computer engineering and root 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.769
 of a little bit of the presentation of 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.540
 final year project 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.430
 Well, I started working here

 you are coming then I started doing my 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.489
 doctorate in computer science also pass to

 mount together with other partners the company 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.539
 simple that is in our charge in the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.110
 nursery of technology-based companies 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.110
 of the city 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.220
 there is this kind of engineering 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.570
 They are very difficult but nothing is impossible 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.540
 with work accompaniment and desire to

 so they can do their projects at the end of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.310
 career or just so that the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.180
 interested in research on this 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.920
 you clones enough 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.870
 in the university of deusto offers us 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.970
 degrees of entrepreneurship as is the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.640
 kinito what used to be ingenuity

 it to create your own company with the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.780
 more engineering technologies 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.670
 informatics in deusto we have our 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.930
 teachers who come from outside 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.690
 companies and can always have a 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.460
 vision much more 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.500
 It is much more real than any other 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.950
 resort that does not tell experiences the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.950
 world of work 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.020
 the company that we have created is in the 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.120
 bookseller technology-based members of 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.620
 skillful stock very integrated by students 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.600
 that they can even carry out 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.090
 formative practices within those 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.750
 technology-based companies where 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.140
 are a bit on the crest of the wave of 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.060
 technologies and also also this nursery 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.530
 of companies that this fits is very much in 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.570
 contact with research groups 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.610
 of the faculty itself which makes 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.560
 an ecosystem is created that is very beautiful 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.090
 and very powerful that integrates both the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.700
 students as a 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.660
 researchers like their own 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.670
 people who work in companies 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.840
 and I could select one of the areas 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.910
 of the mascara 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.040
 you could assign an application and then 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.200
 automatically and at a certain time the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.290
 rumble would start to spin does not have it 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.930
 information of the network options I would say 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.060
 that a this computer that deals with 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.860
 facilitate reality to others through 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.110
 of new technologies and 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.080
 grounding designing new 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.290
 devices to improve the lives of 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.290
 the rest 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.460
 we try to give a little intelligence 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.680
 to everyday objects that in principle do not 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.210
 they have it in the coffee maker when it stays 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.130
 without tweeting water that is running out 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.080
 Water gives us information about the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.940
 consumption that you have made at the time of 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.980
 make coffee when it's time to be in 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.960
 I rest then a little the idea of ​​improving 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.750
 a little sustainability in the 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.610
 deusto university is innovation 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.830
 you can see how the knowledge that 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.560
 they will acquire during the race 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.920
 they end up in a real application that is 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.750
 opportunity consulting tools 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.640
 music financing spaces councils 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.620
 also and so run when carrying 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.840
 out the current dream you're not going to 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.310
 develop during your time student 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.790
 through different phrases can leave 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.790
 reality
