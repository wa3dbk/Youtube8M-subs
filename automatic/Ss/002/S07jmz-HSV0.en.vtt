00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello and welcome to the new and renewed 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.839
 guide to anpe's thymus in season 3 in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.910
 this time I am going to divide the guide into 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.309
 three parts first I will explain the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
 why this renewed day afterwards goes to 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.940
 be indicate the witt time that is 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.859
 will commonly take to go on to explain 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 certain tactics and positioning 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.630
 both online and in team fight or 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.850
 possible guns finally I'll let 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.850
 moons and masters currently use 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 as you know, thymus is a champion who 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.550
 commonly played as a hybrid ap 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.250
 ap and attack speed up does well 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.780
 little those ideas were wrong but 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.460
 with the ugly nerd that I have got to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 beginning of the season and the new 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.330
 objects that have been appearing I'm going to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.970
 recover a point in the speed of 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.070
 attack but with a lot of sense 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.350
 to start william to you there's no need 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.450
 keep in mind against what we play if 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.160
 we play control to sin and that is based on 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.150
 Do damage with skills in a short time 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.540
 He says 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.670
 leblanc it's best not to play team or if 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.130
 Still, he remains committed to the task 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 wait for you arm yourself with patience and buy yourself 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.210
 one bottle and three portions as you 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.670
 will provide an online support with which 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.570
 You can put the enemy without fear that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.850
 Bust you in pieces at level 3 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.880
 if you play against a character ml like 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.380
 rector chinchao or darius get in boots 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.180
 and three positions since these 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.860
 characters usually start with elixirs and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.990
 various nonsense that Koreans do 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 so a good dose of thymus them 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.869
 will teach to catch objects of truth the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.630
 next time with this basic idea we will go 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.640
 for the following items in this order 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.550
 unnecessarily large rod mask 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.360
 boots if we did not have them complete the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.390
 hat complete the magic boots 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.880
 hurricane complete the center mask of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.280
 empty and the last object what the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.869
 wins depends on the game normally 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.600
 we will take a sonia to troll a 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.560
 little people when they come for us 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.490
 waiting so the poison I do a little 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.590
 of effect and they die almost inadvertently 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.780
 to start the melee control game the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.690
 little is essential max and we will do the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.580
 ever since passive poison and 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.550
 Extra damage are critical to kill 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.080
 distracted enemy then max we will do the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.330
 cv to end with the w 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.069
 it is very important to first upload a 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.099
 decade skill to avoid possible 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.660
 great thanks to the active w 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.730
 It is also worth mentioning that this character 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.470
 is played with flash and turn on as 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.480
 I was commenting a moment ago against a 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.910
 vÃ©lez we just have to be very aggressive 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.709
 hit him as long as we can since 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.810
 the poison will take care of throwing 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.640
 back constantly 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.709
 if at low levels it comes for us 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.870
 we just have to throw the dart 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.180
 blinding to avoid damage and attack him without 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.060
 remorse our minions the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.520
 poison and the ignition is something against 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.080
 that almost nobody can still be there 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.959
 be very careful with characters like 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.340
 darius that can attract t since its 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.170
 damage is very large at the beginning of 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.790
 game for what we get by playing 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.550
 with him until he spends it without 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.920
 reach them this will be a good time 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.650
 to attack and show him that the size 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.630
 it's not everything against magicians 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.330
 you have to try something similar but not 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.890
 It is so aggressive of all we 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.630
 we will dedicate disease up to level 6 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.840
 where we can protect ourselves with the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.400
 maximum number of possible mushrooms 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.310
 they expected that or your July will be more than 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.860
 a wise choice do not fear when this one 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.440
 appear strip everything and pray perhaps 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.090
 you get out alive and kill ten 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.549
 Above all, if you're going to die 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.010
 you must make sure that he dies or if not 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.220
 you will have lost the line and surely 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.800
 cost horrors recover backgammon 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.420
 the practice is similar 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.850
 you just have to start always with the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.710
 Darro blinding if you start like this and you 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.170
 try to return the tulebras play 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.640
 done a lot of damage and for when you want 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.280
 Realize that you are not doing 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.770
 nothing will be late and you will be late 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.020
 render remember to press control and the 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.940
 number 4 to laugh your face you'll see what 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.950
 nervous people get 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.780
 something good that has type is that if 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.910
 you win the line you can press your solo 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.550
 almost everything you want 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.590
 except if you are in the middle since your 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.300
 mushrooms grant a vision and a ccd 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.280
 great if the whole team comes 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.380
 for you in the best case if you are 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.360
 a little troll you can load the biggest 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.840
 part may even not die 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.840
 uselessly 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.849
 the places to put the mushrooms vary 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.919
 depending on who you play against 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.050
 look very well at what hobbies they have 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.439
 from level 1 and put them on the sites 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.639
 through which remorseless 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:52.250
 Remember to avoid at all costs 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.759
 farmar with your mushrooms is better to form 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.400
 champions believe me though if you see a 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.710
 marabunta of 400 million or more do not leave 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.930
 pass the opportunity and feed them 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.550
 what I have just said I will comment that if 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.650
 you already have the hurricane will not be worth it 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.599
 since the attack speed that you 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.479
 grants and the triplet or minions is more 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.039
 enough to farmar without problems 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.960
 when you touch on one against one, spend 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.300
 quickly the blinding dart if you see that 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.639
 goes for you without fear starts to take away 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.469
 while you run backwards like that 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.000
 you will reduce your damage just enough 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:25.370
 so that your poison takes away what the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.900
 enemy does not wait will not happen almost time 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.539
 until you can release another 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.699
 dart understand do not throw the flash to a 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.830
 side that is not expected to avoid one or 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.510
 two hits next hit is a 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.660
 ml character 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.160
 to finish and listen to me well that no 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.070
 I will repeat it in the comments in 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.220
 runes you will need the following in red 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.260
 magical penetration in the yellow and 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.480
 blue depends on what to play if 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.880
 that magical resistance and if that of 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.230
 physical resistance and I repeat not by level 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.720
 but direct in 15 essences 2 of 4 with 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.000
 95 of ap and one of speed of 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.190
 movement because of what if thymus is 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.720
 quick that is not a little more can 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.350
 make the difference between getting to 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.250
 enemy and being hunted by the hairs 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.230
 for masters will be a 21 09 I leave you one 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.550
 image so if you have not put it 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.550
 Full screen and video at 1080p 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.189
 and thus concluded this guide thymus and 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.639
 you know what they say this morning what is 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.639
 all
