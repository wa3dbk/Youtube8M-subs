00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.469
 jeep many surprised their time 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.980
 alien headsets called 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.080
 town 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.850
 the latter is well shot due 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.640
 good sound combination 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.289
 form factor and samsung cost already 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960
 wanted to compete in this 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.330
 class and she created a galaxy circle 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.039
 who honestly was not very now 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
 korean developer releases 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.690
 premium bluetooth headset for 70 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.030
 dollars and promises us a cool sound 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.340
 the convenience and quality of the material let's 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 check it out 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 let's start with the appearance came to us 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.920
 device is a dark blue color also 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.890
 sale available models are golden 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.200
 white and blue look style 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.340
 quality materials 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.500
 pearl paint is pleasing to the eye 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.870
 looks on the neck of this device is not so 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.480
 marvelous as the first such headsets but with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.010
 it is still original based like 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.600
 it seems to me later 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.969
 come off look how easy it is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.580
 bend over the convenience when 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.500
 operating this controversial decision 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.229
 the room is all bundled up tightly on the neck 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 but the street is not a fountain constantly 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.770
 flies due to the large weight of the block 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.780
 which is on the neck 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.020
 you can play sports but not really 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 comfortable all due to weight distribution 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.619
 controlled by level you using three 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 buttons and slider enable buttons 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.820
 arranged ergonomically controlled 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.439
 blindly very comfortable for wireless 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.210
 Connection responds to bluetooth with 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.280
 codec and 5x support 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 there is also an application for smartphones 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.530
 on android with instructions and settings in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.000
 which can turn on the alert 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.130
 sound due to the form factor is not particularly 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.649
 impressive in the room of the right 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.509
 fly arrangement still all right, you can 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.399
 achieve mediocre detail and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.670
 some price and volume 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.630
 but on the street everything is very obliquely crooked 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.909
 soundproofing no half 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 instruments goes into oblivion and sound 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.649
 becomes bubbling but the volume margin 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 good though it pleases the quality 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.909
 voice transmission at a decent level for 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.920
 that two full microphones answer one of 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.259
 which noise suppression by 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.740
 autonomy we have the following numbers 10 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.650
 hours while listening to muse 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.280
 ki hours at 11 and 500 in the conversation mode 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.500
 standby 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.510
 misunderstanding with radius of action 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.260
 kind of catches on big enough 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.120
 distances 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.760
 but when walking the signal is very common 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.680
 disappeared and the music was interrupted failing 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.290
 hell we have far from premium 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.490
 devices with enough 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.620
 disadvantages among plus there stands 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.570
 Note high volume appearance with 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.060
 materials autonomy and quality 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.200
 Voice over the rest of the whole more 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.200
 playing options
