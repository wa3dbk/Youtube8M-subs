00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.320 
be showing up on Albany not raw I highly
doubt<00:02:25.049> if<00:02:25.500> he's<00:02:25.709> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.040> part<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.489> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
doubt if he's going to be part of the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.320 
doubt if he's going to be part of the
evolution<00:02:27.930> team<00:02:28.260> or<00:02:28.920> something<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.850> I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
evolution team or something like that I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.720 
evolution team or something like that I
think<00:02:30.870> he's<00:02:31.200> going<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.410> be<00:02:31.560> going<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.160> against

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
think he's going to be going up against

think he's going to be going up against
them<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:34.049> I'm<00:02:34.140> trying<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.470> say<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.799> this

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
them I'm what I'm trying to say is this

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.300
