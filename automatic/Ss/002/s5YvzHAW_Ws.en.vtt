00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
A year ago Julia LIPNITSKAIA, who will became later Olympic Champion at Team Trophy, won the European Championship in Budapest.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And after that victory chain of happenings has became:

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The Olympic Games, where she unreservedly won at Team Trophy, then The World Championship, and so on... Well, and now we have what we have.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
At the season's start some people doubted if 15 years old skater should choose such difficult theme.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But now there is no place for skepticism. Although judges still give top points for performance to Carolina KOSTNER, they can't just not to consider technique and difficulty of LIPNITSKAIA's program.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.500
But while she was waiting for result, Julia was still nervous...

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:43.000
JL: "I was worrying that I'll be placed 2nd again, despite that I was skating not even on 100%, but on 200%. I mean, I've never done such set of elements before, even at trainings.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:58.000
To tell the truth, I pleased with my today's skate more, than place I took. Because if I will skate like this, I can be in top three for sure".

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We wish to Julia to skate the same as she did it at European Championship in the future, because that was fantastic skating.
