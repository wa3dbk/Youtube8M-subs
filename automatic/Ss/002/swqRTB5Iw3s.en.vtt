into the band as you can see from

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.400 
into the band as you can see from
wearing<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> watch<00:00:23.730> daily<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.990> plastic

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.179 
imprint the back cracks when the band
puts<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.900> lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> pressure<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.769> curve<00:00:31.949> if

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
puts a lot of pressure on that curve if

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
puts a lot of pressure on that curve if
the<00:00:33.030> band<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.360> metal<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:34.110> puts<00:00:34.350> more<00:00:34.530> pressure

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the band is metal it puts more pressure

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
the band is metal it puts more pressure
on<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> back<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.670> most<00:00:35.880> likely<00:00:36.059> why<00:00:36.420> the

party metal band users this is how I
wear<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> watch<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.940> wear<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> watch<00:00:42.360> right

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
wear the watch and wear the watch right

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.360 
wear the watch and wear the watch right
above<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:43.020> wrist<00:00:43.230> bone<00:00:43.410> which<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.980> right<00:00:44.129> here

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
above my wrist bone which is right here

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
above my wrist bone which is right here
no<00:00:45.030> matter<00:00:45.210> how<00:00:45.450> tight<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> wear<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> known

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
no matter how tight I wear it known

no matter how tight I wear it known
amount<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> wrist<00:00:47.670> movement<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.239> flexing<00:00:48.719> will

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
amount of wrist movement or flexing will

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
amount of wrist movement or flexing will
put<00:00:49.110> any<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> pressure<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.640> watch<00:00:50.820> as

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
put any kind of pressure on the watch as

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
put any kind of pressure on the watch as
you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> watch<00:00:52.079> stays<00:00:52.379> still<00:00:52.680> while

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you can see the watch stays still while

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.560 
you can see the watch stays still while
my<00:00:53.789> wrist<00:00:54.030> flexes<00:00:55.640> however<00:00:56.640> another<00:00:57.270> way

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
my wrist flexes however another way

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
my wrist flexes however another way
someone<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.140> wear<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> watch<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.859> right<00:00:59.550> down

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
someone can wear the watch is right down

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.209 
someone can wear the watch is right down
at<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.059> wrist<00:01:00.469> so<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> wrist<00:01:01.920> bone<00:01:02.100> is

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
at the wrist so the wrist bone is

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.440 
at the wrist so the wrist bone is
actually<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.940> side<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> someone<00:01:06.270> wears

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
actually on this side so someone wears

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
actually on this side so someone wears
that<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.750> watched<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.470> any<00:01:07.770> kind<00:01:08.340> of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that are watched like this any kind of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
that are watched like this any kind of
sudden<00:01:08.729> flexing<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.299> movement<00:01:09.689> would<00:01:10.260> push

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
sudden flexing or movement would push

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
sudden flexing or movement would push
the<00:01:10.619> band<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.130> while<00:01:12.090> pushing<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.510> watch<00:01:13.020> up

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the band down while pushing the watch up

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.010 
the band down while pushing the watch up
so<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.180> creates<00:01:15.540> tension

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so as you can see this creates tension

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.710 
so as you can see this creates tension
and<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:17.189> curved<00:01:17.460> part<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.000> plastic<00:01:18.360> curve<00:01:18.540> on

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and the curved part the plastic curve on

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.660 
and the curved part the plastic curve on
the<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> watch<00:01:19.350> presses<00:01:20.220> against

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the back of the watch presses against

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.480 
the back of the watch presses against
the<00:01:21.060> band<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.600> lot<00:01:22.200> more<00:01:22.350> pressure<00:01:22.590> than<00:01:23.070> usual

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the band a lot more pressure than usual

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.370 
the band a lot more pressure than usual
and<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.950> watch<00:01:26.100> cracks

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
and then the back of the watch cracks

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.719 
and then the back of the watch cracks
one<00:01:28.380> solution<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.829> someone<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.340> XDA

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
one solution that someone on XDA

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.460 
one solution that someone on XDA
suggested<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.479> simply<00:01:30.869> cutting<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
suggested is simply cutting off the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.620 
suggested is simply cutting off the
curved<00:01:31.710> edge<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.329> leaving<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
curved edge just like that and leaving a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
curved edge just like that and leaving a
straight<00:01:33.930> line<00:01:34.229> however<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.579> recommend

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
straight line however I do not recommend

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.249 
straight line however I do not recommend
this<00:01:36.060> unless<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:37.020> what<00:01:37.049> you're

doing if you don't know how to do it
correctly<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.479> will<00:01:39.600> most<00:01:39.780> likely<00:01:39.930> mess<00:01:40.259> up

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
correctly you will most likely mess up
