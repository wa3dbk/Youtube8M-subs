properly<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:18.240> really<00:00:18.630> easy<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.050> only<00:00:19.350> two

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
properly it's really easy it's only two

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.960 
properly it's really easy it's only two
button<00:00:19.890> presses<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.550> first<00:00:20.789> one's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
button presses and the first one's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
button presses and the first one's
always<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.420> same<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.730> then<00:00:24.470> you<00:00:25.470> also<00:00:25.680> need

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
always the same and then you also need

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.640 
always the same and then you also need
to<00:00:26.220> use<00:00:26.250> two<00:00:26.820> breakable<00:00:27.480> objects<00:00:28.080> during<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to use two breakable objects during a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
to use two breakable objects during a
fight<00:00:28.980> later<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:31.460> which<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.669> done<00:00:32.910> pretty

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
fight later on which is done pretty

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.400 
fight later on which is done pretty
easily

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
easily

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.290 
easily
you<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.309> parry<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.180> then

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you just have to parry and then

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.690 
you just have to parry and then
counter-attack<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.370> you're<00:00:38.370> pretty<00:00:38.520> much

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
counter-attack and you're pretty much

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.430 
counter-attack and you're pretty much
surrounded<00:00:38.910> by<00:00:39.270> breakable<00:00:39.719> objects<00:00:40.140> during

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
surrounded by breakable objects during

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
surrounded by breakable objects during
fight<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.040> it'll<00:00:41.280> happen<00:00:41.430> quite<00:00:41.820> naturally<00:00:42.469> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
fight so it'll happen quite naturally so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
fight so it'll happen quite naturally so
you<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.860> into<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.280> tavern<00:00:44.579> later<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> do

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
you go into this tavern later and you do

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
you go into this tavern later and you do
the<00:00:45.750> two<00:00:45.930> eavesdrops<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> try<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the two eavesdrops and then you try to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.450 
the two eavesdrops and then you try to
leave<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.000> end<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.420> fight

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
leave and you end up in a fight

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.860 
leave and you end up in a fight
and<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.700> said<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.390> parry<00:00:51.719> in

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and like I said you just got a parry in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.420 
and like I said you just got a parry in
that<00:00:52.020> counter<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:55.710> breakables<00:00:56.250> will

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that counter the the breakables will

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.060 
that counter the the breakables will
come<00:00:56.640> pretty<00:00:56.910> naturally<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.350> just

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
come pretty naturally if if not just

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.450 
come pretty naturally if if not just
make<00:00:59.280> sure<00:00:59.489> you're<00:00:59.699> positioned<00:01:00.320> nearby<00:01:01.460> table

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
count as a breakable object

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.240 
count as a breakable object
