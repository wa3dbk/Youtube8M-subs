more<00:03:10.300> black<00:03:10.540> on<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.900> because<00:03:11.020> when<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.290> if

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
you go to blend it it's going to make it

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.870 
you go to blend it it's going to make it
look<00:03:15.130> really<00:03:15.670> great<00:03:16.090> dirty<00:03:17.490> so<00:03:18.490> then<00:03:18.670> just

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
look really great dirty so then just

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:30.300 
look really great dirty so then just
blend<00:03:19.060> those<00:03:19.240> together

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.490 

if<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:31.060> have<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.360> get<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> little<00:03:32.020> bit<00:03:32.290> on<00:03:32.470> your

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
if you have to get a little bit on your

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.699 
if you have to get a little bit on your
brush<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:35.069> blend<00:03:36.069> like<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:37.500> if<00:03:38.500> that's

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
brush and blend like that if that's

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.730 
brush and blend like that if that's
easier

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.630 

okay<00:03:45.490> so<00:03:45.550> that<00:03:45.820> looks<00:03:45.940> good<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:47.350> then<00:03:47.740> I<00:03:48.040> don't

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
okay so that looks good and then I don't

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.640 
okay so that looks good and then I don't
know<00:03:48.730> if<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.880> can<00:03:49.000> tell<00:03:49.210> but<00:03:49.270> where<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:50.200> drew

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
know if you can tell but where I drew

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.360 
know if you can tell but where I drew
that<00:03:50.680> original<00:03:51.250> line<00:03:51.490> it<00:03:52.150> looks<00:03:52.690> like<00:03:52.810> i<00:03:53.470> have

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
that original line it looks like i have

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.550 
that original line it looks like i have
drawn<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:55.120> line<00:03:55.180> there<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.410> don't

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
drawn that line there and you don't

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.220 
drawn that line there and you don't
really<00:03:56.680> want<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.340> look<00:03:57.520> like<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:58.230> so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
really want that to look like that so

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.230 
really want that to look like that so
I'm<00:03:59.710> just<00:03:59.890> going<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.070> take<00:04:00.310> some<00:04:00.610> more<00:04:00.910> black

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
I'm just going to take some more black

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.940 
I'm just going to take some more black
and<00:04:01.920> apply<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:02.950> right<00:04:03.340> where<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:03.610> line<00:04:04.000> is

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
and apply it right where that line is

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.510 
and apply it right where that line is
and<00:04:06.150> up<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.420> little<00:04:07.660> bit<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.170> then<00:04:08.370> blend<00:04:09.370> that

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
and up a little bit and then blend that

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.490 
and up a little bit and then blend that
out<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.800> doesn't<00:04:11.980> look<00:04:12.310> like<00:04:13.500> you

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
out so that it doesn't look like you

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.250 
out so that it doesn't look like you
drew<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.770> line<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.550> then<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:16.720> like<00:04:16.810> an<00:04:16.959> empty

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
drew a line and then it's like an empty

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.800 
drew a line and then it's like an empty
space<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.970> then<00:04:22.090> right<00:04:22.270> here<00:04:22.300> I'm<00:04:22.600> just<00:04:22.660> going

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
space and then right here I'm just going

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.330 
space and then right here I'm just going
to<00:04:22.930> kind<00:04:23.170> of<00:04:23.200> blend<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.530> black<00:04:23.770> in<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.100> and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
to kind of blend that black in the and

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.850 
to kind of blend that black in the and
the<00:04:24.460> pink<00:04:24.730> together<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:26.320> it'll<00:04:26.470> be<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.590> cut

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
the pink together so it'll be a cut

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.110 
the pink together so it'll be a cut
crease<00:04:26.890> still<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:27.610> just<00:04:27.790> not<00:04:27.940> as<00:04:29.640> defined<00:04:30.640> as
