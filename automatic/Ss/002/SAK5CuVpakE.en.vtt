00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.320
 we need a weapon that will allow 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.320
 pay the enemy 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.410
 we made the scene vibrate shake 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.490
 so the actor can really feel 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.890
 yourself inside the robot 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.190

 pilot cockpit head 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.920
 together with scaffolding she 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.920
 consisted of four floors height 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.390
 this cabin can sway and even 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.479
 very fast down 5 meters this 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.280

 the actors were delighted it looked like 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:39.750
 attraction simulator the easiest would be 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.790
 attach to your arms and legs and your back 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.200
 actors leverage to let them move 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.560
 free but i felt that control 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.979
 must occur with effort so we 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.959
 built a construction weighing two tons and 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.479
 attached their hands feet and back 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.890
 chill now suit you belts 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.500
 you step on the platform 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.250
 read movement and re-7b sticker 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.770
 pentecost 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.660
 but at this time they poured 750 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.550
 liters of water per minute charlie hannam

 roleviki 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.370
 we had to isolate from water and 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.959
 deadly wiring areas 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.959
 wandered into a sophisticated pt machine 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.060
 thought that the fights would look cooler 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.340
 if the pilots are spacious, guilty 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.340
 they are like tankers in the second world war 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.970
 being in a close cockpit you feel 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.010
 cozy and even safe but 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.710
 Imagine that a gap in the wall done 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.340
 but it emerges from under the feet of the windshield 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.720
 tumble blows it all gives you a feeling 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.930
 more interactivity than machine tools 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.670
 cockpit react to all actions 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.620

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.660
 stabs cab rushes forward 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.180
 along with them and if kaiju hits by 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.140
 him bounces back and properly them 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.140
 flicking boiling 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.490
 I wanted to take off just so tense 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.080
 a battle movie that looks like 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:24.200
 real real movie fighting 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.330
 who will land you pilot's seat and give you 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.030
 feel what it is like to wear a suit 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.030
