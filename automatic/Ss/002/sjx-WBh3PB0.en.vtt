video on this just quite recently
yesterday<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> basically<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.490> allows

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
yesterday and basically what this allows

you<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:10.140> takes<00:01:10.409> advantage<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you to do is it takes advantage of the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
you to do is it takes advantage of the
touch<00:01:11.850> ID<00:01:12.090> fingerprint<00:01:12.689> sensor<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
touch ID fingerprint sensor on the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
touch ID fingerprint sensor on the
iPhone<00:01:13.799> 5s<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.180> use<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
iPhone 5s and you can use the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.420 
iPhone 5s and you can use the
fingerprint<00:01:16.049> sensor<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.650> unlock<00:01:16.680> your

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
fingerprint sensor to unlock your

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.090 
fingerprint sensor to unlock your
applications<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.930> device<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> can

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
applications on your device so you can

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130 
applications on your device so you can
secure<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.580> apps<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.689> touch<00:01:21.900> ID

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
secure your apps with the touch ID

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.679 
secure your apps with the touch ID
sensor<00:01:22.310> very<00:01:23.310> nice<00:01:23.580> Cydia<00:01:23.880> tweak<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
sensor very nice Cydia tweak it's a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
sensor very nice Cydia tweak it's a
$2.99<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.500> Cydia<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.180> it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
$2.99 in Cydia but it's I think it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
$2.99 in Cydia but it's I think it's
well<00:01:27.600> worth<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.290> works<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.920> well<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
well worth it it works really well so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.030 
well worth it it works really well so
this<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.240> called<00:01:30.540> bio<00:01:31.020> protect<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
this one is called bio protect and of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
this one is called bio protect and of
course<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.579> only<00:01:32.790> compatible<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.420> the

iPhone 5s the next one on my list is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
iPhone 5s the next one on my list is
called<00:01:36.930> NC<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.860> only<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.850> very

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
straightforward simple tweak what it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.870 
straightforward simple tweak what it
does<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.659> removes<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.500> today<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.070> mist
