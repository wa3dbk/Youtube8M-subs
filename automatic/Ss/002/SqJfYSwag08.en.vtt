are included the seat is actually a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.850 
are included the seat is actually a
pretty<00:00:35.309> standard<00:00:35.879> for<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.269> spin<00:00:36.750> bike<00:00:36.960> they're

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
pretty standard for a spin bike they're

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.590 
pretty standard for a spin bike they're
never<00:00:38.129> comfortable<00:00:38.670> your<00:00:38.940> butt<00:00:39.150> just<00:00:39.180> gets

used<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.019> them<00:00:40.140> over<00:00:40.290> time<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.000> instead<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
used to them over time so instead of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.689 
used to them over time so instead of
having<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.900> zoom<00:00:43.470> to<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.650> gym<00:00:43.920> after<00:00:44.070> work<00:00:44.250> or

having to zoom to the gym after work or
really<00:00:44.970> early<00:00:45.000> before<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.870> figured<00:00:46.140> I'd

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
really early before I just figured I'd

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.009 
really early before I just figured I'd
get<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.680> now<00:00:46.949> and<00:00:47.339> save<00:00:48.620> my<00:00:49.970> morale<00:00:50.970> and<00:00:51.360> gas

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
get one now and save my morale and gas

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.009 
get one now and save my morale and gas
time<00:00:52.860> whatever<00:00:53.159> energy<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.540> it<00:00:54.720> at<00:00:54.809> home

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
time whatever energy and use it at home

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.229 
time whatever energy and use it at home
and<00:00:55.559> after<00:00:55.650> assembling<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.370> very<00:00:56.610> simple<00:00:57.030> just

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and after assembling it very simple just

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
and after assembling it very simple just
a<00:00:57.390> few<00:00:57.570> steps<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.110> when<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.290> here<00:00:58.790> put<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.820> little

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
a few steps but when I here put a little

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.859 
a few steps but when I here put a little
seat<00:01:00.239> thing<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:01.220> and<00:01:02.220> whatnot<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:03.269> is

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
seat thing right here and whatnot it is

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.109 
seat thing right here and whatnot it is
a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.290> cheaper<00:01:04.589> than<00:01:04.890> what's<00:01:05.489> expected<00:01:05.640> at

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
a little cheaper than what's expected at

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.670 
a little cheaper than what's expected at
the<00:01:06.210> gym<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.570> buy<00:01:06.750> ones<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> cost<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.530> couple

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.570 
the gym they buy ones that cost a couple
thousand<00:01:08.190> dollars<00:01:08.220> probably<00:01:09.290> but<00:01:10.580> don't

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
thousand dollars probably but don't

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280 
thousand dollars probably but don't
exactly<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:12.119> how<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.390> show<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.960> how<00:01:13.200> it

works<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.250> give<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
works but I'm just going to give you a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
works but I'm just going to give you a
little<00:01:14.790> demonstration<00:01:15.500> after<00:01:16.500> assembling<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
little demonstration after assembling it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.770 
little demonstration after assembling it
I<00:01:17.070> did<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.310> properly<00:01:17.790> I'll<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.479> give<00:01:18.660> you<00:01:18.690> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
I did it properly I'll just give you a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.070 
I did it properly I'll just give you a
little<00:01:18.810> taste<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.010> it<00:01:20.190> sounds<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.670> I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.120 

mean<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.200> sure<00:01:25.260> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
mean I'm sure this is really going to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.320 
mean I'm sure this is really going to
upset<00:01:26.550> my<00:01:28.010> neighbor<00:01:29.010> who<00:01:29.310> lives<00:01:29.520> below<00:01:29.700> me<00:01:29.850> but

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
upset my neighbor who lives below me but

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.930 
upset my neighbor who lives below me but
whatever

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.880 

in<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.480> cool<00:01:36.720> down<00:01:36.990> stage<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> nice

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
in a cool down stage it has a nice

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.680 
in a cool down stage it has a nice
little<00:01:38.100> break<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> overall<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.950> pretty

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
little break so overall it's pretty

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.060 
little break so overall it's pretty
equivalent<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:43.050> what<00:01:43.200> you'd<00:01:43.380> expect<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
equivalent to what you'd expect at the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.090 
equivalent to what you'd expect at the
gym<00:01:44.420> it's<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.570> built<00:01:45.840> solidly<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
gym it's really built solidly the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.540 
gym it's really built solidly the
handles<00:01:47.490> nice<00:01:47.870> firm<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.200> everything<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
handles nice firm and everything was a

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.390 
handles nice firm and everything was a
little<00:01:50.760> concerned<00:01:50.940> with<00:01:51.510> how<00:01:52.230> flimsy<00:01:53.100> its

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
little concerned with how flimsy its

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.370 
little concerned with how flimsy its
assembled<00:01:53.760> there<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.510> overall<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:55.320> looks

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
assembled there but overall it looks

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.650 
assembled there but overall it looks
really<00:01:55.740> good<00:01:56.010> looks<00:01:56.730> a<00:01:56.820> lot<00:01:56.970> nicer<00:01:57.030> than<00:01:57.510> the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
really good looks a lot nicer than the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.900 
really good looks a lot nicer than the
other<00:01:57.870> one<00:01:58.110> that's<00:01:58.230> closely<00:01:58.860> priced<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.730> this
