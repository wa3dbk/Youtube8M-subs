 microphone for noise reduction logo one 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:13.140
 plos one and all the phone itself 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.740
 quite thin and at the same time 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.630
 wide first time to keep it 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.500
 quite comfortable but you get used to 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.500
 literally half a day 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.460
 plastic edges 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.640
 made of metal 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.880
 very slippery unlike the back 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.940
 the cover and when shooting the phone can 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.440
 speak out 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.780
 qualcomm snapdragon 801 processor 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.780
 clock frequency of 2 thousand 500 megahertz 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.140

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.310
 608 scare 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:12.510
 and on mark 2 gives out more than 60 frames in 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:18.390
 I 'll talk about the shortcomings for a second 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.390
 which I revealed within 2 days 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.110
 first most important very bad 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.120
 location of phone camera details 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.459
 is too close to the edge and 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.459
 so it's not very convenient to shoot video 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.600
 and you have to shoot both in general 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.460
 uncomfortable 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.070
 also top and bottom microphone which 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:50.810
 sometimes closed with your fingers when shooting 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.810
 video 2 style speakers in one place 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.170
 when watching videos often close 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.170
 by hands 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.940
 yes and the sound goes in one direction 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.090
 in any case, these speakers are very 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.510
 loud 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.540
 Now I will show examples of a photo and an example 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.989
 video you can find on the link in
