mode<00:00:11.429> as<00:00:11.670> I've<00:00:11.880> been<00:00:12.000> getting<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.360> couple<00:00:12.389> of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
mode as I've been getting a couple of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.740 
mode as I've been getting a couple of
questions<00:00:13.469> about<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.540> some<00:00:15.540> things

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
questions about that and some things

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.439 
questions about that and some things
might<00:00:15.929> not<00:00:15.960> be<00:00:16.109> immediately<00:00:16.680> obvious<00:00:17.449> all

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
might not be immediately obvious all

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.760 
might not be immediately obvious all
right<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.750> we're<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:18.930> gonna<00:00:19.140> take<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.529> toy

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
right so we're just gonna take this toy

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.740 
right so we're just gonna take this toy
I'm<00:00:19.980> using<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.369> Millia<00:00:20.670> type<00:00:20.910> because<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
I'm using the Millia type because the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.890 
I'm using the Millia type because the
red<00:00:22.619> should<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.039> easier<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> see<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.779> gonna

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
red should be easier to see it's gonna

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.089 
red should be easier to see it's gonna
fold<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.810> cockpit<00:00:27.810> part<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.590> all<00:00:28.769> snaps

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099

fold up the cockpit part this all snaps
in<00:00:29.310> pretty<00:00:29.550> easily<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.279> cheat<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
in pretty easily and I just cheat a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.580 
in pretty easily and I just cheat a
little<00:00:33.210> bit<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.540> session<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> arms<00:00:39.290> as<00:00:40.290> they

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
little bit and session the arms as they

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860 
little bit and session the arms as they
need<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> transformation<00:00:42.540> back

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
need to be for the transformation back

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.810 
need to be for the transformation back
into<00:00:43.200> fighter<00:00:43.620> mode<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.520> they're

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
into fighter mode as you can see they're

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.470 
into fighter mode as you can see they're
actually<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:47.239> there's<00:00:48.239> actually
