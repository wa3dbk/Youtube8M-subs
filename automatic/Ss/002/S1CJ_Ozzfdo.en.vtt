00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.349
 become easy task anyway I want 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.790
 costs because it costs so much difficult to 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.050
 and I did this so much 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.050
 as young as possible 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.340
 great team but ultimately will 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.870
 interval with a trie point to 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.710
 have to go home and that's it my 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.079
 fucking fight 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.070

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
 looking different there if I look now I 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.579
 positive there just yes I see 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.640
 nevertheless things that boy that I think about 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.640
 myself 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.960
 i can told my players i love 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.489
 the tiki taka game itself so that's on it 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.020
 thats what I play back for gasoline coin 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.020
 and in this respect it was all good 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.380
 in shopping done 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.710
 contest 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.990
 every manager gets to experience the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.550
 first good side of the t's tan around you 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.240
 can finally lead to the crucial 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.530
 target 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.920
 this was something I really wanted to avoid 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:42.730
 and the team itself is happy too 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.730
 came the discus 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.970
 nothing as nice as the first competition 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.950
 as a novice manager this is mine 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.599
 flight it is consistent with this smooth and streak 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.220

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.170
 so that are completely fantastic and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.769
 that for once when she babbles 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.920
