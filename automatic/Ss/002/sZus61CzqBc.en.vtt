00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.370
 how many people live in your home percent around 13 people 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.989
 how much garbage is calculated that they generate per day 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.020
 we take out three bags a day 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.199
 like two chileans 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.090
 20 25 kilos of garbage because 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.580
 without exception still the fruit some vegetables even what we buy in the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.739
 shops 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.739
 everything well focused in your house know garbage no 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.039
 did not play 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.430
 of this one the narrow one to each other 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.900
 because we do not have education forever 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.440
 to see that we do not have here 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.760
 sensitized that culture to separate garbage 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.710
 I think because of laziness 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.470
 from there maybe for that day 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.230
 I hope that also because the laziness is never commented so 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 really first you must separate the garbage 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.890
 of course 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.630
 if we try to stop it 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.000
 the organic in the event in special containers for organic 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.720
 2000 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.370
 to talk about their indebtedness after the kitchen as they are fruit shells 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.660
 vegetable and all that 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.710
 this even there are occasions when it is used for as a compost 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.880
 cartoon lived viii and cans 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 plastics all that we put in that crime for the inorganic 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.920
 the faith of valencia 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.220
 this time fortunately in the car the comedians as they approve but yes 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.840
 as if all the hannover that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
 a fact to keep in mind while pointing 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.440
 they all leave the bags and they know it so much national 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.030
 You can not do it 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.690
 but those crimes 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.930
 they tell me if the fact is separated what are the classics separate us 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.170
 the bottles the cartoon media separates us 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.130
 the order that he order to have it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.740
 we wait for them cfdt fo 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.170
 by color 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.800
 the cartoon project 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 her 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.089
 the metal 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:12.349
 unfortunately others still do not have the appropriate unit to 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.649
 the separation here we have to this one 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.649
 separate them 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.109
 dangerous what we notice gloves 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.109
 he had a classic 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.739
 if it is dangerous for us, it complicates us more in the sense that your 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.349
 how is everything going 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.999

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.689
 well to cut us 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.299
 it only stops beating us, no more than anything, with the rubbish that is going around 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.449
 there are very few people 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.979
