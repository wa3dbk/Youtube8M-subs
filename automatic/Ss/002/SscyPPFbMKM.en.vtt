00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.320
 my best idea to discover the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.990
 japan without leaving paris I attend a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.400
 Technical ceremony tea ceremony 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.260
 actually quite long 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.789
 there are plenty of gestures that allow you to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.770
 discover a little ritual 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.900
 Japanese when I arrived I was 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.490
 greeted by frozen maki followed she was 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.840
 already dressed in kimono 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.570
 we went down to the room where 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.660
 the ceremony is held the ceremony is 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.969
 installed on tatamis then mathier to 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.520
 start by purifying the water and 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.010
 different utensils before serving the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.970
 tea I tasted a pastry based 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.370
 red beans 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.140
 it apparently helps to soften the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.329
 palace is to be able to better 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.399
 enjoy the tea then that is enough 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.860
 bitter to register just 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.290
 look on the website 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.020
 the tea ceremony costs 30 euros per 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.880
 person and lasts about 50 minutes 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.980
 what I liked was seeing maquis 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.440
 organized and especially prepare everything 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.480

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.850
 true theatricality of tea and it's a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.189
 true moment of disorientation happiness the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.009
 tea ceremony for us japanese 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.319

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.530
 learn for life it's a tradition 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:19.049

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.319
