sensor<00:00:22.439> working<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.109> little

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
sensor working there so this is a little

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.090 
sensor working there so this is a little
bit<00:00:32.489> different<00:00:32.850> than<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> people<00:00:33.660> s<00:00:33.780> 1<00:00:34.110> it's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
bit different than the people s 1 it's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.670 
bit different than the people s 1 it's
actually<00:00:35.430> an<00:00:35.520> upgrade<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.630> people<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.440> one

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
actually an upgrade the people this one

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
actually an upgrade the people this one
adds<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.160> rear<00:00:38.700> camera<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:39.510> 2

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870

another<00:00:44.550> difference<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.690> screen

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
another difference is the screen

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.110 
another difference is the screen
resolution<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.559> 12<00:00:46.920> sorry<00:00:47.610> 1024<00:00:48.390> x<00:00:48.629> 600

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
resolution is 12 sorry 1024 x 600

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.229 
resolution is 12 sorry 1024 x 600
whereas<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.539> s1<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.170> lower<00:00:52.980> than<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.430> pixel

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
whereas the s1 is lower than that pixel

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.430 
whereas the s1 is lower than that pixel
resolution<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.780> we're<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
resolution so here we're going to see it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.990 
resolution so here we're going to see it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.920 

so<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.649> a<00:01:19.680> 5-point<00:01:20.670> multi-touch<00:01:21.090> she's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so this is a 5-point multi-touch she's

so this is a 5-point multi-touch she's
really<00:01:23.180> responsive

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:02:03.270 

alright

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.490 

so<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.789> it's<00:02:05.479> not<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.780> PS<00:02:06.079> but<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.350> still

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500
