a<00:05:37.389> little<00:05:37.630> bit<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.900> confidence<00:05:38.229> if<00:05:38.500> it's<00:05:38.650> a<00:05:38.710> bit

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
a little bit of confidence if it's a bit

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.770 
a little bit of confidence if it's a bit
shifty<00:05:39.340> or<00:05:39.400> not<00:05:39.580> something<00:05:40.270> like<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.599> if<00:05:40.750> he

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
shifty or not something like that if he

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.779 
shifty or not something like that if he
does<00:05:41.289> shortened<00:05:41.710> stride<00:05:41.830> a<00:05:42.099> little<00:05:42.250> bit<00:05:42.639> you

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
does shortened stride a little bit you

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.430 
does shortened stride a little bit you
know<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.090> he<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.479> he<00:05:43.539> just<00:05:43.810> doesn't<00:05:44.200> put<00:05:44.349> in
