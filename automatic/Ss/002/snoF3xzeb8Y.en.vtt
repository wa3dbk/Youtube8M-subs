00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:16.180
 well I say yes here with the samsung galaxy s 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:20.890
 advanced always with the rom cyanogenmod 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:25.640
 10.1 today with the person and 25 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.529
 September is exactly the same as for I 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.410
 the best movement 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:38.540
 naturally compared to September 25th 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:44.150
 are exits other from 26 to 27 is that of 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.820
 today the 28 major improvements there 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.780
 have been precisely respect those of the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.210
 25 and having some problems with the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.720
 traffic data that are coming 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.810
 gigabytes and or preferred to flash here 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.110
 because anyway they are 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.990
 I asked a few months to try it 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 for me anyway they told me that I didn't 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.320
 there are big changes compared to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 this of 25 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.290
 I remain however with that 25 why 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.340
 compared to the previous ones there have been 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.340
 significant improvements 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 the resolution of two bugs a lot 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.350
 fundamental among this we have the wifi 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.350
 direct you immediately see 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:53.190
 here are the finances of course now 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.759
 there are no other devices with which 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.220
 to the trials still have to be tested 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.229
 another part the rider act works 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.140
 perfectly 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:14.460
 other we say father below was also 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:16.390
 lpm ie just the charging of the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.520
 smartphone 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:25.330
 with off that is completely off yes 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.850
 served to the battery icon e 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.160
 charging automatically and unfortunately 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.480
 this is a convenient way 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.790
 initially it still hadn't been 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:46.220
 fixed to date, we finally succeed 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:53.140
 to recharge the cell by pushing 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:56.530
 no bugs other known bugs 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.530
 surely they are 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:06.090
 a little fluidity not not here but neither 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.950
 that every now and then goes shooting but then it is the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:15.000
 vibration problem of the soft keys 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.400
 touch practically to the touch not feedback 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.160
 return of the vibrations though 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.530
 however with the speed of times onwards 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.019
 the mistake in two of the people are 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.989
 managed to fix the bugs supermeet ea 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.220
 short they will also solve the latter 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.190
 problem 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.769
 nothing will leave you to the next to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:44.190
 next people also hopes in the 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:48.920
 rgb version and then the transition from 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:53.160
 knightley rc and called it final 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.040
 closure of the nakhli version hopefully 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.910
 precisely as soon as possible 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.910
 Hello everybody
