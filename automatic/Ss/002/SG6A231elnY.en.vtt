00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello very good today let's see how 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.130
 plant bulbs for it we're just going to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.389
 need a planter me in this case 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.030
 I'm going to use a pot because it's a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.040
 example way some balls that are 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.570
 special for bulbs although if not 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 we want to spend money we can 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.680
 use normal stones of which there are 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.370
 in the park or in the countryside 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.890
 fertilizer and the bulbs 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.340
 the process is the following first 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.130
 we will take the stones or the balls and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.790
 the sands 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.360
 so while the pot as a base now 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.810
 later 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.530
 I put it here let's see let's throw 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.320
 the earth 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.059
 we will not remove all because the bulbs 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.059
 they must be covered in agreement 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.390
 OK 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.310
 we destroyed a little this granny 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.980
 here or we remove it because it's not 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.950
 I can break 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.260
 now we will proceed to put the bulbs is 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.060
 important to always put it with the 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.400
 roots down what is this here 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.979
 that many times as the bulbs have still 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.200
 started to get out we got confused and the 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.850
 we put it down you see these are the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.710
 roots and this is where it will be born 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.950
 I'm going to put only two because it's a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.830
 tiny flower pot we will put these one that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.570
 it is already starting and another that is not and now 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.930
 we will cover them with a little more 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.930
 land 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.350
 more or less they will have to cover it 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.350
 three fingers according 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.570
 it is called fallen again loquito 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.800
 and, as you can see, it is a very 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.890
 simple and very easy does not have any 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.110
 complication 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.280
 then after this just what 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.780
 let's give 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.360
 and we will put them in the place 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.640
 corresponding last I would like 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.220
 tell you that before buying the bulb in 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.010
 any store you check that this 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.720
 it's hard like the one I have here because 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.459
 if he is speaking he means that he does not 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 worthless 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.390
 this is all if you liked the video 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.660
 hit the like and see you in the next 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.660
 video 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.750
 ah
