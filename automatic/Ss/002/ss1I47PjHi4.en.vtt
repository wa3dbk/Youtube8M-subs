00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
has been very very long awaited but I'm

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:24.989 
has been very very long awaited but I'm
sorry<00:00:23.800> I<00:00:23.890> didn't<00:00:24.220> do<00:00:24.310> this<00:00:24.460> review<00:00:24.820> earlier

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:24.999

think<00:00:30.039> that's<00:00:30.220> how<00:00:30.369> you<00:00:30.400> pronounce<00:00:30.550> it<00:00:31.119> by

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:31.749 
think that's how you pronounce it by

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.760 
think that's how you pronounce it by
silk<00:00:32.400> selenate<00:00:33.810> okay<00:00:34.810> so<00:00:34.870> it's<00:00:35.170> just<00:00:35.380> these

because of this product or because of
the<00:01:39.820> others<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.530> I'm<00:01:41.620> going<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.979> just<00:01:42.070> review

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
the others so I'm going to just review

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.399 
the others so I'm going to just review
them<00:01:42.790> all<00:01:43.030> together<00:01:43.240> rather<00:01:43.690> than<00:01:43.900> separate

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
them all together rather than separate

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.850 
them all together rather than separate
okay<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.490> next<00:01:45.820> product<00:01:46.060> is<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:47.290> large<00:01:47.500> paws

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
okay the next product is the large paws

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.580 
okay the next product is the large paws
diminishing<00:01:48.520> night<00:01:48.850> complex<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:50.140> have<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
diminishing night complex and I have to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.190 
diminishing night complex and I have to
say<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:51.040> really<00:01:51.360> really<00:01:52.360> really<00:01:52.390> like<00:01:52.960> this

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
say I really really really like this

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.010 
say I really really really like this
okay<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.369> think<00:01:54.729> it's<00:01:54.909> more<00:01:55.030> concentrated<00:01:55.990> than

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
okay I think it's more concentrated than

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.410 
okay I think it's more concentrated than
this<00:01:56.320> one<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.799> think<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:57.400> one<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:57.610> mainly<00:01:57.970> to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
this one I think this one is mainly to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.870 
this one I think this one is mainly to
you<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:59.200> be<00:01:59.320> used<00:01:59.560> for<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.979> daytime<00:02:00.460> wear<00:02:00.670> this

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
you to be used for the daytime wear this

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.920 
you to be used for the daytime wear this
for<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.420> night<00:02:01.630> time<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.939> is<00:02:04.150> more<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.450> a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
for the night time this is more of a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.580 
for the night time this is more of a
pause<00:02:05.560> reducing<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.400> barrier<00:02:06.850> repairing<00:02:07.689> so

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
pause reducing and barrier repairing so

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.220 
pause reducing and barrier repairing so
um<00:02:09.129> I<00:02:09.220> guess<00:02:09.789> normally<00:02:10.599> I<00:02:10.629> would<00:02:10.899> just<00:02:11.049> put

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
um I guess normally I would just put

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.670 
um I guess normally I would just put
this<00:02:11.379> under<00:02:11.890> my<00:02:11.920> moisturizer<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> morning

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
this under my moisturizer in the morning

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.149 
this under my moisturizer in the morning
before<00:02:14.670> my<00:02:14.819> makeup<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.420> then<00:02:15.780> put<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:16.379> primary

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
before my makeup and then put my primary

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.599 
before my makeup and then put my primary
foundation<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.790> top<00:02:18.769> this<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.040> an<00:02:20.219> extra

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
foundation on top this is just an extra

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.640 
foundation on top this is just an extra
step<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:21.060> my<00:02:21.299> fund<00:02:21.569> in<00:02:21.780> my<00:02:22.140> morning<00:02:22.530> routine

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
