00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 francisco ord칩침ez our correspondent 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.400
 The francisco accompanies us from Quito 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.370
 I want you to tell us at this time what 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.620
 is the situation in ecuador returned the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.259
 calm there are no demonstrations that is 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.420
 happening with this topic and also by the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.030
 controversy that was generated with this topic 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.300
 Good afternoon burn effectively 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.300
 this afternoon they were expected to return to 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.800
 produce seedlings here in the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.060
 mists iris to the north of the city 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.699
 outside the headquarters country because no alliance 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.110
 nothing has happened just from where 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.239
 we are in the benefit of 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.270
 telesur we have a direct view towards 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.760
 that place and we can appreciate that it is 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.550
 absolutely quiet the traffic is 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.980
 flowing there are some police that in 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.629
 prevention has been given appointments from that place 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.580
 and very few people are there gathered 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.470
 yesterday at this same time already 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.600
 there was a large concentration of people 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.659
 there were about 3,000 people 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.890
 that supporters of the government that 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.040
 they were to support the revolution 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.190
 citizen and about 500 more people or 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.290
 less of the opposition some of the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.170
 nights the acts occurred 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.200
 violent because the people of the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.649
 opposition began to throw bottles and 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.630
 stones towards the grandstand where they were 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.390
 talking some of the leaders 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.000
 to country and this caused therefore some 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.460
 inconvenience two policemen injured an ex 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.820
 Minister of Culture also received a 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:38.409
 blow that produced a rupture of his 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.479
 right eyebrow and in any case because that's not 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.490
 transcended beyond francisco I want 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.990
 that find me now to the facts if 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.700
 francisco is that I want you to tell me 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.880
 ok the argument they are using 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.159
 these people who protest against this 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.759
 half the president strap has been clear 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.959
 and explicit of those who would come out 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.310
 affected by saying somehow 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.799
 who would have to pay a tax 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.869
 for receiving that kind of inheritance by the 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.909
 number the amount of money that 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.069
 they would receive in inheritance that really is 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.080
 negligible in relation to the amounts but 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.149
 I want you to tell me about the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.170
 argument that those who are using 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.170
 oppose that measure 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.290
 the one that the government that got the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.990
 hand in the pocket to the paper yanes 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.340
 food is quite far from the 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:31.090
 reality so that it has a part of the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.540
 roles that so much so that in the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.630
 last five years five people have 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.820
 balanced this surpassed the thousand 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.340
 dollars because all people 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.610
 that they would have in acceptance the little bit 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.000
 more of those people would have a 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.080
 application of up to 35 percent of the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.370
 total amount to add but naturally 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.010
 this 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.760
 the personal type during bread is to say 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.010
 this does not affect Ecuadorians in the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.599
 Communication 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.530
 the capital also on the right 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:12.360
 Ecuadorian people have wanted to say that what 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.099
 It is is both hostels 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.230
 especially state delegate to the 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.420
 people are sad that light that the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.060
 rest has motivated interactions 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.370
 but nevertheless the information that is 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.930
 already circulating at this moment 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.360
 reaction that the problem has in front of 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.799
 the trend facts are also in the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.780
 client who clarified to the prospect 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.140
 also you will understand little to 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.140
 little bit 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.269
 francisco ord칩침ez live since removed 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.109
