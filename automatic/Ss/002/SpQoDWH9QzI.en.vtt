00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
these are is this down here is actually

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.830 
these are is this down here is actually
it<00:05:00.440> provides<00:05:01.160> as<00:05:01.580> what's<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.390> persons<00:05:02.780> that

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
it provides as what's the persons that

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.500 
it provides as what's the persons that
is<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.080> shock<00:05:03.410> absorber<00:05:03.760> when<00:05:04.760> you're<00:05:05.090> jumping

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
is a shock absorber when you're jumping

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.390 
is a shock absorber when you're jumping
for<00:05:05.750> example<00:05:06.290> instead<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.590> your<00:05:06.800> horse's<00:05:07.130> leg

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
for example instead of your horse's leg

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.970 
for example instead of your horse's leg
absorbing<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.480> shock<00:05:08.510> this<00:05:09.320> part<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.830> the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
absorbing the shock this part of the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.010 
absorbing the shock this part of the
boot<00:05:10.130> absorbs<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.090> shock<00:05:11.120> which<00:05:11.540> i<00:05:11.690> think<00:05:11.750> is

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
boot absorbs the shock which i think is

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.760 
boot absorbs the shock which i think is
absolutely<00:05:12.200> fantastic<00:05:12.730> um<00:05:13.730> and<00:05:14.630> it's<00:05:15.560> really

streams<00:06:48.479> or<00:06:48.659> lakes<00:06:48.689> or<00:06:49.110> whatever<00:06:49.409> you're

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
streams or lakes or whatever you're

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.549 
streams or lakes or whatever you're
walking<00:06:49.829> through<00:06:49.889> or<00:06:50.099> a<00:06:50.129> puddle<00:06:50.579> um<00:06:51.289> what<00:06:52.289> it

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:52.559 
walking through or a puddle um what it

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.199 
walking through or a puddle um what it
would<00:06:52.679> do<00:06:52.829> is<00:06:52.860> the<00:06:53.429> water<00:06:53.639> would<00:06:53.909> be<00:06:53.999> able<00:06:54.089> to

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:54.209 
would do is the water would be able to

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:56.299 
would do is the water would be able to
go<00:06:54.389> into<00:06:54.629> the<00:06:54.839> boot<00:06:55.019> and<00:06:55.139> this<00:06:55.379> is<00:06:55.559> why<00:06:55.739> this

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:56.309 
go into the boot and this is why this

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:59.479 
go into the boot and this is why this
done<00:06:56.549> here<00:06:56.909> is<00:06:57.089> rubber<00:06:57.829> so<00:06:58.829> it's<00:06:59.039> not<00:06:59.189> going<00:06:59.399> to

00:06:59.479 --> 00:06:59.489 
done here is rubber so it's not going to

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:02.059 
done here is rubber so it's not going to
ruin<00:06:59.729> the<00:07:00.269> shoe<00:07:00.509> it's<00:07:00.899> really<00:07:01.079> hard<00:07:01.409> material

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:02.069 
ruin the shoe it's really hard material

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.119 
ruin the shoe it's really hard material
um<00:07:02.719> so<00:07:03.719> the<00:07:03.959> water<00:07:04.199> could<00:07:04.379> go<00:07:04.529> through<00:07:04.769> kind<00:07:05.039> of

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:05.129 
um so the water could go through kind of

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:06.829 
um so the water could go through kind of
cool<00:07:05.309> your<00:07:05.429> horses<00:07:05.759> have<00:07:05.939> fought<00:07:06.209> make<00:07:06.719> it

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:06.839 
cool your horses have fought make it

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:09.049 
cool your horses have fought make it
nice<00:07:06.959> and<00:07:06.989> comfortable<00:07:07.589> but<00:07:08.099> also<00:07:08.279> it<00:07:08.849> has

00:07:09.049 --> 00:07:09.059 
nice and comfortable but also it has

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:11.109 
nice and comfortable but also it has
this<00:07:09.269> so<00:07:09.479> whenever<00:07:09.749> your<00:07:09.929> horse<00:07:10.139> is<00:07:10.259> walking

00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:11.119 
this so whenever your horse is walking

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:13.459 
this so whenever your horse is walking
the<00:07:12.119> water<00:07:12.359> will<00:07:12.569> be<00:07:12.659> able<00:07:12.719> to<00:07:12.899> like<00:07:13.199> come<00:07:13.439> out

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:13.469 
the water will be able to like come out

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:17.209 
the water will be able to like come out
of<00:07:13.769> the<00:07:13.829> boot<00:07:13.949> to<00:07:14.129> sew<00:07:15.469> on<00:07:16.469> the<00:07:16.499> back<00:07:16.769> this<00:07:17.099> is
