better damage wise and his ax meter is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.000 
better damage wise and his ax meter is
just<00:00:09.690> really<00:00:10.019> useful<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.679> don't<00:00:10.920> get

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
just really useful so you don't get

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.640 
just really useful so you don't get
super<00:00:11.250> lot<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:12.450> still<00:00:12.570> we've<00:00:13.200> come<00:00:13.440> up<00:00:13.469> with

some creative gimmicks to fool your

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.820 
some creative gimmicks to fool your
opponents<00:00:15.780> into<00:00:15.960> getting<00:00:16.109> hit<00:00:16.350> by<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.560> super

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
opponents into getting hit by the super

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.160 
opponents into getting hit by the super
and<00:00:17.279> here<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.150> are<00:00:18.180> yet<00:00:18.420> again<00:00:18.510> talking<00:00:19.020> about

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and here we are yet again talking about

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.859 
and here we are yet again talking about
a<00:00:19.320> new<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.609> one's<00:00:20.850> all<00:00:20.970> thanks<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.330> West

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
a new one this one's all thanks to West

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.189 
a new one this one's all thanks to West
a<00:00:22.020> B<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.650> thus<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.090> only<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.420> dubbed<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
a B and thus it can only be dubbed the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.890 
a B and thus it can only be dubbed the
it<00:00:25.350> Abbasi<00:00:25.619> Slayer

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.179 

imagine<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.080> could<00:00:31.199> Cara<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.890> super

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
imagine if you could Cara the super

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.790 
imagine if you could Cara the super
demon<00:00:32.460> from<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.759> standing<00:00:33.360> roundhouse<00:00:33.809> now<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
demon from a standing roundhouse now I

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
demon from a standing roundhouse now I
know<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.670> technically<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.540> but

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
know you you can technically do it but

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.100 
know you you can technically do it but
it<00:00:37.649> requires<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.370> fancy<00:00:39.120> plink<00:00:39.390> motion<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it requires a fancy plink motion and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.510 
it requires a fancy plink motion and
it's<00:00:40.379> nothing<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> overhead<00:00:41.250> car<00:00:41.489> eye

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it's nothing like the overhead car eye

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.369 
it's nothing like the overhead car eye
where<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.629> hit<00:00:42.719> jab<00:00:42.960> plus<00:00:43.170> strong

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
where you can just hit jab plus strong

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.770 
where you can just hit jab plus strong
twice<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> that's<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.539> overhead

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
twice and that's because the overhead

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.660 
twice and that's because the overhead
starts<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.350> slow<00:00:46.649> whereas<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
starts out really slow whereas the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.100 
starts out really slow whereas the
Roundhouse<00:00:48.000> starts<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.960> eight

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
Roundhouse starts up and what eight

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.290 
Roundhouse starts up and what eight
frames<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.090> enough

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
frames so you really don't have enough

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
frames so you really don't have enough
time<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> tap<00:00:51.870> jab<00:00:52.410> +<00:00:52.739> roundhouse<00:00:53.340> twice

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
time to tap jab + roundhouse twice

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.310 
time to tap jab + roundhouse twice
because<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.809> something<00:00:55.020> dumb

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
because then you get something dumb

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.889 
because then you get something dumb
looking<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> solution<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
looking like that so the solution of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.459 
looking like that so the solution of
this<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> normal<00:00:59.730> outside<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:01.320> its

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this is to with a normal outside of its

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.450 
this is to with a normal outside of its
range<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.219> buffer<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> jabs<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.460> so

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
range and buffer the jabs and that so

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.890 
range and buffer the jabs and that so
what<00:01:05.549> you're<00:01:05.640> gonna<00:01:05.729> want<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.750> into

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
what you're gonna want to do is get into

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.170 
what you're gonna want to do is get into
a<00:01:07.020> range<00:01:07.350> where<00:01:07.680> low<00:01:08.040> forward<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.670> hit<00:01:08.880> but

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
a range where low forward would hit but

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.330 
a range where low forward would hit but
crouching<00:01:09.990> jab<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.500> crouching<00:01:10.710> strong<00:01:11.130> would

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
crouching jab or crouching strong would

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.200 
crouching jab or crouching strong would
not<00:01:11.520> hit<00:01:13.310> as<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.640> crouching<00:01:14.970> strong

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
not hit as you can see crouching strong

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
not hit as you can see crouching strong
whiffing<00:01:15.570> right<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:15.930> now<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.680> we're

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
whiffing right there now what we're

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.730 
whiffing right there now what we're
going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.430> buffer<00:01:18.119> two<00:01:18.570> jabs<00:01:18.900> after<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
going to do is buffer two jabs after the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
going to do is buffer two jabs after the
crouching<00:01:19.950> strong<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:21.210> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.540> sure<00:01:21.570> we

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
crouching strong we want to make sure we

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.800 
crouching strong we want to make sure we
don't<00:01:21.840> buffer<00:01:22.170> them<00:01:22.290> too<00:01:22.530> late<00:01:22.880> because<00:01:23.880> then

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
don't buffer them too late because then

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
don't buffer them too late because then
another<00:01:25.140> jab<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.500> come<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.950> it'll<00:01:26.340> look

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
another jab will come out and it'll look

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.359 
another jab will come out and it'll look
stupid<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.090> suspicious<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.159> use

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
stupid and suspicious you can also use

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.249 
stupid and suspicious you can also use
jab<00:01:32.610> +<00:01:32.909> strong<00:01:33.180> three<00:01:33.450> times<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.930> really

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
jab + strong three times if you really

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
jab + strong three times if you really
wanted<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.400> easier<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:35.790> your

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
wanted to to make it easier for your

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.880 
wanted to to make it easier for your
hands

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
hands

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.040 
hands
either<00:01:37.490> way<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.940> should<00:01:38.150> all<00:01:38.330> go<00:01:38.540> according<00:01:39.020> to

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
either way it should all go according to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.890 
either way it should all go according to
plan<00:01:39.280> provided<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:41.030> finish<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.600> input

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
plan provided that you finish the input

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.990 
plan provided that you finish the input
which<00:01:42.140> would<00:01:42.320> be<00:01:42.550> standing<00:01:43.550> roundhouse

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
which would be standing roundhouse

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.359 
which would be standing roundhouse
afterward<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:44.960> then<00:01:45.110> forward<00:01:45.650> plus<00:01:46.040> short

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
afterward and then forward plus short

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.030 
afterward and then forward plus short
plus<00:01:46.760> fierce<00:01:47.150> punch<00:01:47.650> you<00:01:48.650> can<00:01:48.770> apply<00:01:48.979> this

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
plus fierce punch you can apply this

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.940 
plus fierce punch you can apply this
same<00:01:49.400> logic<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.909> a<00:01:50.060> crouching<00:01:50.420> jab<00:01:51.020> but<00:01:51.710> since

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
same logic to a crouching jab but since

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.620 
same logic to a crouching jab but since
crouching<00:01:52.280> gab<00:01:52.400> is<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:52.640> fast<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.210> actually

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
crouching gab is so fast you actually

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.540 
crouching gab is so fast you actually
have<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.960> buffer<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.380> second<00:01:54.800> jab<00:01:55.009> within<00:01:55.430> the

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
have to buffer the second jab within the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.359 
have to buffer the second jab within the
standing<00:01:55.880> roundhouse<00:01:56.180> itself<00:01:57.160> don't<00:01:58.160> do<00:01:58.280> it

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
standing roundhouse itself don't do it

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.100 
standing roundhouse itself don't do it
too<00:01:58.550> fast<00:01:58.580> because<00:01:59.270> then<00:01:59.420> you'll<00:01:59.540> get<00:01:59.630> an<00:01:59.900> jab

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
too fast because then you'll get an jab

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:10.540 
too fast because then you'll get an jab
and<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.590> look<00:02:00.740> kinda<00:02:00.920> dumb<00:02:09.160> as<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.310> seen

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
and you look kinda dumb as you seen

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.430 
and you look kinda dumb as you seen
there<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.789> Stan<00:02:11.300> Jack<00:02:11.540> came<00:02:11.810> out<00:02:11.930> instead<00:02:12.380> of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
there the Stan Jack came out instead of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.340 
there the Stan Jack came out instead of
the<00:02:12.620> Roundhouse<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.400> pace<00:02:14.390> yourself<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.140> you

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
the Roundhouse so pace yourself and you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.920 
the Roundhouse so pace yourself and you
should<00:02:15.590> get<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.980> correct<00:02:16.430> input<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.780> it'll

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
should get the correct input and it'll

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.020 
should get the correct input and it'll
look<00:02:18.019> more<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.320> that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
look more like that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.520 
look more like that
now<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.269> use<00:02:20.390> this<00:02:20.570> setup<00:02:20.930> as<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.500> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
now you can use this setup as like a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.710 
now you can use this setup as like a
demon<00:02:22.040> flip<00:02:22.310> gimmick<00:02:22.700> where<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.150> land<00:02:23.450> just

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
demon flip gimmick where you land just

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.410 
demon flip gimmick where you land just
outside<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.200> poke<00:02:24.500> range<00:02:24.800> or<00:02:25.730> maybe<00:02:26.120> in

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
outside of poke range or maybe in

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
footsies where they are expecting low

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.030

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.440 

if<00:02:40.890> you're<00:02:41.069> doing<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> input<00:02:41.640> correctly<00:02:42.209> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
if you're doing the input correctly and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.420 
if you're doing the input correctly and
the<00:02:42.660> super<00:02:43.080> isn't<00:02:43.590> coming<00:02:43.860> out<00:02:43.980> or<00:02:44.280> it's

coming out after the roundhouse hits you

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.860 
coming out after the roundhouse hits you
should<00:02:47.310> try<00:02:47.550> holding<00:02:47.880> forward<00:02:48.360> as<00:02:48.660> you're

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
should try holding forward as you're

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.300 
should try holding forward as you're
doing<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> standing<00:02:49.380> roundhouse<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.770> just

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
doing the standing roundhouse and just

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.160 
doing the standing roundhouse and just
continue<00:02:51.209> holding<00:02:51.450> forward<00:02:51.780> while<00:02:51.959> you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
continue holding forward while you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.390 
continue holding forward while you
finish<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> rest<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.890> input

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
finish the rest of the input

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.330 
finish the rest of the input
I<00:02:53.430> found<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.209> helps<00:02:54.480> me<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> lot<00:02:55.160> for<00:02:56.160> some

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
I found this helps me a lot for some

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.670 
I found this helps me a lot for some
reason<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.700> input<00:02:56.970> appears<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.480> same<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.140> it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
reason the input appears the same but it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.670 
reason the input appears the same but it
makes<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.130> difference<00:02:59.520> between<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.870> trick

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
makes the difference between the trick

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.910 
makes the difference between the trick
connecting<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.209> trick<00:03:03.540> all<00:03:03.989> out<00:03:04.380> failing

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
connecting and the trick all out failing

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.040 
connecting and the trick all out failing
I<00:03:05.390> don't<00:03:06.390> understand<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:06.989> it's<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:08.010> tip

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
I don't understand it but it's just tip

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.110 
I don't understand it but it's just tip
the<00:03:10.050> same<00:03:10.410> concept<00:03:11.099> of<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.310> tip<00:03:11.519> demon<00:03:11.819> applies

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the same concept of a tip demon applies

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.350 
the same concept of a tip demon applies
to<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.660> technique<00:03:13.170> as<00:03:13.319> well<00:03:14.180> say<00:03:15.180> for

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
to this technique as well say for

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.910 
to this technique as well say for
instance<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.900> walked<00:03:16.230> up<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.620> did<00:03:16.709> three

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
instance you walked up and did three

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.410 
instance you walked up and did three
crouching<00:03:17.220> shorts<00:03:17.760> that's<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.030> pretty<00:03:18.209> dumb

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
crouching shorts that's a pretty dumb

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.539 
crouching shorts that's a pretty dumb
thing<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.690> do<00:03:18.840> because<00:03:19.620> Akuma<00:03:20.220> doesn't<00:03:20.430> really

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
thing to do because Akuma doesn't really

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.000 
thing to do because Akuma doesn't really
have<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> follow-up<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.269> but<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:22.620> puts<00:03:22.920> you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
have a follow-up to that but it puts you

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.250 
have a follow-up to that but it puts you
at<00:03:23.130> perfect<00:03:23.549> range<00:03:23.819> for<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> crouching<00:03:24.600> jab<00:03:24.959> to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
at perfect range for a crouching jab to

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.250 
at perfect range for a crouching jab to
whiff<00:03:25.580> which<00:03:26.580> then<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:27.690> use<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
whiff which then you can use the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.740 
whiff which then you can use the
technique<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.799> just<00:03:28.830> described<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.569> get

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
technique I just described and you get

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.840 
technique I just described and you get
the<00:03:30.900> added<00:03:31.170> benefit<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.519> standing

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
the added benefit of the standing

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.240 
the added benefit of the standing
roundhouses<00:03:33.180> range<00:03:33.630> or<00:03:34.410> your<00:03:34.560> super<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.100> it's

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
roundhouses range or your super and it's

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.740 
roundhouses range or your super and it's
a<00:03:35.310> pretty<00:03:35.519> good<00:03:35.640> setup<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:36.269> course<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.600> can

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
a pretty good setup of course you can

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.809 
a pretty good setup of course you can
still<00:03:36.930> mess<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:37.290> up<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.830> don't<00:03:38.250> hit<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.610> jab

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
still mess this up so don't hit the jab

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.400 
still mess this up so don't hit the jab
this<00:03:39.030> roundhouse<00:03:39.390> too<00:03:39.630> fast<00:03:39.930> because<00:03:40.290> then

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
this roundhouse too fast because then

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.410 
this roundhouse too fast because then
you<00:03:40.500> get<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.680> standing<00:03:41.010> jab<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.519> going<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.299> rage

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
you get a standing jab and going to rage

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.470 
you get a standing jab and going to rage
mode<00:03:42.630> like<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.049> did<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.609> tick<00:03:45.000> super

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
mode like I just did you can tick super

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.770 
mode like I just did you can tick super
from<00:03:45.810> two<00:03:46.109> crouching<00:03:46.590> Strong's<00:03:46.950> as<00:03:47.190> well<00:03:47.780> just

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
from two crouching Strong's as well just

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.050 
from two crouching Strong's as well just
to<00:03:48.900> buffer<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.620> two<00:03:49.829> jabs<00:03:50.160> at<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.609> end<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
to buffer the two jabs at the end of the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.180 
to buffer the two jabs at the end of the
second<00:03:51.450> crouching<00:03:51.780> strong<00:03:52.049> it's<00:03:52.560> important
