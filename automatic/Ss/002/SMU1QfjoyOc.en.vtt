there's<00:03:39.670> another<00:03:39.910> smudge<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.629> track<00:03:40.900> right

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
there's another smudge of a track right

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.050 
there's another smudge of a track right
there<00:03:41.470> doesn't<00:03:42.099> really<00:03:42.400> show<00:03:42.670> me<00:03:42.790> much<00:03:43.000> though

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.990 
up I don't want to be worried but I
think<00:04:37.979> I<00:04:38.129> should<00:04:38.340> be<00:04:38.460> cautious<00:04:38.759> at<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.389> place

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
think I should be cautious at this place

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.570 
think I should be cautious at this place
Jax<00:04:42.000> come<00:04:42.240> right<00:04:42.419> up<00:04:42.569> to<00:04:42.689> the<00:04:42.810> bridge<00:04:46.580> yeah

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.730 
Jax come right up to the bridge yeah
should<00:04:47.969> be<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.150> little<00:04:48.360> bit<00:04:48.629> more<00:04:49.110> cautious<00:04:49.590> and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
should be a little bit more cautious and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.900 
should be a little bit more cautious and
going<00:04:50.069> a<00:04:50.159> little<00:04:50.279> bit<00:04:50.460> slower

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.970 

feeling<00:04:54.750> he's<00:04:54.930> ahead<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.290> us<00:04:55.560> rather<00:04:55.830> than

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
feeling he's ahead of us rather than

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.250 
feeling he's ahead of us rather than
behind<00:04:56.490> he<00:04:56.880> figures<00:04:57.240> out<00:04:57.390> we're<00:04:57.540> both<00:04:57.750> on<00:04:58.080> the

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
behind he figures out we're both on the

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.320 
behind he figures out we're both on the
same<00:04:58.440> direction<00:04:58.710> these<00:04:59.640> are<00:04:59.700> the<00:04:59.940> two<00:05:00.120> main

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
same direction these are the two main

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.290 
same direction these are the two main
roads<00:05:01.100> it's<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.160> good<00:05:02.310> chance<00:05:02.520> he's<00:05:02.880> gonna<00:05:03.060> be

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
roads it's a good chance he's gonna be

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.520 
roads it's a good chance he's gonna be
there<00:05:03.480> too

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
there too

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.670 
there too
I<00:05:05.540> don't<00:05:06.540> think<00:05:06.810> he'd<00:05:06.930> get<00:05:07.080> in<00:05:07.230> there<00:05:07.380> but<00:05:07.620> he

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
I don't think he'd get in there but he

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.090 
I don't think he'd get in there but he
could<00:05:07.830> probably<00:05:08.040> get<00:05:08.340> through<00:05:08.580> there

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
could probably get through there

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:30.559 
could probably get through there
I<00:05:10.190> probably<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.150> wrist<00:05:11.330> way<00:05:11.480> at<00:05:11.600> this<00:05:11.690> point

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.999 

he's<00:05:31.569> following

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:42.249 

I<00:05:37.129> hope<00:05:38.379> hope<00:05:39.379> you're<00:05:39.559> doing<00:05:39.770> okay<00:05:39.830> mom
