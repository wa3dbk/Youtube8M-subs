00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.040
 secret tip city ​​oatmeal namely 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.730
 Lentils taste almost as good 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.460
 but have much better values ​​i see 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.010
 that maybe here else show it 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.360
 12 to 13 grams have and show to me 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.770

 that's how it's possible, as you can see 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.730
 I'm not the great master in now 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.380
 the decoration 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.550

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.170
