however<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:58.030> believe<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.019> death<00:02:59.290> note<00:02:59.500> is

however I believe that the death note is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.440 
however I believe that the death note is
ranked<00:02:59.950> higher<00:03:00.160> due<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.060> ability<00:03:01.120> of

ranked higher due to the ability of

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.259 
ranked higher due to the ability of

being discreet of course with power

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.360 
being discreet of course with power
always<00:03:04.630> result<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.200> death<00:03:05.410> if<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.160> want<00:03:06.310> to

always result to death if you want to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.009 
always result to death if you want to
compare<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.329> definite<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.840> more

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019
