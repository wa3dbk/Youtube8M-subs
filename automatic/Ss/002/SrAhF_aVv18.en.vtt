00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.320
 very good everyone played here like 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.750
 always with easier 4 and if the version 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.880
 finally it came out I had to download it 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.350
 for three days in a row and I was 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.420
 until three in the morning to be able 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.250
 enter this game that is the first 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.350
 game that I played did not understand anything 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.030
 obviously I only saw that he had the 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.100
 same options in what is audio 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.680
 sound video that kind of thing I said 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.300
 audio and sound that is the same I saw that 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.129
 he was in the same as with respect to 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.330
 beta so I said I'm going to go in I'm going to 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.910
 record of one that comes out what comes out 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.559
 so good it came out this I was 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.239
 playing the campaign also those that I 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.310
 they have in butler ox have already seen that 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.230
 the pass or do not know no good published 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.180
 it matters as well as I was playing 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.680
 the multiplayer basically all the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.300
 night since I said the 3 of the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.190
 tomorrow I downloaded it and it came 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.320
 I wake up from 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.140
 previous day so far it's 6 o'clock 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.270
 in the afternoon and it's six in the afternoon of 29 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.920
 still not sleep so how can 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.899
 noticing such friends is a bit changed 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.690
 I prefer to let do a few first 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.000
 impressions official pardon we arrived 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.500
 well complete tomorrow probably to the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.220
 late and if it is not tomorrow is past tomorrow 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.050
 that is, if it is not 30, it is 31 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.670
 give him more look 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.920
 because I still have to play some 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.380
 another map I think the odd way 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 also or especially some ways in 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.680
 certain maps because I think I passed 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.530
 for all the maps but most 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.410
 I played rus and domination bone assault and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.940
 domination I did not play with that it's long if 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.340
 they liked my pirouette when dying that's 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.980
 die with style that more than more than more 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.860
 what else I played almost nothing team 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.690
 deathmatch do not play obliteration 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.970
 obliteration I did not play the new mode of 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.430
 I do not know how you like it will call in Spanish 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.590
 but good as you can see I'm missing 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.150
 several things but what is good already 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.930
 I played the campaign the campaign apparently 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.820
 has different endings to appear 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.430
 They give to choose at the end they give you a 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.440
 election and I did not want to choose and it happened 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.180
 something good and you will see what happens 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.650
 when the terminal is pretty good 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.240
 the single player campaign to 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.710
 principle is a bit slow it's like more 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.830
 as a tutorial so that you go 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.060
 learning the game but already from the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.190
 third mission onwards it gets very 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.750
 interesting many enemies in the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.860
 last lot of action many explosions 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.680
 above all but good 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.510
 pretty good the game that more than more 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.740
 the butler packs are pretty good 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.290
 betrayed I want a lot of things 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.480
 especially if you get the bonuses of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.130
 experience like that for a while for 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.570
 continue raising levels the classes 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.910
 they start with the same weapons that 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.590
 they started in beta this is the k 12 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.010
 for the assault class the 100 for the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.340
 Support class the mx 4 m x 4 is called 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.840
 never macro is called mx 4 mx 4 for the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.910
 engineer class everyone knows the weapon 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.950
 that is and the sniper rifle we are 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.100
 watching on screen for the class of 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.450
 recognition which I notice is very 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.390
 easy to unlock what are the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.890
 motion sensors the balls that was 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.790
 the first thing is what if I do not 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.170
 I'm wrong so that's pretty 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.330
 pretty good because it's a utensil 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.190
 very, very useful for the class of 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.840
 recognition as well as they are 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.720
 the defibrillators for thanks to 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.760
 high everything pretty basic so like 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.530
 to be closing this video as you already 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.090
 I said last morning I'm going to do the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.860
 first impressions after there I go 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.020
 to start doing map reviews 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.150
 reviews of ways in certain maps how 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.370
 play certain modes on certain maps 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.510
 as they did more than phil three reviews 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.010
 of weapons because they are already all 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.650
 video statistics that we have 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.220
 on the computer and the people of Sinti 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.870
 puntocom was kind enough to put them 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.069
 on your website so I'll be 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.170
 doing the odd review of 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.430
 start doing the series that I mentioned 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.379
 previously in other videos that I was going to 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.060
 do but good that was all I hope that 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.060
 they have author see you next chau
