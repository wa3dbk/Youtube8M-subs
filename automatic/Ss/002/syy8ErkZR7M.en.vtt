charcoal<00:00:11.559> is<00:00:11.889> a<00:00:11.980> little<00:00:12.370> out<00:00:12.490> of<00:00:12.519> control<00:00:13.440> it's

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
charcoal is a little out of control it's

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.930 
charcoal is a little out of control it's
a<00:00:14.530> little<00:00:14.710> hard<00:00:14.889> to<00:00:14.980> control<00:00:15.129> because<00:00:15.759> it<00:00:15.849> can

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
a little hard to control because it can

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.910 
a little hard to control because it can
be<00:00:16.000> soft<00:00:16.540> and<00:00:16.690> it<00:00:16.810> blows<00:00:16.990> away<00:00:17.260> and<00:00:17.710> you<00:00:17.770> just

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
be soft and it blows away and you just

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.849 
be soft and it blows away and you just
touch<00:00:18.280> it<00:00:18.310> and<00:00:18.640> it<00:00:18.760> changes<00:00:19.510> but<00:00:20.380> all<00:00:20.470> that<00:00:20.650> to

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
touch it and it changes but all that to

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.630 
touch it and it changes but all that to
me<00:00:20.980> makes<00:00:21.250> for<00:00:22.029> interesting<00:00:22.269> possibilities

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
me makes for interesting possibilities

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.130 
me makes for interesting possibilities
we're<00:00:24.640> going<00:00:24.760> to<00:00:24.820> use<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.000> still<00:00:25.269> life<00:00:25.480> rather

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
we're going to use the still life rather

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.499 
we're going to use the still life rather
than<00:00:26.260> a<00:00:26.349> figure<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.880> with<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.150> figure<00:00:28.390> we

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
than a figure because with the figure we

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.720 
than a figure because with the figure we
have<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.660> lot<00:00:28.810> of<00:00:28.949> understanding<00:00:29.949> of<00:00:30.130> anatomy

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
have a lot of understanding of anatomy

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.410 
have a lot of understanding of anatomy
and<00:00:31.660> figure<00:00:32.529> drawing<00:00:32.830> which<00:00:33.280> becomes<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:34.210> whole

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
and figure drawing which becomes a whole

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.700 
and figure drawing which becomes a whole
nother<00:00:34.600> issue<00:00:34.719> so<00:00:35.559> we're<00:00:35.680> keeping<00:00:35.860> two<00:00:37.710> simple

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
nother issue so we're keeping two simple

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.040 
nother issue so we're keeping two simple
forms<00:00:39.160> but<00:00:39.520> that<00:00:39.700> have<00:00:39.850> different<00:00:40.210> surface

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
forms but that have different surface

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.630 
forms but that have different surface
qualities<00:00:42.239> different<00:00:43.239> appearances<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:45.160> we

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
qualities different appearances so we

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.930 
qualities different appearances so we
can<00:00:45.879> explore<00:00:46.450> using<00:00:47.110> charcoal<00:00:47.949> possibilities

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
can explore using charcoal possibilities

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.880 
can explore using charcoal possibilities
and<00:00:49.260> capturing<00:00:50.260> different<00:00:50.379> qualities<00:00:50.860> of

fine point with my kneaded eraser I can

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.230 
fine point with my kneaded eraser I can
make<00:01:04.059> little<00:01:04.360> slivers<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.410> light<00:01:05.910> over<00:01:06.910> here

same<00:01:07.960> thing<00:01:10.650> now<00:01:11.650> this<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.120> different

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
same thing now this is a different

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.670 
same thing now this is a different
quality<00:01:13.330> paper<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.110> we're<00:01:14.230> told<00:01:14.440> in<00:01:14.590> the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
quality paper so we're told in the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.860 
quality paper so we're told in the
charcoal<00:01:15.130> more<00:01:15.460> that's<00:01:16.120> when<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.510> want<00:01:16.750> to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
charcoal more that's when you want to

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.660 
charcoal more that's when you want to
experiment<00:01:17.350> with<00:01:17.590> different<00:01:17.710> papers<00:01:18.430> and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
experiment with different papers and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.850 
experiment with different papers and
find<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.910> paper<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.300> has<00:01:19.480> just<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.620> right

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
find a paper that has just the right

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.580 
find a paper that has just the right
texture<00:01:21.370> that<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.730> like<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.330> then<00:01:23.200> if<00:01:23.320> I<00:01:23.410> want

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
texture that you like and then if I want

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.870 
texture that you like and then if I want
to<00:01:23.650> pull<00:01:23.800> out<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:23.950> little<00:01:24.160> lighter<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.640> can<00:01:24.820> go

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
to pull out a little lighter I can go

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.050 
to pull out a little lighter I can go
back<00:01:25.060> over<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.420> with<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.660> little<00:01:26.020> bit<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.170> this

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
back over it with a little bit of this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.900 
back over it with a little bit of this
white<00:01:28.060> charcoal<00:01:28.660> I<00:01:28.810> can<00:01:28.990> do<00:01:29.110> this<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.770> then<00:01:30.730> if

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
white charcoal I can do this and then if

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.060 
white charcoal I can do this and then if
I<00:01:31.060> don't<00:01:31.600> like<00:01:31.930> those<00:01:32.140> hatched<00:01:32.410> lines<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.950> want

I don't like those hatched lines I want

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.100 
I don't like those hatched lines I want

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
want I extend all the lines beyond the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.580 
want I extend all the lines beyond the
shape<00:02:38.069> because<00:02:38.550> what<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.760> does<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.590> helps

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
shape because what that does that helps

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.710 
shape because what that does that helps
me<00:02:40.739> find<00:02:41.010> my<00:02:41.190> proportions<00:02:41.580> relationship<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:42.569> I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
me find my proportions relationship if I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.680 
me find my proportions relationship if I
extend<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.349> line<00:02:44.120> where<00:02:45.120> does<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.330> hit<00:02:45.510> this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
extend this line where does it hit this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.600 
extend this line where does it hit this
and<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.290> say<00:02:46.470> alright<00:02:46.769> this<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.280> too

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
and I say alright this is a little too

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.550 
and I say alright this is a little too
low<00:02:47.850> or<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.360> too<00:02:48.510> high<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:49.380> it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
low or this is too high because it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.470 
low or this is too high because it
should<00:02:49.739> hit<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:49.920> down<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.549> if<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:50.940> extend<00:02:51.299> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
should hit it down here if I extend it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.539 
should hit it down here if I extend it
there<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.810> hits<00:02:52.019> down<00:02:52.230> here<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.489> a

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
there it hits down here so this is a

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.910 
there it hits down here so this is a
little<00:02:53.790> bit<00:02:53.880> lower<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.450> and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
little bit lower and this is here and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
little bit lower and this is here and
that<00:02:58.920> makes<00:02:59.160> sense<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.519> this<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.910> a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
that makes sense because this is a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.259 
that makes sense because this is a
little<00:03:00.420> bit<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.170> was<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> little<00:03:01.470> too<00:03:01.650> fat

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
little bit that was a little too fat

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.720 
little bit that was a little too fat
extending<00:03:03.269> this<00:03:03.450> line<00:03:04.280> where<00:03:05.280> does<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.580> hit

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
extending this line where does it hit

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.059 
extending this line where does it hit
this<00:03:05.940> over<00:03:06.450> here<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:06.989> this<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.290> slightly<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
this over here so this is slightly and

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.910 
this over here so this is slightly and
what<00:03:08.970> happens<00:03:09.360> by<00:03:09.480> extending<00:03:10.110> these<00:03:10.230> lines<00:03:10.560> I

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
what happens by extending these lines I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.259 
what happens by extending these lines I
first<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.400> all<00:03:11.519> have<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:11.850> energetic

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
first of all have a really energetic

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.390 
first of all have a really energetic
picture<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.989> think<00:03:13.739> it's<00:03:13.860> something<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.190> very

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
picture I think it's something it's very

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.360 
picture I think it's something it's very
static<00:03:15.000> there's<00:03:15.209> nothing<00:03:15.600> moving<00:03:15.959> there<00:03:16.370> but

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
static there's nothing moving there but

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.710 
static there's nothing moving there but
my<00:03:17.489> eyes<00:03:17.670> moving<00:03:18.239> around<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.810> these<00:03:20.720> extended

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
my eyes moving around and these extended

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.140 
my eyes moving around and these extended
lines<00:03:21.989> sort<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.620> show<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.130> how<00:03:23.430> my<00:03:23.579> eye<00:03:23.609> moves

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
lines sort of show you how my eye moves

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.960 
lines sort of show you how my eye moves
when<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.540> follows<00:03:24.959> these<00:03:25.170> directions<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.790> goes

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
when it follows these directions it goes

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.990 
when it follows these directions it goes
this<00:03:27.209> way<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.630> goes<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:28.049> way<00:03:28.760> that's<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
this way it goes this way that's the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.759 
this way it goes this way that's the
kind<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.390> stiffy<00:03:31.170> lip<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:31.620> going<00:03:31.739> to

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
kind of a stiffy lip so I'm going to

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.039 
kind of a stiffy lip so I'm going to
loosen<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.190> up<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.579> extend<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.209> get<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.900> little

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
loosen it up and extend it get a little

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.220 
loosen it up and extend it get a little
more<00:03:34.290> oomph<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.769> this<00:03:34.890> picture<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.930> I'm<00:03:36.930> still

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
more oomph to this picture and I'm still

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.810 
more oomph to this picture and I'm still
just<00:03:37.290> mapping<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.799> out<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.280> even<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.640> mapping

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
just mapping it out but even in mapping

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.670 
just mapping it out but even in mapping
and<00:03:39.060> I'm<00:03:39.150> trying<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.570> give<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.780> some<00:03:40.049> energy

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and I'm trying to give it some energy

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.610 
and I'm trying to give it some energy
and<00:03:40.940> find<00:03:41.940> how<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.329> angles<00:03:43.049> move<00:03:43.290> how<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and find how the angles move how the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.289 
and find how the angles move how the
shapes<00:03:44.070> move<00:03:45.109> they<00:03:46.109> don't<00:03:46.880> literally<00:03:47.880> move

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
shapes move they don't literally move

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.000 
shapes move they don't literally move
but<00:03:48.660> they<00:03:48.810> move<00:03:49.140> in<00:03:49.470> my<00:03:49.739> eye

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
but they move in my eye

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.810 
but they move in my eye
and<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:53.010> I'm<00:03:53.070> putting<00:03:53.220> these<00:03:53.370> values<00:03:53.549> in

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
and this now I'm putting these values in

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.630 
and this now I'm putting these values in
these<00:03:54.000> two<00:03:54.680> side<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.890> this<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.340> are<00:03:56.549> the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
these two side of this and this are the

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.030 
these two side of this and this are the
same<00:03:56.790> value<00:03:57.410> this<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> really<00:03:58.799> good<00:03:58.950> example

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
same value this is a really good example

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.059 
same value this is a really good example
of<00:03:59.489> not<00:03:59.760> drawing<00:04:00.540> things<00:04:01.230> by<00:04:01.500> drawing<00:04:01.769> light

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
of not drawing things by drawing light

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.520 
of not drawing things by drawing light
these<00:04:02.850> two<00:04:03.150> are<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.720> same<00:04:03.810> value<00:04:04.319> when<00:04:04.410> I

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
these two are the same value when I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.440 
these two are the same value when I
squint<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:05.130> can't<00:04:05.400> tell<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.910> one<00:04:06.150> from<00:04:06.329> this

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
squint I can't tell this one from this

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.599 
squint I can't tell this one from this
one<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.230> my<00:04:07.380> picture<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.769> can't<00:04:08.100> tell<00:04:08.340> them<00:04:08.459> to

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
one so my picture I can't tell them to

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.530 
one so my picture I can't tell them to
under<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.030> they're<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.239> same<00:04:09.450> value<00:04:09.989> and

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
under so they're the same value and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.479 
under so they're the same value and
there's<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.660> sharp<00:04:13.079> edge<00:04:13.319> here<00:04:13.799> it's<00:04:14.190> just<00:04:14.280> this

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
there's a sharp edge here it's just this

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.370 
there's a sharp edge here it's just this
bit<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.819> light<00:04:15.030> here<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.450> this<00:04:15.690> is<00:04:15.930> almost<00:04:16.139> the

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
bit of light here and this is almost the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.210 
bit of light here and this is almost the
same<00:04:16.620> value

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
same value

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.789 
same value
it's<00:04:17.579> just<00:04:17.789> line<00:04:18.060> almost<00:04:18.359> disappears<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.229> put

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
it's just line almost disappears I put

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.060 
it's just line almost disappears I put
those<00:04:19.919> lines<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:21.140> was<00:04:22.140> drawing<00:04:22.320> things<00:04:22.800> but

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
those lines in I was drawing things but

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.040 
those lines in I was drawing things but
now<00:04:23.159> that<00:04:23.310> I'm<00:04:23.400> drawing<00:04:23.640> value

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
now that I'm drawing value

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.610 
now that I'm drawing value
there's<00:04:26.050> not<00:04:26.500> a<00:04:27.040> lot<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:28.410> difference<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:29.470> what

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
there's not a lot of difference in what

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.250 
there's not a lot of difference in what
happens<00:04:29.920> my<00:04:30.040> lines<00:04:30.280> are<00:04:30.550> going<00:04:30.640> to<00:04:30.760> slowly

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
happens my lines are going to slowly

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.770 
happens my lines are going to slowly
disappear<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:33.730> when<00:04:33.880> I<00:04:33.940> start<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.360> get<00:04:34.570> into

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
disappear and when I start to get into

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.040 
disappear and when I start to get into
very<00:04:35.080> small<00:04:35.320> shapes<00:04:35.980> like<00:04:36.970> up<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.570> I'm<00:04:37.750> going

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
very small shapes like up here I'm going

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.190 
very small shapes like up here I'm going
to<00:04:38.140> start<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.470> use<00:04:38.500> my<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.910> my<00:04:40.180> soft<00:04:40.510> charcoal

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
to start to use my is my soft charcoal

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.670 
to start to use my is my soft charcoal
pencil<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.850> can<00:04:43.000> get<00:04:43.120> very<00:04:43.450> very<00:04:43.540> specific

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
pencil so I can get very very specific

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.320 
pencil so I can get very very specific
for<00:04:44.860> example<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.400> area<00:04:45.580> which<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:45.910> the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
for example this area which is the

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.790 
for example this area which is the
drawings<00:04:46.720> little<00:04:46.960> off<00:04:47.080> here<00:04:47.380> so<00:04:47.410> I'm<00:04:47.620> going<00:04:47.710> to

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
drawings little off here so I'm going to

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.930 
drawings little off here so I'm going to
try<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.520> correct<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.420> little<00:04:49.720> bit<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.940> because

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
try to correct a little bit and because

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.050 
try to correct a little bit and because
this<00:04:52.210> out<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.600> soft<00:04:53.050> area<00:04:53.410> and<00:04:53.820> I'm<00:04:54.820> going<00:04:54.940> to

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
this out the soft area and I'm going to

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.600 
this out the soft area and I'm going to
do<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.480> hatch<00:04:56.140> line<00:04:56.560> so<00:04:56.890> I<00:04:56.980> can<00:04:57.010> start<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.550> get

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
do this hatch line so I can start to get

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.170 
do this hatch line so I can start to get
really<00:04:59.070> subtle<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.280> discreet<00:05:00.790> about<00:05:00.910> the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
really subtle and discreet about the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.800 
really subtle and discreet about the
shapes<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:02.160> how<00:05:03.160> fine<00:05:03.640> I<00:05:03.700> take<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:05.040> how<00:05:06.810> much

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
shapes and how fine I take this how much

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.800 
shapes and how fine I take this how much
I<00:05:08.140> get<00:05:08.680> into<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.190> reflected<00:05:09.940> light<00:05:10.150> reflected

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
I get into the reflected light reflected

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.410 
I get into the reflected light reflected
lights<00:05:11.020> lights<00:05:11.830> that's<00:05:12.130> not<00:05:13.090> coming<00:05:13.330> directly

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
lights lights that's not coming directly

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.940 
lights lights that's not coming directly
from<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:13.870> light<00:05:14.020> source<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.650> coming<00:05:14.860> from

the walls or another object how much

they get into that is my choice as I
