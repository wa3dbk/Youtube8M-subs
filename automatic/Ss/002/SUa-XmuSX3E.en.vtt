00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.689 
gonna go ahead we're going to go to
medium<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> medium-high<00:00:25.859> heat<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
medium like a medium-high heat I like to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.240 
medium like a medium-high heat I like to
kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.029> stay<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.570> medium<00:00:27.990> high<00:00:28.170> high<00:00:28.859> gets

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
kind of stay on medium high high gets

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.919 
kind of stay on medium high high gets
kind<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.910> hot<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.359> burn<00:00:30.570> things

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
kind of really hot and you burn things

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.910 
kind of really hot and you burn things
so<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:32.640> bit<00:00:32.790> lower<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.270> better<00:00:33.300> because

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
so a little bit lower is better because

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.260 
so a little bit lower is better because
unless<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.219> needs<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.670> really<00:00:35.969> high<00:00:36.120> at

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
unless it needs to be really high at

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.360 
unless it needs to be really high at
first<00:00:36.540> keep<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.620> heat<00:00:37.800> down<00:00:37.829> around

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
first keep your heat down around

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.130 
first keep your heat down around
medium-high<00:00:38.940> alright<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
medium-high alright so we're going to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
medium-high alright so we're going to
put<00:00:40.230> our<00:00:40.290> pan<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:41.059> what<00:00:42.059> I've<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:43.579> it's<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.730> no

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
put our pan on what I've got it's a no

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.630 
put our pan on what I've got it's a no
stick<00:00:45.210> pan<00:00:46.100> remember<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.610> says

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
stick pan remember just because it says

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.450 
stick pan remember just because it says
no<00:00:48.059> stick<00:00:48.360> doesn't<00:00:49.050> mean<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.250> not

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
no stick doesn't mean that it's not

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.010 
no stick doesn't mean that it's not
going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> stick<00:00:50.969> it'll<00:00:51.149> kind<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> burn<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
going to stick it'll kind of burn and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.650 
going to stick it'll kind of burn and
then<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> won't<00:00:52.920> stick<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.480> do

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
then it won't stick so what I like to do

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
then it won't stick so what I like to do
is<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.410> cooking<00:00:55.860> spray<00:00:56.160> or

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
is you can use a cooking spray or

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.639 
is you can use a cooking spray or
something<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.260> typically<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.620> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
something like that typically what I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.130 
something like that typically what I
like<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.850> better<00:01:00.090> butter<00:01:00.539> works<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
like I think better butter works the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.420 
like I think better butter works the
best<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:02.420> no<00:01:03.420> stick<00:01:03.719> purposes<00:01:04.229> okay<00:01:04.650> I'll<00:01:05.250> put

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
best for no stick purposes okay I'll put

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.190 
best for no stick purposes okay I'll put
a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.790> butter<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.210> pan<00:01:06.570> let

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a little bit of butter in my pan let

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.340 
a little bit of butter in my pan let
that<00:01:07.409> melt<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.159> me<00:01:08.360> now<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:10.110> we're<00:01:10.260> going

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that melt up for me now what we're going

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
that melt up for me now what we're going
to<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.650> I'm<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> let<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.729> heat<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.240> just

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to do I'm going to let that heat up just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.399 
to do I'm going to let that heat up just
a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.840> bit<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.189> butter<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
a little bit so that butter so it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.609 
a little bit so that butter so it
actually<00:01:17.509> we<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.689> move<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.900> around<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.259> pan

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
actually we can move it around that pan

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.789 
actually we can move it around that pan
and<00:01:19.830> coat<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> pan<00:01:20.460> real<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.799> but

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
and coat that pan real well with it but

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.030 
and coat that pan real well with it but
essentially<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.619> these<00:01:25.770> eggs

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
essentially we have we can do these eggs

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.859 
essentially we have we can do these eggs
a<00:01:26.159> couple<00:01:26.430> different<00:01:26.520> ways<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
a couple different ways we can do a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.109 
a couple different ways we can do a
sunny-side<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.470> which<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.759> leave<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
sunny-side up which is we just leave it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.870 
sunny-side up which is we just leave it
the<00:01:30.930> way<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.229> crack<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.950> let<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.490> cook<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the way we crack it and let it cook in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
the way we crack it and let it cook in
the<00:01:32.939> bottom<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.590> flip<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> over

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the bottom and we don't flip it over

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.730 
the bottom and we don't flip it over
sunny<00:01:35.670> side<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.240> course<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
sunny side up of course if that's the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.980 
sunny side up of course if that's the
way<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.189> great<00:01:38.939> they're<00:01:39.810> very

way you like them great they're very
simple<00:01:40.409> very<00:01:40.439> easy<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.950> let<00:01:41.130> them<00:01:41.220> cook<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
simple very easy you let them cook for a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.499 
simple very easy you let them cook for a
while<00:01:41.720> let<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.070> white<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.820> kind<00:01:45.390> of

while let that white get is kind of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.740 
while let that white get is kind of
solid<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.759> scoop
