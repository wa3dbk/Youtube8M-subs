00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
leagues like I said five and four were

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.710 
leagues like I said five and four were
wrong<00:01:05.460> last<00:01:05.729> year<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.000> foals<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.360> Stafford

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
wrong last year with foals and Stafford

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.149 
wrong last year with foals and Stafford
but<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.229> had<00:01:07.320> Aaron<00:01:07.560> Rodgers<00:01:07.830> at<00:01:07.950> number

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
but then we had Aaron Rodgers at number

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.190 
but then we had Aaron Rodgers at number
three<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.210> he<00:01:09.299> ended<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.600> finishing<00:01:09.810> one

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
three and he ended up finishing one

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
three and he ended up finishing one
overall<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.890> we'll<00:01:11.010> give<00:01:11.130> him<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.460> check<00:01:11.939> for

overall so we'll give him a check for

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
overall so we'll give him a check for
that<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.659> had<00:01:12.780> Peyton<00:01:13.110> Manning<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.409> number<00:01:13.650> two

that we had Peyton Manning at number two

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.800 
that we had Peyton Manning at number two
he<00:01:14.220> ended<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.460> finishing<00:01:14.700> fourth<00:01:15.210> overall<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
he ended up finishing fourth overall so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
he ended up finishing fourth overall so
point<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.220> drew<00:01:17.430> brees<00:01:17.670> at

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
point for that and we have drew brees at

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.120 
point for that and we have drew brees at
number<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.299> you're<00:01:19.049> not<00:01:19.200> finishing<00:01:19.590> sixth

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
number one you're not finishing sixth

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.499 
number one you're not finishing sixth
overall<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.790> we'll<00:01:20.880> give<00:01:21.000> him<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.150> point<00:01:21.390> for

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
overall so we'll give him a point for

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
overall so we'll give him a point for
that<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.810> well<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.439> three<00:01:22.860> went<00:01:23.100> three<00:01:23.400> correct

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700

Eli Manning of the New York Giants I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.399 
Eli Manning of the New York Giants I
think<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> passing<00:01:36.270> attack<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:37.259> year

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
think with the passing attack this year

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.899 
think with the passing attack this year
pretty<00:01:37.619> much<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.950> think<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.820> always

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
pretty much I think you know you always

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.359 
pretty much I think you know you always
have<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.420> wary<00:01:39.689> of

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
have to be a little wary of

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.649 
have to be a little wary of
interceptions<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:41.549> turns<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.939> ball<00:01:42.060> over<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
interceptions he turns the ball over a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
interceptions he turns the ball over a
lot<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.130> gotta<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.399> those<00:01:44.549> go

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
lot I don't think you gotta see those go

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090 
lot I don't think you gotta see those go
down<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.560> personally

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
down because I think with I personally

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.170 
down because I think with I personally
don't<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.490> much<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.820> run<00:01:48.000> game

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180

to pass it more especially if he gets

out<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> playoffs<00:03:04.329> so<00:03:04.659> maybe<00:03:04.870> he<00:03:05.139> can

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
out in the playoffs so maybe he can

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.199 
out in the playoffs so maybe he can
carry<00:03:05.530> over<00:03:05.769> somewhere<00:03:06.220> but<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.819> think<00:03:06.970> Russell

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
carry over somewhere but I think Russell

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.220 
carry over somewhere but I think Russell
Wilson's<00:03:07.450> going<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:07.659> finish<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:07.989> around

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
Wilson's going to finish with around

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.830 
Wilson's going to finish with around

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
yards rushing I don't think they're

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.319 
yards rushing I don't think they're
gonna<00:03:20.319> be<00:03:20.500> anywhere<00:03:20.859> near<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.040> but<00:03:21.280> still<00:03:21.579> my

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
gonna be anywhere near that but still my

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.879 
gonna be anywhere near that but still my

fancy year number three we're going with
Ben<00:03:25.930> Roethlisberger<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.859> mean<00:03:27.989> talent-wise

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
Ben Roethlisberger I mean talent-wise

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.629 
Ben Roethlisberger I mean talent-wise
been<00:03:29.440> around<00:03:29.620> should<00:03:29.829> be<00:03:29.919> most<00:03:30.220> people's<00:03:30.459> top

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
been around should be most people's top

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.309 
been around should be most people's top
five<00:03:30.849> but<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.329> think<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.569> first<00:03:31.780> four<00:03:32.079> games

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
five but I think the first four games

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.689 
five but I think the first four games
with<00:03:32.590> leaving<00:03:32.949> on<00:03:33.040> bail<00:03:33.190> being<00:03:33.400> suspended

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
with leaving on bail being suspended

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.280 
with leaving on bail being suspended
they're<00:03:33.879> gonna<00:03:33.970> throw<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.299> ball<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.629> lot<00:03:34.989> and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
they're gonna throw the ball a lot and

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.619 
they're gonna throw the ball a lot and
those<00:03:35.620> first<00:03:35.919> four<00:03:36.129> games<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:37.299> know<00:03:37.389> you<00:03:37.449> got

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
those first four games you know you got

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.390 
those first four games you know you got
Antonio<00:03:38.049> Brown<00:03:38.230> martavis<00:03:38.739> Bryant<00:03:39.190> Heath

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
Antonio Brown martavis Bryant Heath

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.789 
Antonio Brown martavis Bryant Heath
Miller<00:03:39.720> those<00:03:40.720> receiving<00:03:41.230> threats<00:03:41.560> are

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
Miller those receiving threats are

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.650 
Miller those receiving threats are
always<00:03:42.310> always<00:03:42.549> going<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.849> be<00:03:42.879> potent<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:43.629> I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
always always going to be potent so I

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.080 
always always going to be potent so I
think<00:03:43.780> he's<00:03:43.930> gonna<00:03:44.049> have<00:03:44.169> 4,300<00:03:45.129> passing

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
think he's gonna have 4,300 passing

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.020 
think he's gonna have 4,300 passing
yards<00:03:46.299> 35<00:03:46.930> passing<00:03:47.530> touchdowns<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.819> might<00:03:48.970> as

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.250 
yards 35 passing touchdowns you might as
well<00:03:49.090> throw<00:03:49.329> in<00:03:49.389> three<00:03:49.750> rushing<00:03:50.079> touchdowns

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
well throw in three rushing touchdowns

gonna<00:06:09.400> be<00:06:09.550> able<00:06:09.639> to<00:06:09.789> if<00:06:10.029> he<00:06:10.120> throws<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.419> ball

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
gonna be able to if he throws the ball

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.899 
gonna be able to if he throws the ball
you<00:06:10.990> know<00:06:11.080> 150<00:06:11.529> more<00:06:11.770> times<00:06:12.099> than<00:06:12.610> he<00:06:12.669> heard

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
you know 150 more times than he heard

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.120 
you know 150 more times than he heard
Rogers<00:06:13.300> for<00:06:13.539> example<00:06:14.020> he's<00:06:14.740> got<00:06:14.889> throwing

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
Rogers for example he's got throwing

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.200 
Rogers for example he's got throwing
interceptions<00:06:15.219> so<00:06:15.729> I<00:06:15.789> think<00:06:15.880> you<00:06:16.180> know

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
interceptions so I think you know

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.730 
interceptions so I think you know
obviously<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:16.719> gotta<00:06:16.870> keep<00:06:16.990> in<00:06:17.139> mind<00:06:17.349> Andrew

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
obviously you gotta keep in mind Andrew

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.899 
obviously you gotta keep in mind Andrew
Luck<00:06:17.860> does<00:06:18.039> turn<00:06:18.219> the<00:06:18.310> ball<00:06:18.460> over<00:06:18.490> more<00:06:18.880> than

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
Luck does turn the ball over more than

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.820 
Luck does turn the ball over more than
Aaron<00:06:19.210> Rodgers<00:06:19.539> but<00:06:19.930> i<00:06:19.960> just<00:06:20.139> think<00:06:20.229> just<00:06:20.620> for

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
Aaron Rodgers but i just think just for

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.920 
Aaron Rodgers but i just think just for
purely<00:06:21.310> number<00:06:22.090> standpoints<00:06:22.570> yeah<00:06:22.690> throw<00:06:22.840> the

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
purely number standpoints yeah throw the

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.140 
purely number standpoints yeah throw the
ball<00:06:23.080> so<00:06:23.380> much<00:06:23.560> more<00:06:23.800> he<00:06:24.699> should<00:06:24.940> be<00:06:25.029> the

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
ball so much more he should be the

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.339 
ball so much more he should be the
frontrunner<00:06:25.510> for<00:06:25.570> most<00:06:25.870> your<00:06:26.050> fantasy
