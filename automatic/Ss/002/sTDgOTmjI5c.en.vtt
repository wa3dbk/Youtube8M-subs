the hang of it
I'm<00:00:17.670> absolutely<00:00:18.119> rubbish<00:00:18.600> at<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.170> this

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
I'm absolutely rubbish at it so this

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.660 
I'm absolutely rubbish at it so this
shouldn't<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.650> considered<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.340> review

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
it's just me playing the game badly so

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.710 
it's just me playing the game badly so
you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.410> see<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.740> looks<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:29.630> what<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
it's a Jeep

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's a Jeep
whoops<00:00:37.110> you're<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> maze<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.090> um

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
whoops you're in a maze kind of like um

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.740 
whoops you're in a maze kind of like um
combat<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.410> Atari<00:00:40.800> 2600<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.149> vastly

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
combat on the Atari 2600 but vastly

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.110 
combat on the Atari 2600 but vastly
better<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.940> have

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
better and you do have

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880 
better and you do have
computer-controlled<00:00:45.780> enemies<00:00:46.200> rather<00:00:46.710> than

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
computer-controlled enemies rather than

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.600 
computer-controlled enemies rather than
just<00:00:47.100> one-on-one<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> you've<00:00:50.039> got<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.340> tanks

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
just one-on-one so you've got two tanks

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.080 
just one-on-one so you've got two tanks
running<00:00:50.910> around<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.300> maze<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:53.090> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
running around the maze with you and a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.939 
running around the maze with you and a
helicopter<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.780> keeps<00:00:55.140> coming<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
helicopter that keeps coming out and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
helicopter that keeps coming out and
flying<00:00:56.280> around<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.210> helicopter<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.809> quite

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
flying around the helicopter is quite

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
flying around the helicopter is quite
easy<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.829> tanks<00:00:59.250> aren't<00:00:59.489> because

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
easy to get the tanks aren't because

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.710 
easy to get the tanks aren't because
wherever<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:03.290> but<00:01:04.290> their<00:01:04.860> gun<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.360> pretty

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
wherever you go but their gun is pretty

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.080 
wherever you go but their gun is pretty
much<00:01:06.840> aiming<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.700> makes<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
much aiming right at you which makes it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
much aiming right at you which makes it
very<00:01:09.119> difficult<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> try<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.470> sneak<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.860> on

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
very difficult to try and sneak up on

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.660 
very difficult to try and sneak up on
them<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.580> anything<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:13.400> but<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
them or or anything like that but it is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.510 
them or or anything like that but it is
good<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> mean<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.770> speed<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.100> speed

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
good I mean you do have speed a speed

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.100 
good I mean you do have speed a speed
advantage<00:01:17.549> over<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> tanks

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.280 

ah

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.109 

ah

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:49.120 

yeah<00:01:32.860> we'll<00:01:33.860> reset<00:01:34.460> that

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.980 

I<00:01:49.250> was<00:01:49.850> mistaken<00:01:50.030> in<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:50.689> thought<00:01:50.960> you

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
I was mistaken in that I thought you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.770 
I was mistaken in that I thought you
absolutely<00:01:51.409> had<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.649> have<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.070> overlay<00:01:52.780> on

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
absolutely had to have the overlay on

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.800 
absolutely had to have the overlay on
this<00:01:54.079> game<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.710> be<00:01:54.829> able<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.039> play<00:01:55.189> it<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:55.610> I

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
this game to be able to play it but I

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.789 
this game to be able to play it but I
must<00:01:56.810> have<00:01:56.840> been<00:01:56.960> playing<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.289> in<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.470> different

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
must have been playing it in a different

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:58.990 
must have been playing it in a different
mode<00:01:57.950> when<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:58.280> played<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.610> on<00:01:58.700> an<00:01:58.850> emulator

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
mode when I played it on an emulator

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.169 
mode when I played it on an emulator
because<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:01.280> particular<00:02:01.610> mode<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.030> think

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
because in this particular mode I think

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.219 
because in this particular mode I think
the<00:02:02.450> overlay<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:05.110> well<00:02:06.110> they<00:02:06.380> used<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.740> were

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the overlay is well they used to were

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.920 
the overlay is well they used to were
the<00:02:09.229> programmers<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.910> these<00:02:11.180> vector<00:02:11.540> x<00:02:11.660> games

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
the programmers of these vector x games

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.290 
the programmers of these vector x games
absolutely<00:02:12.709> loathed<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.489> overlays<00:02:13.940> the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
absolutely loathed the overlays the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.440 
absolutely loathed the overlays the
overlays<00:02:14.599> were<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.400> idea<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.880> marketing

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
overlays were the idea of the marketing

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.990 
overlays were the idea of the marketing
people<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.220> quite<00:02:19.220> often<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.640> they<00:02:19.849> would

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
people and quite often that they would

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.530 
people and quite often that they would
write<00:02:20.209> in<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.540> documentation<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.890> best

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
write in the documentation for best

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.309 
write in the documentation for best
gameplay<00:02:23.540> experience<00:02:24.319> remove<00:02:24.890> overlay<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
gameplay experience remove overlay and I

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.839 
gameplay experience remove overlay and I
can<00:02:30.769> kind<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.069> see<00:02:31.220> where<00:02:31.400> they<00:02:31.519> were<00:02:31.580> coming

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
can kind of see where they were coming

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:39.890 
can kind of see where they were coming
from

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.199 

but<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> game<00:02:40.829> itself

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:54.190 

it's<00:02:44.810> very<00:02:45.049> compelling

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.410 

and<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.800> Vectrex<00:02:55.220> itself<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.910> think<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.240> one<00:02:56.390> of

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
and the Vectrex itself I think is one of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.690 
and the Vectrex itself I think is one of
the<00:02:56.540> coolest<00:02:56.930> ones<00:02:57.170> I've<00:02:57.380> ever<00:02:57.620> made<00:02:57.920> purely

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
the coolest ones I've ever made purely

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.440 
the coolest ones I've ever made purely
because<00:02:58.970> it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
because it

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.570 
because it
it's<00:02:59.810> got<00:03:00.020> vector<00:03:00.380> graphics<00:03:00.830> nothing<00:03:01.400> else

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
it's got vector graphics nothing else

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.780 
it's got vector graphics nothing else
has<00:03:02.510> ever<00:03:02.720> had<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:05.170> since<00:03:06.170> yeah<00:03:07.069> partly<00:03:07.640> old

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
arcade game and it just makes them

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:24.010 
arcade game and it just makes them
unique

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:40.320

other one I didn't know that happened

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.440 
other one I didn't know that happened
what<00:04:06.030> could<00:04:06.270> happen

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
what could happen

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.230 
what could happen
you<00:04:09.450> coming<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.840> get<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.530> perfect<00:04:11.010> oh<00:04:11.250> I'm

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
you coming to get the perfect oh I'm

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.870 
you coming to get the perfect oh I'm
going<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.450> get<00:04:12.570> hit<00:04:12.780> here<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:16.310> they<00:04:17.310> can<00:04:17.579> fire

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
going to get hit here and they can fire

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.909 
going to get hit here and they can fire
after<00:04:18.150> they're<00:04:18.510> hit<00:04:18.810> that's<00:04:19.190> interesting

good game I like that I think I like
just<00:06:01.620> about<00:06:01.650> every<00:06:02.040> vector<00:06:02.220> X<00:06:02.520> Games<00:06:02.820> well

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
just about every vector X Games well

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.110 
just about every vector X Games well
that<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:04.020> play<00:06:04.290> it<00:06:04.410> anyway<00:06:04.740> I<00:06:04.980> can't<00:06:05.340> you<00:06:05.850> can't

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120

that I play it anyway I can't you can't
fail<00:06:06.510> to<00:06:06.840> like<00:06:07.020> vector<00:06:07.500> X<00:06:07.620> games<00:06:07.920> unless<00:06:08.840> your

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
fail to like vector X games unless your

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.240 
fail to like vector X games unless your
I<00:06:10.170> don't<00:06:10.890> know<00:06:12.560> yes<00:06:13.560> someone<00:06:13.950> who<00:06:14.070> doesn't
