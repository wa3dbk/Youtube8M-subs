00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.370 
and then with a paladin they have wave
clear<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.670> I'm<00:01:32.909> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:34.020> don't<00:01:34.200> want

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
clear so I'm kind of I really don't want

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.289 
clear so I'm kind of I really don't want
to<00:01:34.500> play<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.770> many<00:01:34.890> cards<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> beginning

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.730

well<00:02:23.010> using<00:02:23.160> my<00:02:23.400> lock<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:23.970> home<00:02:24.120> I'm<00:02:24.420> not

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
really worried about that not much then

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.880 
really worried about that not much then
the<00:02:33.630> problem<00:02:33.959> with<00:02:34.049> paying<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> really<00:02:34.650> safe

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
the problem with paying it really safe

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.589 
the problem with paying it really safe
is<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.400> he<00:02:35.549> gets<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.819> really<00:02:36.060> strong<00:02:36.269> creature

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
worried about his wave Claire and I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.800 
worried about his wave Claire and I
shouldn't<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:41.940> worried<00:02:42.239> about<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.690> be

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810
