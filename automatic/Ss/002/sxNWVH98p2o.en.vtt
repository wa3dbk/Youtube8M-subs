00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.010
 a great desire for everyone here recently 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.550
 Paid theme are here on battlefield with 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.119
 two friends of mine to show you a glitch 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.160
 of battlefield 4 which was discovered 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.570
 these days I discovered it this way 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.820
 case and in practice consists in putting 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.829
 two types of classes in one 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.129
 class you see he has a rocket launcher e 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.219
 munitions 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.100
 I'll show you too, sit and 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:42.699
 now I'm here to show you how 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.159
 this glik which is very complex 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.870
 considered only a fact that there 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.739
 will allow for infinite ammunition 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.739
 for a rocket launcher 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.719
 to make this click 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:58.600
 the mechanism is really very simple 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.479
 first you have to go to the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.080
 pre- game section where you can go to 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.760
 touch up the classes once they enter 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.540
 in the session where the changes are made 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.270
 classes you have to choose two classes that 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.670
 they are close for example assault genre 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.450
 then you will understand later why I tell you 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.130
 nearby 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.230
 when i will explain how to do it 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.630
 the real union 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.700
 now for the two classes you want 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.030
 join and put in the two classes i 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.270
 gadgets you want to have in both 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.760
 classes that can be a gadget for every 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.580
 ie class engineer for example 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.840
 have only the smau and the support can 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.850
 have only the bag of bullets i 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.190
 gadgets must be placed with 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.159
 respectively in the opposite slots for 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.409
 merge classes 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.050
 we must return to the area where we enter 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.940
 in the game or where we decide where 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.920
 born in the map to unite 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.330
 actually classes and play with 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.580
 we have to combine these two classes 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.170
 put on one of the two classes that 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.180
 we decided to role now 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:12.590
 if we have to move towards a class a 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:20.770
 left we have to click l 1x on ps3 e 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:24.200
 ps 4 and lp a on xbox and xbox one 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.780
 nothing to move to a class a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:38.380
 right we will have to click r1 hicks on ps3 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:38.380
 ps4 and rp a on xbox one and xbox 360 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.010
 perfect see you now the soldier of 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.210
 support to those you don't pay with it 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.480
 smau so this is the way 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.430
 joining the classes is a hedgehog for which 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.900
 could be passed in any 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.700
 moment and I don't know how long it will take though 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.390
 as long as there is use it because it really is 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.910
 useful as you see ie they are shots of 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.230
 throw has defined you see a little you 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.210
 or as you can see he has a doctor 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.370
 with the rocket launcher which then revive in 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.320
 any time 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.570
 he instead used it for this little one 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.930
 another that we all send 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.480
 ethical television apart from jokes and 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.970
 thank you for publishing my video 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.250
 they are milder I hope to be there 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.360
