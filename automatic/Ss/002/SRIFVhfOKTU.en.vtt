00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
I'm going to show you one way of working

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.440 
I'm going to show you one way of working
at<00:00:08.440> picot<00:00:08.800> edge<00:00:09.040> and<00:00:09.490> this<00:00:09.910> edge<00:00:10.090> is<00:00:10.270> really

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
at picot edge and this edge is really

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.900 
at picot edge and this edge is really
nice<00:00:10.750> anytime<00:00:11.350> you<00:00:11.799> are<00:00:11.830> using<00:00:12.160> a<00:00:12.400> rolled<00:00:12.730> hem

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
nice anytime you are using a rolled hem

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.790 
nice anytime you are using a rolled hem
a<00:00:13.480> rolled<00:00:13.990> hem<00:00:14.050> would<00:00:14.320> be<00:00:14.410> something<00:00:14.650> that

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
a rolled hem would be something that

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.429 
a rolled hem would be something that
you'd<00:00:15.010> see<00:00:15.220> at<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:15.670> cuff<00:00:16.420> of<00:00:16.599> a<00:00:16.689> cap<00:00:16.960> or<00:00:17.200> the

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
you'd see at the cuff of a cap or the

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.440 
you'd see at the cuff of a cap or the
cuff<00:00:18.099> of<00:00:18.279> sleeves<00:00:18.580> or<00:00:18.849> the<00:00:18.939> bottom<00:00:19.270> of<00:00:19.330> a

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
cuff of sleeves or the bottom of a

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.569 
cuff of sleeves or the bottom of a
sweater<00:00:19.720> anytime<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.710> hem<00:00:20.920> can<00:00:21.130> be<00:00:21.250> turned

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 
sweater anytime the hem can be turned

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.749 
sweater anytime the hem can be turned
you<00:00:21.939> can<00:00:22.119> do<00:00:22.300> this<00:00:22.480> edge<00:00:23.369> go<00:00:24.369> ahead<00:00:24.520> and<00:00:24.610> watch

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
you can do this edge go ahead and watch

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.159 
you can do this edge go ahead and watch
the<00:00:24.970> technique<00:00:25.360> and<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.540> think<00:00:25.779> you'll<00:00:25.899> see

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
the technique and I think you'll see

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.440 
the technique and I think you'll see
that<00:00:26.349> this<00:00:26.710> can<00:00:26.890> be<00:00:27.009> easily<00:00:27.279> substituted<00:00:27.790> into

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
that this can be easily substituted into

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.479 
that this can be easily substituted into
patterns<00:00:29.200> for<00:00:29.529> whatever<00:00:29.829> edge<00:00:30.040> they<00:00:30.279> have

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
patterns for whatever edge they have

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.460 
patterns for whatever edge they have
that<00:00:30.820> might<00:00:31.029> be<00:00:31.149> plain<00:00:31.450> this<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.259> nice

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.220 
when you fold that over and roll the hem
you<00:02:14.320> can<00:02:14.950> see<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.820> edge<00:02:16.000> isn't<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.870> great

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
you can see the edge isn't that great

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.059 
you can see the edge isn't that great
and<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.860> naturally<00:02:18.100> folds<00:02:18.820> there

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
and it naturally folds there

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.780 
and it naturally folds there
because<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:20.239> yarn<00:02:20.450> over<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.099> knit<00:02:22.099> two

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
because of the yarn over and knit two

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.569 
because of the yarn over and knit two
together<00:02:22.879> that<00:02:23.269> we<00:02:23.359> did<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.069> finish<00:02:25.340> this

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
together that we did so to finish this

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:31.569 
together that we did so to finish this
up<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:28.510> left<00:02:29.510> myself<00:02:29.719> a<00:02:30.139> long<00:02:30.409> tail<00:02:30.950> here<00:02:31.430> I'm

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
up I left myself a long tail here I'm

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.990 
up I left myself a long tail here I'm
going<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.889> grab<00:02:33.889> a<00:02:34.400> tapestry<00:02:35.269> needle<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:37.000> it

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
going to grab a tapestry needle and it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.800 
going to grab a tapestry needle and it
would<00:02:38.120> work<00:02:38.329> best<00:02:38.629> for<00:02:38.810> me<00:02:39.019> if<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:40.400> actually

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
would work best for me if I actually

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.509 
would work best for me if I actually
clipped<00:02:41.810> these<00:02:42.079> down<00:02:42.409> to<00:02:42.739> hold<00:02:43.010> my<00:02:43.189> seam

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
clipped these down to hold my seam

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.140 
clipped these down to hold my seam
together<00:02:43.909> like<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:45.700> but<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.909> is<00:02:47.000> such<00:02:47.120> a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
together like that but this is such a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.110 
together like that but this is such a
tiny<00:02:47.480> piece<00:02:48.079> I<00:02:48.319> can<00:02:48.439> easily<00:02:48.799> just<00:02:49.219> hold<00:02:49.999> it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
tiny piece I can easily just hold it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.110 
tiny piece I can easily just hold it
together<00:02:50.859> so<00:02:51.859> I'll<00:02:52.159> pick<00:02:52.519> up<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.790> little<00:02:52.969> bit

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
together so I'll pick up a little bit

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.209 
together so I'll pick up a little bit
from<00:02:53.389> the<00:02:53.569> rolled<00:02:53.780> hem<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.409> just<00:02:54.650> grab<00:02:54.950> the

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:55.219 
from the rolled hem and just grab the

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.209 
from the rolled hem and just grab the
back<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.639> stitch<00:02:56.650> from<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.769> rest<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.159> the

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
back of a stitch from the rest of the

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.000 
back of a stitch from the rest of the
work<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.819> is<00:02:58.879> really<00:02:59.389> nothing<00:03:00.169> fancy<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.889> I

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
work this is really nothing fancy and I

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.459 
work this is really nothing fancy and I
think<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.489> just<00:03:02.150> whip<00:03:02.419> stitch<00:03:02.780> even<00:03:05.319> but<00:03:06.319> the

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:06.469 
think it's just whip stitch even but the

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.050 
think it's just whip stitch even but the
important<00:03:06.859> thing<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.129> I'm<00:03:07.340> not<00:03:07.370> stabbing

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
important thing is I'm not stabbing

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.330 
important thing is I'm not stabbing
through<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.569> work<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.409> nothing<00:03:09.859> will<00:03:09.980> show<00:03:10.189> up

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
through the work so nothing will show up

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.830 
through the work so nothing will show up
on<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:10.699> side<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.180> make<00:03:14.329> your<00:03:14.480> make

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
on this side and just make your make

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.030 
on this side and just make your make
sure<00:03:14.870> you're<00:03:15.139> consistent<00:03:15.319> all<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:15.889> way

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
sure you're consistent all the way

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.420 
sure you're consistent all the way
across<00:03:16.340> with<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.849> way<00:03:16.939> you're<00:03:17.090> seaming<00:03:17.540> it

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.379 

very<00:03:22.430> easy<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:24.669> there's<00:03:25.669> the<00:03:25.819> picot<00:03:26.180> edge

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
very easy and there's the picot edge

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.349 
very easy and there's the picot edge
partially<00:03:27.109> held<00:03:27.319> down<00:03:27.560> now<00:03:28.340> one<00:03:28.699> more<00:03:28.939> trick<00:03:29.239> I

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
partially held down now one more trick I

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.649 
partially held down now one more trick I
want<00:03:29.509> to<00:03:29.599> show<00:03:29.689> you<00:03:29.919> back<00:03:30.919> to<00:03:31.099> the<00:03:31.189> little<00:03:31.370> hat

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
want to show you back to the little hat

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.520 
want to show you back to the little hat
there's<00:03:32.659> this<00:03:33.400> design<00:03:34.400> feature<00:03:34.819> I<00:03:35.090> added<00:03:35.750> with

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
there's this design feature I added with

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.800 
there's this design feature I added with
this<00:03:36.739> blue<00:03:37.129> and<00:03:37.639> I<00:03:37.909> made<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.209> pom-pom<00:03:38.629> to

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
this blue and I made the pom-pom to

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.809 
this blue and I made the pom-pom to
match<00:03:39.019> but<00:03:39.379> it<00:03:39.799> was<00:03:39.859> really<00:03:40.250> just<00:03:40.669> to<00:03:40.790> make

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
match but it was really just to make

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.270 
match but it was really just to make
life<00:03:41.269> easier<00:03:41.599> on<00:03:41.750> myself<00:03:41.959> that's<00:03:42.620> why<00:03:42.829> I<00:03:42.859> added

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
life easier on myself that's why I added

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.390 
life easier on myself that's why I added
this<00:03:43.400> blue<00:03:43.759> stripe<00:03:45.040> be-what<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.159> is<00:03:46.250> what<00:03:46.370> I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
this blue stripe be-what this is what I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.979 
this blue stripe be-what this is what I
did<00:03:46.699> I<00:03:47.470> cast<00:03:48.470> on<00:03:48.620> here<00:03:49.009> I<00:03:49.159> knit<00:03:49.579> down<00:03:49.819> I<00:03:50.180> did<00:03:50.840> the

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
did I cast on here I knit down I did the

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.439 
did I cast on here I knit down I did the
picot<00:03:51.319> edge<00:03:51.530> row<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.189> then<00:03:52.669> I<00:03:52.849> continued

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
picot edge row and then I continued

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.869 
picot edge row and then I continued
knitting<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.019> if<00:03:54.709> I'm<00:03:54.949> not<00:03:55.069> mistaken<00:03:55.459> this

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
knitting and if I'm not mistaken this

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.229 
knitting and if I'm not mistaken this
was<00:03:55.939> ten<00:03:56.419> rows<00:03:56.689> I<00:03:57.079> knit<00:03:57.979> another<00:03:58.310> ten<00:03:58.669> rows<00:03:58.939> and

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
was ten rows I knit another ten rows and

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.479 
was ten rows I knit another ten rows and
did<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.659> blue<00:03:59.870> stripe<00:04:00.259> and<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.009> reason<00:04:01.370> for

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
did the blue stripe and the reason for

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.719 
did the blue stripe and the reason for
that<00:04:01.549> was<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:02.479> that<00:04:02.659> I<00:04:02.719> had<00:04:03.019> an<00:04:03.199> easy<00:04:03.729> guideline

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
that was so that I had an easy guideline

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.059 
that was so that I had an easy guideline
for<00:04:05.239> where<00:04:05.479> I<00:04:05.750> was<00:04:06.019> supposed<00:04:06.139> to<00:04:06.469> be<00:04:06.650> seaming

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
for where I was supposed to be seaming

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.740 
for where I was supposed to be seaming
this<00:04:07.219> down<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.879> I<00:04:08.299> wasn't<00:04:08.599> going<00:04:08.719> to

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
this down and I wasn't going to

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.289 
this down and I wasn't going to
accidentally<00:04:09.349> jump<00:04:09.620> up<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:10.009> row<00:04:10.459> or<00:04:10.729> down<00:04:10.939> a<00:04:10.969> row

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
accidentally jump up a row or down a row

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.420 
accidentally jump up a row or down a row
while<00:04:11.629> I<00:04:11.659> was<00:04:11.900> seaming<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.409> so<00:04:13.069> that<00:04:13.250> was

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
while I was seaming it so that was

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.649 
while I was seaming it so that was
something<00:04:13.609> that<00:04:13.759> just<00:04:14.000> happened<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.299> work<00:04:14.449> out

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
something that just happened to work out

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.719 
something that just happened to work out
well<00:04:14.870> with<00:04:15.079> this<00:04:15.229> hat<00:04:15.469> it<00:04:15.919> was<00:04:16.099> an<00:04:16.250> easy<00:04:16.459> enough

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
well with this hat it was an easy enough

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.339 
well with this hat it was an easy enough
thing<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:17.090> do<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:17.750> made<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:17.989> seaming

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
thing to do and it made the seaming

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.240 
thing to do and it made the seaming
really<00:04:18.620> simple<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:20.530> that's<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.829> that's<00:04:21.949> one

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
really simple and that's it that's one

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.879 
really simple and that's it that's one
easy<00:04:22.490> way<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.820> alter<00:04:23.539> a<00:04:23.719> pattern<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.289> include<00:04:24.650> a

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
easy way to alter a pattern to include a

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.350 
easy way to alter a pattern to include a
