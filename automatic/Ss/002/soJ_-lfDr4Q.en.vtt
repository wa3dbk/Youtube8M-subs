00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.190 
Christmas and I really liked it and it's
actually<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.860> longest<00:02:26.070> time<00:02:26.780> I've<00:02:27.780> ever<00:02:27.810> had

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
actually the longest time I've ever had

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.560 
actually the longest time I've ever had
a<00:02:28.890> Punisher<00:02:29.580> camera<00:02:29.940> because<00:02:30.240> for<00:02:30.420> some

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
a Punisher camera because for some

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.960 
a Punisher camera because for some
reason<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.990> was<00:02:31.200> dropped<00:02:31.590> them<00:02:31.830> or<00:02:32.070> like<00:02:32.220> break

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
reason I was dropped them or like break

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
reason I was dropped them or like break
them<00:02:33.209> more<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:33.900> some<00:02:34.200> reason<00:02:34.920> they<00:02:35.070> become

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
them more like some reason they become

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.699 
them more like some reason they become
unfocused<00:02:36.120> or<00:02:36.330> something<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.680> I

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
unfocused or something like that so I

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.770 
unfocused or something like that so I
kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.070> tend<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.580> go<00:02:38.760> through<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.750> know

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
kind of tend to go through you know

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.380 
kind of tend to go through you know
cornish<00:02:40.290> shoot<00:02:40.530> cameras<00:02:40.980> pretty<00:02:41.820> often<00:02:42.120> so

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
cornish shoot cameras pretty often so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.530 
cornish shoot cameras pretty often so
that's<00:02:42.720> why<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> got<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.290> powershot<00:02:43.890> elph<00:02:44.540> 110

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
that's why I got this powershot elph 110

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.150 
that's why I got this powershot elph 110
because<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.050> wasn't<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.410> expensive<00:02:46.590> i

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
because it wasn't that expensive i

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160 
because it wasn't that expensive i
actually<00:02:47.489> got<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.820> on<00:02:48.030> cyber<00:02:48.330> monday<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.020> it

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
actually got this on cyber monday and it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.810 
actually got this on cyber monday and it

dollars<00:02:51.620> 129<00:02:52.620> /<00:02:52.800> 939<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:53.970> was<00:02:54.000> 139<00:02:54.780> so

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
dollars 129 / 939 I think it was 139 so

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.650 
dollars 129 / 939 I think it was 139 so
130<00:02:56.070> no<00:02:56.190> dollars<00:02:56.489> which<00:02:56.670> really<00:02:57.030> isn't<00:02:57.239> bad

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
130 no dollars which really isn't bad

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.210

since this films and HD which is the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.880 
since this films and HD which is the
main<00:03:03.209> reason<00:03:03.510> why<00:03:03.630> i<00:03:03.660> use<00:03:04.019> punisher<00:03:04.530> cameras

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
main reason why i use punisher cameras

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.590 
main reason why i use punisher cameras
when<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.489> go<00:03:05.670> out<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.850> my<00:03:05.910> friends<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.420> take

part<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.330> flesh<00:03:18.660> would<00:03:18.870> always<00:03:19.170> come<00:03:19.350> up<00:03:19.410> and

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
part the flesh would always come up and

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.710 
part the flesh would always come up and
people<00:03:19.920> would<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.489> blocking<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.030> flash<00:03:21.299> or

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
people would I be blocking the flash or

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.140 
people would I be blocking the flash or
like<00:03:21.870> there<00:03:22.410> was<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> lot<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:23.150> automatic

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
like there was like a lot of automatic

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.420 
like there was like a lot of automatic
and<00:03:24.360> manual<00:03:24.390> settings<00:03:25.350> which<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.769> why<00:03:26.400> I

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
and manual settings which is why I

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.009 
and manual settings which is why I
really<00:03:26.850> like<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.150> camera<00:03:27.510> there's<00:03:27.690> Maino

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
really like this camera there's Maino

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.580 
really like this camera there's Maino
settings<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.709> can<00:03:29.600> shoot<00:03:30.600> HDR<00:03:31.350> which

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
settings and you can shoot HDR which

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.470 
settings and you can shoot HDR which
means<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.070> would<00:03:32.130> take<00:03:32.370> like<00:03:32.580> three<00:03:33.120> different

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
means it would take like three different

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.289 
means it would take like three different
exposures<00:03:34.110> at<00:03:34.320> one<00:03:34.500> time<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:36.090> was<00:03:36.269> really

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
exposures at one time so that was really

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.199 
exposures at one time so that was really
awesome<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:37.890> then<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.160> decided<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.850> didn't

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
awesome but like then I decided I didn't

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.880 
awesome but like then I decided I didn't
really<00:03:39.330> need<00:03:39.660> all<00:03:39.959> those<00:03:40.140> features<00:03:40.440> from<00:03:40.739> my

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
really need all those features from my

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.740 
really need all those features from my
point<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.220> shoot<00:03:41.459> isn't<00:03:41.880> nice<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.209> have<00:03:42.450> but

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
point of shoot isn't nice to have but

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.539 
point of shoot isn't nice to have but
not<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.170> necessary<00:03:43.890> because<00:03:44.160> um<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:45.870> know

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
not like a necessary because um you know

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.610 
not like a necessary because um you know
Punishers<00:03:47.549> are<00:03:47.700> supposed<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.090> fun<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.329> think
