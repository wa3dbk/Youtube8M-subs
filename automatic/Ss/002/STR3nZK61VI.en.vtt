out the knowledge later on you did not
you<00:05:53.970> don't<00:05:54.150> do<00:05:54.300> what<00:05:54.510> ninety-nine<00:05:54.990> percent<00:05:55.110> of

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
you don't do what ninety-nine percent of

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.380 
you don't do what ninety-nine percent of
people<00:05:55.440> do<00:05:55.800> which<00:05:56.010> is<00:05:56.040> you<00:05:56.310> know<00:05:56.370> they<00:05:57.090> they

thinking<00:06:08.100> that<00:06:08.160> getting<00:06:09.060> more<00:06:09.240> knowledge

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
thinking that getting more knowledge

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.110 
thinking that getting more knowledge
will<00:06:09.900> address<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.590> but<00:06:11.010> really<00:06:11.430> it<00:06:11.610> did<00:06:11.760> not

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
will address it but really it did not

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.750 
will address it but really it did not
write<00:06:12.510> in<00:06:12.540> a<00:06:12.780> way<00:06:12.960> so<00:06:13.020> but<00:06:13.380> anyway<00:06:13.530> how<00:06:14.520> do<00:06:14.580> you

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
write in a way so but anyway how do you

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.030 
write in a way so but anyway how do you
get<00:06:14.940> the<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.840> know-how<00:06:16.200> or<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.860> right

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
get the the know-how or the right

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
we benefited from the knowledge but it's

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.200 
we benefited from the knowledge but it's
also<00:07:05.820> still<00:07:06.180> important<00:07:06.780> that<00:07:07.490> we<00:07:08.490> get<00:07:08.670> mentors

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210
