00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
then carry on put the cube there she's
the<00:00:33.059> other<00:00:33.210> laser<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.110> directed<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.800> shoot

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the other laser and be directed to shoot

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090 
the other laser and be directed to shoot
that<00:00:35.190> turret<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> explosion<00:00:37.380> should<00:00:37.620> explode

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
that turret the explosion should explode

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400

the<00:00:38.370> vent<00:00:38.790> or<00:00:39.120> whatever<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.170> then<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the vent or whatever that is so then you

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.240 
the vent or whatever that is so then you
can<00:00:40.559> progress<00:00:40.710> through<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.890> there

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
can progress through it and then there

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.760 
can progress through it and then there
are<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:44.670> singing<00:00:44.969> current

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.220 

and<00:00:52.310> there's<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.730> little<00:00:52.880> remnant<00:00:53.390> dead<00:00:53.780> thing

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and there's a little remnant dead thing

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.510 
and there's a little remnant dead thing
that<00:00:54.470> I<00:00:54.500> don't<00:00:54.710> think<00:00:54.860> anyone<00:00:55.100> cares<00:00:55.220> about

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
that I don't think anyone cares about

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:06.340 
that I don't think anyone cares about
there's<00:00:55.820> nothing<00:00:55.940> special<00:00:56.360> here<00:01:05.350> they're

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
there's nothing special here they're

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.469 
there's nothing special here they're
also<00:01:06.500> sort<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:06.950> beasts<00:01:07.220> turn<00:01:07.490> over<00:01:07.880> here<00:01:08.060> but

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
also sort of beasts turn over here but

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.180 
also sort of beasts turn over here but
it<00:01:08.600> doesn't<00:01:08.840> actually<00:01:08.900> sing<00:01:09.410> so<00:01:09.830> it's<00:01:10.010> not<00:01:10.070> a

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
it doesn't actually sing so it's not a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:02:32.820 
it doesn't actually sing so it's not a
fitting<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.930> that's<00:01:11.930> pretty<00:01:12.229> much

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.850 

and<00:02:33.830> there<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.820> it
