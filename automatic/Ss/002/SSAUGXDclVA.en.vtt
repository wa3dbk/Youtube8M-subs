00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello guys with you sl foxy this 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.649
 video review of the new toy you saw 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.000
 the assassin creed 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.389
 united or assassin creed unity 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 more precisely it is not even a video review on 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.670
 full video review was not enough for me 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.039
 my nerves and iron of my computer is 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.930
 let's say such a mini video review at the beginning 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.510
 I even wanted to spray it and you know 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.269
 record turn on video editor write 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.949
 picture simultaneously comment but 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.079
 know my video card 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.420
 if earlier on moaned from she started 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.489
 just scream and your computer I like 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.910
 not considered backward by today's standards 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.750
 In general, I understand why the creators called 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.160
 this game is unity it means unity 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.719
 sky and your video cards 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.449
 she just flies away flies incapable 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.489
 fight system requirements 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.840
 who poured this toy and 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.150
 the number of lags and errors oh well i 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.409
 I will give you the opportunity to look at it 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.900
 all with your own eyes and you know looking at 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.970
 flying pastis screenshots like that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.860
 This, too, I thought that it was banter 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.500
 then I realized that Stella is herself 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.549
 the game apparently yubisofty could not 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.570
 cope with two projects 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.970
 at the same time though again to the plot I 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.140
 absolutely no fault I just 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.030
 I have no right to find fault with him 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.299
 since i played only from strength 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.360
 two hours and in principle, well, as the plot of me 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.729
 didn't disappoint me disappointed bugs and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.710
 glitches of the graphics itself and from the very beginning 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.840
 the game makes us clear for what reason 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.369
 a huge number of people in the hoods 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.320
 we have to play them but in order 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.000
 to open them apparently we need 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.969
 for a start please this grandfather 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.570
 which some tragedy seems 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.189
 apparently again did not pay retirement 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 a place in the trolley or minibus is necessary 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.060
 will press but I think it will be very 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.340
 fascinating let's see friends 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.110
 what is it 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.200
 so friends now you see the most 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.790
 fast download for computer history 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.099
 of games 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.500
 if it seems to you that she is still slow 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.019
 then I specifically put this cheetah 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.879
 on the screen so that you understand 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.000
 how fast is it going 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.370
 this event and so and so for now 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.620
 nothing happens then let's give 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.370
 opportunity for our cheetah to jump 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.319
 frolic because only he can 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.599
 compare in speed with this 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.950
 instant as sex with real 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.349
 girl saver 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.470
 oh well cheetah and let's not jump 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.750
 Take your time, I do a quick tell 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.500
 graduated and go to 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.690
 retirement while loading this screensaver well 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.090
 and without going into details I will say that 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.060
 the plot of the game throws us into the deep 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.660
 the middle ages recreated apparently by 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.049
 motivated by the condition of life in modern 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.019
 Khrushchev Knights Templar Order 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.980
 Some gandalf white which helps 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:20.280
 our heroes cope with a rare ailment 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.389
 he like the girls from the X-Men has 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.079
 pass through 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.079
 objects 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.490
 but this whole story ends up quite 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.710
 tragically gandalf arrested for 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.380
 sexual harassment to frodo 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.910
 and the main character is trying to get through 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.190
 assassin blade 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.900
 this time not cope with the task well 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.500
 and a little later we see a clear 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.490
 proof that the earth is round 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.490
 if you know what I mean 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.950
 the following mini video plot we 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.980
 playing for the son of chalk Gibson who 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.500
 turn came to the doctor to the clinic 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.240
 because they moved into his hair 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.910
 demons but he never managed to handle 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.640
 this affliction with which suddenly 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.040
 died and all that he left to his 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.840
 legacy is a pocket watch and 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.150
 obsession 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.120
 scalp demons this disease 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.419
 apparently inherited 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.530
 in general, going to do, I will say that 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:41.500
 guys I played a little and I did not play with 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.960
 great pleasure why am i now 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.550
 I will explain in principle it was clear with 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.350
 the very beginning of the storyline i'm not 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.720
 come saw not like me even 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:59.370
 I liked it and took quite good ones from the start 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:02.650
 momentum but the number of glitches and lags and 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.590
 you know this feeling of dampness of the product 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.750
 let me know one of the missions for example 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:13.480
 I couldn't get through because this dude 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:16.419
 stuck on the other side of the gate me 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.120
 enough for about two or three hours of gameplay 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.510
 although I am not a fan of this game, but I 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.030
 I think even ardent fans in this series 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.830
 will strain everything that I saw on 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.490
 the screen and there was really going on 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.470
 some kind of satanism and i may in the future 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.240
 be back to this game when they come out 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.190
 matching patch and optimizers 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.180
 I don't even know what to optimize 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.400
 let's say so optimizing all thanks for 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.370
