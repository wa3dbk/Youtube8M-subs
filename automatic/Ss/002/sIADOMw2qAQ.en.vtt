what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.100 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
kind<00:01:22.730> of<00:01:22.820> place<00:01:23.120> where<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.510> want<00:01:23.930> these

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
kind of place where I want these

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.880 
kind of place where I want these
elements<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.040> be<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:27.230> way<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.440> do<00:01:27.740> that

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
elements to be and the way you do that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.220 
elements to be and the way you do that
is<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.220> put<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.970> most<00:01:29.180> important<00:01:29.780> things<00:01:29.990> in

is you put the most important things in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.530 
is you put the most important things in
first<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.370> this<00:01:31.520> case<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.060> going<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.270> be<00:01:32.390> this

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
first so this case it's going to be this

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.320 
first so this case it's going to be this
horn<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.730> bowl<00:01:36.940> let's<00:01:37.940> talk<00:01:38.150> about

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
horn and the bowl let's talk about

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.610 
horn and the bowl let's talk about
ellipses<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:41.270> particular<00:01:41.690> ellipse<00:01:42.380> is

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
ellipses this particular ellipse is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.660 
ellipses this particular ellipse is
going<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.890> be<00:01:42.950> kind<00:01:43.160> of<00:01:43.220> like<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.370> football

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
going to be kind of like a football

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.950 
going to be kind of like a football
shaped<00:01:44.210> ellipse<00:01:45.850> because<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.330> bowls<00:01:47.540> on<00:01:47.780> its

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
shaped ellipse because the bowls on its

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.590 
shaped ellipse because the bowls on its
side<00:01:48.230> well<00:01:49.160> they're<00:01:49.640> always<00:01:50.030> somewhat

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
side well they're always somewhat

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.350 
side well they're always somewhat
football<00:01:51.020> shaped<00:01:51.520> into<00:01:52.520> drawing<00:01:52.880> earlier

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
football shaped into drawing earlier

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.240 
football shaped into drawing earlier
this<00:01:53.660> because<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:54.020> want<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.290> see<00:01:54.680> how<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.070> would

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
this because I want to see how it would

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.270 
this because I want to see how it would
look<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.730> I<00:01:56.240> think<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.630> was<00:01:56.930> kind<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.320> how<00:01:57.890> I

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
look and I think that was kind of how I

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.430 
look and I think that was kind of how I
think<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:59.180> was<00:01:59.360> going<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.600> look<00:01:59.810> this<00:01:59.990> kind<00:02:00.350> of

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
think it was going to look this kind of

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.470 
think it was going to look this kind of
lips<00:02:00.680> with<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> centerline<00:02:01.700> coming<00:02:02.270> down

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
lips with a centerline coming down

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.210 
lips with a centerline coming down
through<00:02:02.780> there<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:03.290> like<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.620> place<00:02:04.040> the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
through there I like to place the

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.130 
through there I like to place the
centerline<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.270> saw<00:02:05.420> me<00:02:05.570> do<00:02:05.660> that<00:02:05.810> first<00:02:05.990> of

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
centerline you saw me do that first of

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.410 
centerline you saw me do that first of
the<00:02:06.200> q-tip<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.710> then<00:02:06.890> draw<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.700> ellipse<00:02:08.090> from

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
the q-tip and then draw the ellipse from

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.830 
the q-tip and then draw the ellipse from
there<00:02:08.660> okay<00:02:09.729> so

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
there okay so

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.520 
there okay so
a<00:02:12.100> lot<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.130> people<00:02:13.550> have<00:02:13.760> problems<00:02:14.150> when<00:02:15.050> they

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
a lot of people have problems when they

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.090 
a lot of people have problems when they
run<00:02:15.770> into<00:02:15.800> an<00:02:16.280> ellipse<00:02:16.960> that's<00:02:17.960> this<00:02:18.320> way<00:02:18.620> if

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
run into an ellipse that's this way if

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.830 
run into an ellipse that's this way if
it<00:02:19.370> was<00:02:19.490> flat<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.030> table<00:02:20.180> most<00:02:20.540> people

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
it was flat on the table most people

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.920 
it was flat on the table most people
aren't<00:02:21.320> okay<00:02:21.770> with<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.300> but<00:02:23.300> when<00:02:23.420> they<00:02:23.570> when

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
aren't okay with that but when they when

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.440 
aren't okay with that but when they when
you<00:02:23.960> put<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.560> bowl<00:02:24.890> proper<00:02:25.430> bowl<00:02:25.640> up<00:02:25.910> like<00:02:26.180> that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
you put a bowl proper bowl up like that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.800 
you put a bowl proper bowl up like that
everyone<00:02:27.350> starts<00:02:27.710> to<00:02:27.890> want<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.420> not<00:02:29.420> do<00:02:29.780> it

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
everyone starts to want to not do it

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.500 
everyone starts to want to not do it
right<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.350> what<00:02:30.440> happens<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.130> they<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
right and what happens is they have the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.420 
right and what happens is they have the
bowl<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.230> round<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.010> looks<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.220> it's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
bowl to round so it looks like it's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.850 
bowl to round so it looks like it's
facing<00:02:34.700> out<00:02:35.150> toward<00:02:35.570> us<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.230> be<00:02:36.410> careful<00:02:36.770> not

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
facing out toward us so be careful not

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.040 
facing out toward us so be careful not

tips<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.790> anyway<00:02:53.260> here's<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.320> trick<00:02:54.650> if<00:02:54.860> you're

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
tips but anyway here's a trick if you're

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.310 
tips but anyway here's a trick if you're
having<00:02:55.490> problems<00:02:55.700> with<00:02:55.910> ellipses<00:02:56.510> just<00:02:57.140> take

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
having problems with ellipses just take

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.730 
having problems with ellipses just take
your<00:02:57.500> canvas<00:02:57.740> and<00:02:58.130> turn<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:59.170> to<00:03:00.170> where<00:03:00.380> the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
your canvas and turn it to where the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.470 
your canvas and turn it to where the
bowl<00:03:00.980> looks<00:03:01.340> like<00:03:01.490> it's<00:03:01.670> sitting<00:03:01.970> flat<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.270> a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
bowl looks like it's sitting flat on a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.040 
bowl looks like it's sitting flat on a
table<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.020> then<00:03:03.590> draw<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.810> much

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
table and then draw it and it's much

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.600 
table and then draw it and it's much
easier<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.590> do<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.100> like<00:03:07.280> that

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
easier to do it like that

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.460 
easier to do it like that
than<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:10.100> try<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.400> do<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.730> an<00:03:10.880> angle

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
than it is to to try to do it an angle

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.290 
than it is to to try to do it an angle
if<00:03:12.470> you're<00:03:12.740> having<00:03:12.920> problems<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:13.880> once<00:03:14.209> you

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
if you're having problems so once you

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.170 
if you're having problems so once you
get<00:03:14.420> an<00:03:14.510> idea<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.840> where<00:03:15.020> you<00:03:15.140> want<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.590> go

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
get an idea of where you want it to go

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.370 
get an idea of where you want it to go
then<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.209> just<00:03:17.480> come<00:03:17.660> in<00:03:17.780> here<00:03:17.900> with<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.110> palette

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
then I just come in here with a palette

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.259 
then I just come in here with a palette
knife<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.709> scrape<00:03:19.160> off<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.760> I'm<00:03:20.000> just

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
knife and I scrape off and I'm just

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.150 
knife and I scrape off and I'm just
going<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.450> go<00:03:20.600> back<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.050> transfer<00:03:21.650> an<00:03:21.769> oxide

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
going to go back to transfer an oxide

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.330 
going to go back to transfer an oxide
red<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:23.080> most<00:03:24.080> people<00:03:24.620> have<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.800> tendency<00:03:25.310> to

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
red and most people have a tendency to

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.750 
red and most people have a tendency to
err<00:03:25.700> on<00:03:26.260> making<00:03:27.260> their<00:03:27.440> shadows<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:28.100> little<00:03:28.130> bit

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
err on making their shadows a little bit

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.520 
err on making their shadows a little bit
too<00:03:29.180> light<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.790> I'd<00:03:31.790> rather<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.330> start<00:03:33.050> too

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
too light so I'd rather you start too

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.340 
too light so I'd rather you start too
dark<00:03:33.830> than<00:03:34.190> too<00:03:34.400> light<00:03:34.720> then<00:03:35.720> over<00:03:35.989> here<00:03:36.019> we're

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
dark than too light then over here we're

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.479 
dark than too light then over here we're
going<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.500> have<00:03:36.680> our<00:03:37.989> these<00:03:38.989> guys<00:03:39.489> these

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
going to have our these guys these

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.880 
going to have our these guys these
slices<00:03:40.970> I'm<00:03:41.900> not<00:03:42.049> gonna<00:03:42.170> really<00:03:42.260> put<00:03:42.500> those<00:03:42.680> in

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
slices I'm not gonna really put those in

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.250 
slices I'm not gonna really put those in
too<00:03:43.070> much<00:03:43.310> though<00:03:43.549> I<00:03:43.880> just<00:03:44.180> want<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.660> get<00:03:45.049> a

going to mass in this big area where
these<00:03:56.989> grapes<00:03:57.320> are<00:03:57.500> going<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.709> go<00:03:59.470> next<00:04:00.470> part

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
these grapes are going to go next part

these grapes are going to go next part
of<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.830> grate<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.310> what<00:04:01.640> I<00:04:01.670> like<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.030> do<00:04:02.209> is
