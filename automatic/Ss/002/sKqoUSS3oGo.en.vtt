00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.870
 suffer from ear 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.370
 you suffer from raccoon circles like me 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.290
 then you need to watch this video for 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.290
 find a solution to your problem 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.880
 in a previous shopping video that if 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.890
 they have not seen it, I'm going to let them put 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.529
 the image so they go click on it and 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.930
 do it automatically and take them 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.700
 automatically that video and also they 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.500
 I leave information in the box because 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.330
 is watching says some mobile device 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.730
 but good in this video I showed them 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.680
 two products that you rest cause 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.170
 feeling and honestly to me too 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.269
 these were the perfect and for of the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:54.430
 city color and the dark circus concealer 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:57.129
 mix remembers good specifically I'm going to 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.530
 say who is lourdes martínez miriam 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.089
 13 r and anna hernández told me in the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.309
 comments remember girls who 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.019
 you wanted to see some review of the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.940
 two proofreaders or specifically of 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.070
 this palette so today 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.990
 I bring a lot of gossip about these in 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.570
 this time we will go to the ring to these 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.310
 two attentive products to know what is 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.840
 the one that works best obviously according to 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.560
 my experience and point of view 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.259
 as well 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.299
 my trick and it's not a big secret is 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.140
 use concealers in orange tones 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.149
 to cover my tone of dark circles does not seem 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.210
 like panda every day and do not see me 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.189
 Well, so tired and sleepless, I'm sure 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.320
 They know that blue and orange are 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.450
 opposite colors on the color wheel 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.179
 a chromatic circle and this will be 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.360
 applied one above the other are covered 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.759
 with are hidden and when applied separately 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.070
 they are potentiated I am going to put a 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.069
 example if you are using an airplane 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.869
 orange and your ojera is blue marked 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.619
 strong the only one that will be your lip 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.110
 is that your dark circles notice even more 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.630
 but if we apply an orange color 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.700
 on top of that blue bonfire is blue it 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.950
 then also beat what we are going to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.769
 apply today are these two connectors in 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.290
 an orange tone of the citi palette 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.450
 totally orange colors and this one has 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.190
 plus a salmon tone cited the mix for 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.920
 see what helps to cover my bags better 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.380
 and strong alan you identify and say 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.360
 this can work for me I put the 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.040
 I notice that he not only Bonfire 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 I only bothered the color of the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.420
 ojera but I have enough or for my 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.860
 I like enough lines of expression and 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.480
 for the same reason I do not like that 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.459
 accumulating the product there and be more 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.470
 visible so I'm going to leave the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.660
 video with the part of the application for 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.620
 to see which of these two works 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.620
 better lists 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.790
 and 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.890
 and 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.100
 and 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.250
 and 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.989
 and 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.340
 and 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.069
 and 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.440
 and 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.349
 and 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.259
