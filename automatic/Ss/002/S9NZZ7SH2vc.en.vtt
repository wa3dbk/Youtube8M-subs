emotions<00:02:18.069> are<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.250> strong<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.780> other

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
emotions are so strong just the other

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900 
emotions are so strong just the other
day<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.200> nearly<00:02:20.590> attacked<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.220> pour<00:02:21.430> powder<00:02:21.640> on

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
day I nearly attacked to pour powder on

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.540 
day I nearly attacked to pour powder on
for<00:02:22.120> tripping<00:02:22.450> into<00:02:22.750> me<00:02:22.870> merely<00:02:23.770> berated<00:02:24.430> his

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
for tripping into me merely berated his

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.920 
for tripping into me merely berated his
clumsiness<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.300> weakness

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
clumsiness and weakness

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.890 
clumsiness and weakness
I<00:02:25.959> didn't<00:02:26.550> thankfully<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:28.630> difficult

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
I didn't thankfully but it's difficult

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.530 
I didn't thankfully but it's difficult
to<00:02:29.350> fight<00:02:29.530> off<00:02:29.709> those<00:02:29.950> feelings<00:02:30.459> how<00:02:31.300> do<00:02:31.360> you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
to fight off those feelings how do you

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.199 
to fight off those feelings how do you
do<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:34.410> that's<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.560> worst<00:02:35.830> thing<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.340> hear<00:02:36.640> how

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
do it that's the worst thing to hear how

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.930 
do it that's the worst thing to hear how
hard<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.140> suppose<00:02:39.130> that's<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.550> honest

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
hard it is I suppose that's the honest

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.570 
hard it is I suppose that's the honest
answer<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.930> dark<00:02:41.200> side<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.800> easier<00:02:42.310> path

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
answer the dark side is the easier path

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.790 
answer the dark side is the easier path
for<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> reason<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.870> one<00:02:44.050> thing<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.440> made<00:02:44.620> me

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
for a reason the one thing that made me

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.070 
for a reason the one thing that made me
come<00:02:45.040> here<00:02:45.370> was<00:02:45.640> how<00:02:45.820> hard<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.300> had<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:46.900> to

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
come here was how hard I had to think to

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.979 
come here was how hard I had to think to
remember<00:02:47.530> where<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.950> began<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.850> where<00:02:49.600> Uther

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989

the<00:02:50.260> Sith<00:02:50.500> master<00:02:50.709> ended<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.760> wasn't<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
the Sith master ended that wasn't the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.900 
the Sith master ended that wasn't the
person<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.900> wanted<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.380> be<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.310> how<00:02:54.459> did<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.700> end

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
person I wanted to be so how did I end

person I wanted to be so how did I end
up<00:02:55.030> there<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.350> will<00:02:56.560> take<00:02:56.830> some<00:02:57.100> time<00:02:57.130> for

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
up there it it will take some time for

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.690 
up there it it will take some time for
me<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.030> sort<00:02:58.239> through<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.690> think<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:03.519> know

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
me to sort through that I think you know

me to sort through that I think you know
I'd<00:03:04.000> forgotten<00:03:04.450> all<00:03:04.750> about<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:05.200> until<00:03:05.680> I

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
I'd forgotten all about that until I

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.460 
I'd forgotten all about that until I
spoke<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.280> about<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.670> on<00:03:06.760> Korriban

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
spoke to you about it on Korriban

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.170 
spoke to you about it on Korriban
strange<00:03:08.470> considering<00:03:09.070> my<00:03:09.370> hate<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:09.880> them<00:03:10.000> is

what<00:03:10.269> made<00:03:10.480> me<00:03:10.600> leave<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.870> Jedi<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:12.130> I

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
what made me leave the Jedi I think I

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.880 
what made me leave the Jedi I think I

before I can help anyone else maybe once
that<00:03:17.650> happens<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.489> work<00:03:18.640> with<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.940> Jedi<00:03:19.150> to

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
that happens I can work with the Jedi to

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.449 
that happens I can work with the Jedi to
make<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> difference<00:03:19.989> they<00:03:20.680> may<00:03:20.860> work<00:03:21.100> slowly

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
make a difference they may work slowly

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.970

more misery than the slavers ever did I
don't<00:03:31.900> know<00:03:31.989> why<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.260> didn't<00:03:32.769> see<00:03:33.070> that<00:03:33.100> before

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
don't know why I didn't see that before

at<00:03:35.980> once<00:03:36.190> like<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:36.579> wanted<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.630> would

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
at once like I wanted to but it would

maybe<00:03:40.900> that's<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.290> reason<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.709> change<00:03:41.940> maybe

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
maybe that's a reason to change maybe

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.420 
maybe that's a reason to change maybe
that's<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.359> reason<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.750> stay<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.859> guess<00:03:45.250> I'll

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
that's a reason to stay I I guess I'll

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.100 
that's a reason to stay I I guess I'll
see

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.620 

that's<00:03:52.110> very<00:03:52.860> tempting<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:53.730> I'm<00:03:54.210> not<00:03:54.420> ready

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
that's very tempting but I'm not ready

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.690 
that's very tempting but I'm not ready
to<00:03:54.810> leave<00:03:54.960> here<00:03:55.200> yet<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.040> don't<00:03:56.220> belong<00:03:56.460> on

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
to leave here yet and I don't belong on

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.670 
to leave here yet and I don't belong on
the<00:03:56.760> path<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.210> have<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.540> take<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:58.020> told<00:03:58.530> you

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
the path you have to take I told you

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.220 
the path you have to take I told you
that<00:03:58.800> on<00:03:58.950> Korriban<00:03:59.400> it's<00:04:00.030> still<00:04:00.420> true<00:04:00.720> but

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
that on Korriban it's still true but

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.230 
that on Korriban it's still true but
perhaps<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.740> could<00:04:01.890> come<00:04:02.040> back<00:04:02.280> afterwards<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
perhaps you could come back afterwards I

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.500 
perhaps you could come back afterwards I
could<00:04:03.840> certainly<00:04:04.110> use<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.560> friend<00:04:05.040> then<00:04:08.510> that's

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
could certainly use a friend then that's

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.960 
could certainly use a friend then that's
good<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.110> look<00:04:10.740> forward<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.250> time<00:04:11.670> perhaps

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
good I look forward to that time perhaps

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.729 
good I look forward to that time perhaps
we<00:04:12.270> can<00:04:12.390> travel<00:04:12.720> together<00:04:12.870> then<00:04:15.440> then<00:04:16.440> may<00:04:16.590> the

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
we can travel together then then may the

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.100 
we can travel together then then may the
force<00:04:17.010> be<00:04:17.070> with<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.550> my<00:04:17.700> friend<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.330> hope<00:04:18.959> we

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
force be with you my friend I hope we

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.800 
force be with you my friend I hope we
