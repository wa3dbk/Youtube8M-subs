which is the audience I need to know yes

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.659 
which is the audience I need to know yes
this<00:05:16.780> is<00:05:16.960> what<00:05:17.139> we<00:05:17.229> see<00:05:17.500> see<00:05:17.830> whatever<00:05:18.250> there's

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
this is what we see see whatever there's

this is what we see see whatever there's
a<00:05:18.729> big<00:05:18.969> glitch<00:05:19.240> in<00:05:19.509> multiplayer<00:05:19.659> and<00:05:20.379> like

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
a big glitch in multiplayer and like

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.490 
a big glitch in multiplayer and like
obviously<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:22.419> looks<00:05:22.449> really<00:05:22.780> freaky<00:05:23.319> and<00:05:24.210> and

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
obviously it looks really freaky and and

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
obviously it looks really freaky and and
actually<00:05:26.500> this<00:05:26.680> is<00:05:26.830> kind<00:05:26.979> of<00:05:27.069> helpful<00:05:27.280> because

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
actually this is kind of helpful because

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.350 
actually this is kind of helpful because
we<00:05:27.789> can<00:05:27.960> I'm<00:05:28.960> frozen<00:05:29.169> there<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.590> goes<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:30.360> we

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
we can I'm frozen there it goes and we

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.080 
we can I'm frozen there it goes and we
can<00:05:31.539> tell<00:05:31.719> where<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.289> we<00:05:33.130> can<00:05:33.250> document<00:05:33.370> where

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
can tell where the we can document where

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.110 
can tell where the we can document where
our<00:05:34.330> things<00:05:34.779> are<00:05:35.020> like<00:05:35.620> for<00:05:35.860> instance<00:05:36.120> if

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
our things are like for instance if

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.969 
our things are like for instance if
we're<00:05:37.449> building<00:05:37.779> a<00:05:37.840> tunnel<00:05:38.020> from<00:05:38.229> there<00:05:38.710> to

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
we're building a tunnel from there to

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.769 
we're building a tunnel from there to
there<00:05:39.159> we<00:05:39.610> might<00:05:39.789> want<00:05:39.969> to<00:05:40.029> use<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.449> cave

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
there we might want to use that cave

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.269 
there we might want to use that cave
right<00:05:41.050> down<00:05:41.259> that<00:05:41.409> which<00:05:41.620> is<00:05:41.650> just<00:05:41.979> under<00:05:42.250> the

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
right down that which is just under the

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:51.480 
right down that which is just under the
water<00:05:42.930> so<00:05:43.930> we<00:05:44.349> might<00:05:44.680> go<00:05:45.069> dig<00:05:48.810> 123456789<00:05:50.490> about

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
water so we might go dig 123456789 about

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.689 
water so we might go dig 123456789 about
about<00:05:52.060> 9<00:05:52.330> deep<00:05:52.629> and<00:05:52.900> then<00:05:53.529> start<00:05:53.949> moving<00:05:54.460> over

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
about 9 deep and then start moving over

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.399 
about 9 deep and then start moving over
so<00:05:55.690> yeah<00:05:56.650> that's<00:05:57.639> about<00:05:57.849> it<00:05:57.940> I'll<00:05:58.810> have<00:05:59.139> to<00:05:59.289> say

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
so yeah that's about it I'll have to say

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:06.230 
so yeah that's about it I'll have to say
about<00:05:59.500> these<00:05:59.710> glitches<00:06:02.370> they're<00:06:03.370> useful

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.960
