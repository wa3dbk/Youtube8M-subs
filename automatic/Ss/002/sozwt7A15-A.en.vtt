was<00:03:59.220> any<00:03:59.340> way<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.549> could<00:03:59.639> get<00:03:59.909> more<00:04:00.090> inserts

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
was any way I could get more inserts

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.240 
was any way I could get more inserts
since<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.079> smaller<00:04:01.440> lenses<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:01.980> stuff

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
since I have smaller lenses and stuff

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.149 
since I have smaller lenses and stuff
and<00:04:02.720> they<00:04:03.720> said<00:04:03.959> they<00:04:04.109> weren't<00:04:04.409> offering<00:04:05.010> them

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
and they said they weren't offering them

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.759 
and they said they weren't offering them
but<00:04:05.489> she<00:04:05.730> did<00:04:05.970> forwarded<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.720> her<00:04:06.959> director

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
but she did forwarded up to her director

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.190 
but she did forwarded up to her director
or<00:04:08.010> manager<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.819> don't<00:04:09.629> even<00:04:09.720> know<00:04:09.930> who<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.170> was

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
or manager I don't even know who it was

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.619 
or manager I don't even know who it was
but<00:04:10.530> um<00:04:10.739> he<00:04:11.519> said<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.819> was<00:04:11.939> a<00:04:11.970> really<00:04:12.150> good<00:04:12.329> idea

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
but um he said it was a really good idea

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.839 
but um he said it was a really good idea
so<00:04:12.689> they<00:04:12.930> might<00:04:13.139> start<00:04:13.260> doing<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.639> look

about this backpack is this insert
actually<00:04:38.160> comes<00:04:38.400> out<00:04:42.199> and<00:04:43.199> that<00:04:43.349> just<00:04:43.560> becomes

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
actually comes out and that just becomes

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.000

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.710 

now<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.430> poorly<00:04:59.700> back<00:05:00.000> in<00:05:00.210> they'll

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
actually be better for next

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.370

demonstration I'm gonna close this up
and<00:05:05.100> if<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.340> cut<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.580> out<00:05:05.910> you<00:05:06.480> use<00:05:07.230> this<00:05:07.380> as

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
and if you cut that out you use this as

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.200 
and if you cut that out you use this as
a<00:05:07.620> normal<00:05:07.770> backpack<00:05:08.100> suitcase<00:05:08.670> we<00:05:08.850> got<00:05:08.970> two

a normal backpack suitcase we got two
bags<00:05:09.450> in<00:05:09.630> one<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:10.170> there's<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.710> exterior

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
bags in one and there's a exterior

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.390 
bags in one and there's a exterior
pocket<00:05:12.090> that<00:05:12.300> didn't<00:05:12.630> go<00:05:12.720> over<00:05:13.250> which<00:05:14.250> is

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
pocket that didn't go over which is

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.990 
pocket that didn't go over which is
right<00:05:14.640> behind<00:05:14.820> the<00:05:15.090> first<00:05:15.300> one<00:05:16.160> right<00:05:17.160> here<00:05:17.370> so

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
right behind the first one right here so

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.250 
right behind the first one right here so
if<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.330> do<00:05:18.510> have<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:18.750> insert<00:05:19.230> out<00:05:20.090> open<00:05:21.090> this

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.770 

open<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:26.090> access<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:27.120> your<00:05:27.540> normal

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
open that and access to your normal

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.180 
open that and access to your normal
backpack<00:05:28.080> but<00:05:28.920> what<00:05:29.010> I<00:05:29.040> actually<00:05:29.280> do<00:05:29.760> is<00:05:30.120> I

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
backpack but what I actually do is I

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.130 
backpack but what I actually do is I
take<00:05:32.190> my<00:05:32.250> laptop<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:33.180> stick<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:34.020> in<00:05:34.140> here<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:36.510> I

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
take my laptop I stick it in here and I

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.750 
take my laptop I stick it in here and I
don't<00:05:37.200> think<00:05:37.470> it<00:05:37.620> was<00:05:37.740> designed<00:05:38.130> for<00:05:38.310> this<00:05:38.460> but

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
don't think it was designed for this but

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.790 
don't think it was designed for this but
I<00:05:39.000> was<00:05:39.420> hoping<00:05:39.660> I<00:05:39.780> could<00:05:39.810> do<00:05:40.050> it<00:05:40.170> when<00:05:40.290> I<00:05:40.320> was

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
I was hoping I could do it when I was

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.640 
I was hoping I could do it when I was
researching<00:05:40.980> this<00:05:41.490> could<00:05:42.330> just<00:05:42.540> stick<00:05:43.500> your

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
researching this could just stick your

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.770 
researching this could just stick your
laptop<00:05:44.040> in<00:05:44.220> there<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:45.210> you<00:05:45.270> have<00:05:45.420> an<00:05:45.540> extra

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
laptop in there and you have an extra

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.720 
laptop in there and you have an extra
space<00:05:45.960> for<00:05:46.020> them<00:05:46.470> and<00:05:46.830> it's<00:05:47.130> kind<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.430> hard<00:05:47.580> to

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
space for them and it's kind of hard to

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.730 
space for them and it's kind of hard to
close<00:05:47.910> because<00:05:48.690> it's<00:05:48.870> obviously<00:05:49.350> not<00:05:49.500> meant

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
close because it's obviously not meant

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.150 
close because it's obviously not meant
for<00:05:49.770> that<00:05:49.920> 15-inch<00:05:50.790> MacBook<00:05:50.880> Pro<00:05:51.480> so<00:05:52.170> if<00:05:52.860> you

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
for that 15-inch MacBook Pro so if you

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.340 
for that 15-inch MacBook Pro so if you
have<00:05:53.280> a<00:05:53.310> 13-inch<00:05:53.760> or<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:54.090> thinner<00:05:54.300> laptop<00:05:54.780> it'll

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
have a 13-inch or a thinner laptop it'll

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.810 
have a 13-inch or a thinner laptop it'll
be<00:05:55.440> easier<00:05:55.710> for<00:05:55.740> you<00:05:56.100> but<00:05:56.880> it<00:05:57.000> does<00:05:57.180> close<00:05:57.680> so

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
be easier for you but it does close so

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.090 
be easier for you but it does close so
you<00:05:59.820> got<00:05:59.970> your<00:06:00.120> laptop<00:06:00.240> in<00:06:00.630> there<00:06:00.980> it's<00:06:01.980> got

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
you got your laptop in there it's got

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.310 
you got your laptop in there it's got
all<00:06:02.220> your<00:06:02.400> camera<00:06:02.700> gear<00:06:02.730> in<00:06:03.000> here<00:06:03.240> nice<00:06:04.080> and

keen<00:06:58.150> sequence<00:06:58.660> photo<00:06:58.960> I<00:06:59.259> think<00:06:59.590> it<00:06:59.830> is<00:06:59.949> and

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
keen sequence photo I think it is and

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.070 
keen sequence photo I think it is and
that<00:07:00.639> one's<00:07:00.990> closer<00:07:01.990> to<00:07:02.289> 200<00:07:02.860> so<00:07:03.780> if<00:07:04.780> you<00:07:04.900> need

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
that one's closer to 200 so if you need

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.719 
that one's closer to 200 so if you need
more<00:07:05.229> space<00:07:05.410> or<00:07:05.830> if<00:07:05.919> you<00:07:05.979> need<00:07:06.160> more<00:07:06.280> features

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
more space or if you need more features

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.930

you might want to go to that one but for

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.080 
you might want to go to that one but for
now<00:07:10.060> I<00:07:10.090> think<00:07:10.240> this<00:07:10.509> is<00:07:10.720> a<00:07:11.550> pretty<00:07:12.550> satisfying
