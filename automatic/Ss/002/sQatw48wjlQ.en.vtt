00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
rice in the insta pot it's super simple

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.380 
rice in the insta pot it's super simple
if<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> don't<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.130> an<00:00:20.220> insta<00:00:20.520> pot<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.210> need

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
if you don't have an insta pot you need

if you don't have an insta pot you need
to<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.949> okay<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.279> steps<00:00:23.609> are<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
to get one okay so the steps are the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.370 
to get one okay so the steps are the
same<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.930> 4<00:00:25.619> cups<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.099> brown<00:00:26.369> rice<00:00:27.140> in<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
same it's 4 cups of brown rice in the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.900 
same it's 4 cups of brown rice in the
inste<00:00:28.680> pot<00:00:28.859> 5<00:00:29.189> cups<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.670> water<00:00:29.910> put<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.929> lid<00:00:31.140> on

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
inste pot 5 cups of water put the lid on

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.819 
inste pot 5 cups of water put the lid on
make<00:00:32.910> sure<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.270> pressure<00:00:34.020> regulator<00:00:34.440> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
make sure the pressure regulator is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.810 
make sure the pressure regulator is
turned<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.489> pressure<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.739> then<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.070> function

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
turned to pressure and then the function

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.299 
turned to pressure and then the function
you<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.090> hit<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> manual<00:00:40.050> mode<00:00:40.530> which<00:00:41.190> will

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
you just hit the manual mode which will

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
you just hit the manual mode which will
automatically<00:00:41.969> kick<00:00:42.180> into<00:00:42.420> high<00:00:42.719> pressure

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
automatically kick into high pressure

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.959 
automatically kick into high pressure
and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> adjust<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.730> time

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and then you're going to adjust the time

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.270 
and then you're going to adjust the time
down<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> 22<00:00:45.899> minutes<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.649> same<00:00:46.920> amount

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
down to 22 minutes it's the same amount

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
down to 22 minutes it's the same amount
of<00:00:47.370> cooking<00:00:47.730> time<00:00:47.910> whether<00:00:48.210> you're<00:00:48.420> making<00:00:48.600> 2

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
of cooking time whether you're making 2

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.250 
of cooking time whether you're making 2
cups<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.620> 4<00:00:50.129> cups<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.670> 6<00:00:50.940> cups<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.360> rice<00:00:51.539> and

cups or 4 cups or 6 cups of rice and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.520 
cups or 4 cups or 6 cups of rice and
then<00:00:53.190> once<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> 22<00:00:54.570> minutes<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.320> want

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
then once the 22 minutes are up you want

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.200 
then once the 22 minutes are up you want
to<00:00:55.620> turn<00:00:56.250> off<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.260> insta<00:00:58.260> pot<00:00:58.850> wait<00:00:59.850> 10

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
to turn off the insta pot wait 10

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
to turn off the insta pot wait 10
minutes<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.469> turn<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
minutes and then you can turn the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.700 
minutes and then you can turn the
pressure<00:01:02.190> regulator<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:03.090> steaming<00:01:03.840> allow<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
pressure regulator to steaming allow the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.980 
pressure regulator to steaming allow the
remaining<00:01:05.460> pressure<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> pot<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.750> come

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
remaining pressure in the pot to come

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
remaining pressure in the pot to come
out<00:01:07.170> totally<00:01:08.130> safe<00:01:08.400> don't<00:01:08.760> sweat<00:01:09.000> it
