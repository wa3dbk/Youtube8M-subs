colors<00:01:12.320> individually<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> draw<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
colors individually I like to draw a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
colors individually I like to draw a
little<00:01:14.250> feeling<00:01:14.640> faces<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> stickers<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
little feeling faces on the stickers it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.530 
little feeling faces on the stickers it
takes<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.619> time<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.130> way<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
takes a little more time that way but it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
takes a little more time that way but it
makes<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> game<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.710> feeling

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
makes the game a little more feeling

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.570 
makes the game a little more feeling
specific<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:22.049> would<00:01:22.770> roll<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
specific that way so you would roll the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
specific that way so you would roll the
dice<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.570> had<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> spinner<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.619> could

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
dice or if you had a spinner you could

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.249 
dice or if you had a spinner you could
spin<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.490> move<00:01:26.930> however<00:01:27.930> many

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
spin it and then move however many

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.899 
spin it and then move however many
number<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> spaces<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.100> needed<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> move<00:01:29.670> in

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
number of spaces you needed to move in

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
number of spaces you needed to move in
this<00:01:30.030> particular<00:01:30.570> game<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.079> rolled<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
this particular game if you rolled a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.780 
this particular game if you rolled a
three<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.040> land<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.549> little

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
three and you land it on this little

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
three and you land it on this little
green<00:01:32.909> face<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.079> code<00:01:34.320> says<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
green face here the code says that you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.590

here's<00:02:12.510> another<00:02:12.840> game<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.350> made<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:14.100> one

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
here's another game that I made this one

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.370 
here's another game that I made this one
is<00:02:16.370> goes<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.580> one<00:02:17.730> has<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.940> beginning<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.959> it

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
is goes this one has a beginning and it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.110 
is goes this one has a beginning and it
has<00:02:19.530> an<00:02:19.680> ending<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.160> you're<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:20.940> be<00:02:21.090> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
has an ending so you're going to be a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.600 
has an ending so you're going to be a
little<00:02:21.630> bit<00:02:22.020> more<00:02:22.290> limited<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.220> amount<00:02:23.340> of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
little bit more limited in the amount of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.660 
little bit more limited in the amount of
time<00:02:24.950> probably<00:02:25.950> wouldn't<00:02:26.220> take<00:02:26.310> as<00:02:26.459> much<00:02:26.610> time

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
time probably wouldn't take as much time

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.060 
time probably wouldn't take as much time
to<00:02:26.970> play<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> game<00:02:27.300> like<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.380> really<00:02:28.620> do

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
to play a game like this so I really do

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.980 
to play a game like this so I really do
