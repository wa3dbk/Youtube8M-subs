the last attack may be different but

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.090 
the last attack may be different but
chances<00:02:56.510> are<00:02:56.630> about<00:02:56.750> 1<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:57.320> 4<00:02:57.620> you're<00:02:57.890> never

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100

going<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.730> far<00:02:58.910> anyway<00:02:59.120> it's<00:03:00.130> really

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
going to get that far anyway it's really

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.760 
going to get that far anyway it's really
kind<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:02.090> waste<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.960> thought<00:03:03.590> they<00:03:03.740> could

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
kind of a waste I thought they could

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.470

have<00:03:04.010> done<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.580> much<00:03:04.730> more<00:03:04.970> with<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.180> if

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
have done so much more with it if

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.850 
have done so much more with it if
somebody<00:03:05.720> does<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.020> dragon<00:03:06.440> rush<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.740> e<00:03:06.770> you

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
that in one combo it's very hard to do

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.220 
that in one combo it's very hard to do
you<00:04:45.890> have<00:04:46.010> to<00:04:46.160> hold<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.610> certain<00:04:46.820> way<00:04:47.230> yeah

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
you have to hold it a certain way yeah

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.310 
you have to hold it a certain way yeah
that's<00:04:48.650> hardcore<00:04:49.540> too<00:04:50.540> hardcore<00:04:50.870> for<00:04:51.050> you

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
that's hardcore too hardcore for you

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
there are lots of characters in this

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.670 
there are lots of characters in this
game<00:04:54.230> I<00:04:54.440> think<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:54.950> lost<00:04:55.190> count<00:04:55.580> at<00:04:55.850> about

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
game I think I lost count at about

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.470 
game I think I lost count at about
48,000<00:04:57.680> but<00:04:58.669> seriously<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.120> think<00:04:59.180> there's

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
48,000 but seriously I think there's

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.570 
48,000 but seriously I think there's
maybe<00:04:59.630> about<00:04:59.900> 40<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.410> 50<00:05:00.650> of<00:05:00.950> them<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.220> anybody

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
maybe about 40 to 50 of them and anybody

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.220 
maybe about 40 to 50 of them and anybody
can<00:05:01.880> think<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.330> almost<00:05:02.780> as<00:05:02.990> in<00:05:03.200> this<00:05:03.380> game<00:05:05.230> well

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
can think of almost as in this game well

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.960 
can think of almost as in this game well
I<00:05:06.260> guess<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.620> should<00:05:06.830> hit<00:05:06.980> up<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.190> story<00:05:07.669> mode

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
I guess I should hit up the story mode

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.370 
I guess I should hit up the story mode
at<00:05:08.090> least<00:05:08.240> a<00:05:08.330> little<00:05:08.510> bit<00:05:08.720> considering<00:05:09.110> it's

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
at least a little bit considering it's

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.150 
at least a little bit considering it's
like<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.740> main<00:05:10.070> part<00:05:10.550> of<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.790> entire<00:05:11.180> game

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
like the main part of the entire game

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.210 
like the main part of the entire game
