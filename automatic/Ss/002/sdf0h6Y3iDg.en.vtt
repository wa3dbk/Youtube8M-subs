how<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> jailbreak<00:01:04.199> works<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:05.369> every

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
how the jailbreak works is for every

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.510 
how the jailbreak works is for every
specific<00:01:06.470> device<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.159> will<00:01:08.280> make<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
specific device you do it will make a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.250 
specific device you do it will make a
separate<00:01:08.880> version<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.570> booty<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.140> is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
separate version of I booty and this is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
separate version of I booty and this is
because<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:11.010> taking<00:01:11.369> files<00:01:11.640> from<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
because it's taking files from the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.230 
because it's taking files from the
firmware<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.750> running<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.740> um<00:01:14.119> running<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
firmware and running them um running the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.660 
firmware and running them um running the
commands<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> computers<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.830> it's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
commands on the computers and it's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.030 
commands on the computers and it's
basically<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.090> user<00:01:18.509> interface<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.710> older

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
basically a user interface for the older

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.370 
basically a user interface for the older
pwnage<00:01:20.460> tool<00:01:20.490> style<00:01:21.000> thing<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:22.110> very

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
pwnage tool style thing and it's very

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.289 
pwnage tool style thing and it's very
nice<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.250> happens<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.880> once<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> run

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
nice and what happens is once you run

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
nice and what happens is once you run
snowbreeze<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.439> show<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.100> your
