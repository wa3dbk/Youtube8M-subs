I blamed myself on the German video of
Archie<00:00:30.010> jumping<00:00:30.430> so<00:00:31.420> if<00:00:31.870> I<00:00:31.960> did<00:00:32.140> it<00:00:32.230> again<00:00:32.820> I'm

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
Archie jumping so if I did it again I'm

idiot and this little concept so I try
the<00:00:40.150> first<00:00:40.510> dive<00:00:42.750> maybe<00:00:43.750> it's<00:00:44.320> better<00:00:44.590> maybe

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
the first dive maybe it's better maybe

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.320

it's<00:00:45.850> worse

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
it's worse

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.150 
it's worse

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
highest score 91 so send us answer this

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.390 
highest score 91 so send us answer this
video<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.930> video<00:03:56.349> but<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.010> beat<00:03:57.220> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
video of you video but you beat the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.420 
video of you video but you beat the
score<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.849> 91<00:03:58.420> points<00:03:58.959> but<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.799> absolutely

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
score of 91 points but is absolutely

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.160 
score of 91 points but is absolutely
possible<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.180> not<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.510> greatest<00:04:01.780> score

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
possible that is not the greatest score

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.940 
possible that is not the greatest score
ever

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
ever

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.559 
ever
and<00:04:03.129> if<00:04:03.579> you're<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.730> little<00:04:03.819> bit<00:04:04.030> lucky<00:04:04.209> with

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
and if you're a little bit lucky with

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.520 
and if you're a little bit lucky with
her<00:04:04.769> when<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:07.060> really<00:04:07.540> easy<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.019> beat<00:04:08.319> that

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
her when it's really easy to beat that

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.539 
her when it's really easy to beat that
score<00:04:08.819> so<00:04:09.819> if<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.269> witness<00:04:10.569> contest<00:04:11.370> we<00:04:12.370> can

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
score so if you witness contest we can

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.000 
score so if you witness contest we can
discuss<00:04:12.910> what<00:04:13.269> sir<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.930> have<00:04:14.230> won<00:04:14.470> maybe<00:04:14.739> you

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
discuss what sir you have won maybe you

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.520 
discuss what sir you have won maybe you
can<00:04:15.250> decide<00:04:15.730> what's<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.329> next<00:04:16.630> event<00:04:17.340> and

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
can decide what's the next event and

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.200 
can decide what's the next event and
doesn't<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:21.489> haven't

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
doesn't it haven't

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.360 
doesn't it haven't
an<00:04:23.750> event<00:04:24.169> like<00:04:24.380> summer<00:04:24.889> games<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.190> winter

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
an event like summer games of winter

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.129 
an event like summer games of winter
games<00:04:25.550> or<00:04:25.669> something<00:04:25.850> maybe<00:04:26.600> it's<00:04:26.930> just

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
games or something maybe it's just

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.320 
games or something maybe it's just
interesting<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.160> first<00:04:28.400> racetrack<00:04:29.000> form

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
interesting of the first racetrack form

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.730 
interesting of the first racetrack form
from<00:04:29.720> Mario<00:04:30.050> Kart<00:04:30.080> six<00:04:30.710> year<00:04:31.810> 64<00:04:32.810> or<00:04:33.169> something

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
from Mario Kart six year 64 or something

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.040 
from Mario Kart six year 64 or something
else<00:04:33.919> it's<00:04:34.310> all<00:04:34.520> possible<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.840> is<00:04:36.020> a

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
else it's all possible this is a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.610 
else it's all possible this is a
community<00:04:36.500> day<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.729> community<00:04:38.210> decides

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
community day and the community decides

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.390 
community day and the community decides
what's<00:04:39.620> happened<00:04:39.949> next

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
what's happened next

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.930 
what's happened next
so<00:04:41.000> just<00:04:41.389> beat<00:04:41.600> 91<00:04:42.680> there's<00:04:43.100> waha<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.520> score<00:04:43.910> of

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
so just beat 91 there's waha a score of

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.939 
so just beat 91 there's waha a score of
cliff-diving<00:04:44.449> and<00:04:44.870> believe<00:04:45.380> me<00:04:45.530> it<00:04:45.740> is

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
cliff-diving and believe me it is

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.340 
cliff-diving and believe me it is
possible<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.699> is<00:04:46.729> more<00:04:47.360> than<00:04:47.539> possible<00:04:47.810> of

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
possible it is more than possible of

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.390 
possible it is more than possible of
course<00:04:48.490> no<00:04:49.490> sheets<00:04:50.030> no<00:04:50.389> slowdowns<00:04:50.960> no<00:04:51.770> safe

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
course no sheets no slowdowns no safe

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.750 
course no sheets no slowdowns no safe
states<00:04:52.759> just<00:04:53.720> do<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:54.080> like<00:04:54.410> me<00:04:54.710> on<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.520> same

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
states just do it like me on the same

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.510 
states just do it like me on the same
game<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.690> play<00:04:57.229> it<00:04:57.289> may<00:04:57.830> be<00:04:57.889> just<00:04:58.220> like<00:04:58.370> an

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
game and play it may be just like an

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.290 
game and play it may be just like an
idiot<00:04:59.169> and<00:05:00.169> we'll<00:05:01.010> be<00:05:01.130> all<00:05:01.280> happy<00:05:01.460> maybe<00:05:02.090> this

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
idiot and we'll be all happy maybe this

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.500 
idiot and we'll be all happy maybe this
is<00:05:02.419> really<00:05:02.630> interesting<00:05:03.169> concept<00:05:03.380> for<00:05:03.770> you

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
is really interesting concept for you

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.510 
is really interesting concept for you
maybe<00:05:05.510> it's<00:05:05.810> possible<00:05:06.050> if<00:05:06.440> someone<00:05:06.979> beat<00:05:07.250> that

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
maybe it's possible if someone beat that

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.659 
maybe it's possible if someone beat that
score<00:05:07.699> but<00:05:08.120> it's<00:05:08.270> absolutely<00:05:08.840> possible<00:05:09.669> we

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
score but it's absolutely possible we

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.969 
score but it's absolutely possible we
try<00:05:10.699> to<00:05:10.970> be<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.360> next<00:05:11.389> score<00:05:11.840> maybe<00:05:12.380> we<00:05:12.770> set

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
try to be the next score maybe we set

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.370 
try to be the next score maybe we set
some<00:05:13.160> records<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:14.300> community<00:05:14.780> I<00:05:14.990> think

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
some records and the community I think

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.969 
some records and the community I think
it's<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.830> lot<00:05:16.479> whereas<00:05:17.479> I'm<00:05:17.599> not<00:05:17.780> possible<00:05:18.680> and

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
it's a lot whereas I'm not possible and

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.310 
it's a lot whereas I'm not possible and
a<00:05:19.430> lot<00:05:19.880> really<00:05:20.090> interesting<00:05:20.690> on<00:05:20.810> this<00:05:20.930> concept

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
a lot really interesting on this concept

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.950 
a lot really interesting on this concept
so<00:05:21.949> maybe<00:05:22.160> you're<00:05:22.970> just<00:05:23.120> interested<00:05:23.449> in<00:05:23.750> that
