00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 so as promised I find you in 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.440
 this video to introduce you to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.690
 a few purchases that I could make 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.910
 during during my races of which 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.910
 I made the crossroads specials and goes up 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.210
 in fact I have been to see a little in the 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.539
 organic rays is also in the region 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 ray t and iced and so on and I 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.320
 wanted so I found what I 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.000
 wanted so I took this so 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.000
 arizona 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.760
 it's green tea tea with 2 honey 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 so I'll see what it gives me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 will taste I do not know at all I have 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 ever tasted so I will see what 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.309
 that it looks like it looks 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.649
 super good we'll see if it's mito 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.690
 or not and in the same style just to 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 side there were debates are like 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.829
 these one so that strangely looks like 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.980
 Arizona Arizona I had to pay them 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.440
 the cans 3 euros and that's a 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.070
 one liter bottle and it costs one euro 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.530
 84 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 so there were three different kinds 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.480
 I took the three kinds for one euro 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.910
 I told myself it's not serious we try 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.570
 I had already seen that on a video I know 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.330
 more than that but I think it was 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 mallet trick girly something like that 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.950
 I do not know if you're going through 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.780
 infrabel I think it's you then you 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.939
 are white infuse so that woerth and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.140
 cherry and lotus flowers so this one 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.610
 the more bottles they make 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770
 strangely thinking about getting to the standards 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.500
 clearly and it's a bottle of a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.049
 liter so to the giant quickly and so here's 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.240
 that's the first then the second 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.259
 it's green tea so lemon flavor 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.259
 green and mint 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.340
 so that's very cool I think it can 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.570
 to pass super good and if you're less sure 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.549
 this is the one black tea infuse 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.119
 peach flavors and that's it 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.130
 the money i ginseng sorry here's so 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.310
 very pretty bottles I think that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.470
 I will keep I find them beautiful 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.899
 armband pour I 'll talk to you again 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.219
 in in finished products I think 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.240
 that I was including is really because 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.950
 that kind of things that can be 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.799
 nice to know because it's good because 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.360
 that it's not good and in the same style 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.549
 I found it actually when I 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.399
 saw the name daiquiri strawberries 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.899
 So here it is playful tons it's 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.209
 a 10 units and that's 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 iced tea similar to fresh daiquiri 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.920
 so its open jelly turns out to be fair 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.720
 between years I read that it's a good thing 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680
 smell the red berries end frankly 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.620
 it's nice to see 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.670
 there they were not fresh so I think 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.590
 that it's better fresh so 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.010
 frankly it's a drink I can not wait 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.890
 to test and I found that so that I 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.470
 been to a destocking store and I 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.540
 found that so it's pag at these 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.579
 gossip and its watermelons and mint and at 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.590
 I think it can not be too bad 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.109
 I will test I have always wanted to test 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.639
 this brand of fruit juice and I had 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.519
 I tested not know why but I 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.680
 test so this is the opportunity 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.099
 then always drink I have 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.629
 wanted I have a craze then with the 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.670
 mint just now and also with the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.290
 purple game I had cravings for 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.420
 purple and suddenly I bought the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.829
 purple syrup it's super good I 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.349
 do not know if you know and I have 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.239
 really hard to find some 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.310
 in stores apart from crossroad 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.540
 where I saw it otherwise I do not see 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.489
 often and so there these syrups of my 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.900
 mona I do not know it's a small 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.340
 bottle it's a bottle of 33 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.230
 centiliters so it's not huge 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.790
 I would be more telling you the price 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.730
 it was 2 euros and kate 22 euros so 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.319
 Here jeans at it again and this year 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.790
 find bearings to the violet I 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.699
 do not know if it's really ugly really 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.569
 good but I seem I do not find any 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.609
 purple candy 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.590
 so if you have but because 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.720
 the appearance in the era of candy like that 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 he's really good in the shape of a violet 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.810
 I do not say tell me if you know where 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.810
 can we find that 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.860
 about day I found it was starting to 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.160
 when I was little 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.160
 so it's honey to announce 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.300
 honey candy and I love it man 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.910
 wedging I want to hold back in 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.770
 the sweets before know I do not know 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.260
 it's weird is actually in the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.180
 organic rays so I wanted since a 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.600
 little moment I saw that in the video 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.450
 of caroline and her fiat resulted in 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.430
 ibiza in their blog lisa and I had seen 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.650
 it had thousands of wafers 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.990
 chocolate napkin rice and I 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.610
 did not find and there I came across 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.169
 packages like that you know us and at 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.610
 the help of rude napeo milk chocolate 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:34.500
 and dark chocolate chocolate and our 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.500
 cocoon rap and so this is already open 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.520
 like this here 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.570
 and frankly it's great 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.090
 good by cons that there is not much 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.980
 in a package I've already emptied half 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.169
 of the package does not have much but 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.970
 frankly if we pay attention that 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.530
 it's really a good alternative 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.830
 goes on how to eat him the patties of 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.280
 ribes 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.450
 the evidence the evidence here I have 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.060
 rice cakes in my room I 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.190
 nibble that when I'm a little hungry and 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.930
 this is not the best 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.190
 but there with chocolate it's really 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.500
 super good you have the impression of 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.040
 to eat nuggets with tits stuff 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.430
 in the genre so it's super good ok I 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.470
 found myself d 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.940
 the cranberries that's because I 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.050
 I like a lot Thursday eaten fruits 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.310
 dry and I found that I do not find I 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.389
 not find in my usual store where 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.710
 I will do my shopping and there as 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.509
 I was at crossroads I looked at a 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.979
 little what they had and so the 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.180
 cranberries will taste if they are too 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.229
 good than what I did eat 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.830
 in your crio of fruit mix there and 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.960
 then I wanted to take it 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.180
 had specials actually made of 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.879
 you have seen the promos on its 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.460
 gerbil cakes is so a had two 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.099
 bought 1 free 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.659
 So I took all have blanched at the 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.479
 dates because I really like them 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:57.090
 dates and a lot mine that so 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.710
 it's guys both are pretty soft 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.370
 without too much sugar a little organic and will 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.680
 so I say I test and then I have 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.789
 taken two so it's actually honey and 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.440
 date was not part of the offer 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.210
 so laurent inevitably I want to 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.949
 test title and price of milk and 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.780
 chocolate 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:17.800
 it can be very well big packages 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.710
 the cost one euro and 30.1 euro 30 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.690
 I tasted it is the one with sesame and 20 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.060
 can you tell it's super good it's not 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.289
 very sweet stuff but frankly 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.569
 I think I like cakes 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.009
 dry so it does not bother me if has no 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.569
 chocolate does not matter my meaning 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.729
 really the shot of sesame is 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.690
 really very very good so I you 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.099
 recommend if you want little ones 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.099
 cakes to nibble like that and not 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:41.440
 necessarily princes and super stuff 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:42.669
 beefy in calories do not hesitate to you 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.029
 take on that I think it's not 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.409
 wrong and a ray just as found 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:49.620
 it's agave syrup so cost a 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:52.240
 euro the wheelbarrows 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.180
 that's cheap because I send 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.740
 syrup is super expensive and chinon and 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.319
 there I found bio at crossroads 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.860
 at 1 euros and some for 250 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.449
 milliliters 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.580
 so as I told you I am 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.990
 first fish with that all that 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.440
 was chocolate etc 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.770
 I am created with that so here I am 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.150
 wanted everything shown at crossroads so 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.719
 do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.789
 think 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:17.080
 if you too are eating that kind of 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:18.880
