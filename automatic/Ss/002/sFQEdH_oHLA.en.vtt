00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Welcome to the first part 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.240
 our five-part comparison series 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.440
 between the htc evo 9 samsung 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.030
 galaxy s 6 or s6 edge and the iphone 63 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.980
 great phones and we want 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.089
 find out together where his 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 strengthen and weaken 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:24.449
 So let's start with one of the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.279
 main features of a smartphone 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.840
 on and that the display 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.730
 the most obvious difference is 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.920
 of course the larger screens with 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.850
 4.7 inches, the iphone has the smallest 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 that is to 96 in the team with 5 inch or 51 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.940
 close to each other 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.800
 at the pixeldichte are the top three 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.160
 smartphones really far apart 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.559
 with 326 pixels per inch, it has iphone on 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.020
 few picture points to offer the htc 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.230
 evo 9 maintained with a full hd display 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.230
 on a pixel density of 441 pixels per 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 inch the pixel bird shoots the galaxy 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.030
 s 6 r 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 it has a resolution of 2560 x 1440 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 and a terrific pixel density of 577 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.880
 Of course, ppi pixels are not 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.040
 everything that makes a good display 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.890
 black worth knows will be an appealing 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.509
 color reproduction crisp contrasts and 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.710
 a good brightness for example 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.320
 not be neglected 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.360
 The iphone offers a clear and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.710
 balanced picture must be in spite of the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.290
 relatively low resolution 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060
 really do not hide the htc one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.369
 proves again is a higher resolution 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 as a politically very nice to have 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.100
 But it is not necessary, the display is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.840
 sharp and simply beautiful to look at 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.780
 but now to our pixel monster with 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.759
 the 5 1 inch super amoled display 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.170
 in my eyes that it provides six 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.960
 thanks in part to the coach 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.610
 resolution a spectacular display too 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.659
 I like the contrasts and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.460
 intense colors 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.020
 you can the screen mode synonymous but synonymous 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.390
 if one does not like that 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 We like Bavaria 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.899
 still tested how good the displays are 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.310
 on full brightness at direct 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.079
 solar radiation can still detect 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.090
 what about the summer but pretty 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.920
 important is clear winner is that it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.229
 six being the weakest in the new one 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.460
 cuts 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.410
 before we come to this conclusion 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.210
 For the sake of completeness, I would like to come 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.830
 I personally address a cause 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.270
 I find incredibly important but consider 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.000
 well, it was us 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.070
 view no worries all three phones 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.500
 are sufficiently stable almost 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.080
 You asked that one more question 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.210
 thing last year, the galaxy s 5 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.040
 a glove mode so you could 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.210
 set the phone so that and 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.740
 Resident Evil was shared with 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.420
 gloves can operate this mode 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.580
 There are no more six 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.350
 there the htc ghonim is new in this 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.730
 mode now you can do it with 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.650
 gloves use the iphone has 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.290
 This mode has never been the money for sex 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.580
 responsive display which is relatively simple 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.950
 Can be operated with some gloves 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.900
 but not with all it's a third 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.940
 there and plus point is today in the topic 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.350
 new display yet but come now to 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.300
 that's going to be pretty good for me 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.070
 clearly out and say that really 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.040
 we have two really good ones here 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.360
 displays and a great and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.150
 that of course the pixel some of 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.890
 galaxy s 6 likes to write yours today 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.330
 impressions in the comments are 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.620
 of course burning and then maybe 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.690
 still a small outlook in the 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.459
 in the future the four more videos here 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.840
 series will be a battery comparison 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.580
 a speaker comparing a camera 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.290
 comparison and then finally one 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.330
 purchase advice of the attempt to clarify 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.120
 which cellphone exactly for you that 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.470
 right is okay the second part 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.630
 you fly here and the difference 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.310
 from galaxy s6 and s6 s6 linked 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.290
 here are also the display and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.320
 China one briefly addressed 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.480
 Well then finally on 19 06 in 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.980
 be hamburg and be a workshop 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.750
 lead on the topic of earning money in 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.850
 internet what happens there when i see you 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.220
 the link in the description box and me 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.530
 I look forward to your comments on this 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.680
 display comparison that's saying good 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.680
 People
