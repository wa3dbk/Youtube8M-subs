week's episode is about shuffling that's

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.170 
week's episode is about shuffling that's
short<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.109> short<00:00:16.529> hop<00:00:16.710> fastball<00:00:17.430> l<00:00:17.670> cancel

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
short for short hop fastball l cancel

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.540 
short for short hop fastball l cancel
which<00:00:18.960> makes<00:00:19.199> recovery<00:00:19.619> animation<00:00:20.130> shorter

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
which makes recovery animation shorter

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.300 
which makes recovery animation shorter
and<00:00:20.850> allows<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.390> combo<00:00:22.039> basically<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.130> makes

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and allows for combo basically it makes

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.029 
and allows for combo basically it makes
whatever<00:00:23.519> character<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.119> using<00:00:24.600> faster<00:00:25.050> now

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
whatever character you using faster now

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.980 
whatever character you using faster now
let's<00:00:26.220> get<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> first<00:00:26.820> part<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.570> jumping

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
let's get to the first part the jumping

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
let's get to the first part the jumping
there<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:28.890> two<00:00:29.010> levels<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.460> jump<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
there are two levels of jump in the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
there are two levels of jump in the
smash<00:00:30.090> Britta<00:00:30.390> series<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.619> full<00:00:31.859> hop<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
smash Britta series the full hop and the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
smash Britta series the full hop and the
short<00:00:32.669> hop<00:00:33.140> when<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.200> press<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> jump<00:00:34.739> button

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
short hop when you press the jump button

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.500 
short hop when you press the jump button
your<00:00:35.160> character<00:00:35.520> crouches<00:00:35.969> getting<00:00:36.300> ready

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
your character crouches getting ready

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.900 
your character crouches getting ready
for<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> jump<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:38.070> hold<00:00:38.219> jump<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.760> all

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
for the jump if you hold jump for all

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.690 
for the jump if you hold jump for all
the<00:00:39.120> crouch<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:40.200> called<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> full<00:00:40.770> hop<00:00:40.950> if

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the crouch that's called the full hop if

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
the crouch that's called the full hop if
you<00:00:41.820> let<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> before<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.530> short

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
you let go before that and they short

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.889 
you let go before that and they short
hop<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.340> may<00:00:44.820> seem<00:00:45.030> come<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.450> short<00:00:45.660> hop<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
hop it may seem come to short hop it

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
hop it may seem come to short hop it
first<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> basically<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.460> hit

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
first because you basically need to hit

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.700 
first because you basically need to hit
jump<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.030> fast<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.930> keep<00:00:49.079> crash<00:00:49.320> soon

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
jump really fast just keep crash soon

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
jump really fast just keep crash soon
because<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> definitely<00:00:50.489> pays<00:00:51.030> off<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
because it definitely pays off in the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.010 
because it definitely pays off in the
end<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:53.219> fastball<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.510> hit<00:00:54.780> down

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
end to fastball all you do is hit down

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.520 
end to fastball all you do is hit down
right<00:00:55.500> after<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.890> peak<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> jump<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
right after the peak of the jump and

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
right after the peak of the jump and
that's<00:00:58.530> about<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.030> now<00:01:00.030> L<00:01:00.270> canceling<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:01.289> an

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that's about it now L canceling when an

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
that's about it now L canceling when an
air<00:01:01.559> move<00:01:01.770> touches<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> ground<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
air move touches the ground the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.179 
air move touches the ground the
character<00:01:03.390> goes<00:01:03.570> into<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> recovery<00:01:04.350> animation

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
character goes into a recovery animation

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.780 
character goes into a recovery animation
and<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> hit<00:01:06.150> L<00:01:06.390> R<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:07.260> Z<00:01:07.619> right<00:01:08.280> before<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and if you hit L R or Z right before the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.990 
and if you hit L R or Z right before the
ground<00:01:09.060> then<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.689> shortens<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.229> animation

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
ground then it shortens that animation

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.730 
ground then it shortens that animation
this<00:01:12.000> makes<00:01:12.270> chasing<00:01:12.780> your<00:01:12.900> opponent<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> lot

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
this makes chasing your opponent a lot

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.630 
this makes chasing your opponent a lot
easier<00:01:13.950> now<00:01:14.570> about<00:01:15.570> di<00:01:16.009> di<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> short<00:01:17.549> for

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
easier now about di di is short for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.210 
easier now about di di is short for
directional<00:01:18.299> influence<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.560> influences

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
directional influence this influences

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
directional influence this influences
your<00:01:20.369> character<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.850> momentum<00:01:21.330> through<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
your character is momentum through the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.859 
your character is momentum through the
air<00:01:21.900> after<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> character<00:01:23.189> has<00:01:23.310> been<00:01:23.490> hit

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
air after the character has been hit

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.469 
air after the character has been hit
this<00:01:24.869> takes<00:01:25.110> practice<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.939> direction<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this takes practice to the direction you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
this takes practice to the direction you
want<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.810> has<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.409> inputted<00:01:28.890> right<00:01:29.189> when

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
want to go has to be inputted right when

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
want to go has to be inputted right when
the<00:01:29.490> character<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> take<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> best<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the character is it take the best of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
the character is it take the best of
that<00:01:31.320> look<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.670> suck<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> DI<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:34.049> shut<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.619> my
