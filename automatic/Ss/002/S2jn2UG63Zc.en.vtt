00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:24.560
 will have to run through different barriers and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.560
 In general, then make your way to yourself song

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 escape this fucking parts 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.600
 closed as a complex and get out 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.790

 offices let's see oh well 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 let's start 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.149
 There was a life of cardboard you need to fill 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.679
 output like this module and the module more precisely 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 Branch wounds and so can be said as 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.519
 steel protocol soda need to choose 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.079
 get out and that is no need to think for 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.769
 and god kill 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.550
 let's avoid the period first and then right 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.700
 immediately started 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:16.990
 skype click and run immediately onions 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.640

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.140
 on all the same kind of about my names 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.320
 For some reason, when recording starts to blunt 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.820
 Ospanov on this second block it was 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.010
 Basically easy shoes 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.150
 it's already so heavy left for the door 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.060
 then turn 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.190
 those doors again then left then 1 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.190
 straight to the virgin at the beginning 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.340
 left 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.720
 not everyone comes here anymore 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.290

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.400
 match with Spartak is faster not about on 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:11.070
 this is the wrong way 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:13.980
 module b stand and give module b november 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.610

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.110
 beautiful module please pass and 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.650
 because it adds me time which I 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:30.720
 managed to come to close this parable about 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:36.750

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.350

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.680
 turn left to the end and then not not 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.220

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:55.619
