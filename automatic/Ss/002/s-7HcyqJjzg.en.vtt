I have taken the Christmas decorations over here altogether to screen,

00:00:03.846 --> 00:00:05.846
and do you want to lighten the candle 
 same like here to the screen ?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.700
Lady - yes

00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:09.951
It will be good for childrens in the house and are not afraid

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:13.015

and then,if you want to turn it off...just blow

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Another advantage is transfering the ornaments ,It done by opening here

 to transfer,all this to pot under here

So that you can get whole decorations back here

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:46.446

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:54.637

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:28.315

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:42.260

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:48.460
and now if we go for shopping

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.550
it will hard for you to remember all these list 

00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:52.860
and you don't want to carry the whole ipad

00:01:52.898 --> 00:01:54.900
to remember all these lists

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.970
Just slope the list you want from here

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.250
like this

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.350
and easy to carry

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:03.770
even you can put it back by just placing

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:05.780
and it will be automatically uploaded.

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:10.930
How does the paper comes out ?

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.000
It's was too speedy..right

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:14.300

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:14.750
Man - Yeah !!

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:14.800
It was the performance of software and very fast.

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:18.800
For example, I can keep any digital images knows easily

00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.060
the one I want in the photos was with my parents because it is

00:02:22.972 --> 00:02:24.970
have only lived in the digital out-and usually

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.410
select it by pulling out for

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:29.870
direct print

00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:33.880
which will be hard copy with us

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:37.130
so now we have hard copy

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:39.410
place it here and it will be

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:40.770

00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:42.510
and we can give hard copy to parents

00:02:43.777 --> 00:02:45.780
This is my favorite photo

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.090
that the place where I spent every year on Christmas

00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:51.430
Lady - where is it ?

00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:52.490
Branca back between the 2 mountains and also quite a lot of clouds

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:55.070
and can melt the snow path

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360
by moving this cloud from here

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360
by taking this cloud from here

00:02:57.754 --> 00:02:59.750
now..it comes to outside..and lets

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.550
see the sunshine and it's melting now..landscape here is very different

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:04.670
We can even change the position of the Sun

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:07.970
to various positions to make it evening

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.400
Isn't it romantic ?

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:11.870
Lady - What happens if the sun does not comes in 
 that place like goes with narrow area of earth ?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.560
simultaneously only one side or directly in the back with action

00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:19.090
and remember it will be automatically goes to

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:21.280
dark and believe it will be global warming and 
 when it get stop especially in winter.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.670

00:03:29.223 --> 00:03:31.220

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:33.690
