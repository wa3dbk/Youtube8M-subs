00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.950 
this video in any way i spit up the
middle<00:00:32.150> part<00:00:32.390> where<00:00:32.599> I'm<00:00:32.690> killing<00:00:32.930> myself

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
middle part where I'm killing myself

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.350 
middle part where I'm killing myself
because<00:00:33.500> it's<00:00:33.650> very<00:00:33.770> tedious<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.520> boring<00:00:34.670> so

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
because it's very tedious and boring so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.730 
because it's very tedious and boring so
we<00:00:35.480> can<00:00:35.600> get<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.810> action<00:00:36.140> much<00:00:36.290> faster

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
we can get to the action much faster

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.220 
we can get to the action much faster
thank<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:37.600> so<00:00:38.600> there's<00:00:38.870> been<00:00:39.020> a<00:00:39.080> lot<00:00:39.200> of

controversy<00:00:39.890> over<00:00:39.920> whether<00:00:40.100> or<00:00:40.340> not<00:00:40.460> and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
controversy over whether or not and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.860 
controversy over whether or not and
Orion<00:00:41.060> actually<00:00:41.270> did<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:43.060> so<00:00:44.060> here<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:44.570> am<00:00:44.630> in

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
Orion actually did and so here I am in

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.110 
Orion actually did and so here I am in
the<00:00:45.110> room<00:00:45.320> right<00:00:46.100> before<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.520> confrontation

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120

the room right before the confrontation
with<00:00:47.239> him<00:00:47.390> I<00:00:47.570> haven't<00:00:48.230> fought<00:00:48.350> with<00:00:48.530> him<00:00:48.650> yet<00:00:48.830> I

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.750 
with him I haven't fought with him yet I
haven't<00:00:49.070> done<00:00:49.250> anything<00:00:49.430> with<00:00:49.610> anybody

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
haven't done anything with anybody

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.160 
haven't done anything with anybody
chambers<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.360> can<00:00:50.480> see<00:00:50.629> he's<00:00:50.780> right<00:00:50.930> there

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
chambers you can see he's right there

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.380 
chambers you can see he's right there
he's<00:00:51.350> still<00:00:51.559> alive<00:00:51.650> at<00:00:51.950> this<00:00:52.010> point<00:00:52.300> so<00:00:53.300> I'm

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
he's still alive at this point so I'm

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.350 
he's still alive at this point so I'm
going<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.780> kill<00:00:54.140> myself<00:00:54.170> right<00:00:54.790> now<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.120> see

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
going to kill myself right now and see

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:27.270 
going to kill myself right now and see
what<00:00:56.450> happens

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.730 

so<00:01:27.970> I'm<00:01:28.180> dying<00:01:28.479> and

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.859 

resurrected<00:01:33.909> all<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.119> way<00:01:35.179> back<00:01:35.359> down<00:01:35.420> here

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
resurrected all the way back down here

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.999 
resurrected all the way back down here
just<00:01:36.109> feet<00:01:36.590> from<00:01:37.090> where<00:01:38.350> Ryan<00:01:39.350> eventually

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
just feet from where Ryan eventually

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.330 
just feet from where Ryan eventually
dies<00:01:41.049> and<00:01:42.049> as<00:01:42.439> you<00:01:42.500> can<00:01:42.619> see<00:01:42.649> I've<00:01:42.920> come<00:01:42.950> back

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
dies and as you can see I've come back

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.649 
dies and as you can see I've come back
to<00:01:43.399> life<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:45.310> it's<00:01:46.310> clear<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.119> say<00:01:47.359> that<00:01:47.539> even

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
to life so it's clear to say that even

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.949 
to life so it's clear to say that even
though<00:01:47.869> he<00:01:48.020> deactivated<00:01:48.200> at<00:01:48.679> one<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:48.950> can<00:01:49.369> use

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
though he deactivated at one you can use

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.010 
though he deactivated at one you can use
one<00:01:50.959> in<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.289> same<00:01:51.439> proximity<00:01:51.709> as<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.729> one

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
one in the same proximity as that one

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.330 
one in the same proximity as that one
because<00:01:54.020> I've<00:01:54.289> just<00:01:54.500> done<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.890> very<00:01:54.920> thing

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
because I've just done that very thing

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.190 
because I've just done that very thing
hopefully<00:01:56.149> this<00:01:56.329> ends<00:01:57.289> a<00:01:57.380> lot<00:01:57.649> of<00:01:57.829> questions

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
hopefully this ends a lot of questions

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.749 
hopefully this ends a lot of questions
so<00:02:00.200> after<00:02:00.409> saying<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.979> I'm<00:02:01.189> not<00:02:01.310> saying<00:02:01.670> that

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
so after saying that I'm not saying that

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.179 
so after saying that I'm not saying that
he's<00:02:02.090> going<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.630> be<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.319> second<00:02:03.679> one<00:02:03.770> has<00:02:04.009> to

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
he's going to be the second one has to

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.469 
he's going to be the second one has to
be<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.459> merely<00:02:04.700> saying<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.179> can't<00:02:05.360> be

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
be and merely saying that it can't be

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.510 
be and merely saying that it can't be
ruled<00:02:05.719> out<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.739> know<00:02:06.770> people<00:02:07.009> will<00:02:07.250> say

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
ruled out and I know people will say

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.789 
ruled out and I know people will say
that<00:02:07.789> well<00:02:07.939> you<00:02:08.119> know<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:08.269> can't<00:02:08.750> make<00:02:09.440> the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
that well you know you can't make the

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.509 
that well you know you can't make the
game<00:02:09.829> laws<00:02:10.220> as<00:02:10.519> no<00:02:11.299> rules<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:13.099> point<00:02:13.370> is

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
game laws as no rules but the point is

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.910 
game laws as no rules but the point is
is<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.730> if<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.450> do<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.599> he<00:02:15.260> can<00:02:15.290> do<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.709> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
is that if I can do it he can do it and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.559 
is that if I can do it he can do it and
if<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.549> happened<00:02:16.849> to<00:02:16.879> me<00:02:17.060> then<00:02:17.299> it<00:02:17.450> would

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
if it happened to me then it would

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:33.880 
if it happened to me then it would
probably<00:02:17.959> happen<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.590> him

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.950 

you
