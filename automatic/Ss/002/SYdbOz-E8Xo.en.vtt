00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.070
 ricky so guys are welcome 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
 a new video and today I bring a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.820
 more interesting model because today 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.769
 who liked the model that would come 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.990
 being the damage indicator for the 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.580
 mods and enemies so nothing told me 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.020
 who wanted more mods and today 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.990
 I bring one as they were given the title 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.650
 Well, if we are in the mold 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.990
 interpersonal that I think is great 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.580
 because apart from that it is not simply 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.590
 that you can get them from creatives but 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.469
 that the sender mans who added us 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.600
 European ones in and of itself so nothing 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.999
 he passed a shattered motorcycle videos like 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.010
 always pm this volume there are topics 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.429
 just to look for what's coming 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.929
 being these 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.609
 enders and good as you can see I'm going 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.679
 catch snowballs because we take 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.579
 agreement a state 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:56.240
 but I think it 's like that ok ok yeah I got it 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.840
 snowballs see me how it sounds 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.670
 because because now I already 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.760
 I mentioned in the episode person in the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.550
 previous video of mods for all these 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.320
 modes are in beta phase so as not 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.440
 has added what is still a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.420
 skin of the under bears as they are replaced 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.860
 with snowballs however there is a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.900
 texture farc that the truth is that I've 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.220
 searched a lot but I could not 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.710
 find that what he does is that 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.200
 can 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.180
 see the snowballs as enter first 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.100
 which would be a bit more real what 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.810
 another motorcycle is destroyed videos 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.010
 Of course, what has been the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.600
 experience of the mod 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.800
 however, let's try what 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.240
 I know what everyone wants 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.740
 then there in the background, they see a 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.159
 little sheep I hope you 're looking good 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.259
 so let's throw it away and pumba and like 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.300
 you see see me teleporting makes 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.909
 nothing if the same function as a pearl 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.560
 of ende and may know has no character 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.240
 or simply the trails la european 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.780
 just like the functional micro if I get 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.780
 to the street 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.570
 good thing is that it seems great to me that's 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.400
 super super excellent because then we're going 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.920
 to allow us to move much faster 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.510
 during the maps requires routes 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 long will also allow us 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.430
 get to places that before then not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.860
 we could easily get there as could 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.930
 to be has a mountain or simply 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.270
 any place high so nothing guys 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.610
 you already know that the English that network this mode 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.750
 they have it down here in the description 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.990
 I will also see if I find what 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.880
 it's been the slate surbac that what 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.390
 does is allow to see the snowballs 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.490
 as well as interest which would then 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.110
 that much is said in him however 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.520
 Well, it is not that it makes a lot of trouble 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.840
 So guys 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.400
 I hope you liked this video 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.200
 you know that these videos are not very 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.790
 long because it's just a small 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.740
 review of what they see saying the text 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.450
 agreed to download it and tested it 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.370
 so nothing that I hope you have 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.680

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.340
