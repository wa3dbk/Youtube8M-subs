 Optional PlayStation 3 wiiu soft 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.590
 To work with the Kamen Rider Summon Ride 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.310
 nfc chip is built on a pedestal 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.680
 Rider kick pose 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:39.050
 It is a figure 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.760
 Defeated i package gold Kedomo I think that item is is you can see a little 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.980
 In that 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.700
 Because it was such a great discount I bought only one salvage 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.700
 Thunder Nakuwa' 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.700
 Yes it is like this in all types 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.470
 It is a little Kamen Rider drive rate 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.060
 Hmm It is high 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.159
 I of pushing the most bone now, after all that new rider 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.580
 Liger 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.000
 It will be a rider drive 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.830
 I bought a ride figure of water 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.530
 Kamen Rider Wizards 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.530
 Although it is a ride figure of a water Kamen Rider wizard 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.320
 Because it is not water style 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 In I think I want to open immediately 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:35.690
 A little but I was interested from before to be released in the item 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.950
 Because I still do not think silent 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:45.710
 You in conjunction with the game do not buy it game software 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.910
 Since the play this figure troubled or not buy or buy because its function can not be used a little I 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.870
 Even though it came out 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.409
 Also I'd have bought one because it was by chance I discount 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.119
 I cat can of was good 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.109
 I think Toka Do not want raised bought from the mainland I just purpose of collection roots figures 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.870
 Isn't it 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.770
 It's a weak 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.730
 Jean 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.440
 very well 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.440
 It feels like a high volume feeling- 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.890
 Candy has always Ramune may enter one 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.300
 Then I want to take out this plastic 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.600
 Big 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.810
 Do you understand everyone like this? 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.710
 Feeling 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:36.460
 It is pretty cool and there is a fire just to make 500 yen 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.460
 It does not seem to contain it fc check later even when viewed from the back 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:47.200
 Yup 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:48.310
 It's a pretty good time, I wonder if this watery feeling is all right clear parts 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.870
 Is beautiful 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.519
 M 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.519
 The wizard itself for quite a while 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.440
 Sounds good fine can itself of slow things slightly smaller 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:10.239
 Pretty cool 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.239
 Will introduce the little Kkode here figure Namaakashi 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400
 Hmm 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:27.060
 This time 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:31.920
 Rider Samonraido Kedomo sg we've covered the ride figure 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:35.640
 It is very cool and clear parts are also good. 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:43.680
 This is a pose for the rider kick , is it mount ? 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:47.050
 Thin behind this is that Tanabii I of the wizard is also very cool also a nfc 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.490
 At the same time by say built-in fear 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.569
 I am absolutely sure about Amibo released by Tendo 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:03.810
 I think it is a product that tends to be compared 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:13.769
 There are many friends here for my friends, but my favorite friends are in the US, but I have an American sister Enue festival 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:14.560
 more amoeba itself is quite large Kedomo I thought Day skimmer I Mediocre NiÃ±o 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.239
 Acknowledgment 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:23.110
 This sg live figure here is pricey 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.570
 I think it is quite attractive 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.310
 Through Oki- san, too 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:35.980
 I think there is no problem with this size 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:39.700
 On the contrary, if it is a little big like Amigo , it is hard to carry to use in the game 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.590
 I think I will take a little sleeping place to collect 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:51.100
 If you think about the game interlocking to the last 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:53.880
 Amibo's 1200 tax exemption feels somewhat expensive . 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:59.150
 Though it is personal subjectivity, but 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.289
 You can see the contents of that sg ride figure 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.249
 Oh Since the goods of 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:11.399
 My personal favorite sound Mask Liger Kametani is Preah and 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:16.739
 I feel like I want one for collection by all means when it is released 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:18.770
 It is those who have a game this is I do not it say about okay to the other all buy 

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:19.990
 Pretty can also It is good 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.010
 Yup 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:29.710
 Because it is built-in with nfc and maybe built-in with nfc 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:31.900
 You can make Seibu or put your saved data in this figure itself and play with friends 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:38.220
 I think I do 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.220
 That's all for this introduction Thank you for watching 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.160
 I hope you see it again
