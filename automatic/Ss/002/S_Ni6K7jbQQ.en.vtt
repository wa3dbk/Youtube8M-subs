00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.899
 Hello everyone who watches this video in this 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:13.920
 video i want to show you my last 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:21.920
 this work is such a knife this knife is made 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.920
 of steel h12mf this knife went two weeks 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.939
 the handle is made of homemade 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.329
 plastic is more made of aluminum 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.309
 or aluminum, I do not know exactly but 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.950
 durable enough material like you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.160
 see on the blade done here 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.920
 engraving this knife I called flora 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.489
 because here is a floral ornament and 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:58.280
 the handle is so green 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:00.800
 the length of the blade is 15 centimeters 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 width 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.909
 just over three and a half centimeters 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:15.000
 and a butt thickness of three and a half 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.460
 millimeter that's how you see again 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.100
 repeat all the handle is made of 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.220
 homemade plastic into a buster and how are you 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.640
 see and also about the bet made of 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.960
 same plastic here as you see with 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.590
 one mounting handle is very ergonomic 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.460
 and very comfortable and fits very well in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.460
 arms 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.040
 he as you see is such an engraving on 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.160
 he doesn't 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.380
 I do not know whether this is engraved or not, but here 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.630
 this drawing is contra acid pancake 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.290
 spam is all done using photoresist and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.310
 acids 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.500
 Here is such a bolster at all for this knife 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.870
 I wanted to make a stainless buster 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.399
 become 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.220
 but decided this time to make no foolishness 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.260
 aluminum or because of lumiya that's how you 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.940
 You see this very beautiful grip 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:24.200
 It turned out so I want to say by 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.330
 grip grip grip again 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.020
 repeat is made of homemade 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.840
 plastic 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.120
 who does not know what kind of homemade 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.830
 plastic I shot a video on my channel 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.300
 homemade plastic 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.870
 can look here will be 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.209
 reference 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:49.300
 and here is my homemade plastic made it 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:53.360
 for the passivity of the small and the guys wrote to me 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.500
 what is this homemade plastic but 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.040
 very bad 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.430
 polished why is it poorly polished 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.780
 because when you make this 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.390
 homemade plastic it needs a little 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.810
 stand well how to understand stand in 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.870
 general 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.280
 you have prepared this plastic and need it 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.200
 somewhere about two weeks and the best month 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.430
 allows him to stand so that he completely 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.030
 hardened and became strong enough 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.420
 then you can polish it here 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.350
 as you see, yes, that's such a perfect 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.430
 here to such a perfect surface 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:40.930
 it is also polished like plexiglass 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.930
 easy enough and just see 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.460
 and what I want to say is that the handle of this 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.460
 homemade plastic is very durable and 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.120
 very hard many ask me 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.270
 will fall it will burst go crack 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.860
 I want to immediately say that if she falls 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.370
 on the floor it will not crack and 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.530
 burst all very durable and find well 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.160
 Naturally as any plastic of course 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.250
 she will scratch 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:20.380
 I also want to say that this knife is under 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.350
 very yes well sharp enough I don't 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.730
 began to sharpen yes super razor sharpness 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:31.180
 Yes, in principle, it is not necessary, well, let's 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:37.750
 check sharpening and look you sharp 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:43.890
 Whether or not it so here's a sheet of A4 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.890
 see no problem 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.160
 I am often asked 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.470
 what tools do i use at all 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.229
 to be honest from my 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.650
 the tools that I have and from 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.150
 what kind 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.860
 well, what machines do you know the coolest 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.630
 the tool is my screwdriver 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.310
 I also have a grinding machine 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.580
 Turkish production for home 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.220
 masters but it's not as cool as you 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.289
 you understand , many ask me 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.870
 what kind of grinder do I have ? what kind of grinder am I 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.930
 I use a grinder at all I do not have but 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:43.830
 there is a desire to buy it over time 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.530
 I think I'll get everything in the main all 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.180
 basic operations operations of course 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.919
 made by hand and in general I do not have 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.099
 specialized workshop I live in 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:00.660
 ordinary apartment and all I do 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:04.860
 at home so if something goes wrong 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:08.220
 judge strictly well at home when 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.470
 You can make it easy here 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.139
 such a knife if you have a small 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:17.909
 emery desire but also a small amount 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.330
 tools this knife is made accept 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:22.590
 by them 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.680
 well, the very minimum of tools for it 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.289
 was used 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.289
 most say our cool but cool 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.680

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.320
