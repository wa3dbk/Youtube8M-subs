00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.280
 Thank you! Is WataGames 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.500
 Twitter also said, but 

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:09.345
 it is this! This one! Mysterious configuration!! 

00:00:10.193 --> 00:00:12.193
 It's about to make sense of the configuration! 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.960
 Why did I initially deploy in such a place? I think. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.240
 It may not be possible to see this notice, however. 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.280
 In fact, consider this for the sake of matching. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.340
 Is there something that is not paired with the other party? 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.840
 Victory has this reason! 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.520
 People who are close to victory point become paired. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.980
 I think that is the reason for this arrangement. 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.100
 Because, therefore, if the victory point is reduced 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.700
 It is difficult to be attacked because it is easy to be paired with downgrading. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.200
 Therefore, it may be effective when resources are saved. 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.500
 Really net is like being paired with the same time 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.940
 Also consider this combat effective. 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.900
 Please pay more attention to high evaluation and channel registration!
