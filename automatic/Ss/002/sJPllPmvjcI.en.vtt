the<00:03:38.260> main<00:03:38.470> key<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.769> this<00:03:38.950> base<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.550> mean<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:39.850> do

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
the main key to this base I mean you do

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.020 
the main key to this base I mean you do
not<00:03:40.090> want<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.480> dragons<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.860> get<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.820> town

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
not want the dragons to get to the town

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.830 
not want the dragons to get to the town
to<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.510> air<00:03:43.660> defenses<00:03:44.080> quickly<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.130> and

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
to the air defenses quickly so and

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.560 
to the air defenses quickly so and
there's<00:03:46.840> storages<00:03:47.769> that<00:03:47.890> do<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> good<00:03:48.220> job<00:03:48.280> of

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
there's storages that do a good job of

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.790 
there's storages that do a good job of
getting<00:03:49.570> them<00:03:49.750> caught<00:03:50.050> up<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.350> there<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.680> then

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
getting them caught up in there and then

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.530 
getting them caught up in there and then
even<00:03:51.070> this<00:03:51.160> bottom<00:03:51.580> here<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:51.910> bottom<00:03:52.330> it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
even this bottom here this bottom it

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.150 
even this bottom here this bottom it
kind<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:53.050> looks<00:03:53.200> weak<00:03:53.410> but<00:03:53.560> at<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.739> same<00:03:53.890> time

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
kind of looks weak but at the same time

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.979 
kind of looks weak but at the same time
it's<00:03:54.430> it's<00:03:54.700> where<00:03:54.910> most<00:03:55.120> of<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.330> defenses<00:03:55.840> are

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
it's it's where most of the defenses are

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.930 
it's it's where most of the defenses are
people<00:03:56.860> are<00:03:56.950> probably<00:03:57.100> gonna<00:03:57.310> try<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.610> avoid

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
people are probably gonna try to avoid

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.600 
people are probably gonna try to avoid
the<00:03:58.090> bottom<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.800> that's<00:03:59.800> because<00:04:00.250> it's<00:04:00.400> well

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
the bottom and that's because it's well

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.449 
the bottom and that's because it's well
covered<00:04:00.850> it's<00:04:01.150> probably<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:02.130> strongest<00:04:03.130> part

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
covered it's probably the strongest part

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.240 
covered it's probably the strongest part
of<00:04:03.580> the<00:04:03.640> base<00:04:03.850> but<00:04:04.650> at<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.769> same<00:04:05.890> time<00:04:06.100> it

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
of the base but at the same time it

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.890 
of the base but at the same time it
doesn't<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.940> does<00:04:07.150> look<00:04:07.330> like<00:04:07.360> strongest

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
doesn't and it does look like strongest

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.259 
doesn't and it does look like strongest
but<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.440> besides<00:04:09.100> look<00:04:09.459> weak<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:10.090> they're

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
but and besides look weak but they're

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.599 
but and besides look weak but they're
not<00:04:10.450> guys<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.109> then<00:04:11.260> expressing<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.130> top<00:04:12.340> lip

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
not guys and then expressing a top lip

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.140 
not guys and then expressing a top lip
that<00:04:12.790> looks<00:04:13.060> weak

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
that looks weak

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.620 
that looks weak
but<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:14.750> it's<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.439> built<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.669> base<00:04:17.060> literally

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
but and it's I built a base literally

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.439 
but and it's I built a base literally
too<00:04:18.009> for<00:04:19.900> for<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:20.989> top<00:04:21.199> they're<00:04:21.470> like<00:04:21.739> huh<00:04:22.449> for

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
too for for the top they're like huh for

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.270 
too for for the top they're like huh for
that<00:04:23.570> top<00:04:23.810> left<00:04:24.080> two<00:04:24.289> people<00:04:24.560> think<00:04:25.130> they'd

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
that top left two people think they'd

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.640 
that top left two people think they'd
come<00:04:25.550> in<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:26.050> come<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.080> from<00:04:27.350> that<00:04:27.500> direction

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
come in and come in from that direction

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.370 
come in and come in from that direction
and<00:04:28.310> yet<00:04:29.270> they<00:04:29.419> it's<00:04:29.720> gonna<00:04:29.840> be<00:04:29.990> tough<00:04:30.229> because

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
and yet they it's gonna be tough because

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.409 
and yet they it's gonna be tough because
the<00:04:30.530> storages<00:04:31.039> I<00:04:31.100> mean<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.460> take<00:04:31.639> up<00:04:31.820> there's

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
the storages I mean the take up there's

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.320 
the storages I mean the take up there's
just<00:04:32.479> so<00:04:32.720> many<00:04:32.810> hit<00:04:33.169> points<00:04:33.199> and<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.970> then<00:04:35.180> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
just so many hit points and and then the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.060 
just so many hit points and and then the
traps<00:04:35.750> up<00:04:35.960> top<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.229> mean<00:04:36.380> it<00:04:36.530> still<00:04:36.710> protects

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
traps up top I mean it still protects

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.890 
traps up top I mean it still protects
well<00:04:37.250> against<00:04:37.490> ground<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.419> mean<00:04:38.630> cuz<00:04:38.780> the

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
well against ground to I mean cuz the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.960 
well against ground to I mean cuz the
traps<00:04:39.199> all<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.740> bottom<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.310> traps<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.820> are

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
traps all the bottom the traps that are

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.090 
traps all the bottom the traps that are
on<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.210> ground<00:04:41.479> they're<00:04:42.320> trying<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.650> set<00:04:42.919> up

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
on the ground they're trying to set up

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.120 
on the ground they're trying to set up
those<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:44.720> ground<00:04:44.960> troops<00:04:45.229> for<00:04:45.530> failure<00:04:45.889> and

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
those the ground troops for failure and

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.180 
those the ground troops for failure and
then<00:04:46.510> accidentally<00:04:47.510> I<00:04:47.690> put<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.080> cannons<00:04:49.010> in<00:04:49.130> a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
then accidentally I put the cannons in a

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.100 
then accidentally I put the cannons in a
bit<00:04:49.340> too<00:04:49.490> far<00:04:49.729> here<00:04:50.000> so<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:50.360> was<00:04:50.750> like<00:04:50.870> whoops

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
bit too far here so I was like whoops

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.710 
bit too far here so I was like whoops
I'll<00:04:51.320> move<00:04:51.560> them<00:04:51.710> out<00:04:51.889> to<00:04:52.699> help<00:04:52.880> out<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.270> clan

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
I'll move them out to help out the clan

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.580 
I'll move them out to help out the clan
castle

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
castle

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.290 
castle
clonk<00:04:55.250> awesome<00:04:56.530> but<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.910> then<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.180> only

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
clonk awesome but and then the only

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.610 
clonk awesome but and then the only
thing<00:04:59.510> that<00:04:59.630> can<00:04:59.750> still<00:04:59.960> get<00:05:00.080> lured<00:05:00.289> is<00:05:00.440> that

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
thing that can still get lured is that

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.830 
thing that can still get lured is that
as<00:05:00.800> if<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:01.460> send<00:05:01.729> in<00:05:01.850> like<00:05:02.000> a<00:05:02.030> hog<00:05:02.300> at<00:05:02.690> the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
as if you send in like a hog at the

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.100 
as if you send in like a hog at the
bottom<00:05:03.260> they're<00:05:03.440> there<00:05:03.880> at<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:05.150> arch<00:05:05.720> towers

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
bottom they're there at the arch towers

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.450 
bottom they're there at the arch towers
and<00:05:06.289> candidates<00:05:06.650> but<00:05:06.770> other<00:05:06.949> than<00:05:07.039> that<00:05:07.130> it's

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
and candidates but other than that it's

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.089 
and candidates but other than that it's
hard<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:07.910> get<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.449> so<00:05:09.050> they're<00:05:09.800> gonna<00:05:09.919> have<00:05:10.070> to

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
hard to get to so they're gonna have to

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.360 
hard to get to so they're gonna have to
deal<00:05:10.370> with<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.789> clan<00:05:11.060> castle<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:12.190> this<00:05:13.190> isn't

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
deal with the clan castle and this isn't

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.920 
deal with the clan castle and this isn't
this<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.669> nice<00:05:13.880> base<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:14.330> really<00:05:14.539> like<00:05:14.660> how<00:05:14.810> this

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
this a nice base I really like how this

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.409 
this a nice base I really like how this
came<00:05:15.169> out<00:05:15.349> um<00:05:15.590> put<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.550> lot<00:05:16.729> of<00:05:16.820> work<00:05:16.940> into<00:05:17.120> it<00:05:17.210> I

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
came out um put a lot of work into it I

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.270 
came out um put a lot of work into it I
just<00:05:17.479> thought<00:05:17.780> like<00:05:18.050> Oh<00:05:18.229> what<00:05:18.590> would<00:05:18.889> you<00:05:19.039> not

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
just thought like Oh what would you not

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.250 
just thought like Oh what would you not
want<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.669> see<00:05:19.910> when<00:05:20.270> you're<00:05:20.389> using<00:05:20.630> dragons

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
want to see when you're using dragons
