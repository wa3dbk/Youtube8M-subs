00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.580
 the match with jules comes on Sunday 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.950
 the match with one of the pointers of the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.570
 tournament how the week is prepared even 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.449
 after the result of the superclassic 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.900
 from last Sunday well we prepare ourselves 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.900
 the best way obviously what good 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.070
 we had a hard hit of the weekend 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.650
 but good you have to continue 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.869
 forward knowing that obviously we 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 we get away from the pointers but good 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.050
 we have a nice chance to discount 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.760
 points now on Sunday is a match 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.519
 special for you since it is played against 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.519
 all that equipment if special because good 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.280
 I have a lot of love at the level of play 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.680
 many years there but good nothing I think 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.050
 I am a professional and I lived being the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.510
 river shirt so I'm going to do 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.310
 everything to be in speaking also of 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.780
 the differences between news and river as 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.150
 with this two those wheel plays here 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.880
 you're like lateral now in what position 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.879
 you feel more comfortable, particularly not 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.950
 to the last two years already in level I played 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.910
 three also obviously always know 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.729
 an idea that I was lucky to have 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.860
 the last technicians who asked me to 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.320
 play sideways but that attack so 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.250
 well, it does not change me very much, I feel 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.810
 like where I am I have spoken with ramón 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.490
 out there obviously that outside is written 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.230
 A little bit of doubt spoke a little bit more 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 for the position of me but 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.750
 we had ramón side when joel ask me 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.950
 octave when lateral so between 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.020
 we had no doubt that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.030
 I wanted collateral what I would have to do 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.680
 river to be able to pull down between 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.170
 quotes to the pointer years that comes very 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.970
 well in the championship is what it has 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.090
 that there is a team that I have to play like that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.770
 that plays very well but also 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.320
 when you have the ball he lets you play 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.110
 so we have to be smart 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.270
 I think we have to try to attack him 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.130
 because if you give the ball to them you 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.570
 can complicate so I think the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.399
 better way that we do not have it 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 you also know very well the court is 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.720
 more more difficult as in playing there 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.810
 in rosario it is not very nice the truth that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.810
 playing there is nice because good 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.020
 I get a lot of people and good when a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.080
 party has this expectation of 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.730
 pointer against river I think it's good 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.440
 I think it's going to be a nice match 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.440
 also for the family 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.900
 that you can not even visitors out there 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.040
 better than it is by the doubts that we 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:48.740
 come hang by themes 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.740
