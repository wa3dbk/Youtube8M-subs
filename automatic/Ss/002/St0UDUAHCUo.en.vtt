model blackberry bold touch 9930 both

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.830 
model blackberry bold touch 9930 both
are<00:00:17.310> considered<00:00:17.640> business<00:00:17.970> models<00:00:18.510> because

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
are considered business models because

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.900 
are considered business models because
they<00:00:18.960> combine<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.560> QWERTY<00:00:19.890> keyboard<00:00:20.310> with<00:00:20.880> a

they combine the QWERTY keyboard with a
touchscreen<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.160> let's<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.460> they<00:00:23.550> have

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
touchscreen and let's see what they have

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.000 
touchscreen and let's see what they have
in<00:00:23.730> common<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.390> starters<00:00:24.900> they're<00:00:25.380> exactly

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
in common for starters they're exactly

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.400 
in common for starters they're exactly
the<00:00:26.130> same<00:00:26.250> thickness<00:00:26.990> ten<00:00:27.990> point<00:00:28.260> five

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the same thickness ten point five

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.389 
the same thickness ten point five
millimeters<00:00:29.090> here<00:00:30.090> they're<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.920> nice<00:00:31.920> phone

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
millimeters here they're a nice phone

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.000 
millimeters here they're a nice phone
sandwich<00:00:34.820> okay<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:38.309> bold<00:00:38.550> touch<00:00:38.899> weighs

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
sandwich okay and the bold touch weighs

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.580 
sandwich okay and the bold touch weighs
130<00:00:41.010> grams<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.030> pretty<00:00:42.239> light<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.590> how

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
130 grams so it's pretty light for how

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.420 
130 grams so it's pretty light for how
wide<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.040> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
wide it is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
wide it is
while<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> Nokia<00:00:45.690> e6<00:00:46.340> weighs<00:00:47.809> 133<00:00:48.809> grams<00:00:48.920> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
while the Nokia e6 weighs 133 grams so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
while the Nokia e6 weighs 133 grams so
they're<00:00:50.100> pretty<00:00:50.309> close<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:51.510> far<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.809> screens

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
they're pretty close as far as screens

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.099 
they're pretty close as far as screens
go<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:53.550> BlackBerry<00:00:54.059> has<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> 2.8<00:00:55.289> each<00:00:56.030> display

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
go the BlackBerry has a 2.8 each display

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.560 
go the BlackBerry has a 2.8 each display
so<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> plus<00:00:58.820> with<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> resolution<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
so that's a plus with a resolution of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
so that's a plus with a resolution of
640<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.440> 480

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

over<00:01:11.070> 480<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> stop<00:01:13.470> both

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
over 480 and now I'm going to stop both

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.010 
over 480 and now I'm going to stop both
devices<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:15.000> which<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.420> boots<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.470> faster

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
devices to see which one boots up faster

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.609 
devices to see which one boots up faster
3<00:01:19.020> 2<00:01:19.259> 1<00:01:19.500> go

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.580 

the<00:01:26.250> BlackBerry<00:01:26.790> already<00:01:27.119> started<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:28.320> okay

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the BlackBerry already started then okay

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.090 
the BlackBerry already started then okay
we're<00:01:28.740> still<00:01:28.950> waiting<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.640 

is<00:01:36.729> taking<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.240> while

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.400 

okay<00:01:44.400> so<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.700> processing<00:01:45.150> power<00:01:45.330> on<00:01:46.170> these

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
okay so the processing power on these

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.970 
okay so the processing power on these
devices<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.180> ball<00:01:48.600> touch<00:01:48.930> has<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> 1.2

devices the ball touch has the 1.2
gigahertz<00:01:50.220> CPU<00:01:50.720> while<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.960> Nokia<00:01:52.290> e6<00:01:52.620> has<00:01:53.270> 680

gigahertz CPU while the Nokia e6 has 680
megahertz<00:01:55.190> CPU<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.600> almost

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
megahertz CPU so this one is almost

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.070 
megahertz CPU so this one is almost
twice<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.590> powerful<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.580> other<00:01:59.810> this<00:02:00.810> one

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080

how its removed this one discover lift

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.700 
how its removed this one discover lift
stop<00:05:47.199> a<00:05:47.440> metallic<00:05:48.250> cover<00:05:49.409> this<00:05:50.409> is<00:05:50.590> the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
stop a metallic cover this is the

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.670 
stop a metallic cover this is the
battery<00:05:52.710> you<00:05:53.710> remove<00:05:54.009> it<00:05:54.159> it's<00:05:54.699> pretty<00:05:55.060> thick

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
battery you remove it it's pretty thick

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.950 
battery you remove it it's pretty thick
considering<00:05:56.680> how<00:05:56.800> big<00:05:57.159> the<00:05:57.280> devices<00:05:57.780> but<00:05:58.780> I'm

considering how big the devices but I'm

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.740 
considering how big the devices but I'm
guessing<00:05:59.169> it<00:05:59.530> has<00:05:59.740> more<00:06:00.009> power<00:06:00.370> and<00:06:00.639> more<00:06:00.750> days

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
guessing it has more power and more days

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.149 
guessing it has more power and more days
and<00:06:02.020> hours<00:06:02.229> of<00:06:02.320> functioning<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:02.949> the

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
devices in the following days till then

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.840 
devices in the following days till then
you<00:06:32.020> should<00:06:32.230> remember<00:06:32.470> that<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:33.370> BlackBerry

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
you should remember that the BlackBerry

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.330 
you should remember that the BlackBerry
model<00:06:34.240> is<00:06:34.420> double<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.140> price<00:06:35.170> of<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.740> nokia<00:06:36.070> 6

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
model is double the price of the nokia 6

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.960 
model is double the price of the nokia 6
so<00:06:36.580> keep<00:06:36.790> that<00:06:36.880> in<00:06:36.940> mind<00:06:38.370> as<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.520> can<00:06:39.670> see<00:06:39.820> the

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
so keep that in mind as you can see the

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.210 
so keep that in mind as you can see the
startup<00:06:40.360> time<00:06:40.510> is<00:06:40.690> actually<00:06:40.810> longer<00:06:41.410> now<00:06:41.680> that

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
startup time is actually longer now that

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.580 
startup time is actually longer now that
I<00:06:42.310> remove<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.670> battery<00:06:43.170> and<00:06:44.170> if<00:06:44.290> I<00:06:44.410> were<00:06:44.530> to

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
I remove the battery and if I were to

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.010 
I remove the battery and if I were to
start<00:06:44.950> the<00:06:45.040> nokia<00:06:45.340> model<00:06:45.640> now<00:06:45.790> I'm<00:06:46.630> guessing

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
start the nokia model now I'm guessing

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.710 
start the nokia model now I'm guessing
it<00:06:47.170> would<00:06:47.290> beat<00:06:47.530> the<00:06:47.710> BlackBerry<00:06:48.540> just<00:06:49.540> for

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
it would beat the BlackBerry just for

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.620 
it would beat the BlackBerry just for
fun<00:06:50.490> so<00:06:51.490> the<00:06:51.610> BlackBerry<00:06:51.970> has<00:06:52.120> a<00:06:52.150> quick<00:06:52.390> start

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630 
fun so the BlackBerry has a quick start

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.420 
fun so the BlackBerry has a quick start
mode<00:06:52.950> once<00:06:53.950> you<00:06:54.070> don't<00:06:54.160> remove<00:06:54.400> the<00:06:54.550> battery

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
mode once you don't remove the battery

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.870 
mode once you don't remove the battery
ok<00:06:57.430> so<00:06:57.490> this<00:06:57.700> is<00:06:57.880> just<00:06:58.090> for<00:06:58.330> fun

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
ok so this is just for fun

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:06.360 
ok so this is just for fun
I'm<00:07:00.880> really<00:07:01.180> curious<00:07:05.040> they<00:07:06.040> will<00:07:06.160> probably

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
I'm really curious they will probably

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.590 
I'm really curious they will probably
start<00:07:06.790> at<00:07:06.910> the<00:07:07.000> same<00:07:07.180> time<00:07:07.420> or<00:07:07.780> something<00:07:09.600> and

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
start at the same time or something and

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.080 
start at the same time or something and
ok<00:07:10.960> I<00:07:10.990> held<00:07:11.140> the<00:07:11.230> upper<00:07:11.260> hand

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
ok I held the upper hand

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.080 
ok I held the upper hand
so<00:07:13.090> the<00:07:13.270> initial<00:07:13.390> test<00:07:13.840> was<00:07:14.110> wrong<00:07:15.090> although

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
so the initial test was wrong although

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.540 
so the initial test was wrong although
it<00:07:16.300> takes<00:07:16.420> a<00:07:16.630> while<00:07:16.780> to<00:07:16.810> really<00:07:17.230> be<00:07:18.190> able<00:07:18.280> to

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
it takes a while to really be able to

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.060 
it takes a while to really be able to
use<00:07:18.640> the<00:07:18.790> device<00:07:20.640> so<00:07:21.640> only<00:07:21.670> now<00:07:22.180> we<00:07:22.240> can<00:07:22.510> use<00:07:22.660> it

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070 
use the device so only now we can use it

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.320 
use the device so only now we can use it
there<00:07:24.070> is<00:07:24.190> a<00:07:24.220> lot<00:07:24.370> of<00:07:24.520> waiting<00:07:24.730> time<00:07:25.060> for<00:07:25.240> the

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
there is a lot of waiting time for the

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.830 
there is a lot of waiting time for the
BlackBerry<00:07:25.690> once<00:07:26.590> you<00:07:26.710> remove<00:07:26.890> the<00:07:27.010> battery
