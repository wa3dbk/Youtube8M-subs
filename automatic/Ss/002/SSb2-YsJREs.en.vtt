about<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.260> engine<00:04:37.620> that's<00:04:37.920> what<00:04:38.100> it's<00:04:38.220> all

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
about that engine that's what it's all

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.700 
about that engine that's what it's all
about<00:04:38.370> because<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.960> said<00:04:40.020> before<00:04:40.290> I<00:04:40.500> don't

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
about because like I said before I don't

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.340 
about because like I said before I don't
know<00:04:41.010> everything<00:04:41.280> but<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:42.000> try<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.300> work<00:04:43.140> with

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
know everything but I try to work with

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.780 
know everything but I try to work with
the<00:04:43.470> evidence<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.100> if<00:04:44.280> you're<00:04:44.460> still<00:04:44.670> making

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
the evidence so if you're still making

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.000 
the evidence so if you're still making
comments<00:04:45.150> on<00:04:45.450> that<00:04:45.480> work<00:04:46.380> off<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.680> evidence

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
comments on that work off the evidence

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.410 
comments on that work off the evidence
and<00:04:47.250> not<00:04:47.400> just<00:04:47.580> off<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.940> pure<00:04:48.150> speculation

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
and not just off of pure speculation

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.810 
and not just off of pure speculation
take<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> look<00:04:49.620> at<00:04:49.800> all<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.040> videos<00:04:50.340> including

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
take a look at all the videos including

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.250 
take a look at all the videos including
the leak<00:04:51.060> down<00:04:51.240> video<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:51.870> see<00:04:52.020> if<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.110> can

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
the leak down video and see if you can

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.970 
the leak down video and see if you can
come<00:04:52.350> up<00:04:52.500> with<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.680> more<00:04:52.770> reasonable

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
come up with a more reasonable

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.200 
come up with a more reasonable
explanation<00:04:53.790> so<00:04:54.420> far<00:04:54.660> my<00:04:54.840> favorite<00:04:55.230> one<00:04:55.410> is

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
explanation so far my favorite one is

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.730 
explanation so far my favorite one is
maybe<00:04:57.210> microscopic<00:04:57.960> cracks<00:04:58.140> either<00:04:58.500> in<00:04:58.620> the

maybe microscopic cracks either in the

maybe microscopic cracks either in the

cylinder wall or the piston itself rings
lining<00:05:02.490> up<00:05:02.640> may<00:05:03.540> or<00:05:03.690> may<00:05:03.840> not<00:05:03.870> be<00:05:04.080> at<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.560> top

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.530 
lining up may or may not be at the top
of<00:05:04.770> my<00:05:04.980> list<00:05:05.190> so<00:05:05.340> much<00:05:05.490> anymore<00:05:05.730> as<00:05:06.120> far<00:05:06.450> as

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
that ring gap is concerned it seem large

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.890 
that ring gap is concerned it seem large
to<00:05:08.640> me<00:05:08.760> but<00:05:09.060> I've<00:05:09.240> been<00:05:09.390> told<00:05:09.570> that<00:05:09.750> that's

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
to me but I've been told that that's

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.080 
to me but I've been told that that's
pretty<00:05:10.230> much<00:05:10.470> inspect<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.520> also<00:05:11.850> there's

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
pretty much inspect and also there's

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.060 
pretty much inspect and also there's
other<00:05:12.330> speculation<00:05:12.930> about<00:05:13.170> piston<00:05:13.830> rings

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
other speculation about piston rings

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.260 
other speculation about piston rings
lining<00:05:14.430> up<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:14.760> that's<00:05:14.910> something<00:05:15.120> that

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
lining up and that's something that

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.510 
lining up and that's something that
normally<00:05:15.540> happens<00:05:16.140> also<00:05:16.530> on<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.400> high

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
normally happens also on the high

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.310 
normally happens also on the high
performance<00:05:18.090> application<00:05:18.720> ring<00:05:18.900> gaps<00:05:19.140> are

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
performance application ring gaps are

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.840 
performance application ring gaps are
even<00:05:19.590> larger<00:05:20.780> given<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:21.990> uh<00:05:22.730> you<00:05:23.730> know

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
even larger given that uh you know

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.340 
even larger given that uh you know
there's<00:05:24.090> there's<00:05:24.360> other<00:05:24.630> issues<00:05:24.690> going<00:05:25.170> on

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
there's there's other issues going on

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.770 
there's there's other issues going on
there<00:05:25.620> but<00:05:25.830> I<00:05:25.860> still<00:05:26.160> stick<00:05:26.400> by<00:05:26.580> my<00:05:27.120> theory

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
there but I still stick by my theory

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.330 
there but I still stick by my theory
that<00:05:28.020> something<00:05:28.530> is<00:05:28.650> going<00:05:28.830> on<00:05:29.010> with<00:05:29.220> the

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
that something is going on with the

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.770 
that something is going on with the
compression<00:05:29.730> loss<00:05:29.880> at<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> bottom<00:05:30.540> end<00:05:30.690> of

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
compression loss at the bottom end of

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.450 
compression loss at the bottom end of
the<00:05:30.870> engine<00:05:31.140> based<00:05:31.350> on<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.680> discoloration<00:05:32.370> of

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
the engine based on the discoloration of

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.710 
the engine based on the discoloration of
the<00:05:32.490> cylinder<00:05:32.880> wall<00:05:33.060> without<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.510> proper

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
the cylinder wall without the proper

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.090 
the cylinder wall without the proper
measuring<00:05:34.170> tools<00:05:34.380> to<00:05:34.560> get<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:34.830> there<00:05:35.070> and

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
measuring tools to get in there and

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.250 
measuring tools to get in there and
actually<00:05:35.790> Mike<00:05:36.330> everything<00:05:36.720> out<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:37.080> be

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
actually Mike everything out to be

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.500 
actually Mike everything out to be
honest<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.980> jury<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.340> still<00:05:38.370> out<00:05:38.700> so<00:05:39.060> really

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
honest the jury is still out so really

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.480 
honest the jury is still out so really
there's<00:05:40.320> a<00:05:40.380> whole<00:05:40.590> lot<00:05:40.710> of<00:05:40.740> theory<00:05:41.100> based<00:05:41.310> on

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
there's a whole lot of theory based on

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.020 
there's a whole lot of theory based on
evidence<00:05:41.760> but<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.480> I<00:05:43.320> will<00:05:43.980> admit<00:05:44.370> that<00:05:44.400> I<00:05:44.700> don't

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
evidence but I I will admit that I don't

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.050 
evidence but I I will admit that I don't
have<00:05:45.300> solid<00:05:45.960> proof<00:05:46.230> of<00:05:46.650> what<00:05:47.460> was<00:05:47.610> happening

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
have solid proof of what was happening

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.760
