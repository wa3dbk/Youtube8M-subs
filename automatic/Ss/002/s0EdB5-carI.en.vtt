didn't we didn't we weren't schemed or
anything<00:00:17.020> it's<00:00:17.380> not<00:00:17.500> like<00:00:17.710> I<00:00:18.009> don't<00:00:18.820> know<00:00:18.939> they

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
anything it's not like I don't know they

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.300 
anything it's not like I don't know they
just<00:00:19.359> threw<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.810> ball<00:00:20.019> a<00:00:20.080> lot<00:00:20.320> we<00:00:20.859> just<00:00:21.070> got

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
just threw the ball a lot we just got

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.700 
just threw the ball a lot we just got
beat<00:00:21.490> a<00:00:22.029> person<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.810> person<00:00:23.140> we<00:00:23.230> got<00:00:23.380> beat<00:00:23.560> in

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
beat a person a person we got beat in

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.519 
beat a person a person we got beat in
Oringer<00:00:24.580> that's<00:00:24.730> not<00:00:24.849> acceptable<00:00:25.150> because<00:00:25.529> we

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
Oringer that's not acceptable because we

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.929 
Oringer that's not acceptable because we
have<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:26.740> ability<00:00:27.099> to<00:00:27.130> not<00:00:27.400> get<00:00:27.820> beat<00:00:27.999> so<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
have the ability to not get beat so it

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.400 
have the ability to not get beat so it
is<00:00:31.119> going<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.329> be<00:00:31.359> intense<00:00:31.689> and<00:00:31.990> I<00:00:32.140> think<00:00:32.320> the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
is going to be intense and I think the

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.870 
is going to be intense and I think the
players<00:00:32.590> are<00:00:32.829> ratcheting<00:00:33.190> up<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:33.370> intense<00:00:33.730> is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
players are ratcheting up the intense is

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.630 
players are ratcheting up the intense is
the<00:00:33.970> intenseness<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.900> or<00:00:35.110> intensity<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.740> I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
the intenseness to or intensity and I

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.250 
the intenseness to or intensity and I
don't<00:00:37.360> know<00:00:37.420> I<00:00:37.450> think<00:00:37.570> that's<00:00:37.900> what<00:00:38.020> we<00:00:38.050> need

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
don't know I think that's what we need

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.630 
don't know I think that's what we need
its<00:00:38.410> Big<00:00:38.560> Ten<00:00:38.770> ball<00:00:38.950> you<00:00:39.070> can't<00:00:39.280> take<00:00:39.430> anyone

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
its Big Ten ball you can't take anyone

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
they were gonna zone anyways but they

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.760 
they were gonna zone anyways but they

I<00:00:56.950> was<00:00:57.130> much<00:00:57.310> flatter<00:00:57.580> Penn<00:00:57.880> State<00:00:58.120> Connor

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

double<00:01:00.820> teams<00:01:01.000> up<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.450> backer<00:01:01.660> so<00:01:02.380> they

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
double teams up to the backer so they

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.079 
double teams up to the backer so they
might<00:01:02.860> try<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.250> change<00:01:03.700> their<00:01:03.910> game<00:01:04.059> plan

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.240 
might try to change their game plan
where<00:01:04.570> they<00:01:04.689> just<00:01:04.720> go<00:01:04.989> flat<00:01:05.259> like<00:01:05.470> Iowa<00:01:05.770> did<00:01:05.980> or

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
where they just go flat like Iowa did or

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.400 
where they just go flat like Iowa did or
they<00:01:06.640> might<00:01:06.790> stick<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.150> what<00:01:07.300> they<00:01:07.330> do<00:01:07.480> either
