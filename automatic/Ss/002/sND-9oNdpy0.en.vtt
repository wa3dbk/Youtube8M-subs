00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.259 
is a very important step I prefer a
liquid<00:02:22.830> or<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.069> gel<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.670> goes<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:24.000> nice<00:02:24.239> and

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
liquid or a gel it goes on nice and

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.559 
liquid or a gel it goes on nice and
smooth<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.410> lot<00:02:25.590> easier<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:26.190> use<00:02:26.569> than

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
smooth and it's a lot easier to use than

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.229 
smooth and it's a lot easier to use than
a<00:02:27.630> pencil<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:29.430> going<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.670> start<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
a pencil and I'm going to start in the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.960 
a pencil and I'm going to start in the
center<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.780> her<00:02:30.930> eyelid<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.739> I'm<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:32.819> going

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
center of her eyelid and I'm just going

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.140 
center of her eyelid and I'm just going
to<00:02:33.060> be<00:02:33.180> drawing<00:02:33.450> very<00:02:33.720> short<00:02:34.200> strokes<00:02:35.150> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
to be drawing very short strokes so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.090 
to be drawing very short strokes so
we're<00:02:36.330> painting<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.140> creating<00:02:37.890> very

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
we're painting that on creating very

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.000 
we're painting that on creating very
short<00:02:38.519> lines<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.060> then<00:02:39.150> connecting<00:02:39.780> them

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
short lines and then connecting them

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.460 
short lines and then connecting them
it's<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.070> lot<00:02:41.220> easier<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.299> then<00:02:42.510> then

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
it's a lot easier to do that then then

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.970 
it's a lot easier to do that then then
creating<00:02:43.890> one<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.790> perfect<00:02:45.420> line<00:02:45.739> then<00:02:46.739> we're

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
creating one one perfect line then we're

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.210 
creating one one perfect line then we're
going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.280> extend<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.820> line<00:02:48.090> up<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.440> out

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
going to extend this line up and out

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.789 
going to extend this line up and out
just<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:51.090> little<00:02:51.120> bit<00:02:51.390> giving<00:02:52.049> her<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.319> little

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
just a little bit giving her a little

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.090 
just a little bit giving her a little

expose that little ledge in there and we

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.559

want<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.810> continue<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.290> line<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:14.160> meet<00:03:14.569> the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
want to continue that line to meet the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.830 
want to continue that line to meet the
line<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.049> center<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.940> gel<00:03:18.389> liner<00:03:18.630> is

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
line in the center this gel liner is

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.120 
line in the center this gel liner is
great<00:03:19.200> because<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.400> goes<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:21.440> liquid<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:23.040> it

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
great because it goes on liquid but it

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.120 
great because it goes on liquid but it
dries<00:03:23.370> matte<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.359> waterproof<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.410> this

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
dries matte and it is waterproof so this

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.900 
dries matte and it is waterproof so this
should<00:03:26.340> last<00:03:26.549> her<00:03:26.819> all<00:03:27.000> night<00:03:28.790> curling<00:03:29.790> the

should last her all night curling the
lashes<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:30.660> such<00:03:30.870> an<00:03:31.019> essential<00:03:31.500> part<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.980> a
