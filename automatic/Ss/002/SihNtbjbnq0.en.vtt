00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
something I know I've done a video on

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.510 
something I know I've done a video on
this<00:00:47.219> before<00:00:47.399> about<00:00:48.120> using<00:00:48.620> some<00:00:49.620> sandpaper<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this before about using some sandpaper I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.380 
this before about using some sandpaper I
use<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.739> 600<00:00:52.739> grit<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.730> roll<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
use a 600 grit and I roll it up and I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.029 
use a 600 grit and I roll it up and I
stick<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> jack<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.350> spin<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> around

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
stick it in the jack and spin it around

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.959 
stick it in the jack and spin it around
I've<00:00:56.850> already<00:00:57.210> done<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.820> can

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
I've already done it so and you can

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.250 
I've already done it so and you can
refer<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> other<00:01:00.570> video<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.140> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
refer to the other video what you do is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.540 
refer to the other video what you do is
you<00:01:01.320> stick<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> jack<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you stick it actually in the jack and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
you stick it actually in the jack and
spin<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> around<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.290> cleans<00:01:04.860> off<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
spin it around and it cleans off all the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.700 
spin it around and it cleans off all the
oxidation<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.540> when<00:01:06.659> you're<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.409> doing

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
oxidation but when you're you're doing

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.340 
oxidation but when you're you're doing
this<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> an<00:01:08.580> input<00:01:08.939> jack<00:01:09.080> sometimes<00:01:10.080> guys

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this to a an input jack sometimes guys

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.370 
this to a an input jack sometimes guys
miss<00:01:10.799> these<00:01:11.869> let's<00:01:12.869> see<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.110> could<00:01:13.200> see

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
miss these let's see if you could see

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679 
miss these let's see if you could see
them<00:01:13.530> there's<00:01:14.130> an<00:01:14.310> extra<00:01:14.640> shorting<00:01:15.150> contact

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
them there's an extra shorting contact

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.890 
them there's an extra shorting contact
here<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:17.460> takes<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> signal<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.420> ground<00:01:18.689> for

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
here it takes the signal to ground for

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.140 
here it takes the signal to ground for
the<00:01:18.960> jack<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.500> want<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.970> like

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the jack what you want to do I use like

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
the jack what you want to do I use like
a<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.390> kneel<00:01:21.689> file<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.280> between

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
a little kneel file and I get in between

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.140 
a little kneel file and I get in between
I<00:01:24.030> can't<00:01:24.720> hold<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> camera<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.710> this

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
I can't hold the camera and do this

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.580 
I can't hold the camera and do this
usually<00:01:27.150> use<00:01:27.450> two<00:01:27.600> hands<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.049> anyway<00:01:28.290> let's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
usually use two hands but anyway let's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
usually use two hands but anyway let's
see<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.340> hand<00:01:30.020> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
see if I can do this with one hand you

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.120 
see if I can do this with one hand you
stick<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.680> needle<00:01:31.979> file<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.700> between

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
stick the little needle file in between

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.560 
stick the little needle file in between
the<00:01:35.130> shorting<00:01:35.640> part<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> jack<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the shorting part of the jack and the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.240 
the shorting part of the jack and the
jack<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> want<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.890> just

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.569 
jack and what you want to do is just
make<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.790> couple<00:01:42.000> passes<00:01:42.329> real<00:01:42.930> quick<00:01:43.579> two

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
make a couple passes real quick two

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.160 
make a couple passes real quick two
passes<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.630> need<00:01:45.659> maybe

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
three and it cleans the oxidation that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
three and it cleans the oxidation that
builds<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.070> there<00:01:50.280> I've<00:01:50.759> had<00:01:51.000> apps<00:01:51.240> over

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
builds up in there I've had apps over

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.920 
builds up in there I've had apps over
the<00:01:51.930> years<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.189> annoying

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
the years that just have this annoying

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.870 
the years that just have this annoying
frying<00:01:54.930> baking<00:01:55.350> sound<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.549> think<00:01:56.759> it's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
frying baking sound and you think it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.190 
frying baking sound and you think it's
the<00:01:57.000> circuit<00:01:57.329> board<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.049> some

the circuit board you think it's some

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
the circuit board you think it's some
caps<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.850> just<00:01:59.909> a

caps you think it's this and it's just a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.649 
caps you think it's this and it's just a
real<00:02:00.390> heavily<00:02:01.350> oxidized<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.520> little<00:02:03.299> shorting

real heavily oxidized a little shorting
part<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.049> jack<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.890> making

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
part of the jack that's just not making

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.319 
part of the jack that's just not making
a<00:02:05.219> good<00:02:05.430> ground<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.880> you're<00:02:05.969> hearing<00:02:06.149> all

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
a good ground and you're hearing all

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.639 
a good ground and you're hearing all
this<00:02:06.450> crazy<00:02:06.750> noise<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.290> wonder<00:02:07.500> where

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
this crazy noise and you wonder where

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.359 
this crazy noise and you wonder where
it's<00:02:07.770> coming<00:02:07.950> from

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it's coming from

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.800 
it's coming from
that's<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:09.000> thing<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.360> should<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:09.629> look

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that's one thing you should really look

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.630 
that's one thing you should really look
at<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.560> any<00:02:10.739> time<00:02:10.920> you're<00:02:11.039> cleaning<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:11.430> Jack

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
at so any time you're cleaning your Jack

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.290 
at so any time you're cleaning your Jack
should<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:11.879> your<00:02:12.000> chassis<00:02:12.390> open

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
should have your chassis open

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.730 
should have your chassis open
obviously<00:02:13.750> you're<00:02:13.900> being<00:02:14.080> safe<00:02:14.290> you're<00:02:14.500> being

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
obviously you're being safe you're being

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.360 
obviously you're being safe you're being
careful<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.190> everything<00:02:15.520> but<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:18.190> this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
careful and everything but do this

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.950 
careful and everything but do this
little<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.940> little<00:02:19.000> maneuver<00:02:19.360> right<00:02:19.750> here

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
little this little maneuver right here

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.600 
little this little maneuver right here
which<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.200> little<00:02:20.380> needle<00:02:20.620> file<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.520> get

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
which a little needle file so I can get

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.810 
which a little needle file so I can get
a<00:02:21.640> better<00:02:21.760> angle<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:23.200> you're<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.920> couple

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
a better angle and you're just a couple

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.080 
a better angle and you're just a couple
two<00:02:25.060> or<00:02:25.150> three<00:02:25.300> passes<00:02:26.490> it's<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.550> very<00:02:27.790> fine

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
two or three passes it's a very fine

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.610 
two or three passes it's a very fine
file<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.690> I'm<00:02:28.780> not<00:02:28.900> really<00:02:29.020> taking<00:02:29.200> off<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.470> lot

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
file so I'm not really taking off a lot

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.650 
file so I'm not really taking off a lot
of<00:02:29.650> metal<00:02:29.980> you're<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.420> like<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.510> said

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
of metal you're just like I said

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.600 
of metal you're just like I said
breaking<00:02:32.050> up<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.320> oxidation<00:02:32.800> that's<00:02:33.340> really

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
breaking up that oxidation that's really

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.130 
breaking up that oxidation that's really
it<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.270> little<00:02:34.480> amp<00:02:34.660> ASI<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.800> tip<00:02:37.140> and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
it it's a little amp ASI and a tip and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.890 
it it's a little amp ASI and a tip and
that's<00:02:38.230> really<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:41.700> 67<00:02:42.700> super<00:02:43.090> reverb<00:02:43.240> chassis

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
that's really it 67 super reverb chassis

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.570 
that's really it 67 super reverb chassis
amp<00:02:44.500> actually<00:02:44.800> sounds<00:02:45.010> pretty<00:02:45.190> darn<00:02:45.400> good
