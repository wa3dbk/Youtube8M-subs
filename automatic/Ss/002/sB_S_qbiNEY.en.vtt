00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
repeat the heroics of 2003 I think it'll

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.850 
repeat the heroics of 2003 I think it'll
be<00:00:35.910> closer<00:00:36.120> than<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.540> people<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:37.079> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
be closer than what people think you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.709 
be closer than what people think you
know<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.070> England<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.520> attack<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
know if England can attack the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.010 
know if England can attack the
Australian<00:00:40.500> forwards<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.220> also<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.630> know<00:00:42.780> be

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
Australian forwards and also you know be

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.400 
Australian forwards and also you know be
more<00:00:43.200> aggressive<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.770> defense<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:45.060> they've

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
more aggressive in defense now they've

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
more aggressive in defense now they've
eco<00:00:46.410> turbulent<00:00:46.920> i<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.400> i<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
eco turbulent i think that i think the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.180 
eco turbulent i think that i think the
13-point<00:00:48.690> start<00:00:49.020> isn't<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.380> probably<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
13-point start isn't it probably that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
13-point start isn't it probably that
they<00:00:50.310> have<00:00:50.490> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.720> with<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.990> it's<00:00:52.530> i

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
they have so you know with that it's i

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
they have so you know with that it's i
think<00:00:53.970> they<00:00:54.060> might<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.420> could<00:00:54.600> go<00:00:54.750> within

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
think they might they could go within

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.250 
think they might they could go within
that<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.530> honest<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.630> that<00:00:57.630> battle<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that to be honest and that battle of the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
that to be honest and that battle of the
center's<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> moment<00:00:59.040> of<00:00:59.130> course<00:00:59.280> Farrell<00:00:59.610> is
