00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
actually liking these let's take a look

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.420 
actually liking these let's take a look
at<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.670> cover

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
at the back cover

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.500 
at the back cover
these<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.730> region<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.870> region<00:01:04.500> B<00:01:05.510> this

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
these are region a and region B this

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.480 
these are region a and region B this
does<00:01:06.840> contain<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> three<00:01:07.619> versions<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.159> audio

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
does contain the three versions of audio

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
does contain the three versions of audio
if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> focus<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.340> other

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
if you can get a focus on here the other

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.060 
if you can get a focus on here the other
reason<00:01:11.760> I'm<00:01:11.880> doing<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.470> have

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
reason I'm doing this is because I have

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.670 
reason I'm doing this is because I have
a<00:01:14.100> new<00:01:14.280> camera<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.320> testing<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:16.979> out

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
a new camera and I'm just testing it out

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.740 
a new camera and I'm just testing it out
the<00:01:19.680> outside<00:01:20.159> slipcover<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.240> same<00:01:21.479> thing

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the outside slipcover is the same thing

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.969 
the outside slipcover is the same thing
as<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.290> inside<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> case

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.370 

opening<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:33.920> here<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.400> inside

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
opening it up here we have on the inside

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.950 
opening it up here we have on the inside
it's<00:01:37.380> basically<00:01:38.010> Dragon<00:01:38.670> Ball<00:01:38.790> Z<00:01:38.970> blu-ray<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it's basically Dragon Ball Z blu-ray and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.770 
it's basically Dragon Ball Z blu-ray and
it<00:01:40.770> has<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> episode<00:01:41.640> list<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.390> episode

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it has the episode list the episode

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.010 
it has the episode list the episode
guide<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:44.400> discs<00:01:44.940> are<00:01:45.150> actually

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
guide there the discs are actually

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.920 
guide there the discs are actually
pretty<00:01:46.759> simplistic<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.240> basic<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:48.899> is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
pretty simplistic and basic which is

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.109 
pretty simplistic and basic which is
fine<00:01:49.440> I<00:01:50.930> think<00:01:51.930> they<00:01:52.020> look<00:01:52.200> good<00:01:52.970> could<00:01:53.970> be

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
fine I think they look good could be

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.050 
fine I think they look good could be
better<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:55.350> they're<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.070> bad<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.759> could<00:01:56.940> be

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
better but they're not bad they could be

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
better but they're not bad they could be
worse<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.970> see<00:02:00.180> how<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.200> case<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
worse as you can see how the case is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.880 
worse as you can see how the case is
line<00:02:02.009> up<00:02:02.220> there<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> show<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.179> picture<00:02:03.890> that's

just<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.970> quick<00:03:19.180> comparison<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:20.560> only<00:03:20.920> has

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
just a quick comparison this only has

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.600 
just a quick comparison this only has
the<00:03:21.489> first<00:03:22.020> this<00:03:23.020> only<00:03:23.530> has<00:03:23.680> like<00:03:23.770> I<00:03:23.980> think<00:03:24.250> 17

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
the first this only has like I think 17

region<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.730> B<00:03:27.940> as<00:03:28.060> well<00:03:28.300> I<00:03:29.400> would<00:03:30.400> not

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
region a and B as well I would not

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.310 
region a and B as well I would not
recommend<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:31.150> buy<00:03:31.270> these<00:03:31.330> because<00:03:31.750> as<00:03:31.959> you

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
recommend to buy these because as you

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.410 
recommend to buy these because as you
know<00:03:32.440> they<00:03:32.620> stopped<00:03:33.010> making<00:03:33.910> these<00:03:34.060> but<00:03:34.300> I'm

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
know they stopped making these but I'm

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.300 
know they stopped making these but I'm
just<00:03:34.630> comparing<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.350> just<00:03:35.620> for<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:36.070> sake<00:03:36.280> of

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
just comparing it just for the sake of

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.420 
just comparing it just for the sake of
it<00:03:36.520> because<00:03:37.360> first<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.470> all<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.680> discs<00:03:38.980> are<00:03:39.250> is

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430

a<00:04:47.140> few<00:04:47.350> finger<00:04:47.650> prints<00:04:47.860> on<00:04:48.010> there<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.400> can

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
a few finger prints on there that I can

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.300 
a few finger prints on there that I can
see<00:04:48.729> looking<00:04:49.510> at<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.900> discs<00:04:50.349> I<00:04:50.530> really<00:04:51.160> like

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
see looking at the discs I really like

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.190 
see looking at the discs I really like
the<00:04:51.430> way<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.030> unfolds<00:04:52.690> like<00:04:52.750> this<00:04:53.020> of

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
the way that this unfolds like this of

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.330 
the way that this unfolds like this of
course<00:04:53.410> you're<00:04:53.560> not<00:04:53.680> going<00:04:53.890> to<00:04:53.979> get

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
course you're not going to get

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.150 
course you're not going to get
the<00:04:54.790> opportunity<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.930> have<00:04:56.170> this<00:04:56.740> sort<00:04:57.040> of

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
the opportunity to have this sort of

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.830 
the opportunity to have this sort of
setup<00:04:57.490> with<00:04:57.730> a<00:04:57.760> blue<00:04:58.030> race<00:04:58.240> because<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.690> blue

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
setup with a blue race because the blue

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.540 
setup with a blue race because the blue
race<00:04:58.990> simply<00:04:59.410> contains<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.100> many<00:05:00.190> episodes

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
race simply contains so many episodes

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.100 
race simply contains so many episodes
per<00:05:00.910> disc<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.600> having<00:05:02.500> a<00:05:02.590> big<00:05:02.770> fold-out<00:05:04.110> case

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
per disc that having a big fold-out case

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.600 
per disc that having a big fold-out case
like<00:05:05.350> this<00:05:05.530> is<00:05:05.710> unnecessary

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
like this is unnecessary

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.390 
like this is unnecessary
