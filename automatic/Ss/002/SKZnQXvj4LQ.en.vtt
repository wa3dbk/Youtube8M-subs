00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.800
 hand Vlad puts on not two players and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.839
 I really like one of the best in my 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.060
 the look i ever played 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.670

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.460
 gold and so now I think Vlad is not 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.539
 throw an invite and start to see what kind of 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.359

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.450
 players and singing 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.559
 well, there are only three players from belgium 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.059
 pluses stick but with personnel 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.399
 I don't know what else to say well I don't know 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.850
 the match will show as always so let's start 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.920
 drove 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.050
 I personally could not give you any further 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.629
 the ball remained with me cast on the oder 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.610
 Peter Drink a blow under the hammer aya-yay 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.190
 cool moment was unfortunately 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.110
 it turned out to score now cast oh 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.829
 cool cast and now I can do 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.270
 I think do-do oh-oh-oh what a pass was 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.609
 until immediately be able to select 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.400
 and I get them diapers maybe 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.380
 dangerous and by we shall still go 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.659
 play here and she needs to beat van percy 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.030
 beats blocking defenders goalkeeper which 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.890
 Safe is good Raphael head serves small 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.650
 Raoul Albiol score who's hitting the goal 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.229
 great the bride is scoring from napoli 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.080
 quarterback 10 a great start thought so 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.720
 anyway this time and forgot scoring 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.610
 first about her here judge helped me now 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.990
 my attack need to beat draxler punch 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.079
 drakslera but someone puts on Rodrigue and 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.259
 turn around to rodrigo runs about 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.960
 or head than to be no misses the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.869
 I can now punish her for this 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.630
 the player of the opponent depay shift to the center 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.720
 there still opens on no hit declare 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.329
 blow fact de mouth scores all the same 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.299
 naked damn on the counterattack caught me not 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.520
 all not all such players returned well 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.130
 what's my scheme okay 11 45 minutes and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.119
 again you are not shifted to the center and blows 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.670
 near the barbell 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.540
 oh passes the cast on van percy up 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.430
 pass 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.790
 request for van persie should go out 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.930
 fine now cast will go to good 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.630
 not it will be ass 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.310
 so good does not go blow is not strong but 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:24.060
 my goalie everything looks great that's where i go 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.420
 turf picking perfect order hit hit 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.170
 go oh oh to center center score punches 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.730
 goal second goal head and he scores but 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.650
 here I did not want to hang up just like that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.140
 that the goalkeepers came out and I just left 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.780
 pass to the center on horseback and and score 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.430
 great 21 but then the game does not break through 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.410
 it turned out blocked and here the goalkeeper 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.209
 left and bottom left eyes can be 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.790
 too late let him score I don't see 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.680
 the difference from one but then one bothers him 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.790
 it is necessary to shift to the center until it is clogged 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.040
 score a blow 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.170
 and I am the goalkeeper; the advice is players there 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.500
 almost head to center to center and 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.190
 terk head great beat draxler goal 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.989
 excellent 31 and this diet drops left mid 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.670
 excellent free kick first abandoned there 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.760
 goes head cool ferried indigo 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.010
 cappella but degas drops scored 31 i think 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.750
 I will not miss two goals in these five minutes 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.610
 or for how many there are three minutes so i 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.769
 I think I won this match the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.300
 player and order shifted runs away here 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.850
 picked up Rodrigo Rodrigo 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.220
 once again nayder this way to score grandfather not 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.209
 it turned out maybe woods with people and so 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.580
 the whole match is over 31 I won two 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.170
 Goal head but I think the situation is there 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.180
 there was no other way out though 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.739
 it was possible to think very well so 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.560
 great match anyway for me 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.290
 first victory in the camps and now i'm 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.989
 I will get a player and so I got on not 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.080
 after defeating lord stone i 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.480
 I hope this is not the last victory in my 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.890
 camps and think on this all if you
