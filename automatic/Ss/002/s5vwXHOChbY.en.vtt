00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
of double cream here I'm gonna put that

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.360 
of double cream here I'm gonna put that
straight<00:00:21.090> into<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.450> pan<00:00:22.100> you're<00:00:23.100> gonna<00:00:23.190> add

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 
straight into the pan you're gonna add

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.910 
straight into the pan you're gonna add
our<00:00:23.400> golden<00:00:23.820> caster<00:00:24.030> sugar<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.650> mean<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.770> goes

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
our golden caster sugar I mean it goes

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.630 
our golden caster sugar I mean it goes
all<00:00:26.310> over<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.000> goes<00:00:27.360> in<00:00:27.600> now<00:00:28.020> it's<00:00:28.200> the<00:00:28.290> butter

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
all over it goes in now it's the butter

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.620 
all over it goes in now it's the butter
so<00:00:29.640> we're<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:29.790> breaking<00:00:30.180> it<00:00:30.390> into<00:00:30.480> smaller

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
so we're just breaking it into smaller

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.900 
so we're just breaking it into smaller
pieces<00:00:30.990> why<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.590> we're<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> need<00:00:32.759> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
melon here yeah it's just quicker I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190 
melon here yeah it's just quicker I
think<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.820> yeah<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.810> right<00:00:36.900> let's<00:00:36.930> get

think that's it yeah all right let's get

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.990 
think that's it yeah all right let's get
two<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:37.620> okay<00:00:38.400> so<00:00:38.460> I'm<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:38.670> gonna<00:00:38.790> pop

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
two in there okay so I'm just gonna pop

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.160 
two in there okay so I'm just gonna pop
that<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> pan<00:00:39.630> slip<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.560> in<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> let's

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that into the pan slip it in so let's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.780 
that into the pan slip it in so let's
break<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> chocolate<00:00:43.560> in<00:00:43.950> we've<00:00:44.490> got<00:00:44.640> some

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
dark chocolate here and we're just gonna

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.840 
dark chocolate here and we're just gonna
break<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.650> again<00:00:46.739> into<00:00:46.980> smaller<00:00:47.280> pieces<00:00:47.489> just

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
break it again into smaller pieces just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.560 
break it again into smaller pieces just
to<00:00:47.910> help<00:00:48.060> it<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> melt<00:00:48.650> nice<00:00:49.650> dark<00:00:50.130> chocolate

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
to help it to melt nice dark chocolate

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.960 
to help it to melt nice dark chocolate
now<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.870> last<00:00:52.140> ingredient<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.970> liquid

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
now the last ingredient is liquid

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.310 
now the last ingredient is liquid
glucose<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.630> we<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.170> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
glucose and we know what the point of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
glucose and we know what the point of
this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> don't<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.090> it's<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.360> stop<00:00:57.660> those

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
this is don't we it's to stop those

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.750 
this is don't we it's to stop those
crystals<00:00:58.410> forming<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> making<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.640> all

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
crystals forming and making it all

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700 
crystals forming and making it all
grainy<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> help<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> food<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> stay

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
grainy is to help the food to stay

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.369 
grainy is to help the food to stay
really<00:01:02.010> nice<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.700> smooth

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
really nice and smooth

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.359 
really nice and smooth
go<00:01:04.610> right<00:01:05.610> let's<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.569> onto<00:01:06.749> the<00:01:06.840> hub<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.369> at

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
go right let's get it onto the hub so at

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.999 
go right let's get it onto the hub so at
this<00:01:08.579> point<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.240> stir<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.810> me<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.889> what

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
this point you can stir for me so what

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:11.899 
this point you can stir for me so what
we're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.249> do<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.429> we're<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.609> to<00:01:11.670> heat

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
we're going to do is we're going to heat

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.330 
we're going to do is we're going to heat
it<00:01:11.939> very<00:01:12.359> gently<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it very gently and that's just so the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.669 
it very gently and that's just so the
sugar<00:01:14.630> dissolves<00:01:15.630> while<00:01:16.289> we're<00:01:16.439> doing<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
sugar dissolves while we're doing that

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.660 
sugar dissolves while we're doing that
we're<00:01:16.859> gonna<00:01:16.920> oil<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.490> him<00:01:17.869> put<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.079> all<00:01:19.439> over

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
we're gonna oil out him put it all over

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.929 
we're gonna oil out him put it all over
the<00:01:20.670> 10th<00:01:20.969> even<00:01:21.719> on<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.079> sides<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.639> you

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the 10th even on the sides and get you

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.570 
the 10th even on the sides and get you
and<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.229> corners<00:01:25.679> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.039> 10th

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.120 

this<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.480> still<00:01:29.900> from<00:01:30.140> very<00:01:30.470> very<00:01:30.560> fine

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
this is still from very very fine

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.580 
this is still from very very fine
crystals<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.820> there<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:33.110> we<00:01:33.290> don't<00:01:33.470> want

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
crystals in there and we don't want

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.160 
crystals in there and we don't want
crystals<00:01:33.980> in<00:01:34.070> our<00:01:34.190> first<00:01:34.460> doing<00:01:34.810> we<00:01:35.810> want<00:01:35.900> nice

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
crystals in our first doing we want nice

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.190 
crystals in our first doing we want nice
smooth<00:01:36.650> well<00:01:37.010> mixed<00:01:37.460> foot<00:01:37.790> ready<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:38.870> think

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200

we're ready yeah okay so you've got the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.250 
we're ready yeah okay so you've got the
thermometer<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.780> we're<00:01:44.870> going<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.020> put<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
thermometer so we're going to put the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.900 
thermometer so we're going to put the
thermometer<00:01:45.470> in<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.010> this<00:01:46.220> is<00:01:46.430> a<00:01:46.460> stage<00:01:46.760> at

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
thermometer in and this is a stage at

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.370 
thermometer in and this is a stage at
which<00:01:47.000> Fabio<00:01:47.390> has<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.660> step<00:01:47.870> away<00:01:48.020> from<00:01:48.170> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
which Fabio has to step away from the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.510
