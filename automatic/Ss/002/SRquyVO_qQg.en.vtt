prolong<00:02:46.790> were<00:02:46.910> maybe<00:02:47.150> not<00:02:47.269> as<00:02:47.600> thick<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.830> good

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
after I threw it up in this style and I

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.259 
after I threw it up in this style and I
just<00:03:54.260> took<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.739> curl<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.190> kind<00:03:55.549> of<00:03:55.639> wiggled

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
just took the curl and kind of wiggled

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.910 
just took the curl and kind of wiggled
it<00:03:56.450> down<00:03:57.139> to<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.859> end<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:59.630> kind<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.380> stuck<00:04:00.650> and

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
it down to the end and kind of stuck and

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.250 
it down to the end and kind of stuck and
so<00:04:01.400> same<00:04:01.639> there<00:04:01.880> now<00:04:02.389> of<00:04:02.600> course<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.989> will<00:04:03.079> come

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
so same there now of course it will come

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.370 
so same there now of course it will come
off<00:04:03.500> once<00:04:03.769> I<00:04:03.920> wash<00:04:04.220> my<00:04:04.400> hair<00:04:04.609> off<00:04:04.850> but<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:05.930> lasts

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
off once I wash my hair off but it lasts

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.500 
off once I wash my hair off but it lasts
for<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.829> day<00:04:07.040> kind<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:07.910> fooled<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.239> couple<00:04:08.449> of

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
for the day kind of fooled a couple of

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.879 
for the day kind of fooled a couple of
co-workers<00:04:08.720> they<00:04:09.199> actually<00:04:09.530> thought<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.829> I

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
co-workers they actually thought that I

co-workers they actually thought that I
did

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
did

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.260 
did
here<00:04:10.720> silver<00:04:11.710> which<00:04:12.310> wouldn't<00:04:12.880> be<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.030> bad<00:04:13.240> idea

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
here silver which wouldn't be a bad idea

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.270 
here silver which wouldn't be a bad idea
but<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.110> would<00:04:14.260> take<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.470> whole<00:04:14.770> lot<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:15.100> bleach

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
but it would take a whole lot of bleach

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.370 
but it would take a whole lot of bleach
to<00:04:15.730> get<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:16.510> way<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:18.480> until<00:04:19.480> me<00:04:19.810> ready<00:04:20.079> -

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
to get it this way so until me ready -

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.260 
to get it this way so until me ready -
until<00:04:21.100> me<00:04:21.190> being<00:04:21.370> ready<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.700> color<00:04:22.000> my<00:04:22.240> hair

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
until me being ready to color my hair

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.270 
until me being ready to color my hair
which<00:04:22.630> won't<00:04:22.870> be<00:04:22.960> right<00:04:23.350> now<00:04:23.530> it'll<00:04:23.830> be<00:04:23.860> when<00:04:24.250> I

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
which won't be right now it'll be when I

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.270 
which won't be right now it'll be when I
grow<00:04:24.700> my<00:04:24.850> hair<00:04:24.880> fully<00:04:25.330> out<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:26.050> at<00:04:26.560> least<00:04:26.740> sits

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
grow my hair fully out and at least sits

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.480 
grow my hair fully out and at least sits
about<00:04:27.750> this<00:04:28.750> way<00:04:29.200> with<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.920> being<00:04:30.130> curly

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
about this way with it being curly

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.860 
about this way with it being curly
that's<00:04:31.060> what<00:04:31.210> I'll<00:04:31.300> probably<00:04:31.390> ends<00:04:31.780> up

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
that's what I'll probably ends up

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.170 
that's what I'll probably ends up
calling<00:04:32.080> my<00:04:32.320> hair<00:04:32.560> but<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.310> won't<00:04:33.550> be<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:34.060> this

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
calling my hair but it won't be to this

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.910 
calling my hair but it won't be to this
color<00:04:34.540> because<00:04:34.810> that'll<00:04:35.380> take<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.590> lot<00:04:35.740> of

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
color because that'll take a lot of

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.360 
color because that'll take a lot of
bleach<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.400> I'm<00:04:36.460> assuming<00:04:37.830> yeah<00:04:38.830> anyway

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
bleach that I'm assuming yeah anyway

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.610 
bleach that I'm assuming yeah anyway
