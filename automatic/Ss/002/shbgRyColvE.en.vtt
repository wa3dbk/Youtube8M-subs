Kermit the frog here, and
this is a mystery box.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.890
You see, if anybody can guess
from the clues I give what is

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.140

Sometimes, we have to care about
the friends, especially

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.700
friends who love cookies,
friends who love cookies so

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.240
much they play silly guessing
games because maybe, maybe

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.682
just maybe a frog, a very
handsome frog who has cookie

00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:18.900
will give best, best friend
who no can live without

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.160
cookies, give that best
friend a cookie.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.290
But if friendship
mean nothing--

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.262
KERMIT: OK.

00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:30.210

COOKIE MONSTER: One
measly cookie?

00:02:35.286 --> 00:02:38.145
Speech like that deserves
at least five cookies.

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:39.480

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.260
