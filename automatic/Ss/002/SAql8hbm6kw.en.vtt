inch<00:01:27.110> piece<00:01:27.500> just<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.070> give<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.430> little

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
inch piece just to give you a little

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.600 
inch piece just to give you a little
wiggle<00:01:28.970> room<00:01:29.950> but<00:01:30.950> if<00:01:31.100> you're<00:01:31.280> real<00:01:31.430> careful

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
wiggle room but if you're real careful

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.210 
wiggle room but if you're real careful
you<00:01:31.910> can<00:01:32.090> do<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.930> then<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:33.950> want<00:01:34.160> to

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
you can do this and then you want to

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.279 
you can do this and then you want to
sandwich<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.910> now<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:35.330> probably<00:01:35.600> better<00:01:36.170> to

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
sandwich it now it's probably better to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.040 
sandwich it now it's probably better to
use<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.009> premium<00:01:37.280> crease<00:01:38.119> pads<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.780> mine

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.130 
are on order so don't have those so
we're<00:01:41.240> going<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.390> try<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.690> like<00:01:41.810> this

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
we're going to try it like this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.710

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
won't believe how how how easy this is

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.920 
won't believe how how how easy this is
it<00:02:55.980> creates<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.850> little<00:02:57.000> table<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.780> can

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
it creates a little table and you can

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.110 
it creates a little table and you can
see<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.320> here<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.830> my<00:02:59.070> frog<00:02:59.460> this<00:02:59.820> is<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
see that here on my frog this is the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.980 
see that here on my frog this is the
table<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.050> back<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.670> want<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.150> fold

table on the back and you want to fold

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.870 
table on the back and you want to fold
that<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.770> see<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.220> that's<00:03:05.400> sort<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
that you can see that that's sort of a

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.820 
that you can see that that's sort of a
valley<00:03:06.210> fold<00:03:08.600> just<00:03:09.600> fold<00:03:09.960> that<00:03:10.020> center<00:03:10.620> part

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
valley fold just fold that center part

valley fold just fold that center part
so<00:03:11.100> it's<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.370> valley<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.140> next<00:03:13.470> part<00:03:13.850> where

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
so it's a valley in this next part where

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.290 
so it's a valley in this next part where
the<00:03:15.090> little<00:03:15.710> deco<00:03:16.710> label<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.460> is<00:03:17.820> actually<00:03:18.270> a
