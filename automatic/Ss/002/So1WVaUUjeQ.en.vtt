looking<00:00:01.709> at<00:00:02.480> stony<00:00:03.480> with<00:00:03.659> Fisher<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.259> whoever

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
looking at stony with Fisher and whoever

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.089 
looking at stony with Fisher and whoever
one<00:00:04.830> second<00:00:05.310> line<00:00:06.620> well<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.680> think<00:00:07.740> that's<00:00:07.950> a

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
one second line well I think that's a

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.250 
one second line well I think that's a
natural<00:00:08.220> place<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.639> start<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.230> guy

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
natural place to start this is a guy

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.660 
natural place to start this is a guy
that<00:00:10.849> is<00:00:11.849> used<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.799> playing<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> top<00:00:14.400> six

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
that is used to playing in the top six

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.260 
that is used to playing in the top six
for<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:14.940> reason<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.379> acquire<00:00:17.270> wineries

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
for the reason we acquire wineries

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.849 
for the reason we acquire wineries
acquired<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.990> addresses<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.560> need<00:00:19.740> were

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
acquired the addresses that need were

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.470 
acquired the addresses that need were
talking<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.960> goal<00:00:21.960> scorer<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:23.480> so

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
talking about of a a goal scorer and so

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.609 
talking about of a a goal scorer and so
I<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> natural<00:00:26.130> place<00:00:27.619> frame

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
I think that's the natural place frame

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.810 
I think that's the natural place frame
to<00:00:28.740> start<00:00:29.039> end<00:00:29.869> you'll<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:31.130> in<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.340> quote

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
to start end you'll be in that quote

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.150 
to start end you'll be in that quote
unquote<00:00:32.969> mix<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.719> six<00:00:34.320> forwards<00:00:35.059> someplace<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
think it's a tremendous deal for us

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.170 
think it's a tremendous deal for us
going<00:01:28.619> ahead<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.549> lot<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.820> areas<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> lot

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
going ahead here in a lot of areas a lot

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.050 
going ahead here in a lot of areas a lot
of<00:01:30.390> ways<00:01:32.150> Commodore<00:01:33.150> equip<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.320> wait<00:01:34.619> oh

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
of ways Commodore equip it with wait oh

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
of ways Commodore equip it with wait oh
it's<00:01:36.060> probably<00:01:36.329> where<00:01:36.509> we'll<00:01:37.110> go<00:01:37.340> you'll<00:01:38.340> go

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it's probably where we'll go you'll go

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.830 
it's probably where we'll go you'll go
to<00:01:38.490> start<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.939> hand-picked<00:01:39.299> um<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:41.540> think<00:01:42.540> we

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
to start a hand-picked um I think we

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
to start a hand-picked um I think we
need<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.170> whether<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.340> weight<00:01:44.610> or<00:01:45.119> not

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
need it whether it's what weight or not

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.090 
need it whether it's what weight or not
to<00:01:45.509> leave<00:01:47.180> nothing<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:49.100> don't

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to leave nothing to do with I don't

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100 
to leave nothing to do with I don't
think<00:01:50.250> our<00:01:50.369> play<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.939> season<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.600> lately<00:01:51.869> or

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
think our play this season or lately or

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.000 
think our play this season or lately or
anything<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.470> we<00:01:52.920> wanted<00:01:53.280> amorphous

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
anything but we wanted amorphous

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.260 
anything but we wanted amorphous
presence<00:01:54.870> in<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.380> back<00:01:56.560> end<00:01:57.150> probably<00:01:58.150> away

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
presence in the back end probably away

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.050 
presence in the back end probably away
from<00:01:59.070> cilia<00:02:00.070> done<00:02:00.250> before<00:02:00.580> from<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.850> playoffs

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
last year in the finals and I think he

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.540 
last year in the finals and I think he
said<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.600> real<00:02:05.560> competitive<00:02:07.710> player<00:02:08.710> with<00:02:09.310> size

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.600 
said a real competitive player with size
and<00:02:10.080> we<00:02:11.080> said<00:02:11.320> last<00:02:11.500> year<00:02:11.710> after<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.250> playoffs

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and we said last year after the playoffs

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.470 
and we said last year after the playoffs
size<00:02:13.000> matters<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.690> we<00:02:13.810> go<00:02:14.730> bigger<00:02:15.730> pulls<00:02:16.270> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
size matters and we go bigger pulls and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.920 
size matters and we go bigger pulls and

can happen but i think being a couple
weeks<00:02:59.500> before<00:03:00.959> their<00:03:01.959> life<00:03:02.170> brian<00:03:02.530> said

weeks before their life brian said

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.000 
weeks before their life brian said
allows<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.010> couple<00:03:03.459> weeks<00:03:03.610> Marv<00:03:05.010> transition

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
and he said he didn't think he was

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.160 
and he said he didn't think he was
really<00:03:08.650> done<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.250> when<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.750> know<00:03:10.870> another

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
really done so when you know another

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.170 
really done so when you know another
edition<00:03:11.560> ur<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.800> comes<00:03:12.130> that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
edition ur to comes that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.630 
edition ur to comes that
that<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:14.680> gives<00:03:14.799> more<00:03:15.099> time<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:15.519> get

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
that just gives more time to get

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.970 
that just gives more time to get
together<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.329> think<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.719> team<00:03:16.930> sort<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.739> sends

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
together I think the team sort of sends

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.000 
together I think the team sort of sends
a<00:03:18.040> message<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.900> lead<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.079> size<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.469> fans<00:03:20.709> here

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
a message to lead the size of fans here

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.920 
a message to lead the size of fans here
that<00:03:21.189> were<00:03:21.790> serious<00:03:22.180> when<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.629> go<00:03:22.810> after

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
that were serious when you go after

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.380 
that were serious when you go after
Stanley<00:03:23.290> Cup<00:03:23.560> teams<00:03:24.430> every<00:03:24.760> year<00:03:24.939> for<00:03:25.120> players

Stanley Cup teams every year for players
that<00:03:25.629> are<00:03:25.719> guts<00:03:25.989> down<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.349> coverings<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:27.090> think

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
that are guts down and coverings I think

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.929 
that are guts down and coverings I think
the<00:03:28.209> message<00:03:28.359> is<00:03:28.599> clear<00:03:28.689> what<00:03:29.790> was<00:03:30.790> the

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
the message is clear what was the

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.959 
the message is clear what was the
