all<00:00:10.790> i<00:00:10.820> need<00:00:11.240> to<00:00:11.330> know<00:00:11.450> when<00:00:11.690> it<00:00:11.809> comes<00:00:11.990> to

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
all i need to know when it comes to

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.770 
all i need to know when it comes to
utilizing<00:00:13.549> some<00:00:13.940> of<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:14.059> analysis<00:00:14.570> tools

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
utilizing some of the analysis tools

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.170 
utilizing some of the analysis tools
inside<00:00:15.169> of<00:00:15.349> Autodesk<00:00:15.769> Inventor<00:00:15.860> I<00:00:16.280> simply

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
inside of Autodesk Inventor I simply

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.720 
inside of Autodesk Inventor I simply
want<00:00:17.450> to<00:00:17.570> know<00:00:17.810> will<00:00:18.590> it<00:00:18.770> break<00:00:19.010> before<00:00:19.370> this

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
want to know will it break before this

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.160 
want to know will it break before this
thing's<00:00:20.000> real<00:00:20.330> right

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
thing's real right

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.050 
thing's real right
just<00:00:21.710> think<00:00:21.980> about<00:00:22.160> in<00:00:22.280> the<00:00:22.340> context<00:00:22.790> of<00:00:22.880> how

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
just think about in the context of how

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.570 
just think about in the context of how
you<00:00:23.630> know<00:00:23.720> we<00:00:23.930> used<00:00:24.200> to<00:00:24.350> analyze<00:00:24.920> if<00:00:25.250> things

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
you know we used to analyze if things

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.060 
you know we used to analyze if things
were<00:00:25.760> going<00:00:26.030> to<00:00:26.180> break<00:00:26.450> we'd<00:00:26.780> build<00:00:27.620> physical

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
were going to break we'd build physical

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.310 
were going to break we'd build physical
prototypes<00:00:28.550> we'd<00:00:28.790> fire<00:00:29.000> them<00:00:29.210> up<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.600> you

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
prototypes we'd fire them up and you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.630 
prototypes we'd fire them up and you
know<00:00:30.440> hopefully<00:00:30.830> nobody<00:00:31.160> gets<00:00:31.190> hurt<00:00:31.490> in<00:00:31.610> the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
know hopefully nobody gets hurt in the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.380 
know hopefully nobody gets hurt in the
process

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
process

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.169 
process
whoops<00:00:33.350> here's<00:00:34.339> another<00:00:34.460> one<00:00:34.730> check<00:00:34.940> out<00:00:35.059> this

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:35.179 
whoops here's another one check out this

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.410 
whoops here's another one check out this
guy<00:00:36.129> luckily<00:00:37.129> I<00:00:37.370> can't<00:00:37.850> believe<00:00:38.030> that<00:00:38.059> person

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
guy luckily I can't believe that person

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.910 
guy luckily I can't believe that person
to<00:00:38.510> get<00:00:38.660> hit<00:00:38.839> in<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:38.960> head<00:00:39.170> but<00:00:39.679> nevertheless

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
to get hit in the head but nevertheless

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.709 
to get hit in the head but nevertheless
obviously<00:00:40.640> we<00:00:40.820> have<00:00:40.969> technology<00:00:41.570> today

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
obviously we have technology today

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.349 
obviously we have technology today
that's<00:00:42.050> going<00:00:42.199> to<00:00:42.289> allow<00:00:42.559> us<00:00:42.589> to<00:00:43.370> simulate<00:00:43.789> a

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
that's going to allow us to simulate a

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.110 
that's going to allow us to simulate a
lot<00:00:45.199> of<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.379> real<00:00:45.559> world<00:00:45.859> environments<00:00:46.519> so

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
lot of the real world environments so

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.759 
lot of the real world environments so
that<00:00:47.359> we<00:00:47.570> a<00:00:47.809> we<00:00:47.989> don't<00:00:48.079> have<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.379> build<00:00:48.620> this

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
that we a we don't have to build this

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.340 
that we a we don't have to build this
thing<00:00:48.829> first<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.519> be<00:00:49.749> nobody<00:00:50.749> gets<00:00:50.960> hurt<00:00:51.199> in

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
thing first and be nobody gets hurt in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.649 
thing first and be nobody gets hurt in
the<00:00:51.379> process<00:00:51.969> so<00:00:52.969> let's<00:00:53.149> go<00:00:53.269> ahead<00:00:53.359> and<00:00:53.480> create

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
the process so let's go ahead and create

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.450 
the process so let's go ahead and create
a<00:00:53.809> new<00:00:53.870> simulation<00:00:54.530> here<00:00:54.679> obviously<00:00:54.920> inside

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
a new simulation here obviously inside

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.099 
a new simulation here obviously inside
of<00:00:55.579> Autodesk<00:00:55.879> Inventor<00:00:55.999> Professional<00:00:56.749> I'm

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
of Autodesk Inventor Professional I'm

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.299 
of Autodesk Inventor Professional I'm
going<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:57.350> go<00:00:57.409> to<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.589> stress<00:00:57.829> analysis

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
going to go to the stress analysis

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.860 
going to go to the stress analysis
environment<00:00:58.579> I'm<00:00:58.969> simply<00:00:59.269> going<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.449> say<00:00:59.659> I

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
environment I'm simply going to say I

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.110 
environment I'm simply going to say I
want<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.440> create<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.800> new<00:01:00.949> simulation<00:01:01.190> to

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
want to create a new simulation to

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.750 
want to create a new simulation to
determine<00:01:02.780> if<00:01:03.170> it's<00:01:03.739> going<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.040> break<00:01:04.220> will<00:01:04.640> it

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
determine if it's going to break will it

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.640 
determine if it's going to break will it
break<00:01:04.940> right<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:05.930> if<00:01:06.050> we<00:01:06.170> take<00:01:06.260> a<00:01:06.320> look<00:01:06.470> at<00:01:06.590> the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
break right so if we take a look at the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.410 
break right so if we take a look at the
ribbon<00:01:06.920> bar<00:01:07.070> it's<00:01:07.310> really<00:01:07.670> easy<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.090> follow<00:01:08.240> if

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
ribbon bar it's really easy to follow if

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.580 
ribbon bar it's really easy to follow if
you<00:01:08.480> just<00:01:08.690> follow<00:01:08.840> things<00:01:09.170> from<00:01:09.350> left<00:01:09.530> to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
you just follow things from left to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.200 
you just follow things from left to
right<00:01:09.770> across<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.220> top<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:10.640> basically<00:01:11.000> tells

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
right across the top it basically tells

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.700 
right across the top it basically tells
you<00:01:11.330> what<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.630> do<00:01:11.780> now<00:01:12.320> I've<00:01:12.380> got<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.560> couple

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
you what to do now I've got a couple

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.830 
you what to do now I've got a couple
nylon<00:01:13.280> parts<00:01:13.670> in<00:01:13.790> here<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.420> don't<00:01:14.600> really

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
nylon parts in here and I don't really

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.990 
nylon parts in here and I don't really
need<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.140> use<00:01:15.410> include<00:01:16.190> those<00:01:16.430> in<00:01:16.490> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
need to use include those in the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.580 
need to use include those in the
simulation<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:17.840> just<00:01:17.990> find<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> parts

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
simulation so you just find the parts

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.740 
simulation so you just find the parts
right<00:01:18.770> click<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.190> say<00:01:19.340> ignore<00:01:20.000> during<00:01:20.660> the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
right click and say ignore during the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.380 
right click and say ignore during the
simulation<00:01:20.980> pretty<00:01:21.980> easy<00:01:22.160> right<00:01:22.460> now<00:01:22.670> the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
simulation pretty easy right now the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.550 
simulation pretty easy right now the
next<00:01:23.600> thing<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:23.810> need<00:01:23.870> to<00:01:24.080> do<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.290> figure<00:01:24.440> out

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
next thing I need to do is figure out

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.170 
next thing I need to do is figure out
where<00:01:24.830> my<00:01:24.980> constraints<00:01:25.490> are<00:01:25.610> where<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.000> this

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
where my constraints are where is this

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.110 
where my constraints are where is this
thing<00:01:26.240> being<00:01:26.840> supported<00:01:27.670> when<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:28.820> applied

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
thing being supported when it's applied

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.750 
thing being supported when it's applied
in<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.660> assembly<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:30.410> pretty<00:01:30.740> easy<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.670> know

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
in the assembly so pretty easy you know

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.130 
in the assembly so pretty easy you know
on<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.910> left<00:01:32.120> hand<00:01:32.330> side<00:01:32.570> on<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:32.900> right<00:01:33.020> hand

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
on the left hand side on the right hand

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.020 
on the left hand side on the right hand
side<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.740> I'll<00:01:33.860> go<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.220> choose<00:01:34.370> okay<00:01:34.760> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
side and I'll go and choose okay and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.360 
side and I'll go and choose okay and
then<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.080> next<00:01:36.110> thing<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.470> need<00:01:36.620> to<00:01:36.710> do<00:01:36.860> is<00:01:37.100> just

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
then the next thing I need to do is just

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.150 
then the next thing I need to do is just
determine<00:01:37.790> what<00:01:37.940> my<00:01:38.150> forces<00:01:38.600> are<00:01:39.100> there's<00:01:40.100> a

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
determine what my forces are there's a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.350 
determine what my forces are there's a
couple<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.400> different<00:01:40.610> ways<00:01:40.730> to<00:01:40.760> apply<00:01:41.120> these

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
couple of different ways to apply these

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.600 
couple of different ways to apply these
forces<00:01:41.890> obviously<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:42.980> have<00:01:43.070> force<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:43.490> have

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
forces obviously we have force we have

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.830 
forces obviously we have force we have
pressure<00:01:43.850> we<00:01:44.030> have<00:01:44.120> some<00:01:44.270> other<00:01:44.390> ways<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.600> do

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
pressure we have some other ways to do

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.420 
pressure we have some other ways to do
it<00:01:44.870> but<00:01:45.140> really<00:01:45.230> I<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:45.950> want<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.160> force

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
it but really I just want to force

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.580 
it but really I just want to force
applied<00:01:46.850> any<00:01:47.390> specific<00:01:47.930> direction<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:48.530> you

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
applied any specific direction so you

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.560 
applied any specific direction so you
see<00:01:48.770> I'm<00:01:48.860> going<00:01:49.010> to<00:01:49.070> use<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.340> option<00:01:49.700> for<00:01:49.940> use

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
see I'm going to use the option for use

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.800 
see I'm going to use the option for use
vector<00:01:51.140> components<00:01:52.120> if<00:01:53.120> any<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.510> you<00:01:53.630> have

vector components if any of you have

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.510 
vector components if any of you have
seen<00:01:53.990> Despicable<00:01:54.560> Me<00:01:54.590> you'll<00:01:55.010> never<00:01:55.220> think<00:01:55.460> a

seems<00:02:00.830> anyway<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.030> I'm<00:02:02.210> going<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.390> go<00:02:02.450> ahead

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510

and<00:02:02.810> change<00:02:03.110> my<00:02:03.350> vector<00:02:05.200> direction<00:02:06.200> for<00:02:06.470> these

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
and change my vector direction for these

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.039 
and change my vector direction for these

forces you know positive is going to

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.209

going<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.349> flip<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.619> around<00:02:09.679> negative<00:02:10.039> I'm

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:10.219 
going to flip it around negative I'm

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:11.020 
going to flip it around negative I'm
going<00:02:10.249> to<00:02:10.429> go<00:02:10.519> in<00:02:10.579> the<00:02:10.670> opposite<00:02:10.909> direction

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
going to go in the opposite direction

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.440 
going to go in the opposite direction
but<00:02:11.510> nevertheless<00:02:12.019> I<00:02:12.439> had

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
but nevertheless I had

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.990 
but nevertheless I had
you<00:02:13.750> know<00:02:13.840> 200<00:02:14.590> Newton's<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:15.190> down<00:02:15.400> 200

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
you know 200 Newton's going down 200

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.699 
you know 200 Newton's going down 200
Newton's<00:02:16.270> being<00:02:16.900> applied<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.440> direction

Newton's being applied in that direction

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.970 
Newton's being applied in that direction
and<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.310> simply<00:02:18.640> say<00:02:18.940> simulate<00:02:19.629> now<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.830> go

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
and I simply say simulate now you can go

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.979 
and I simply say simulate now you can go
in<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.370> control<00:02:22.180> some<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> mesh<00:02:22.599> settings

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
in and control some of the mesh settings

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.339 
in and control some of the mesh settings
and<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:24.370> know<00:02:24.459> kind<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.989> make<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.110> mesh<00:02:26.319> a

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
and you know kind of make the mesh a

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.449 
and you know kind of make the mesh a
little<00:02:26.650> bit<00:02:26.739> tighter<00:02:26.950> if<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.129> want<00:02:27.280> but

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
little bit tighter if you want but

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.280 
little bit tighter if you want but
really<00:02:27.610> if<00:02:27.819> all<00:02:28.390> you're<00:02:28.569> looking<00:02:28.599> to<00:02:28.959> figure

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
really if all you're looking to figure

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.540 
really if all you're looking to figure
out<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.920> will<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.880> thing<00:02:30.940> break<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:33.459> know

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
out is is will this thing break you know

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.000 
out is is will this thing break you know
just<00:02:33.880> apply<00:02:34.239> where<00:02:34.870> your<00:02:35.110> fixed<00:02:35.500> constraints

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
just apply where your fixed constraints

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.500 
just apply where your fixed constraints
are<00:02:36.160> where<00:02:36.430> your<00:02:36.550> forces<00:02:36.940> are<00:02:37.060> going<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.390> be

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
are where your forces are going to be

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.130 
now what the heck is von Mises stress
well<00:03:02.319> let's<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:03.459> look<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.760> up<00:03:03.819> real<00:03:04.060> quick

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
well let's just look it up real quick

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.470 
well let's just look it up real quick
see<00:03:05.140> because<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:06.370> know<00:03:06.459> if<00:03:06.700> this<00:03:07.030> is

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
see because you know if this is

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.819 
see because you know if this is
something<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.840> do<00:03:07.959> every<00:03:08.200> single<00:03:08.230> day<00:03:08.500> well

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
something you do every single day well

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.860 
something you do every single day well

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
von Mises yield criterion all right

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.140 
von Mises yield criterion all right
let's<00:03:11.049> check<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.319> out<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.370> basically<00:03:12.880> what

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
let's check this out so basically what

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.789 
let's check this out so basically what
it<00:03:13.239> what<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.480> says<00:03:13.810> is<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.290> yielding<00:03:14.650> of

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
it what it says is that the yielding of

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.030 
it what it says is that the yielding of
material<00:03:15.220> begins<00:03:15.610> when<00:03:15.940> ii<00:03:16.840> DVR<00:03:17.319> extras'<00:03:17.799> and

Mises<00:03:26.920> are<00:03:27.069> equivalent<00:03:27.549> basically<00:03:28.329> what<00:03:28.510> I'm

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
Mises are equivalent basically what I'm

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.050 
Mises are equivalent basically what I'm
looking<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:29.109> here<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.709> material<00:03:29.859> said<00:03:30.370> to

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
looking for here is the material said to

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.670 
looking for here is the material said to
be<00:03:31.150> yielding<00:03:31.630> when<00:03:32.079> it<00:03:32.170> reaches<00:03:32.530> this

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
be yielding when it reaches this

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.099 
be yielding when it reaches this
critical<00:03:33.190> point<00:03:33.430> node<00:03:33.819> as<00:03:34.329> yield<00:03:34.810> strength

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
critical point node as yield strength

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.830 
critical point node as yield strength
all<00:03:35.829> right<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.579> yield<00:03:36.790> point<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.359> material

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
all right so the yield point of material

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.500 
all right so the yield point of material
is<00:03:37.989> when<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.319> when<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.799> goes<00:03:39.400> beyond<00:03:39.940> its

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
is when it when it goes beyond its

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.750 
is when it when it goes beyond its
ability<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.319> go<00:03:41.769> back<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.310> where<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.609> was

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
ability to go back to where it was

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.890 
ability to go back to where it was
originally<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.769> easy<00:03:44.980> right<00:03:45.900> so

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
originally it's that easy right so

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.289 
originally it's that easy right so
there's<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.260> number<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.910> they<00:03:49.060> that

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
there's a number that that they that

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.030 
there's a number that that they that
they<00:03:49.450> apply<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:50.019> mega<00:03:50.230> Pascal's<00:03:50.769> right

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
they apply to that mega Pascal's right

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.150 
they apply to that mega Pascal's right
and<00:03:51.569> each<00:03:52.569> material<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.620> little<00:03:54.040> bit

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
and each material is a little bit

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.430 
and each material is a little bit
different<00:03:54.609> okay<00:03:55.299> so<00:03:55.359> now<00:03:55.870> I'm<00:03:55.989> going<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.200> stop

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
different okay so now I'm going to stop

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.900 
different okay so now I'm going to stop
now<00:03:56.470> I'm<00:03:56.769> going<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:56.980> check<00:03:57.160> out<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.579> see<00:03:57.730> what

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
now I'm going to check out and see what

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.150 
now I'm going to check out and see what
the<00:03:58.030> yield<00:03:58.239> strength<00:03:58.630> for<00:03:59.440> steel<00:03:59.709> is<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.099> I'll

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
the yield strength for steel is so I'll

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.349 
the yield strength for steel is so I'll
just<00:04:00.280> scroll<00:04:00.489> down<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.819> bottom<00:04:01.090> here<00:04:01.120> and

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
just scroll down to the bottom here and

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.699 
just scroll down to the bottom here and
you<00:04:01.420> can<00:04:01.569> find<00:04:01.780> these<00:04:01.930> charts<00:04:02.230> anywhere<00:04:02.530> right

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
you can find these charts anywhere right

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.120 
you can find these charts anywhere right
so<00:04:03.310> all<00:04:03.340> right<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:03.639> ASTM<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.569> 36<00:04:05.079> steel<00:04:05.349> yield

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
so all right so ASTM a 36 steel yield

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.009 
so all right so ASTM a 36 steel yield
strength<00:04:06.459> 250<00:04:07.090> mega<00:04:07.239> Pascal's<00:04:07.720> all<00:04:07.870> right

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
strength 250 mega Pascal's all right

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.710 
strength 250 mega Pascal's all right
cool<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.980> as<00:04:09.160> long<00:04:09.430> as<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.790> don't<00:04:09.849> exceed<00:04:10.480> that

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
cool so as long as I don't exceed that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.180 
cool so as long as I don't exceed that
guess<00:04:11.349> what<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.980> won't<00:04:12.310> break<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:14.019> know<00:04:14.139> in<00:04:14.680> in

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
guess what it won't break you know in in

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.060 
guess what it won't break you know in in
the<00:04:15.310> most<00:04:15.489> general<00:04:16.060> sense<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:17.650> terms<00:04:17.889> here

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
the most general sense of the terms here

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.710 
the most general sense of the terms here
now<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.250> know<00:04:18.729> I'm<00:04:19.030> going<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.239> get<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.419> bunch<00:04:19.630> of

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
now I know I'm going to get a bunch of

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.839 
now I know I'm going to get a bunch of
people<00:04:20.019> come<00:04:20.169> on<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.530> say<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.430> know<00:04:21.549> Rob

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
people come on and say you know Rob

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.250 
people come on and say you know Rob
there<00:04:22.180> there<00:04:22.450> are<00:04:22.510> other<00:04:22.599> factors<00:04:23.140> to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
there there are other factors to

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.719 
there there are other factors to
consider<00:04:23.289> here<00:04:23.770> but<00:04:23.950> when<00:04:24.099> you're<00:04:24.220> in<00:04:24.370> early

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
consider here but when you're in early

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.330 
consider here but when you're in early
design<00:04:25.120> phase<00:04:25.289> when<00:04:26.289> you<00:04:26.409> simply<00:04:26.830> want<00:04:27.070> to

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
design phase when you simply want to

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.770 
design phase when you simply want to
whether<00:04:27.610> or<00:04:27.790> not<00:04:27.880> you're<00:04:28.060> going<00:04:28.419> down<00:04:28.600> the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
whether or not you're going down the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.659 
whether or not you're going down the
right<00:04:28.930> path<00:04:29.200> based<00:04:29.620> upon<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.190> stresses<00:04:30.639> that

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
right path based upon the stresses that

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.370 
right path based upon the stresses that
are<00:04:30.850> going<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.150> be<00:04:31.240> applied<00:04:31.510> for<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.050> think

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
are going to be applied for it I think

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.560 
are going to be applied for it I think
this<00:04:32.470> is<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.620> great<00:04:33.010> way<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.580> determine<00:04:34.389> whether

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
this is a great way to determine whether

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.070 
this is a great way to determine whether
or<00:04:34.690> not<00:04:34.980> it's<00:04:35.980> going<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.190> break<00:04:36.570> okay<00:04:37.600> so

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
or not it's going to break okay so

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.420 
or not it's going to break okay so
there's<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.320> couple<00:04:38.440> other<00:04:38.650> things<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:38.980> can<00:04:39.310> go

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
there's a couple other things you can go

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.100 
there's a couple other things you can go
through<00:04:39.730> obviously<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:40.750> can<00:04:40.900> check

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
through obviously you can you can check

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.710 
through obviously you can you can check
out<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.560> safety<00:04:41.980> factor<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:43.330> maximum

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
out the the safety factor the maximum

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.409 
out the the safety factor the maximum
displacement<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.500> mean<00:04:44.620> those<00:04:45.180> safety<00:04:46.180> factor

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
displacement I mean those safety factor

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.790 
displacement I mean those safety factor
maximum<00:04:46.960> displacement<00:04:47.290> those<00:04:47.560> are<00:04:47.680> pretty

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
maximum displacement those are pretty

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.129 
maximum displacement those are pretty
self-explanatory<00:04:48.570> but<00:04:49.570> I<00:04:49.630> can<00:04:49.840> also<00:04:49.960> go

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
self-explanatory but I can also go

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.129 
self-explanatory but I can also go
through<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.800> say<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.490> know<00:04:51.610> I'm<00:04:51.990> no<00:04:52.990> expert

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139

here when it comes to analysis and you

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.760 
here when it comes to analysis and you
know<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.810> really<00:04:56.080> want<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.350> maybe<00:04:56.470> take<00:04:56.740> that

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770

your you know design analysis but you
know<00:05:19.240> nevertheless<00:05:19.479> it<00:05:19.840> creates<00:05:20.500> all<00:05:20.650> the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
those little snapshots of the screen so

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.640 
those little snapshots of the screen so
that<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.090> can<00:05:31.240> not<00:05:31.840> only<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:32.260> read<00:05:32.500> the

based upon this configuration it's not
going<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:45.280> break<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:45.669> you<00:05:46.150> know<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.479> sure
