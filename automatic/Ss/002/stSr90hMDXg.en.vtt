00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.740
 hello I'm ala brito this video I will 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.360
 show you how one more works 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.820
 of those new resources that I had 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.430
 promised to make videos about the new 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.110
 features of the 2.66 plan and this video is 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.660
 which will be exactly on one of those 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.090
 new features that the dynamic topology 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.279
 within the area of ​​sculpture of the blender 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.289
 I just you already know everything about 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.939
 sculpture then I'll just just do 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.559
 a quick summary here about how it is that 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.989
 How does sculpture work? 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.420
 traditional process of sculpture here 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.000
 on the blog you add a victim here in the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 if the object that will be carved you 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.769
 put there in the sculpture mode and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.229
 eventually you put a modifier 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.309
 of the multi-resolution musician type by 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:53.799
 example just put here in go mode 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:59.110
 subdivide it sometimes I put it there 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:00.760
 a mutual one and there with the way of sculpture 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.650
 You go there and make your own 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.040
 sculptures here on the blog is this here was 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.010
 what did you do regularly and I 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.290
 say you no longer need to do the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.900
 multi resolution has an option now in 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.910
 banner that allows you to add 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.320
 dynamically all subdivisions ac 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.030
 that leaves your computer including 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.410
 much faster do you the more you 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.740
 do it here better your computer 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.480
 be quick and if I said that 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.220
 you do not need to add the multi 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.420
 multires resolution 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.600
 Can you do it here in a way? 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.430
 dynamic so I'm going to get this object 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.990
 that I did here you can get these 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.060
 concepts you have there about how it is 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.260
 which works the way of sculpture and play 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.260
 in the river place 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.030
 I was literally throwing it away in the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.030
 toilet 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.080
 It's now that I've played, let's do it. 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.520
 Now an object flew up to work here. 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.110
 with a bucket 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.130
 As you can see, you're a 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.590
 person of a perception so much more 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.390
 everything if you are a very cunning person 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.910
 in terms of perception will be to realize that 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.020
 this vat that has no division 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.820
 he only has here humble six phases 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.590
 so you can see over here 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.800
 a person with a perception of the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.810
 for these precise details. 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.550
 six faces only I will enter the mode 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.050
 and what do I do 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.660
 can do with the sculpture that there is 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.950
 absolutely nothing because sculpture 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.170
 depends on subdivision of 2.66 we have 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.180
 Here this feature called'm pole 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.980
 in this field, the pole that lies 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.980
 available in the toolbar 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.930
 and you can use here you can connect to 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.320
 dynamic topology with this option here 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.010
 call and denied the emec when you do 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.200
 that 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.320
 Look what happens when you move the mouse. 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.330
 here about an easy 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.040
 yes it is creating here the topology of 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.350
 Light dynamic way gets kind of ugly 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.700
 use 5 but some are some tracks 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.880
 triangular 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.370
 But he can sculpt here his 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.799
 3d model without the need of multi 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.260
 pray he is adding as he 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.709
 What are you doing then? 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.959
 example let change my wizard here 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:20.690
 For this blog blogger, I did not notice 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.140
 I 'm making a spine here in the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:30.739
 cube make another spine here in the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:33.079
 cube and note that it created the topology 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.090
 in a totally dynamic way in 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.150
 what I needed here for 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.600
 make this spine in the bucket 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.860
 Let's increase the front here and go. 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.860
 decrease radios 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.980
 Look, I made a spine here. 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.720
 lighter and with a little chocolate the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.590
 did not eat enough chocolate to keep this 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.090
 thorn 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.239
 so you have here for example the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.239
 possibility 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.989
 is that a scar is a father like oo 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.050
 blender achieves this technology 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:10.970
 dynamics add here as you go. 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.530
 new faces need new objects 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.050
 new subdivisions 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.630
 according to the edition you make in the 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.230
 object if you want to see this in action 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.470
 we can here carve it in the way 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.960
 wireframe you will understand well what 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.160
 does this tool it adds 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.290
 Here the subdivisions as you 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.190
 going back to work with a 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:43.120
 Editing Let's go here I just left 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:46.669
 humble 6 easy to 25 thousand 706 makes 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.990
 us to exclude that object that you 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:59.000
 You can work with it just click here 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:00.650
 on 1 x scale in y apply this 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.840
 scale against the avaí a person 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.830
 civilized you always apply scale and 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.080
 after you do this kind of 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.890
 transformation so as not to have problems 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.320
 then I'm going to enter here in the mode 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.990
 of sculpture 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.360
 let's connect the dynamic topology and 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.360
 how are you a lazy person you 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.700
 will connect or symmetry is lazy 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.919
 Why do not you want to do both sides? 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.630
 and who only carved one side and wants the 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:31.190
 another is already automatically exiting with 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.900
 the transformations I call it 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.690
 laziness 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.220
 so you can for example here in 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.650
 start doing a favor a cutlet 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.250
 that you will not even do a hair 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.250
 he suffers from baldness 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.300
 It's the middle hair if it were 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.140
 hair in the case is going to be hair 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.660
 he is so half-way because he 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.610
 believe that this one this character 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.920
 this particular citizen here not 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.920
 pass the chap then 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:18.450
 he has these aquino entries in the hair 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:21.950
 Let's get out of the sculpture module. 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.950
 I put right here says 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.000
 notice for example how you can 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:34.890
 create these details here in objects 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:42.420
 without the need to add elements 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:44.820
 such as multi has or under 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:49.430
 vigilance did you can do everything with 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:52.430
 the way of sculpture and everything 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.430
 symmetrical 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.480
 so this is it now you already know how it is 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.460
 the dynamic topology works here 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.320
 on the blog I hope you can use 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.820
 that you have understood how it is that 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.560
 it works, you can use it in your 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.540
 sculpture projects if you are 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.400
 cheer on doing some 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.590
 so I hope you enjoyed it, I hope 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.590
 that you have understood and until the next
