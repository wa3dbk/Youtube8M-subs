00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.590
 2014 a year for me is difficult but a lot 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.030
 ripening 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.650
 I think I got the end of the year 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.430
 many positive things 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.840
 at the moment it would theoretically be very 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.029
 negative 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.040
 I started the year with a very 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.010
 evident very clear 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.050
 already at the beginning of the year wins a competition 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.640
 valid international timetable in the 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.900
 chile and was actually a sequence of 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.210
 that I had been growing very physically 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.170
 feeling really really confident and 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.180
 really reach another level 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.280
 in the second competition of the year was 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.260
 a test in Spain six days at 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 fifth day of this competition suffers 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.710
 a small drop and I ended up knocking on the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.650
 my left knee ended up generating a 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.979
 which left me about seven 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.159
 days of Bahia then was was a first 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.740
 difficult moment of this season and that 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.350
 then broke the process a little 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.040
 evolution but I managed to keep 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.170
 level was as soon as the string expires 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.530
 plus a valid proof by calendar 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.530
 International 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.630
 then go back to chile again 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.650
 for the south of the games 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.970
 americans 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.770
 today I won the gold medal 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.530
 to Brazil 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.240
 I came back to Brazil again to 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.930
 the international cup generates tea where to see 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.790
 the three days and in the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.850
 I would arrive at what would be my first 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.590
 competition is the proof that people 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.450
 worked throughout the pre-season 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.740
 thinking as a great goal of the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.840
 first semester that was the championship 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.790
 pany that this year was 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.439
 performed in brazil 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.110
 the Pan American championship was perhaps 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.959
 one of the most difficult 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.250
 me as an athlete has a competition 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:15.160
 I got really into shape 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.960
 a great chance to be disputing the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.590
 victory 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.660
 and I really demonstrated it on the track 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.140
 during the competition but already in the first 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.560
 Back I started to have some problems 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.230
 mechanics a little further ahead the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.100
 team leads the race suffered a fall and 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.010
 then I had a tire bore that I had a 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.790
 problem in the UN exchange zone has 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.970
 mechanic where the supporter is 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.640
 the wheel was changed and generated a new 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.100
 problem was not a proof really 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.190
 very difficult where things went from 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.380
 well framed during 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.720
 all the competition and the result was 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.300
 very far from what was then 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.700
 first mechanical problem first day 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.360
 really difficult in the season that 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.709
 She shook her head a little at the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.290
 follow sequence to south africa 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.800
 where once again I had a bore of 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.580
 and that tire bore eventually caused 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.190
 a very strong fall where I had a 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.400
 dislocation in the ribs 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.200
 again a few more days of cycling 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.060
 I had to have a few more days of 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.100
 recovery was not a second small 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.940
 injury that I had during this year and a 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.549
 second mechanical problem to me 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.940
 impossible to edit by searching is the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.489
 result that I could do 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.739
 then it was a beginning of year where the 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.390
 evolutionary process that ended up 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.239
 very interrupted 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.060
 besides it was difficult for me as 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:56.760
 athlete is dealing with all situations 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.069
 and is skirting and keeping motivated 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.730
 is looking for evolution for a year 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.340
 but I think that was the point never 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.209
 matured during this period. 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.150
 season 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:14.250
 I then had another sequence of 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.230
 Problems is had one more problem in the 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.269
 second stage in the third stage of the cup 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.230
 world in the Czech Republic where I did 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.060
 my best performance in the championship 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.940
 also has one more 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.340
 tire that got me out of the fight for 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.669
 victory and I ended up losing the title of 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.979
 Brazilian champion and also in the 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.760
 world championship in Norway at the end 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.639
 of the year 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.200
 but it is also a positive point were 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.050
 seven wins 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.970
 by international ranking but the year 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.130
 closing as first in the ranking 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.960
 Brazilian is another year very well at 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.850
 international ranking this year closing 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.169
 in 21st place 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.990
 in 2003 I closed on the 15th 2014 in the 21st 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.450
 so a difficult year was 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.720
 an important brand for me and also 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.570
 to the nation that since these points are 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.740
 which determines a number of 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.640
 participants in major events 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:18.930
 international number of participants 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.289
 of the nation 2014 closed 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.960
 was a year of growing maturity 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:28.590
 it's a lot of experience to learn a lot with 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.229
 difficult moments and but I think the 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.300
 big time for me is mine 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.590
 transfer not here in fact 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.840
 'raising in the years 2015 2015 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.789
 initially it 's all work going on 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.280
 for the River Olympics 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:49.380
 and I think my biggest motivation with 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.660
 25 years old in Brazilian someone 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.389
 coming from a country no traditional 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.860
 in this modality is little traditional until 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.460
 in the Olympic sport 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.470
 In general, one is arriving at the 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.150
 higher than an athlete of the 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.249
 mode can arrive in one of the 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.009
 main team 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:12.259
 on board one of the best bikes 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:15.929
 along with perhaps one of the best 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:18.629
 teammates is integrating 

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:20.969
 11 a team of this feedback is really 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:23.419
 a big challenge for me but it is 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:26.369
 really a great motivation and 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.359
 I believe I will be able to explore all 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:31.709
 the margin of improvement it still has 

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:34.739
 I hope things go much more right in 

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:38.459
 2015 that the results will happen 

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:39.529
 is also on the tracks not only outside the 

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:43.099
 clues 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:46.499
 the entrance to the party house and yes 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:47.999
 demand a certain adaptation is a 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:51.299
 new material 

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:53.699
 is a way to manage the season 

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:57.749
 new new goals 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:07:00.119
 what was the main thing ceases to be the 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:03.089
 main for me now I have new 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:06.929
 new goals 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:09.809
 within this partnership, there is a year of 

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:12.209
 A lot of change for me is great. 

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:15.689
 It's easy that I'm going to be there. 

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:19.979
 working with professionals with the 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:22.499
 staff of the entire team itself is 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.269
 very first line so I believe 

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:27.179
 This will make my job much easier. 

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:29.539
 Life is more the first challenge is 

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:32.639
 fully integrated with the team 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:34.219
 adapted to changes such as the team 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:37.589
 how is the operation 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:38.789
 of the team and this demands some 

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:40.769
 time 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:43.019
 I hope it's as fast as possible. 

00:07:40.769 --> 00:07:46.559
 and from that moment I have 

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:49.409
 adapted to the new team the new people 

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:52.129
 Who will I be working with? 

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:56.849
 I think it has everything for evolution to be 

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:59.479
 gradual and very fast then I see 

00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:03.479
 the time now in the season to start and 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:05.519
 start fetching the results and see 

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:07.379
 how will this evolution be thinking 

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:09.509
 in 2016 

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:13.189
 I think it has everything to make it super right. 

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:13.189
 I'm really very motivated.
