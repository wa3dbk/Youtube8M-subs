input codes input a code doesn't work
and<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.670> code<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.450> found<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.170> put<00:01:14.240> just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and you get code not found and put just

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
and you get code not found and put just
a<00:01:15.360> default<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.259> know<00:01:16.439> most<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.220> you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
will try this and you get level 1 it

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
will try this and you get level 1 it
rewards<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> gives<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> first

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
level so yeah there is a code to get to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.520 
level so yeah there is a code to get to
a<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:31.110> debug<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.790> which<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> play<00:01:33.659> the

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
can't back out of so you have level one

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.050 
can't back out of so you have level one
which<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:54.459> brings<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.549> back<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.150> cutscene

which is brings you back to the cutscene
you<00:03:59.060> click<00:03:59.299> V<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.750> can<00:03:59.900> skip<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.920> cutscene<00:04:01.430> I

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
you click V you can skip the cutscene I

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.900 
you click V you can skip the cutscene I
think<00:04:02.239> you<00:04:02.690> can't<00:04:02.930> actually<00:04:03.079> ok<00:04:03.560> I'll<00:04:04.519> work<00:04:04.760> on

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
think you can't actually ok I'll work on

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.120 
think you can't actually ok I'll work on
that<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.480> could<00:04:05.660> Z<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.590> arrive<00:04:06.860> at<00:04:07.010> the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
that so you could Z you arrive at the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.300 
that so you could Z you arrive at the
level<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.670> this<00:04:07.730> is<00:04:07.880> what<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.540> basic<00:04:09.310> game

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
level and this is what a the basic game

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.830 
level and this is what a the basic game
would<00:04:11.000> be<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:12.519> or<00:04:13.519> one<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.420> one<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.690> the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
would be like or one of one of the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.110 
would be like or one of one of the
sections<00:04:15.110> is<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.560> point-and-click<00:04:16.549> kind<00:04:16.970> of

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
sections is a point-and-click kind of

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.659 
sections is a point-and-click kind of
but<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.390> use<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.720> controls<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:19.370> arrow<00:04:19.519> keys

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
but you use the controls the arrow keys

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.140 
but you use the controls the arrow keys
to<00:04:19.880> move<00:04:20.090> your<00:04:20.390> cursor<00:04:20.599> around<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:22.700> can't<00:04:22.970> go

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
to move your cursor around you can't go

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.510 
to move your cursor around you can't go
diagonally<00:04:23.810> because<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.260> code<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.860> don't<00:04:25.400> want

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
diagonally because the code I don't want

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.940 
diagonally because the code I don't want
to<00:04:25.669> be<00:04:25.789> too<00:04:25.940> complex

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
to be too complex

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.750 
to be too complex
and<00:04:27.950> as<00:04:28.280> for<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.770> dots<00:04:30.770> they<00:04:31.190> won't<00:04:31.370> be<00:04:31.550> there

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
and as for the dots they won't be there

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.230 
and as for the dots they won't be there
in<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.000> final<00:04:32.360> game<00:04:32.540> but<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:34.160> gives<00:04:34.970> me<00:04:35.090> a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
in the final game but it just gives me a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.120 
in the final game but it just gives me a
way<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.480> track<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.560> cursor<00:04:37.010> um<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.890> you<00:04:39.980> get

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
way to track the cursor um so you get

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.980 
way to track the cursor um so you get
that<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:41.000> can<00:04:41.210> click<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:42.020> now<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:43.990> box

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
um heads up the key

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.490 
um heads up the key
we'll<00:06:39.949> be<00:06:40.069> in<00:06:40.099> the<00:06:40.250> bricks<00:06:40.610> here<00:06:41.169> and<00:06:42.169> i'll<00:06:42.319> try

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
we'll be in the bricks here and i'll try

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.010 
we'll be in the bricks here and i'll try
and<00:06:42.680> make<00:06:42.770> their<00:06:42.919> bricks<00:06:43.159> less<00:06:43.430> obvious<00:06:44.020> maybe

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
and make their bricks less obvious maybe

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.200 
and make their bricks less obvious maybe
put<00:06:45.500> something<00:06:45.740> in<00:06:45.830> front<00:06:45.860> of<00:06:46.129> them<00:06:46.280> so<00:06:47.150> you

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
put something in front of them so you

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.529 
put something in front of them so you
can't<00:06:47.539> see<00:06:47.840> them<00:06:48.250> or<00:06:49.250> make<00:06:49.879> them<00:06:49.909> a<00:06:50.240> little

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
can't see them or make them a little

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:57.300 
can't see them or make them a little
darker<00:06:50.990> but<00:06:51.169> anyway<00:06:52.300> that's<00:06:53.500> version<00:06:55.270> 0.5

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
darker but anyway that's version 0.5

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.339 
darker but anyway that's version 0.5
like<00:06:58.310> I<00:06:58.580> you<00:06:59.389> can<00:06:59.569> see<00:06:59.719> I'm<00:07:00.020> in<00:07:01.569> the<00:07:02.569> process<00:07:02.870> of

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
like I you can see I'm in the process of

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.589 
like I you can see I'm in the process of
having<00:07:03.560> a<00:07:03.800> working<00:07:04.039> game<00:07:04.400> here<00:07:04.849> it's<00:07:05.180> not<00:07:05.360> the

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 
having a working game here it's not the

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.659 
having a working game here it's not the
best<00:07:05.990> ever<00:07:06.560> but<00:07:07.340> it's<00:07:07.550> something<00:07:08.710> and<00:07:09.710> I<00:07:10.189> can<00:07:10.580> I

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
best ever but it's something and I can I

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:11.800 
best ever but it's something and I can I
put<00:07:10.879> this<00:07:10.969> in<00:07:11.120> that<00:07:11.240> now<00:07:11.419> because<00:07:11.750> you

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
put this in that now because you

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.769 
put this in that now because you
probably<00:07:11.960> can<00:07:12.199> see<00:07:12.379> it<00:07:12.529> there's<00:07:12.830> a<00:07:12.919> watermark

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:13.779 
probably can see it there's a watermark
