00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
way to get level 30 so I've had a lot of

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.769 
way to get level 30 so I've had a lot of
characters<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.150> game<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.480> I've<00:00:21.630> been

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
characters in this game and I've been

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.179 
characters in this game and I've been
playing<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.109> game<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.350> about<00:00:22.710> two<00:00:22.920> years

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
playing this game for about two years

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.580 
playing this game for about two years
and<00:00:23.609> I've<00:00:24.119> learned<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.689> most<00:00:24.840> efficient<00:00:25.380> ways

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and I've learned the most efficient ways

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.320 
and I've learned the most efficient ways
to<00:00:25.980> get<00:00:26.160> through<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:28.189> lot<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.580> lot<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
to get through a lot of a lot of the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.560 
to get through a lot of a lot of the
missions<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> game<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:32.090> my<00:00:33.090> best<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
missions in the game and my best is

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.959 
missions in the game and my best is
actually<00:00:33.750> getting<00:00:34.110> level<00:00:34.469> 30<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.920> two<00:00:35.190> days<00:00:36.110> so

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
actually getting level 30 in two days so

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.080 
actually getting level 30 in two days so
I'm<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.719> showing<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.290> how<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:41.579> get

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I'm going to be showing you how to get

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
I'm going to be showing you how to get
level<00:00:42.420> 30<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.989> two<00:00:43.230> days<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:45.739> basically<00:00:48.110> it's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
level 30 in two days so basically it's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.080 
level 30 in two days so basically it's
going<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.739> easiest<00:00:53.070> most<00:00:53.579> efficient

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
going to be the easiest most efficient

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.630 
going to be the easiest most efficient
way<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:56.280> start<00:00:57.530> out<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.949> one

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
way to do it is to start out with one

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.729 
way to do it is to start out with one
mentor<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.440> or

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
mentor that you really that you like or

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.470 
mentor that you really that you like or
you<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> missions<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> get<00:01:03.300> from

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you like the missions that you get from

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260 
you like the missions that you get from
it<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.860> me<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.220> Superman<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.030> meta

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it so for me that was Superman the meta

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.200 
it so for me that was Superman the meta
mentor<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.710> every<00:01:11.640> character<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> I've

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
mentor and so every character that I've

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.660 
mentor and so every character that I've
made<00:01:12.450> I've<00:01:12.750> probably<00:01:13.320> made<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.799> twenty<00:01:14.640> or

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
made I've probably made like twenty or

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
made I've probably made like twenty or
thirty<00:01:15.060> some<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.540> them<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.810> deleted<00:01:16.229> really

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
thirty some of them I deleted really

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920 
thirty some of them I deleted really
early<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.009> stuff<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.850> I've<00:01:18.689> made<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
early on stuff like that but I've made a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.820 
early on stuff like that but I've made a
lot<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.259> characters<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.420> deleted<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.560> lot<00:01:22.740> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
lot of characters and deleted a lot of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.109 
lot of characters and deleted a lot of
them<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:25.040> most<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.640> make<00:01:26.939> them

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
them but for most of them I make them

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.200 
them but for most of them I make them
mentored<00:01:27.479> by<00:01:27.540> Superman<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
mentored by Superman because so that I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.260 
mentored by Superman because so that I
can<00:01:30.390> learn<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.840> missions<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:32.210> as<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
can learn the missions that you get as a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.940 
can learn the missions that you get as a
level<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.320> hero<00:01:35.159> mentored<00:01:35.640> by<00:01:35.700> Superman

level as a hero mentored by Superman

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.460 
level as a hero mentored by Superman
I<00:01:37.979> move<00:01:38.850> through<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.570> faster<00:01:40.079> than<00:01:40.140> here

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I move through much faster than here

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.170 
I move through much faster than here
than<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> villain<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.820> make

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
than I do as a villain because I make

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.840 
than I do as a villain because I make
more<00:01:42.450> heroes<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.740> I've<00:01:43.860> learned<00:01:44.100> more<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.640> how

basically my advice to you guys is to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.889 
basically my advice to you guys is to
choose<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:53.189> mentor<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.090> want<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.689> work

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
choose one mentor that you want to work

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.819 
choose one mentor that you want to work
on<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:57.299> every<00:01:58.049> time<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.409> make<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> new

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
on and every time you make a new

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.190 
on and every time you make a new
character<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.490> use<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.149> mentor<00:02:00.719> because

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
character just use that mentor because

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.780 
character just use that mentor because
you<00:02:01.680> will<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:03.140> you'll<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:05.040> may<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.399> kind

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
you will get you'll just it may be kind

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490 
you will get you'll just it may be kind
of<00:02:05.850> tedious<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.509> boring<00:02:06.750> because<00:02:07.229> you'll<00:02:07.380> be

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
of tedious and boring because you'll be

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
of tedious and boring because you'll be
doing<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> same<00:02:08.009> missions<00:02:08.399> over<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.819> over

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
doing the same missions over and over

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.760 
doing the same missions over and over
again<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.629> game<00:02:10.080> doesn't<00:02:10.289> start<00:02:10.500> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
again but the game doesn't start to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.229 
again but the game doesn't start to
level<00:02:11.039> 30<00:02:11.250> guys<00:02:11.459> so

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
level 30 guys so

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.089 
level 30 guys so
the<00:02:13.540> fun<00:02:13.719> doesn't<00:02:14.019> start<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.349> level<00:02:14.530> 30<00:02:14.799> so

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
the fun doesn't start to level 30 so

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.629 
the fun doesn't start to level 30 so
just<00:02:15.310> think<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.579> that<00:02:15.700> as<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> tutorial<00:02:16.299> and

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639 
just think of that as a tutorial and

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.390 
just think of that as a tutorial and
just<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.049> same<00:02:20.079> mission<00:02:20.739> you'll<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.219> doing

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
just do the same mission you'll be doing

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.470 
just do the same mission you'll be doing
the<00:02:21.489> same<00:02:21.519> missions<00:02:21.939> over<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.269> over<00:02:22.389> again

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the same missions over and over again

patterns you'll learn you'll learn where
the<00:02:34.420> most<00:02:34.629> where<00:02:35.260> important<00:02:35.680> things<00:02:35.889> are

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
the most where important things are

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.080 
the most where important things are
where<00:02:36.670> things<00:02:36.719> spawn<00:02:38.159> where<00:02:39.159> side<00:02:39.669> missions

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
where things spawn where side missions

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.209 
where things spawn where side missions
are<00:02:40.299> which<00:02:40.750> side<00:02:41.049> missions<00:02:41.439> to<00:02:41.620> choose<00:02:41.889> which

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
are which side missions to choose which

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.349 
are which side missions to choose which
will<00:02:42.489> are<00:02:42.790> actually<00:02:43.209> worth<00:02:43.419> the<00:02:43.530> work<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:46.060> so

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
will are actually worth the work and so

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.610 
will are actually worth the work and so
on<00:02:47.760> side<00:02:48.760> missions<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.329> big<00:02:49.629> big<00:02:50.109> part<00:02:50.409> of<00:02:50.500> it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
on side missions is a big big part of it

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.770 
on side missions is a big big part of it
for<00:02:50.650> me<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:53.099> mean<00:02:54.099> you<00:02:54.370> for<00:02:54.819> me<00:02:54.939> I<00:02:55.209> believe<00:02:55.750> that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
for me I mean you for me I believe that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.689 
for me I mean you for me I believe that
you<00:02:56.019> have<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.169> choose<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:57.069> right<00:02:57.280> side<00:02:57.519> which

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:57.699 
you have to choose the right side which

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.559 
you have to choose the right side which
is<00:02:57.849> some<00:02:58.389> of<00:02:58.480> them<00:02:58.599> are<00:02:58.870> bad<00:02:59.230> and<00:03:00.120> our<00:03:01.120> waste<00:03:01.329> of

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
is some of them are bad and our waste of

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.110 
is some of them are bad and our waste of
time<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.139> don't<00:03:02.260> get<00:03:02.469> it's<00:03:03.069> not<00:03:03.250> worth<00:03:03.400> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
time you don't get it's not worth the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.929 
time you don't get it's not worth the
work<00:03:04.329> but<00:03:05.290> some<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.590> them<00:03:05.709> are<00:03:05.859> super<00:03:06.400> easy<00:03:06.579> to

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
work but some of them are super easy to

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.339 
work but some of them are super easy to
do<00:03:07.060> or<00:03:07.239> some<00:03:07.449> of<00:03:07.540> them<00:03:07.629> you're<00:03:07.780> even<00:03:08.169> already
