system of chakras and today we'll take a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.310 
system of chakras and today we'll take a
look<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> system<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.689> acupuncture

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
look at the system of acupuncture

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.069 
look at the system of acupuncture
meridians<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> how<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:32.969> tie<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.840> both<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
meridians and how they tie into both the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.520 
meridians and how they tie into both the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
chakras and the energy bodies I've

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.920 
chakras and the energy bodies I've
always<00:00:37.800> found<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.340> curious<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:39.090> Chinese

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
always found it curious that Chinese

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.860 
always found it curious that Chinese
medicine<00:00:40.440> textbooks<00:00:41.040> ignore<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.180> subject<00:00:42.690> of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
medicine textbooks ignore the subject of

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.090 
medicine textbooks ignore the subject of
the<00:00:43.290> system<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.800> chakras<00:00:45.020> after<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.920> two

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the system of chakras after all the two

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400 
the system of chakras after all the two
systems<00:00:47.399> are<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:48.329> energy<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> human

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
systems are about energy in the human

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.130 
systems are about energy in the human
body<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.969> seems<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.660> should<00:00:51.960> be

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
body so it seems that they should be

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.979 
body so it seems that they should be
linked<00:00:52.379> together<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.090> that's<00:00:54.090> particularly

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
linked together and that's particularly

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709 
linked together and that's particularly
true<00:00:55.309> since<00:00:56.309> there's<00:00:56.579> an<00:00:56.760> important<00:00:57.270> point<00:00:57.510> in

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
true since there's an important point in

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.930 
true since there's an important point in
acupuncture<00:00:58.320> corresponding<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> each<00:00:59.550> chakra

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
acupuncture corresponding to each chakra

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.470 
acupuncture corresponding to each chakra
gate<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> body<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:02.149> believe<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.300> are

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
gate on the body I believe they are

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
gate on the body I believe they are
interconnected<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.470> I'll<00:01:04.979> discuss<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
interconnected and I'll discuss that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.420 
interconnected and I'll discuss that
later<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.210> video<00:01:06.439> but<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:07.830> i<00:01:08.130> want

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
later in this video but for now i want

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
later in this video but for now i want
to<00:01:08.520> discuss<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.360> acupuncture<00:01:09.960> meridians<00:01:12.590> at

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
to discuss the acupuncture meridians at

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
to discuss the acupuncture meridians at
the<00:01:13.830> outset<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.549> important<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> realize

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the outset it's important to realize

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.679 
the outset it's important to realize
that<00:01:15.659> Chinese<00:01:16.470> medicine<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.640> oldest<00:01:18.330> form

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that Chinese medicine is the oldest form

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.050 
that Chinese medicine is the oldest form
of<00:01:18.869> continuously<00:01:19.560> practiced<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.400> documented

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
of continuously practiced and documented

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.929 
of continuously practiced and documented
medicine<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.750> world<00:01:21.869> today<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.729> I<00:01:23.729> want

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
medicine in the world today and I want

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.700 
medicine in the world today and I want
to<00:01:24.000> emphasize<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.720> word<00:01:24.750> document<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
to emphasize the word document it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
to emphasize the word document it
because<00:01:26.610> there's<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> tendency<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.540> people<00:01:27.750> in

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
because there's a tendency for people in

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.260 
because there's a tendency for people in
the<00:01:28.259> West<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.680> discount<00:01:29.189> Chinese<00:01:29.640> medicine<00:01:30.150> as

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the West to discount Chinese medicine as

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
year but the problem is that there

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.349 
year but the problem is that there
aren't<00:02:46.799> enough<00:02:46.980> people<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.730> West<00:02:47.939> who<00:02:48.180> can

the natural harmony is disturbed so when

the natural harmony is disturbed so when

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
environment is disturbed then there is
