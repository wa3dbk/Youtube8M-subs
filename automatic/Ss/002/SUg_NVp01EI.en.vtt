so it's quite quite tiny and you make it
into<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.490> double<00:03:49.820> point<00:03:51.280> so<00:03:52.280> that's<00:03:52.490> the<00:03:52.730> shape

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
into a double point so that's the shape

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.340 
into a double point so that's the shape
you've<00:03:53.210> got<00:03:55.210> and<00:03:56.210> pop<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.510> down<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.690> second<00:03:57.200> I'm

gonna make a big hole you're gonna put
one<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.480> points<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:03.460> now<00:04:04.460> you<00:04:04.520> have<00:04:04.700> a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
one of the points in now you have a
