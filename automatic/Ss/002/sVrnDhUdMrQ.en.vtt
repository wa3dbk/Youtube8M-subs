00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
barbecue skewers a mason jar and I guess

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.970

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.570 
that's basically it so I just measured
the<00:04:45.370> little<00:04:46.139> wooden<00:04:47.139> skewer<00:04:47.560> things<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.250> make

the little wooden skewer things to make

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.830 
the little wooden skewer things to make
sure<00:04:48.730> they<00:04:48.880> were<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:49.030> good<00:04:49.300> height<00:04:49.540> for<00:04:49.570> the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
sure they were a good height for the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.990 
sure they were a good height for the
mason<00:04:50.169> jar<00:04:50.350> and<00:04:50.560> then<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:50.889> began<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.310> add<00:04:51.760> these

cute little hearts inside of the mason

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.920
