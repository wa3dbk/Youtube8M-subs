Pastor Mike and we have a question here

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.780 
Pastor Mike and we have a question here
which<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.680> sensitive<00:00:05.069> one<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.460> we<00:00:05.549> deal

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
which is in a sensitive one that we deal

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.299 
which is in a sensitive one that we deal
with<00:00:05.819> often<00:00:06.299> as<00:00:06.420> pastors<00:00:06.990> what<00:00:07.950> happens<00:00:08.189> to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
with often as pastors what happens to

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.339 
with often as pastors what happens to
babies<00:00:08.429> when<00:00:08.760> their<00:00:08.880> dies<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.450> that's<00:00:10.200> a

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
babies when their dies with the that's a

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.509 
babies when their dies with the that's a
hard<00:00:10.559> question<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.010> it'd<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.219> great<00:00:11.309> if<00:00:11.460> we

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
hard question and it'd be great if we

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.560 
hard question and it'd be great if we
could<00:00:11.610> point<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> verse<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.300> say<00:00:12.450> well

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
could point to a verse and say well

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.669 
could point to a verse and say well
here's<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.929> Bible<00:00:13.259> says<00:00:13.469> but

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
here's what the Bible says but

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.110 
here's what the Bible says but
unfortunately<00:00:14.219> that's<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.030> those

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
unfortunately that's one of those

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.550 
unfortunately that's one of those
questions<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.599> Bible<00:00:15.839> doesn't<00:00:15.960> specifically

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
questions the Bible doesn't specifically

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.840 
questions the Bible doesn't specifically
address<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.310> some<00:00:17.460> people<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.730> concerned

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
address and some people are concerned

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.510 
address and some people are concerned
about<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.390> because<00:00:18.539> if<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.960> read<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.500> Romans<00:00:20.250> 5

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
about it because if you read in Romans 5

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.429 
about it because if you read in Romans 5
for<00:00:20.820> instance<00:00:20.970> talking<00:00:21.510> about<00:00:21.750> how<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> sin

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
for instance talking about how the sin

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.920 
for instance talking about how the sin
of<00:00:22.470> Adam<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> consequence<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
of Adam then and the consequence of that

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.620 
of Adam then and the consequence of that
was<00:00:25.640> transmitted<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.939> rest<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.300> humanity

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
was transmitted to the rest of humanity

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.050 
was transmitted to the rest of humanity
right<00:00:28.260> people<00:00:28.980> say<00:00:29.189> well<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.880> what

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
right people say well you know what

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
right people say well you know what
where's<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.840> for<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> baby

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
where's the out for the baby

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.310 
where's the out for the baby
right<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.149> Psalm<00:00:33.270> 51<00:00:33.600> conceived

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
right you think it's Psalm 51 conceived

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
right you think it's Psalm 51 conceived
and<00:00:34.590> sin<00:00:34.800> those<00:00:35.040> types<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.430> things<00:00:35.610> right

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and sin those types of things right

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.670 
and sin those types of things right
right<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> here's<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> think<00:00:37.380> we

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
right and and here's what I think we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
right and and here's what I think we
need<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> note<00:00:38.160> particularly<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.090> look

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
need to note particularly when you look

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.450 
need to note particularly when you look
at<00:00:39.649> Romans<00:00:40.649> five<00:00:40.829> which<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.160> certainly<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
at Romans five which is certainly a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.060 
at Romans five which is certainly a
central<00:00:41.790> passage<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:43.079> text<00:00:43.649> talks<00:00:43.950> about

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
central passage that text talks about

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.740 
central passage that text talks about
the<00:00:44.340> consequence<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.129> sin<00:00:47.129> from<00:00:47.370> Adam

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
the consequence of that sin from Adam

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
the consequence of that sin from Adam
being<00:00:48.750> evident<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.200> death<00:00:49.739> death<00:00:50.160> spread<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
being evident in death death spread to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.020 
being evident in death death spread to
all<00:00:50.789> men<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.980> that's<00:00:53.760> true

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
all men and and that that is that's true

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
all men and and that that is that's true
it's<00:00:54.300> absolutely<00:00:54.809> true<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:56.070> why

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it's absolutely true but in that's why

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.450 
it's absolutely true but in that's why
babies<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.940> die<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:58.100> sin<00:00:59.100> has<00:00:59.219> entered

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
babies can die because sin has entered

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.240 
babies can die because sin has entered
the<00:00:59.579> world<00:00:59.789> through<00:01:00.180> Adam<00:01:00.359> now<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.739> question

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the world through Adam now the question

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
the world through Adam now the question
is<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> rest<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
is what do we see in the rest of the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
is what do we see in the rest of the
Bible<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.830> give<00:01:05.010> us<00:01:05.129> any<00:01:05.339> hints<00:01:05.760> about

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
Bible that would give us any hints about

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.580 
Bible that would give us any hints about
what<00:01:06.090> happens<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> baby<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.990> dies<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
what happens to a baby that dies and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
what happens to a baby that dies and
that's<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> real<00:01:08.520> important<00:01:08.909> question<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that's the real important question and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.940 
that's the real important question and
when<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.810> look<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.380> throughout<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
when you look at that throughout the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
when you look at that throughout the
Bible<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> find<00:01:11.430> often<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.270> children<00:01:13.020> are

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
Bible you find often that children are

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
Bible you find often that children are
not<00:01:13.619> held<00:01:14.070> accountable<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:15.060> way<00:01:15.180> their

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
not held accountable the way their

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
not held accountable the way their
parents<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.860> decisions<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.460> made

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
parents are for decisions that are made

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.830 
parents are for decisions that are made
I<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> wilderness<00:01:18.360> wandering

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
I think of the wilderness wandering

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
I think of the wilderness wandering
right<00:01:19.049> right<00:01:19.619> they<00:01:19.830> were<00:01:19.890> children<00:01:20.340> they

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
right right they were children they

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.640 
right right they were children they
didn't<00:01:21.299> make<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.840> decisions<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.500> their

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
didn't make the decisions that their

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
didn't make the decisions that their
parents<00:01:23.009> did<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.909> were<00:01:23.970> remanded<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
parents did so they were remanded to the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.320 
parents did so they were remanded to the
desert<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.590> 40<00:01:26.100> years<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
desert for 40 years so there was a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.179 
desert for 40 years so there was a
consequence<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.259> their<00:01:28.380> parents<00:01:28.799> sin<00:01:29.009> but

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
consequence for their parents sin but

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
consequence for their parents sin but
they<00:01:29.640> were<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.880> held<00:01:30.119> culpable<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
they were not held culpable for that and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.230 
they were not held culpable for that and
they<00:01:31.290> were<00:01:31.380> allowed<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> enter<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.790> promised

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
they were allowed to enter the promised

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.630 
they were allowed to enter the promised
land<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> recent<00:01:35.159> story<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
land I think of a recent story in the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640 
land I think of a recent story in the
paper<00:01:35.790> about<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> woman<00:01:36.360> who<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.290> convicted

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
paper about a woman who was convicted

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.260 
paper about a woman who was convicted
and<00:01:37.920> sent<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> jail<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> she<00:01:38.880> was<00:01:39.030> pregnant

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and sent to jail and she was pregnant

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.950 
and sent to jail and she was pregnant
her<00:01:39.990> baby<00:01:40.229> goes<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.710> jail<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.189> her<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:42.659> eats

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
her baby goes to jail with her and eats

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.080 
her baby goes to jail with her and eats
I<00:01:43.170> guess<00:01:43.409> secondarily<00:01:44.009> prison<00:01:44.579> food<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.000> all

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I guess secondarily prison food and all

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.359 
I guess secondarily prison food and all
the<00:01:45.119> rest<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> baby's<00:01:46.350> born<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the rest but when the baby's born the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.700 
the rest but when the baby's born the
baby<00:01:47.549> obviously<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.689> guilty<00:01:49.320> under<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
baby obviously is not guilty under the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.310 
baby obviously is not guilty under the
law<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
law and I think you know that's the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
law and I think you know that's the
picture<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:52.979> see<00:01:53.250> even<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.729> Romans

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
picture that we see even in Romans

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
picture that we see even in Romans
chapter<00:01:54.090> 8<00:01:54.509> verses<00:01:54.930> 19<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.380> 20<00:01:55.470> talks<00:01:55.829> about

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
chapter 8 verses 19 and 20 talks about

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.100 
chapter 8 verses 19 and 20 talks about
creation<00:01:56.340> itself<00:01:56.820> being<00:01:57.390> subject<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
creation itself being subject to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.590 
creation itself being subject to
futility<00:01:58.409> because<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.369> sin<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> curse<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
futility because of sin and the curse in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.380 
futility because of sin and the curse in
Genesis<00:02:01.049> 3<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.950> babies<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:02.850> subject<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
Genesis 3 so babies are subject to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.359 
Genesis 3 so babies are subject to
suffering<00:02:03.840> they're<00:02:03.990> subject<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.439> death<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.340> I

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
suffering they're subject to death but I

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.059 
suffering they're subject to death but I
think<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> culpability<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.810> guilt<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.950> are

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
think the culpability of guilt they are

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
think the culpability of guilt they are
not<00:02:08.220> subject<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.849> before<00:02:09.420> God's<00:02:09.690> tribunal

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
not subject to before God's tribunal

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.800 
not subject to before God's tribunal
because<00:02:11.340> they're<00:02:11.580> their<00:02:11.849> children<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
because they're their children so I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.770 
because they're their children so I
think<00:02:13.260> you

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
think you

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.450 
think you
the<00:02:14.050> picture<00:02:14.380> together<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.860> Bible<00:02:15.280> I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
the picture together in the Bible I

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.580 
the picture together in the Bible I
think<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.000> can<00:02:16.120> be<00:02:16.240> confident<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.560> know

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
think you can be confident that you know

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.770 
think you can be confident that you know
the<00:02:17.800> nature<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.520> what<00:02:18.700> we<00:02:18.820> see<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.450> text

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
the nature of what we see in the text

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.080 
the nature of what we see in the text
leads<00:02:19.990> us<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.350> believe<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.620> babies<00:02:21.190> receive

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
leads us to believe that babies receive

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.880 
leads us to believe that babies receive
a<00:02:22.150> dispensation<00:02:22.720> if<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.350> will<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.680> God's

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
a dispensation if you will of God's

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.970 
a dispensation if you will of God's
grace<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.850> they<00:02:25.030> are<00:02:25.120> forgiven<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.590> we

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
grace that they are forgiven and that we

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.960 
grace that they are forgiven and that we
will<00:02:27.220> see<00:02:27.490> these<00:02:27.880> either<00:02:28.840> unborn<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:29.970> babies

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
will see these either unborn or babies

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.420 
will see these either unborn or babies
that<00:02:31.240> die<00:02:31.450> these<00:02:31.510> children<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.380> die<00:02:32.560> will

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
that die these children that die will

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.949 
that die these children that die will
see<00:02:33.700> them<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:33.970> heaven<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.360> there<00:02:34.600> something<00:02:34.930> to

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
see them in heaven is there something to

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.780 
see them in heaven is there something to
the<00:02:35.320> fact<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.620> or<00:02:35.800> in<00:02:36.010> Romans<00:02:36.340> 1<00:02:36.490> it's<00:02:36.640> going

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
the fact that or in Romans 1 it's going

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.640 
the fact that or in Romans 1 it's going
to<00:02:36.850> say<00:02:36.970> things<00:02:37.030> like<00:02:37.450> those<00:02:37.990> people<00:02:38.410> who<00:02:38.530> are

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
to say things like those people who are

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.070 
to say things like those people who are
held<00:02:38.890> accountable<00:02:39.190> who<00:02:39.610> maybe<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:40.120> know<00:02:40.240> see

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
held accountable who maybe you know see

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.900 
held accountable who maybe you know see
the<00:02:41.230> general<00:02:41.590> revelation<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.310> there

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
the general revelation it's there

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.400 
the general revelation it's there
they're<00:02:43.120> perceiving<00:02:43.660> they're<00:02:43.990> there

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
they're perceiving they're there

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.720 
they're perceiving they're there
considering<00:02:44.860> their<00:02:45.010> understanding<00:02:45.580> things

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
considering their understanding things

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.010 
considering their understanding things
and<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.000> maybe<00:02:46.209> shows<00:02:46.480> us<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> difference

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
and that maybe shows us a difference

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.690 
and that maybe shows us a difference
between<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> babies<00:02:47.739> themselves<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.580> the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
between the babies themselves and the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.150 
between the babies themselves and the
people<00:02:49.270> who<00:02:49.630> are<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.140> know<00:02:50.170> held<00:02:50.830> accountable

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
people who are you know held accountable

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.130 
people who are you know held accountable
of<00:02:51.340> being<00:02:51.550> older<00:02:51.850> than<00:02:51.970> service<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.020> of

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
of being older than service and and of

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.420 
of being older than service and and of
course<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> hell<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.890> place<00:02:54.160> for

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
course and a hell is a place for

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.720 
course and a hell is a place for
retribution<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.930> infractions<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:57.010> sin

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
retribution for infractions of sin

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.940 
retribution for infractions of sin
against<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.180> law<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.530> see<00:02:59.709> in<00:02:59.830> Scripture

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
against the law and we see in Scripture

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.220 
against the law and we see in Scripture
there's<00:03:00.370> not<00:03:00.640> an<00:03:01.180> accountability<00:03:02.050> for

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
there's not an accountability for

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.990 
there's not an accountability for
infractions<00:03:02.530> against<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.310> law<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.790> if

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
infractions against the law but if

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000 
infractions against the law but if
there's<00:03:04.180> no<00:03:04.330> capacity<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.350> understand<00:03:05.800> the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
there's no capacity to understand the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.770 
there's no capacity to understand the
law<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.730> reason<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.060> can<00:03:07.239> say<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.630> man

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
law and the reason you can say the man

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.050 
law and the reason you can say the man
in<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.020> bush<00:03:08.230> still<00:03:08.530> goes<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.800> hell<00:03:09.730> is

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
in the bush still goes to hell is

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.510 
in the bush still goes to hell is
because<00:03:10.480> Romans<00:03:11.170> 1<00:03:11.380> says<00:03:11.410> there<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.100> enough

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
because Romans 1 says there is enough

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.570 
because Romans 1 says there is enough
culpability<00:03:13.120> we've<00:03:13.959> given<00:03:14.590> through<00:03:14.890> creation

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
culpability we've given through creation

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.570 
culpability we've given through creation
so<00:03:15.850> all<00:03:16.660> I'm<00:03:17.020> saying<00:03:17.050> is<00:03:17.500> much<00:03:17.890> like<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.160> Ezrin

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
so all I'm saying is much like in Ezrin
