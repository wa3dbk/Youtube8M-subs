00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is programmed is kind of questionable

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
is programmed is kind of questionable
whether<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> minion<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> champion

but<00:02:13.600> now<00:02:13.690> let's<00:02:13.900> see<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> interaction<00:02:14.740> with

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
but now let's see the interaction with

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.500 
but now let's see the interaction with
Shen's<00:02:15.160> ultimate<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.180> see<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
Shen's ultimate so you can see that the

and<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.580> Shen<00:02:18.940> prepares<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.510> users<00:02:19.780> ultimate

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
and that Shen prepares to users ultimate

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.320 
and that Shen prepares to users ultimate
I<00:02:20.440> use<00:02:20.740> my<00:02:20.920> ultimate<00:02:21.220> on<00:02:21.430> him<00:02:21.580> as<00:02:21.700> well<00:02:21.850> as<00:02:22.060> his

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
I use my ultimate on him as well as his

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.150 
I use my ultimate on him as well as his
busy<00:02:22.600> channeling<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.290> he<00:02:23.440> still<00:02:23.680> teleports

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
busy channeling and he still teleports

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.620 
busy channeling and he still teleports
the<00:02:24.310> least<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.730> gives<00:02:24.970> him<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> shield<00:02:25.420> but

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the least and gives him the shield but

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.970 
the least and gives him the shield but
as<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.810> slow<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.140> down<00:02:26.170> taking<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.680> look<00:02:26.830> at<00:02:26.890> the

music<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.430> guys<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.730> see<00:02:48.880> how<00:02:49.030> many

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
music and you guys can see how many

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.760 
music and you guys can see how many
stacks<00:02:49.450> they<00:02:49.630> can<00:02:49.810> get<00:02:49.990> on<00:02:50.170> top<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.500> how<00:02:50.620> much

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
stacks they can get on top of how much

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.410 
stacks they can get on top of how much
damage<00:02:51.130> it'll<00:02:51.280> do<00:02:51.520> if<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.820> use<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.150> rent

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
damage it'll do if you use the rent

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.210 
damage it'll do if you use the rent
remember<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.230> not<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> maximum<00:02:53.770> damage

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
remember this is not the maximum damage

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.800 
remember this is not the maximum damage
because<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.700> only<00:02:54.820> have<00:02:55.000> attack<00:02:55.330> speed<00:02:55.630> items

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
because I only have attack speed items

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:09.099 
because I only have attack speed items
no<00:02:56.260> ad<00:02:56.590> items<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.490> it<00:02:57.610> is<00:02:57.640> still<00:02:57.910> pretty<00:02:58.120> cool

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.479 

the<00:03:10.109> next<00:03:10.319> myth<00:03:10.439> is<00:03:10.469> asking<00:03:10.950> are<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.189> able<00:03:11.370> to

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the next myth is asking are you able to

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.339 
the next myth is asking are you able to
use<00:03:11.670> both<00:03:11.939> parts<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.480> calluses<00:03:12.900> ultimate

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
use both parts of calluses ultimate

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.709 
use both parts of calluses ultimate
through<00:03:13.650> azir's<00:03:14.010> ultimate<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:15.299> one<00:03:15.510> also

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
through azir's ultimate this one also

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.720 
through azir's ultimate this one also
has<00:03:15.870> somewhat<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.439> a<00:03:16.620> surprising<00:03:17.219> twist<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
has somewhat of a surprising twist it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.369 
has somewhat of a surprising twist it
starts<00:03:18.120> off<00:03:18.269> as<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.629> would<00:03:18.749> probably<00:03:19.170> guess

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
starts off as you would probably guess

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.660 
starts off as you would probably guess
the<00:03:19.620> first<00:03:19.829> part<00:03:20.040> goes<00:03:20.219> through<00:03:20.489> without

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
the first part goes through without

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.580 
the first part goes through without
problem<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:21.239> then<00:03:21.359> as<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.599> fires<00:03:21.959> out<00:03:22.290> it

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
problem but then as it fires out it

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.319 
problem but then as it fires out it
seems<00:03:22.799> like<00:03:22.950> RV<00:03:23.310> still<00:03:23.639> hits<00:03:23.849> him<00:03:23.969> even<00:03:24.269> though

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
seems like RV still hits him even though

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.360 
seems like RV still hits him even though
the<00:03:24.450> soldiers<00:03:24.719> clearly<00:03:25.439> blocked<00:03:25.769> her<00:03:25.920> taking

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
the soldiers clearly blocked her taking

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.830 
the soldiers clearly blocked her taking
a<00:03:26.459> look<00:03:26.670> at<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.879> in<00:03:26.969> slow<00:03:27.120> motion<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.480> see<00:03:27.689> that

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
a look at it in slow motion you see that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.899 
a look at it in slow motion you see that
the<00:03:27.930> AoE<00:03:28.230> effects<00:03:28.769> still<00:03:28.980> hit<00:03:29.159> his<00:03:29.280> ear<00:03:29.609> but

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
the AoE effects still hit his ear but

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.490 
the AoE effects still hit his ear but
the<00:03:30.030> soldiers<00:03:30.450> still<00:03:30.659> did<00:03:30.810> their<00:03:30.900> job<00:03:31.170> which

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
the soldiers still did their job which

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.860 
the soldiers still did their job which
is<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> little<00:03:31.920> odd<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.969> next<00:03:33.209> myth<00:03:33.359> is<00:03:33.389> asking

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
is a little odd the next myth is asking

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.720 
is a little odd the next myth is asking
will<00:03:34.139> rune<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:34.560> hurricane<00:03:34.980> applied<00:03:35.340> rent

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
which is the thing that sticks the spear

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.379 
which is the thing that sticks the spear
inside<00:03:37.469> each<00:03:37.620> target<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.370> all<00:03:38.579> targets<00:03:38.849> hit<00:03:39.209> a

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
inside each target to all targets hit a

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.750 
inside each target to all targets hit a
very<00:03:40.049> simple<00:03:40.499> myth<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.919> to<00:03:40.980> test<00:03:41.219> us<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.430> simply

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
very simple myth and to test us I simply

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.490 
very simple myth and to test us I simply
used<00:03:41.969> it<00:03:42.120> on<00:03:42.209> three<00:03:42.599> minions<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.169> you<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.349> see

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
