00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.550
 heinz witte medium and for today or 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.980
 I would like to let you leave today 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.730
 multiple wish a game sign 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.220
 which is called modes of the user 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.989
 digital ones are used for that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.640
 sound a bit more aggressive 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.500
 to let in more rhythm in too 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.660
 bring about different at the other 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.340
 timbre with reinzubringen yes to 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.989
 to make the whole thing calmer 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.730
 yes it is a game technique me 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.650
 Do not doubt that is the one or 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.129
 other other possibility also exists 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.489
 how to do the whole thing on the guitar 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.710
 can implement 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.860
 I'll show you just like me 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.110
 The whole hand was ok 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.810
 First, let's just take care of them 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.630
 right hand ie the hand with which we 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.250
 Striking strings and the technique is 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.860
 quite simply I just take mine 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.840
 hand knew yes and while I stop 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.650
 puts on the pages that comes through 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.979
 a percussive looks then as in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 my hand was on the strings on it 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.360
 and will stop that if I do 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 now that for example so powerful that I 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.270
 but let's do a beat 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:41.219
 Just let 1 on 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.219
 sound at 230 and again 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.910
 Yes 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.890
 so the technology is first for the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.659
 right hand, I take a small one 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.810
 chord sequence I'm a long day on 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810
 ball 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.149
 back on the ball 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.319
 again 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.070
 ok so it means I'm just 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.110
 my hand could be on the sides 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.040
 to stop this is the technology for 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.720
 the right hand and the left have in 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.630
 I take that as an example in f 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.240
 Accor and there it works 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.510
 so that only really in the mountain for 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.040
 it sounds like it is like that when i put the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.420
 So download wants to play where I am 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.280
 the right hand can already get up 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.970
 the pages goes then I open it like that 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.940
 the guitar 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.590
 at the same time go here with the left 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.060
 just hand in from the sides 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.620
 that's just me 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.810
 only have the sides a little piece of 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.580
 Waistband start as I grab one f 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.350
 accor and when i download the game 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.270
 I just go solve the handle 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.430
 bit on planning with the finger 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.320
 still on the side, yes, by that arises 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.350
 also a percussive sound I do that 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.330
 Now just so that I can 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.740
 death note now only with the left 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.120
 So, that's what I mean when I generate hand 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.570
 Now, for example, the handle is normal 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.000
 claw and stop 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.290
 and if I now own I do 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.800
 the pages do not completely refrain from mine 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.580
 finger on the side also comes 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.580
 bacchus set it to music 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.360
 who again 12th 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.350
 ok so and now we can do it all the time 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.900
 combine 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:56.269
 that is to say again 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.110
 and on two just here in front of the fingers 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.159
 from the sides and here 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.470
 At the same time I can lay my hand 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.470
 that will be on the pages on the pages 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:27.960
 about the work you practice a bit 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.720
 Of course, synchronization is necessary 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.430
 so that it really works out here 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.900
 and that's exactly what it is 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.820
 contrary to the strings 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:58.620
 but it looks pretty 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:05:00.530
 cool sound and of course, too 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.720
 just see the markup in it be so 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.640
 I will do exactly that 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.350
 exactly the same here I put off easily 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.760
 sides and who does not hit me 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:15.240
 Just put my hand back on the page yes 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.680
 yes it works and so yes that is roughly how 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.850
 All this technology works 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.030
 just have to play around a bit 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.110
 Try a lot with where to listen 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.140
 such music for example pretty 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.090
 For example, it is often spontaneous 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.720
 incident for the acoustic guitar is to 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.720
 example so meyer 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.989
 jack johnson 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.450
 or quite succinctly from the music direction 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.450
 for example reception 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.720
 and and and there and there are 100,000 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:32.700
 directions or 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:34.020
 In the end, even jazz music would be a good idea 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.540
 just a little bit around 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.630
 look for youtube different 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.680
 clips where you hear something like that told me 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.500
 I already have an example 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.050
 Little called yes I hope you 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.240
 have a lot of fun with this video could 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.310
 I help a whole corner again 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.890
 and wish you a lot of fun 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.390
 Of course, I'm happy when you open 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.590
 I like this button presses and 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:02.490
 then I wish you one more 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:06.710
 wonderful day and have fun with the 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.710
 cover the medium tells you
