00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.730
 body can be a bit frustrating 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.370
 because we all think that somewhere 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.340

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.130
 flyers will make volume and call the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.110

 little ones will increase the volume 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.000
 visually at the bottom of your 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.830

 a bikini convertibles are also 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.690
 perfect for gifts is like having 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.690
 three cinemas in one 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.369
 the new ones in the hips will widen 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.020
 the lateral areas this is ideal for 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.299
 those that have great pleasure and few 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.890
 hips the same way the last 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.240
 reversible are great to create 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.520
 different looks during a trip 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.780
 finally if you have little taste a torso 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.940
 very thin but wearing bikinis extra month 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.800
 a great complement to our clothes 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.410
 bathroom are the pareos so I'm going to 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.850
 teach them four ways to use the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.670
 double to your wall or in half and has 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.350
 been a knot hangs you in the neck and 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.569
 raise with both hands from the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.489
 habit now you just have to grab 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.440
 those points that you took from behind like 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.940
 if it were an apron and you already have a 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.220
 dress with the bare back 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.710
 place the pareo from behind 7 at 2 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.600
 top points ahead hang 13 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.570
 knot in the neck takes a little fabric 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.610
 of the degrees and ties the computers and 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.610
 it flies and there is a longer dress 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.120
 begins with the pareo from behind and together 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.519
 to the two upper ends in front 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.010
 Take a bracelet and introduce the joints 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.280
 by it separates each tip for its 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.810
 respective side and up to the back 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.769
 then just like the pareo so that 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.769
 get a strapless dress 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.090
 double a sarong in half and tie the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.250
 upper ends then fold the other 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.799
 once in half and until again you 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.239
 will be like an 8 repeats exactly what 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.239
 same with the tips below 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.590
 Y 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.450
 it's okay 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.870
 good 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.520
 d 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.650
 then introduce your feet for two of the 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.569
 small holes pull the pareo up 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.420
 introduce your arms for the other two 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.760
 remaining games you will begin to notice that 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.560

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.230
 hands a little fabric from the sides 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.790
 take them forward and tie the tea 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.790
 will drop a super comfortable jumper 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.019
 I hope these tips and ideas have 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.989
 served to have things clearer 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:03.359

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.359

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.340
