00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
they are high and they do you know

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.770 
they are high and they do you know
nothing<00:03:34.579> ruin<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.970> but<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.329> know<00:03:35.450> we<00:03:35.660> don't

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
nothing ruin it but you know we don't

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.740 
nothing ruin it but you know we don't
all<00:03:35.989> die<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:37.459> technically<00:03:37.910> maybe<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.600> weed

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
all die so so technically maybe the weed

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.440 
all die so so technically maybe the weed
is<00:03:38.900> what<00:03:39.049> saves<00:03:39.290> us<00:03:39.440> true<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.489> never<00:03:40.700> know<00:03:40.910> so

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
is what saves us true you never know so

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.690 
is what saves us true you never know so
I<00:03:42.019> think<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.410> message<00:03:42.709> is<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:42.980> get<00:03:43.340> high<00:03:43.519> if

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
I think the message is to get high if

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.190 
I think the message is to get high if
people<00:03:44.030> are<00:03:44.120> trying<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.420> chase<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:44.810> make<00:03:44.989> sure
