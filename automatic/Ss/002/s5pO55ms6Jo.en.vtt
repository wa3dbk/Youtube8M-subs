just<00:03:39.400> smaller<00:03:40.000> pieces<00:03:40.390> but<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.349> doesn't

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
just smaller pieces but it doesn't

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.449 
just smaller pieces but it doesn't
really<00:03:41.799> matter

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.640

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.390 
I've cooked the chutney in for about
seven<00:04:37.419> minutes<00:04:37.750> which<00:04:37.960> seems<00:04:38.289> to<00:04:38.500> be<00:04:38.650> perfect

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
seven minutes which seems to be perfect

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.040 
seven minutes which seems to be perfect
I<00:04:39.639> lowered<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.300> heat<00:04:41.070> from<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.160> little<00:04:42.490> too<00:04:43.050> you

know<00:04:44.169> just<00:04:44.470> below<00:04:44.800> medium<00:04:45.310> for<00:04:45.789> the<00:04:45.880> last<00:04:46.090> two

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
know just below medium for the last two

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.620 
know just below medium for the last two
minutes<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:47.979> can<00:04:48.039> come<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.610> see<00:04:49.180> what<00:04:49.539> it

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
minutes so you can come and see what it

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.450 
minutes so you can come and see what it
looks<00:04:49.870> like<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:53.590> apples<00:04:54.220> are<00:04:54.370> all

looks like so the apples are all

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.029 
looks like so the apples are all
softened<00:04:54.849> and<00:04:55.539> I'm<00:04:56.020> just<00:04:56.199> gonna<00:04:56.349> repeat<00:04:56.800> the
