00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.040
 1 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.430
 3 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.600
 tomorrow 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600
 point 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.689
 of 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.689
 mons fathers 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.550
 it 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.739
 the pot to play 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.689
 ayo balloons technology 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.369
 so percent 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.429
 problem way I find that the sound he has besides still 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.129
 that's what I mean the hood facing his 15th 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.780
 and then play 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.440
 what 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.020
 m 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.920
 the first ones 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 unleaded 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.970
 so 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.790
 here and then the quorum is only 7% times are hard 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.820
 e you have an explanation is very well done by himself see 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.460
 5 on Lyon which will appear 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.390
 8 so here at the pettiness he can play as long as it can play 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.070
 in B minor 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.220
 etc. 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.290
 So it's been a calamity for 11 years water million 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 % 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.160
 then in addition 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.280
 the major 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.950
 she eats troops 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950
 why just like 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.420
 nantes 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 woerth 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.049
 here is nobody 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.190
 raffarin on the hood 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.320
 it's not that it's wrong it's a little easier 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.300
 according to m as to his wish 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.720
 so I'm not here for that I'm coming today it's mostly 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.770
 at work at the top the rhythmic 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.580
 at the window 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.300
 larry smith following me I started learning left I'm not 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.470
 totally 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.070
 in the end I started to pau in celebration we know we feel 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.049
 ranked the strings at the beginning by far the 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.719
 We explained 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.949
 so 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.869
 to the point where we will feel rhythmic 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.869
 once we meet they have understood how works 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.670
 we can begin to attack the strings so an attali maid started 2 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.509
 authorities 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:38.059
 - you type 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.059
 so what should also reveal things like that 5 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.879
 tomorrow 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.229
 mm 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.889
 m 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.549
 and for a long time glitzy the cce it is very technical it is necessary to raise the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.249
 ceiling 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.280
 I'm ranking them and can be started soon after that 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.839
 the researcher 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.839
 m ivory 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:18.089
 yet only for pete 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.839
 on arithmetic 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.429
 and so love you i'm with nick 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.429
 I had moments where you have to put in the lead in parentheses 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:28.479
 a bomb 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.199
 m 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.439
 m course
