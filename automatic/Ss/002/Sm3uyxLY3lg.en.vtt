character<00:00:17.640> probably<00:00:17.940> when<00:00:18.029> I'm<00:00:18.150> not<00:00:18.270> gonna

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
character probably when I'm not gonna

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.730

use<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.600> much<00:00:19.080> when<00:00:19.350> storm<00:00:19.619> revolution

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.099 
use that much when storm revolution
comes<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.510> kind<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> cool<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
comes out but it's kind of cool that the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.810 
comes out but it's kind of cool that the
shown<00:00:22.320> off<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.650> move<00:00:22.859> sets<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.250> early<00:00:23.310> a
