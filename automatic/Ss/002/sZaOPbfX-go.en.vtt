00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.780 
my braid to my main line and actually
what<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.520> I'm<00:01:53.670> gonna

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.300 
what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna
double<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.270> line<00:01:54.540> first<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.530> I've<00:01:55.649> got<00:01:55.829> double

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
double the line first so I've got double

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.090 
double the line first so I've got double
line<00:01:57.049> I'm<00:01:58.049> gonna<00:01:58.320> make<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.710> loop<00:01:58.890> with

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
line I'm gonna make a little loop with

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.700 
line I'm gonna make a little loop with
my<00:01:59.130> mana<00:01:59.630> I'm<00:02:00.630> gonna<00:02:00.960> push<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> double<00:02:01.560> line

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
my mana I'm gonna push the double line

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.639 
my mana I'm gonna push the double line
through<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> loop<00:02:03.649> pinch<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.810> wrap<00:02:06.810> eight<00:02:07.439> or

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
through the loop pinch it wrap eight or

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.949 
through the loop pinch it wrap eight or
ten<00:02:07.860> times<00:02:08.099> around<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.000> loop<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.390> by<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> way

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
ten times around the loop and by the way

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.800 
ten times around the loop and by the way
you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.319> find<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:11.220> knot<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.790> our<00:02:12.360> web<00:02:12.510> site

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
you can find this knot on our web site

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.580 
you can find this knot on our web site
at<00:02:12.989> any

Glinka<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:15.239> really<00:02:15.569> important<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.019> knot

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
Glinka it's really important this knot

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.680 
Glinka it's really important this knot
is<00:02:16.410> tied<00:02:16.650> well<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> hard<00:02:17.940> knot<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.300> tie<00:02:18.480> but

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
is tied well not a hard knot to tie but

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.619 
is tied well not a hard knot to tie but
doesn't<00:02:19.019> need<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.260> tied<00:02:19.440> right<00:02:20.510> I'm<00:02:21.510> gonna

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
doesn't need to be tied right I'm gonna

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.839 
doesn't need to be tied right I'm gonna
pull<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.989> back<00:02:22.170> through<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:23.550> I'm<00:02:23.730> gonna

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
pull it back through and I'm gonna

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.880 
pull it back through and I'm gonna
carefully<00:02:24.300> tighten<00:02:24.780> all<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.410> up<00:02:25.500> at<00:02:25.650> once

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
carefully tighten all of it up at once

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.670 
carefully tighten all of it up at once
so<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> doesn't<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> wraps<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:28.500> pull

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
so that doesn't so the wraps don't pull

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.160 
so that doesn't so the wraps don't pull
over<00:02:28.709> themselves<00:02:29.660> just<00:02:30.660> take<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.110> up<00:02:33.170> and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
over themselves just take that up and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.259 
over themselves just take that up and
pull<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.920> tight<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:37.280> now<00:02:38.280> I'm<00:02:38.580> ready<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.090> load

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
pull it tight and now I'm ready to load

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.030 
pull it tight and now I'm ready to load
the<00:02:39.420> rail<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.750> now<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:43.170> gonna<00:02:43.319> take<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.739> spool

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
the rail so now I'm gonna take the spool

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.190 
the rail so now I'm gonna take the spool
and<00:02:44.310> I'm<00:02:44.760> gonna<00:02:44.879> want<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.330> orient<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.959> spool

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
and I'm gonna want to orient the spool

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.470 
and I'm gonna want to orient the spool
so<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> line<00:02:46.769> comes<00:02:47.130> off<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.970> same<00:02:48.180> way<00:02:48.360> it's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
so the line comes off the same way it's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.699 
so the line comes off the same way it's
going<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.630> go<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.170> reel<00:02:49.319> it's<00:02:49.590> gonna

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
going to go on on the reel it's gonna

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.289 
going to go on on the reel it's gonna
kind<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.099> reduce<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.610> amount<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.910> twists<00:02:51.150> I

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
kind of reduce the amount of twists I

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.940 
kind of reduce the amount of twists I
have<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:52.110> other<00:02:52.230> option<00:02:52.650> would<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:52.829> to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
have the other option would be to

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.069 
have the other option would be to
basically<00:02:53.130> just<00:02:53.640> roll<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.360> line<00:02:54.630> out<00:02:54.660> like

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
basically just roll this line out like

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.539 
basically just roll this line out like
maybe<00:02:55.230> put<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.680> line<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.069> bucket<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.370> water

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
maybe put this line in a bucket of water

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.460 
maybe put this line in a bucket of water
in<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.849> box<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.720> we're<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:57.900> gonna<00:02:58.110> pull<00:02:58.379> it

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
in a box but we're just gonna pull it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.750 
in a box but we're just gonna pull it
right<00:02:58.590> off<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.860> top<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.250> spool<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.640> this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
right off the top of the spool in this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.119 
right off the top of the spool in this
case<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.690> as<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.230> worried<00:03:01.500> about<00:03:01.560> twists

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
case not as really worried about twists

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.289 
case not as really worried about twists
because<00:03:02.190> I'm<00:03:02.370> gonna<00:03:02.489> stretch<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.030> line<00:03:03.269> out

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
because I'm gonna stretch this line out

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.059 
because I'm gonna stretch this line out
when<00:03:03.599> I<00:03:03.629> finally<00:03:03.989> get<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.410> water<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
when I finally get it on the water and

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.229 
when I finally get it on the water and
make<00:03:05.220> sure<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.519> all<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> twists<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.120> of

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
make sure you get all the twists out of

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.780 
make sure you get all the twists out of
it<00:03:06.329> so<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.260> made<00:03:07.530> sure<00:03:07.829> one<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.549> things<00:03:08.670> I've
