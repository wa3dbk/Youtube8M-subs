00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.210
 the barack obama government holds a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.550
 wide bombing campaign with 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.340
 Many drones do not know in Brazil the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.289
 which are drones are not the planes 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.930
 manned practically flying robots 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.080
 which are controlled by remote control 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.050
 remotely and are used by 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.189
 bomb targets in pakistan in Yemen and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.470
 in your mesh 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.439
 at least two thousand members of Al 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.780
 qaeda militants or 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.660
 of organizations associated with qaeda 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.910
 were killed in these operations in another 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.219
 undetermined number of civilian victims 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 which may even be thousands including 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.200
 women children and the elderly 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.690
 and nobody can investigate these 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.090
 attacks with drones that are all made 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.360
 secretly there is very little information 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.050
 about this the good government had been trying to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.510
 keep as much confidentiality as possible about 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.699
 the accusations against 11 but the president 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.290
 American already suffering strong criticism from 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.659
 rights organizations 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.119
 human rights and jurists 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.890
 first because many civilians are dead 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 in these operations that have people 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.780
 dying as bush did the war of the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.130
 iraq and afghanistan obama trends 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 bombings in heaven war 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.960
 themselves are bombardments 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.840
 Americans with robots that kill a lot 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.820
 people and ii and in the world nobody 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.700
 part of who his victim information 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.970
 these more serious civilian victims 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.290
 many of the alleged militants include 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.869
 you are not entitled to any judgment 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.630
 simply killed without the right to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.400
 defense is an innocent person many 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.649
 who were arrested during the administration 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.210
 bush taken to guantÃ¡namo 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.210
 subsequently proved that they were 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.100
 innocent in the case of actions with drones 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 bank they are dead they will never have 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.649
 right to defense and one of them at least 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.320
 one is an American citizen and this is very 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.770
 every American citizen in the states 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.860
 have the right to the defense of the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.489
 judgment and if you do not respect this 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.289
 you go against the constitution and the anuar 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.750
 al aulaqi is a well known member of al 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.390
 qaeda but even as every state 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.600
 American 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.970
 including the goal that made the killer of the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.440
 Batman movie that killed people who 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.100
 were watching a movie is a serial 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.690
 killer 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.700
 he is entitled to a defense judgment 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.680
 will be judged the same 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.480
 should apply to all and obama 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.930
 had been criticized for this and 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.370
 refused to show the memorandum 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.310
 justified its actions and its policy 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.110
 of selective assassinations but the ellipse 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.090
 that the main TV channel of the states 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.050
 have gained access to these 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.700
 documents 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.650
 Obama administration came blocking 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.300
 new york times el tank led the question 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.720
 even to justice to try to compel 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.110
 obama aa disclose this information 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.150
 but it needs access and use of 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.850
 argument arguments department of 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.430
 justice that are considered weak by 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.830
 many analysts who depend on the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.920
 chissindo justify with the constitution 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.660
 constitutes the quality of these actions 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.970
 but experts think that they are very 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.519
 weak arguments such as saying 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.410
 which pose an imminent threat to 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.269
 but they make it clear that 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.980
 an imminent attack is not necessarily 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.239
 imminent 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.370
 the also what those organizations 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.230
 associated with fall 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.840
 arguments are very weak in this 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.900
 document and obama will tend to suffer 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.060
 increasingly critical of the issue of 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.360
 games outside the united states do not 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.650
 speaks even though there is an investigation 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.630
 in the UN on the issue and also 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.850
 relatives of people who died in 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.290
 English have also led to the 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.540
 England to try to process the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.730
 panic but here in the United States is 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.350
 growing and comes precisely from these 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.829
 human rights organizations 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.380
 The interesting thing is that obama is criticized 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.540
 precisely because of its violent president 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.239
 these issues which would generally have 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.579
 associated more albums but obama becomes 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.110
 to be very like many people who 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.329
 sympathized with the American president 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.010
 already calls him one of the most bloodthirsty 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.280
 presidents of the history of the states 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.280
 United
