00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
accessories just starting off with the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.550 
accessories just starting off with the
rig<00:00:18.210> here<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.779> see<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.990> cameras<00:00:19.410> already

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
rig here you can see the cameras already

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.189 
rig here you can see the cameras already
mounted<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.600> primary<00:00:21.600> function<00:00:21.960> for<00:00:22.109> this

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
mounted to it primary function for this

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.060 
mounted to it primary function for this
sort<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.410> thing<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.830> really<00:00:23.010> just

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
sort of thing is to really just

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.710 
sort of thing is to really just
stabilize<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> camera<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.600> just

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
stabilize the camera so you can just

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.540 
stabilize the camera so you can just
hold<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.680> instead<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.220> holding<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
hold like this instead of holding the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.189 
hold like this instead of holding the
camera<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.180> front<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> you're

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
camera out in front of you you're

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.720 
camera out in front of you you're
actually<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.590> holding<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> rig<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
actually just holding the rig and it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.760 
actually just holding the rig and it
gives<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> nice<00:00:30.210> steady<00:00:30.630> pan<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.980> move

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
gives you a nice steady pan as you move

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.560 
gives you a nice steady pan as you move
so<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.190> let's<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.700> show<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.030> how<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> work

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
so now let's just show you how you work

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.790 
so now let's just show you how you work
with<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> focusing<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.530> things

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
with the focusing on these things

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.990 
with the focusing on these things
because<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.340> don't<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.670> want<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> be

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
because you don't really want to be

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.549 
because you don't really want to be
touching<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> lens<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:40.170> pick

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
touching the lens actually pick

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.040 
touching the lens actually pick
something<00:00:40.800> noise<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:42.030> rough<00:00:42.210> so

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
something noise and it's a bit rough so

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.420 
something noise and it's a bit rough so
you<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.260> use<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.710> accessory<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.280> this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you just use an accessory like this

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.209 
you just use an accessory like this
which<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.770> focus<00:00:46.770> ring<00:00:47.010> or

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
which is actually the focus ring or

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.720 
which is actually the focus ring or
focus<00:00:47.550> puller<00:00:47.760> would<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.510> caught

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
focus puller would get one one caught

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
focus puller would get one one caught
this<00:00:50.730> attachment<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:51.809> part<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
this attachment here is actually part of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
this attachment here is actually part of
that<00:00:52.410> accessory<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.489> attaches<00:00:53.820> around<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that accessory it attaches around the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.650 
that accessory it attaches around the
lens<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.899> basically<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.730> gear<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
lens and basically it's just a gear that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.650 
lens and basically it's just a gear that
allows<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:59.250> driving<00:00:59.760> mechanism<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.329> actually

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
allows the driving mechanism to actually

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080 
allows the driving mechanism to actually
to<00:01:01.140> turn<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.859> focusing<00:01:02.520> ring<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:02.940> lens

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
to turn the focusing ring on your lens

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.109 
to turn the focusing ring on your lens
so<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> attach<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> rig<00:01:04.909> just<00:01:05.909> need

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so to attach this to the rig just need

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.899 
so to attach this to the rig just need
to<00:01:06.560> find<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> two<00:01:07.920> rods<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.490> front<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to find the two rods here in front of it

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.870 
to find the two rods here in front of it
and<00:01:09.150> slide<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.960> should<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> tight<00:01:10.650> fit

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
and slide it on it should be a tight fit

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
and slide it on it should be a tight fit
so<00:01:11.880> shouldn't<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.240> much<00:01:12.360> given<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.810> then

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so shouldn't be much given there then

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.870 
so shouldn't be much given there then
you're<00:01:13.560> lining<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.549> gear

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you're lining it up so that this gear

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
you're lining it up so that this gear
wheel<00:01:15.060> lines<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.140> bill<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
wheel lines up to this bill that you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.880 
wheel lines up to this bill that you
attach<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.159> lens<00:01:18.530> there's<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> locking
