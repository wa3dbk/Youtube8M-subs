00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everybody today the category is going to show 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.299
 for you a very cool product that 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.299
 both antifury tape both 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.090
 if there is one thing that fills the bag that 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.930
 haunts all tire cyclists 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.820
 bored 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.220
 The loss of time has nothing to stop for 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.169
 sometimes change a very small future 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.489
 gets emptied gradually you will use 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.339
 just fill 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.379
 So there's no way for you, it 's you. 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.870
 uses a very heavy period heavy one 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.790
 but this tire does not have in Brazil is the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.829
 sealant is cool but also 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.309
 that work is that you have to 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.000
 reset every month it will dry but you 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.039
 here are these straps that are 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.199
 polyurethane you can put 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.109
 between the tire and the camera and 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.980
 and a soul gets a tougher thing and it's 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.719
 resistant to thorns 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.500
 glass pieces mainly who 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.850
 walks on the road has a lot of thinks 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.759
 piece of steel cable that is itself 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.710
 loose car truck sits in the corner 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.710
 in the cyclist he passes and ends up boring 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.220
 there are several measures this tape 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.630
 separated by color to put on the streets 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.240
 of districts in the mountains from 26 to 27 6 29 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.800
 the various bibles and each one has its 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.180
 specific color that I'm going to use now is 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.070
 recommended for bikes 29 but I go 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.470
 the width so I'll use a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.050
 27min bike will be left over I'll cut a 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.750
 little but have to let it overlap and 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.729
 you proceed in the same way you form 24 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.820
 with the tire of this width you too 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.210
 You can use this one here and it's going to be you. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.300
 it makes the difference and is very easy to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.720
 mount actually not only go to the wheel 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.540
 the bike you can empty and open 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.570
 with one side of the tire and you will 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.060
 by carefully inserting it so that it 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.560
 in this area, which is more external than 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.110
 daily camera the tire 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.550
 I'm going to take an hour from this downtown to 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.140
 show here on the bench because there is a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.560
 position for you to see is the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.560
 subject matter 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.950
 installation is very easy you repair 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.300
 I did not even empty the camera. 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.130
 A little crowded, there are people who take everything away. 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.270
 strip period until the area has not 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.140
 need 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:51.790
 we just start at the center 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.460
 here in the nozzle leave tape in that position 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.680
 I think the center and let's start applying 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.930
 here in the direction of the beak because people 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.690
 does this because the nozzle is already the part that 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.970
 more weighs in the camera and how will the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.720
 overlapping the two ends and I do not want 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.300
 much more weight in the place alone 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.410
 where does so with and here the difference 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.870
 that remains 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.590
 since I'm using a strap to bike 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.390
 rim 29 and that wheel 276 is left over 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 you cut 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.090
 now that we agree with the leftovers 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.950
 put it in that position and take a look 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.900
 because it's no good at all to be on the side 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.640
 will not protect who protects the band 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.459
 then just to give a 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.670
 Happy quick check is right, no. 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.430
 I was a little sidetracked and already 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.910
 You are ready to run now we will 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.780
 close the fill and exit to the 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.880
 Street 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.580
 talk on the street and install mister 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.530
 both on a bike rim 26 with the tire well 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.270
 mill and it looks like we planted 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.530
 with him 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.320
 taking advantage of the opportunity to test 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.570
 this belt of the future we are going to test 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.220
 also a myth is rolling does not taste good 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.050
 if it is true or not but at last there was 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.930
 much complaint there were reports that 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.270
 traders or residents disgusted with 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.790
 the presence of the cycle path in the 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.770
 its doors have played softly to 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.090
 the tire of the staff and to encourage 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.980
 the use of the system 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.320
 so we'll also test the tape 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.370
 this fact is resistant to 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.370
 taxinha hole 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.620
 we have here without bedbugs the famous 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.460
 box to hold that role in 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.979
 Notice 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.560
 so we'll make a trap 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.630
 here I'll test with my bass 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.500
 I'll stay here playing this one for 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.500
 put this trap 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.210
 It's worth remembering that we interdicted here 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.760
 part of this cycle path that is very quiet 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.560
 by the way so that nobody finishes 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.140
 we are trapped here in our trap. 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.730
 She's for our test after we 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.480
 let's collect and we will be very careful 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.300
 ready test 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.480
 the likelihood of it taking a one 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.310
 15 or 20 in any past and we only 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.000
 see what happens 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.000
 catch bass 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.840
 Look how cool it is 35 studded studs. 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.180
 on both wheels and she herself goes 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:35.150
 Shipping is very cool. 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.240
 Nothing, no noise has to make a 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.030
 comb now because some have been 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.520
 dropping by the way because the own 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.780
 feel for not allowing the entry ends 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.900
 expelling 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.090
 the little one of the few goes out of the tire 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.170
 and now I'm going to have to interdict an area 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.170
 bigger here to solve 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:06.440
 all here it is clear that the 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.530
 people did something very radical to pass 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.810
 about 100 paws with break tires 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.490
 but so it is to take the test to the 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.949
 extreme of course you will not do 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.620
 a business of that purpose then to 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:21.410
 Normal use is very valid 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.150
 the belt works really hope 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.250
 You enjoyed our crazy test. 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.260
 and mister brought a product to whom 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.330
 seeks practicality in the work of 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.040
 maintenance is easy to install and has 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.680
 people have been using it for over ten years 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.139
 sells the bike but took it was put in the 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.139
 bike and this is really cool to have 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.210
 this facility in the product and in the 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.450
 our website you can check in 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.610
 complete the table with the color 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.710
 size and individual weight of each 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.870
 simple for you to know how much this goes 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.430
 weighing on your bike is very little 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.940
 So we'll see each other in the next videos. 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.940
 thanks 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.590
 is
