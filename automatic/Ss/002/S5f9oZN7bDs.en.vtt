midsole<00:00:43.149> seamlessly<00:00:44.149> it<00:00:45.050> actually<00:00:45.379> wraps

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
midsole seamlessly it actually wraps

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.309 
midsole seamlessly it actually wraps
around<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.460> bottom<00:00:46.729> of<00:00:46.819> the<00:00:46.909> shoe<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.389> around
