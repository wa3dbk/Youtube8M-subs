 aston martin ferrari corvette porsche 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.339
 had made it evolve at the level of the tracks 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 widened the size of the wheels and 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.970
 tires like aerodynamic fin 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.369

 detail that is important in endurance 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 to the question will we run away without 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.640
 benchmark the answer is no direction the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.890
 motorhome with arnaud under

 jean marc merlin erik maris for sure 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.159
 more and I hope that the course of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.819
 gait 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.259
 starting the first left happens in 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.030
 do we come in fifth or brake 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.619
 a little bit and they pass in bag 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.539
 it's easier when you do not know 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.090

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.709

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.319
 burning bend it's too late you 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.280
 to find the right time to do and 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:52.630
 is that the c3 is con I know

 repeat the porsche is waiting for that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.370
 our goodwill 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.030
 a sacred pressure coupled with a small 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.560
 pride after the court on the circuit the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.630
 little text explanation for 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.650
 apprehend pilotage and swamp 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.530
 the main general power of a 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.080
 polar then initial 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.390
 to turn on the fuel pumps and 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.390
 after store the app okay 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.269
 let's go for an installation tour 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.769
 little control and anouma nor courses at 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.069
 condition that there is no flag 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.930
 red 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.640
 what we sometimes happen but it's 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.640
 promised it was not our football 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.860
 major change for this rsr 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.660
 the adoption of paddles driving 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.850
 select reports a sacred 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.200
 improvements for his pilots like 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.030
 for the novices we are 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.590
 before you had to be an expert 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.080
 to spare the appearance of the box 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.090
 and this passage to the palace was necessary 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.690
 to say what motivates our desire to 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.690
 do this test 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.780
 we immediately appreciate the comfort 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.090
 especially at the downshift just get 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.910
 focus on braking think already to 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.380
 the output with the anti slip adjust in 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.010
 intermediate position and by this 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.030
 beautiful day 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.030
 we risk nothing 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.640
 endurance is also changes 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.709
 of driver drivers in that we 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.660
 regards and even there it's not going too 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.030
 quickly that between each vernet and 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.470
 raymond narac normal vincent has like a 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.500
 offer to share with us his 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.500
 experience 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.450
 an agreement with me even my life sitting 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.880
 it's diabolical finally it's great 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.320
 ad looks great and when I think 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.669
 that we are not even a tenth of 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.110
 abilities ah yeah okay this is a 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.970
 craft ladies and gentlemen this is a 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.150
 job done it's a total foot of 450 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.150
 horses 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.080
 and thank you for the gift guys really 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.509
 thank you for the gift but the heartbeat 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.870
 accelerates when we settle in this 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.870
 autumn 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.500
 enjoy in turn the 450 horses get 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.510
 regal and therefore tempting palates 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.970
 to apprehend would be only a small 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.710
 little the behavior of the beast which one 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.010
 was barely talking about heating 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.350
 tires 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.750
 this is the challenge of these few loops 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.750
 magny circuitry necessarily provides 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.229
 he is right vincent we stay on the watch 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.330
 the regulars of the vdev series and their 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.889
 trays based on us what is 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.629
 nice to see that sometimes a 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.849
 acceleration at exit of turn 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:43.050
 can follow them before telling them 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.050
 goodbye in the following sequence 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.930
 johan took out his sign what idea he 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.220
 it's time to get back to the stands 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.140
 hot prints 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.500
 find me the three four adjectives 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.660
 who would symbolize that day taking 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.950
 steering wheel of this car there and he 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.140
 summary of the sensations you experienced 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:24.390
 so already amazing because before you 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.890
 do not believe what is that? 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.160
 first word it's amazing 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.620
 impressive this is the second 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.950
 stressful it's the third is 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.750
 enjoyable it's the fourth there would be 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.280
 keys on a race car 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.410
 we almost do not want to 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.200
 make the team's porsche imsa she 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.730
 had the keys to success in 2013 in 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.500
 world championship and she's leaving 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.390
 this year for a European tour 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.240
 the car will leave for a season 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.730
 2014 is a program the lms so we 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.230

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.820
 car for the new season he's going there 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.560
 have things to change on the 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.080
 car where it's really this 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.350
 model who will go back for a 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.180
 year 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.410
 it's really this model that goes 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.570
 go back for a year saw the 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.330
 regulation after this car there 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.320
 down we will start from the chassis during it 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.630
 we have three weeks left now 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.180
 to prepare the car and deliver the 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:18.960
 2014 configuration with a new 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.030

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.440
 a beautiful program 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.770
 we can not thank the team enough 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.550
 he his performance matmut to have us 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.220
 trust 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.610

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.610
 end of season
