 james dancing 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.350
 hello youtube people in today's video 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.700
 we will learn to make up a face what 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.670
 first thing we have to do is open 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.710
 an image and with control j duplicate the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.519
 cap 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.570
 then we add a new layer which 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.570
 we will call lips 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.290
 we look for a color in the palette that we 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.290
 seem appropriate 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.620
 and we started painting the lips without 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.620
 get out 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.119
 if we leave now we take the rubber and 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.200
 we started to erase those areas that do not 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.200
 they should be painted 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.580
 with the fusion we change it to color 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.530
 we lower the opacity a bit according to whether 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.510
 we want more clarito stronger and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.550
 then we add blur bausch 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.700
 no longer in filters 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.410
 and we therefore blur as much as 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.410
 what we need more or less 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 then we add a new layer 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.820
 which we will call cheekbones 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.130
 we select a meat color so not very 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.130
 strong a natural tone 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.000
 and what we do is paint 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.580
 then blur filters or 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.229
 not what we need is a lot 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.729
 blur so that the color spreads 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.569
 and it does not look like a goop on your face 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.150
 we need it to be diffused 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.540
 then we will create another layer the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.540
 which denominates of ways contours eyes 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.540
 eyes 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.180
 with a black color we choose a brush 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.319
 normal of a small size for 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.980
 border what is the eye 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.540
 we surround the whole eye with the brush we see 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.319
 that we have a very black spot 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.319
 but do not worry 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.730
 now we take and change the mode of 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.140
 Fusion of the layer to soft light 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.850
 we already see how it fades a bit 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.010
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.310
 Gaussian blur filter 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.629
 and give it a more blurred tone for 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.629
 make it more realistic 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.910
 we will create another new layer below 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.540
 which we will call eyeshadow or 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.540
 shades 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.510
 we will choose the color in the palette of 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.230
 colors the cattle we like with a 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.230
 normal brush 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.150
 and we paint the area that we want 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.150
 appear the eye shadow 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.300
 simply then you have to change the 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.610
 soft light fusion mode 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.560
 and finally apply a filter 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.770
 Gaussian blur as we have done 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.770
 previously 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.489
 if you do not like the final result and 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.140
 you want to change something click on last of 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.640
 the layer can move and vary the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.150
 opacities to change the result 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.150
 final 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.620
 and finally in the layer that we have 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.040
 duplicate we add a light filter 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.040
 soft 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.569
 and this is all friends I hope that I have 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.569
 liked the tutorial and until next time
