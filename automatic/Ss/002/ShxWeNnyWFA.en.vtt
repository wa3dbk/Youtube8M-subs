they<00:00:30.929> were<00:00:31.019> notorious<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.009> of

they were notorious for a little bit of
leak<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:34.110> necessarily<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
leak I don't think it's necessarily a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.720 
leak I don't think it's necessarily a
nap<00:00:35.040> really<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> problem<00:00:35.930> however<00:00:37.730> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
nap really a problem however the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.850 
nap really a problem however the

compression the compression clamps in

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.490 
compression the compression clamps in
general<00:00:41.820> seem<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.360> leak<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.230> they're<00:00:43.320> non

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

general seem to leak because they're non
adjustable<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.090> replaced<00:00:45.450> them<00:00:45.719> with

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
here's a compression style clamp and you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.539 
here's a compression style clamp and you
can<00:01:02.489> order<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.449> purely<00:01:03.660> wrench<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.650> $40<00:01:05.309> or

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
can order in a purely wrench for $40 or

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.560 
can order in a purely wrench for $40 or
if<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.689> type<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:09.060> does<00:01:09.450> the

if you have one of this type it does the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
if you have one of this type it does the
job<00:01:09.810> quite<00:01:10.080> well<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.740> compress<00:01:11.130> them

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
job quite well you just compress them

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
job quite well you just compress them
and<00:01:11.640> then<00:01:12.479> snap<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.170> pop<00:01:13.380> off<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:15.170> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and then snap and they pop off I have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.219 
and then snap and they pop off I have
yet<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> remove<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:18.180> DB<00:01:18.540> killers<00:01:18.930> from<00:01:19.110> the

yet to remove the DB killers from the
exhaust<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.950> did<00:01:20.430> drill<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> popper<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
