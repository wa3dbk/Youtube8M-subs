increase camping everybody's going to
worry<00:02:31.170> about<00:02:31.320> their<00:02:31.620> stats<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.310> visible

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
worry about their stats I visible

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.840 
worry about their stats I visible
everybody's<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.160> oh

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850

kind of thing and I think it's just
going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> increase<00:02:40.620> more<00:02:41.010> trash<00:02:41.910> talking<00:02:42.450> i<00:02:42.630> I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
going to increase more trash talking i I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.820 
going to increase more trash talking i I
really<00:02:43.830> don't<00:02:44.130> see<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.810> causing<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.080> better

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
really don't see it causing a better

really don't see it causing a better
effect<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.640> don't<00:02:48.420> see<00:02:48.630> how<00:02:48.750> that's<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.230> would

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
effect I don't see how that's it would

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.070

mean 3i me looks good but it's uh I
think<00:05:20.700> it's<00:05:20.930> got<00:05:21.930> potential<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.890> killstreaks

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
think it's got potential the killstreaks

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.320 
think it's got potential the killstreaks
look<00:05:23.790> good<00:05:24.200> you<00:05:25.200> got<00:05:25.380> proficiencies<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:27.000> is

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
look good you got proficiencies that is

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.380 
look good you got proficiencies that is
basically<00:05:27.540> gives<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.140> fourth<00:05:28.680> perk<00:05:29.390> which

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
basically gives you a fourth perk which

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.760 
basically gives you a fourth perk which
looks<00:05:30.930> pretty<00:05:31.070> amazing<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:34.050> know<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.200> even<00:05:34.590> had

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
looks pretty amazing you know I even had

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.710

80s a move at the same time and it's

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.760 
80s a move at the same time and it's
well<00:07:16.550> I<00:07:16.820> won't<00:07:17.540> be<00:07:17.690> able<00:07:17.840> to<00:07:18.020> do<00:07:18.170> that<00:07:18.320> but<00:07:18.590> you

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
well I won't be able to do that but you

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.670 
well I won't be able to do that but you

the<00:07:21.800> speed<00:07:22.160> is<00:07:22.310> not<00:07:22.490> reduced<00:07:22.700> so<00:07:23.570> that<00:07:23.600> that

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
the speed is not reduced so that that

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.350 
the speed is not reduced so that that
could<00:07:24.410> be<00:07:24.560> problematic<00:07:25.190> I<00:07:25.820> don't<00:07:26.000> know<00:07:26.090> and
