I<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:19.740> squares<00:01:20.100> as

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
I like to think of these squares as

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.460 
I like to think of these squares as
little<00:01:21.060> windows<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> table<00:01:22.170> cells<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
little windows into the table cells that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
little windows into the table cells that
they<00:01:22.590> represent<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> data<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
they represent so the data here is the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.330 
they represent so the data here is the
exact<00:01:24.869> same<00:01:25.020> data<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.530> you're<00:01:25.830> seeing<00:01:25.979> here

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
