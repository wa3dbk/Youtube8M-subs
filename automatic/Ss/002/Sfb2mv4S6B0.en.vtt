00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.180
 hello friends how are you I hope that very 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.410
 ok, this is the second video that 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.420
 I will upload now that you have returned 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.910
 because then I had some exams already 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.610
 I explained in the previous video 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.830
 a school exams and good 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.410
 Sorry for not uploading videos in that 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.779
 time now I will be fulfilled I will 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.419
 do week by week unless 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.350
 I have other very serious problems and it is 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.830
 I'm going to have to stop for a little while 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.170
 well the previous video was about a 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.450
 room was called there have been landslides are 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.650
 a very good very fluid based on stock 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.320
 but for those who do not like in the 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.809
 good course they want to change their bar 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.489
 the state will see that disappear 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.750
 like and uploading that video to change 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.100
 the status bar in blue and not 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.820
 I'm sure but I think it's 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.050
 transparent now that's for the gti 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:07.220
 8190 the eye once I say it I 'm not 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.770
 sure if all the models work 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.360
 I'm going to try it on this or I 'm not sure 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.700
 not even if this is going to work 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.390
 but most likely because it's the most 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 common 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.729
 good 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.440
 for this we are going to need clear the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.530
 adapter the micro sd what are we going to put 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.520
 Let's put the computer there 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.520
 that the beautiful entrance 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.110
 let's hope they recognize it 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.150
 let's open 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.930
 at home in the archives of biros de 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.330
 robots or dog 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.220
 but the night noise my little brother is 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.220
 watching movies good 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.310
 now let's pass it 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.780
 the zip file that I told them 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.780
 to memory 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.530
 let's copy it does not take long is very 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.530
 light weighs almost nothing 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.490
 now we get the memory 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.010
 we have the memory now we close this 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.010
 because it no longer serves us nothing is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.010
 stage 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.060
 lotina 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.709
 and the memory that we already had 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.709
 and now we put the new 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.350
 as I say sorry for the noise of 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.270
 wind and we overcome their movie 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.580
 for a little while for me to make my video 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.410
 sorry 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.410
 we plugged the phone again 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.810
 now let's go into the recovery mode 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.940
 I remind you of those who already know those who do not 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.640
 Well, let's go, I'll explain 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.080
 these modes to enter the recovery 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.800
 eyes volume up 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.230
 it's home and it's the power button 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.090
 shutdown or blocking 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.900
 all three at the same time until 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.970
 learn copper they are let go and we 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.900
 We wait until the phone alone 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.900
 in recovery section 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.400
 now that they are in recovery mode no 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.720
 let's do no wipe 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.720
 nothing else we are going to go to 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.940
 install inform yourself of a letter and I put it 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.430
 in the external I and encrypted do not outsource 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.110
 take the penultimate option those that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.650
 they put in the internal is the first 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.370
 option 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.610
 now blue status bar s 3 min and 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.540
 I wanted the file 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.900
 and we installed it 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.769
 since it's installed let's go back and 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.769
 bounces on now 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.010
 as we once did the installation a 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.020
 slight file will not take because not 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.150
 We put in the Navarrese that's not a 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.150
 first pot or it's nothing 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.400
 we are waiting for this that pledge 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.950
 we wait and wait 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.990
 this happens to us because we install something without 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:02.990
 do the whites do not worry 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.040

 the doubles also changed places 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.419
 worry the caste for 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:36.220
