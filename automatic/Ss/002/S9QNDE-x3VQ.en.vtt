00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 and it is called the power ethanol what we 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.750
 we have in the pumps of the gas stations 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.120
 It's the same product that we take to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 physics to supply the coffees to focus on 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.769
 the whole development of the concept of 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.949
 Paulo 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.220
 the shell v power ethanol came 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.529
 learning of the shell team along with the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.109
 team ferrari in formula 1 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.380
 bringing here for the car application 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.929
 says to play then when our 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.329
 consumer supplies a shell v power 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.090
 ethanol at gas stations 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.129
 thirty years supplying technology that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.160
 result of interaction with cars 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.440
 they also put us still 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 and strong in stock this year 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.940
 increasing our team to mattheis 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.550
 on this coming from continuing with val bm 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.969
 with one more member of the team that the powder is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.860
 of 4 with the shell brand and four with 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.190
 amarilys we people we continue with 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.289
 very large focus and rains on ethanol and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.270
 so it is very important that the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.450
 consumer knows that the same fuel 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.880
 and what he has here in the course that he 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.580
 supply here at the post he will find 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.979
 also in the post of history this shows 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.590
 which is a superquality fuel 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.150
 a fuel that in which it actually 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.259
 is different 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.780
 In addition, we are entering the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.770
 stock light and remain strong 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.650
 total 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.650
 a very happy bike with a 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.430
 signing this contract and returning to 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.500
 he only have a strong sponsor 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.490
 who has a dna in motorsport 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.289
 excellence of the 60 years sponsoring is 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.869
 racing and of great competitiveness 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.000
 how is formula 1 I am very happy in 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.250
 participate in this project and very happy 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.110
 will also return mattheis that I consider 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.289
 the best team to play a category 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.970
 so competitive and has a 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.369
 competitive team as well as the 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.179
 valdeno already in his 2nd year within the 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.340
 chance 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.440
 a guy who has had good results and 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.330
 Last year's victories so I got 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.069
 sure I have the same equipment 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.310
 that he the same equipment as the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.780
 champion car in this sum of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.000
 factors, I'm sure it's going to be a year 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.709
 very competitive and has a lot of 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.769
 hopeful with this first test in 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.489
 SÃ£o Paulo and the expectation is the best 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.090
 all 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.640
 I think it has even surpassed our 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.459
 expectations because we all know that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.880
 shock an extremely 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.280
 competitive 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.190
 not only the level of the pilots but of all 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.320
 the teams really level is something like this 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.549
 that it is difficult to see 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.310
 world motorsport 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.799
 but we did get those two victories 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.130
 we reached the last stage with 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.680
 chances of being champions and this 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.600
 continuity of this partnership agreement 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.850
 Now a little longer for the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.640
 security and tranquility for both 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.950
 team as the pilot work 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.530
 together in search of the best 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.870
 which consequently victory cheney 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.600
 this is really critical for 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.579
 people can have an even better year of 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.459
 That's the first and that's what I hope it is. 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:16.120
 This is what I ask so is this that I 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.989
 I hope the fans will be with us until 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.819
 on Sundays pushing with v power is the 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.299
 Our car then I think the year is going 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.299
 be very good
