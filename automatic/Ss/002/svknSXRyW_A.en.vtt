00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
kind of wrap it around your button and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.890 
kind of wrap it around your button and
try<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.130> tuck<00:02:37.090> these<00:02:37.299> little<00:02:37.570> ends

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
try and tuck these little ends

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.229 
try and tuck these little ends
underneath<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:39.010> my<00:02:39.250> opinion<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> last<00:02:39.820> step

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
underneath in my opinion the last step

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.970 
underneath in my opinion the last step
is<00:02:40.420> actually<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.870> trickiest<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.799> is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
is actually the trickiest and that is

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.770 
is actually the trickiest and that is
making<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.579> little<00:02:42.820> weird<00:02:43.180> loop<00:02:43.480> at<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
making that little weird loop at the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.810 
making that little weird loop at the
bottom<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.380> but<00:02:44.560> my<00:02:44.829> two<00:02:45.010> sections<00:02:45.610> tied

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
bottom of the but my two sections tied

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.190 
bottom of the but my two sections tied
together<00:02:46.000> I'm<00:02:46.299> just<00:02:46.450> loosening<00:02:46.660> them<00:02:47.019> up<00:02:47.110> a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
together I'm just loosening them up a

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.979 
together I'm just loosening them up a
little<00:02:47.350> bit<00:02:47.500> with<00:02:47.709> my<00:02:47.860> fingers<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:49.570> am

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
little bit with my fingers and I am

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.500 
little bit with my fingers and I am
going<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.350> just<00:02:50.739> make<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:52.739> Topsy<00:02:53.739> tail<00:02:54.510> with

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
going to just make a Topsy tail with

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.980 
going to just make a Topsy tail with
this<00:02:55.690> section

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
this section

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.810 
this section
so<00:02:57.830> I'm<00:02:58.070> just<00:02:58.690> folding<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.020> tail<00:03:00.200> through

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
so I'm just folding the tail through

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.370 
so I'm just folding the tail through
once<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:01.940> flip<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.360> take<00:03:03.080> your<00:03:03.230> little

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.140 
once you flip it take your little
ponytail<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:04.250> divide<00:03:04.520> it<00:03:04.700> into<00:03:04.850> two<00:03:05.150> pieces

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
ponytail and divide it into two pieces

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.240 
ponytail and divide it into two pieces
and<00:03:08.150> I've<00:03:09.020> got<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.260> little<00:03:09.530> styling<00:03:09.830> clipped

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
thing that I'm going to use on this

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.960 
thing that I'm going to use on this
section<00:03:12.530> while<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.890> work<00:03:13.070> on<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.400> first<00:03:13.640> one

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
section while I work on this first one

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.420 
section while I work on this first one
section<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.870> bend<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:16.130> tuck<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.300> ends
