description the first piece of hardware

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
description the first piece of hardware
I<00:00:34.290> added<00:00:34.649> was<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> very<00:00:35.399> simple<00:00:35.670> pc-style

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
I added was a very simple pc-style

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.680 
I added was a very simple pc-style
speaker<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:38.040> fixed<00:00:38.460> volume<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.090> variable

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
speaker with fixed volume and variable

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.590 
speaker with fixed volume and variable
frequency<00:00:40.370> generating<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.489> square<00:00:41.850> wave<00:00:42.030> form

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
frequency generating a square wave form

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.040 
frequency generating a square wave form
it's<00:00:43.440> mainly<00:00:43.739> useful<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.670> simple<00:00:45.059> beeps<00:00:45.270> but

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
it's mainly useful for simple beeps but

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.080 
it's mainly useful for simple beeps but
if<00:00:46.200> you're<00:00:46.350> talented<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.460> make<00:00:47.640> music

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
if you're talented you can make music

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.990 
if you're talented you can make music
with<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.420> too<00:00:48.750> here's<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> piano<00:00:50.160> application

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
with it too here's a piano application

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
with it too here's a piano application
using<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> keyboard<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.230> input<00:00:52.530> generating

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
using the keyboard for input generating

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.689 
using the keyboard for input generating
tones<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.750> use<00:00:54.960> these<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:56.190> rows<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
tones you can use these two rows of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.090 
tones you can use these two rows of
buttons<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.420> make<00:00:57.539> different<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.649> pitched

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
buttons to make different the pitched

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.960 
buttons to make different the pitched
tones<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.850> one<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.090> rows<00:01:04.729> in<00:01:05.729> this

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
tones so this is one of the rows in this

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.470 
tones so this is one of the rows in this
one's<00:01:06.180> higher

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.920 

you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.440> also<00:01:10.560> use<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.130> shift<00:01:11.370> key<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:12.720> make

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you can also use the shift key to make

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.090 
you can also use the shift key to make
this<00:01:13.140> row<00:01:13.500> even<00:01:14.190> higher<00:01:14.400> pitched<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.860> one

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
this row even higher pitched or this one

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.480 
this row even higher pitched or this one
even<00:01:17.370> lower<00:01:17.730> pitched<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.740> use<00:01:26.250> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
even lower pitched and you can use this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.790 
even lower pitched and you can use this
like<00:01:26.730> a<00:01:26.760> regular<00:01:27.060> piano<00:01:27.810> although<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:28.560> can

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
like a regular piano although you can

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.940 
like a regular piano although you can
only<00:01:28.950> press<00:01:29.370> one<00:01:29.700> key<00:01:29.730> at<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> same<00:01:30.300> time<00:01:30.950> you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
only press one key at the same time you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.370 
only press one key at the same time you
can<00:01:32.190> make<00:01:32.400> different<00:01:33.000> tones<00:01:33.690> at<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.170> same

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
can make different tones at the same

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.720 
can make different tones at the same
time<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.690> if<00:01:36.690> you're<00:01:37.170> talented<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:37.800> all<00:01:38.010> you

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
time and if you're talented at all you

00:01:38.730 --> 00:02:11.660 
time and if you're talented at all you
can<00:01:39.090> play<00:01:39.690> them<00:01:39.960> simple<00:01:40.950> tunes

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:27.910 

you

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.679 

the<00:02:28.920> second<00:02:29.280> device<00:02:29.609> i<00:02:29.879> programmed<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.629> a

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
the second device i programmed is a

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.989 
the second device i programmed is a
virtual<00:02:31.230> serial<00:02:31.499> port<00:02:32.040> which<00:02:32.609> is<00:02:32.790> very

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:32.999 
virtual serial port which is very

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.089 
virtual serial port which is very
flexible<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.780> allows<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.439> lot<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.859> new<00:02:35.069> things

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
flexible and allows a lot of new things

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.360 
flexible and allows a lot of new things
to<00:02:35.639> do<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.139> uses<00:02:37.139> the<00:02:37.170> emulator<00:02:37.709> programs

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
to do it uses the emulator programs

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.429 
to do it uses the emulator programs
standard<00:02:39.090> input<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.719> output<00:02:40.200> for

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
standard input and output for

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.009 
standard input and output for
communication<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.909> you<00:02:41.969> can<00:02:42.239> connect<00:02:42.599> it<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.989> a

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
communication so you can connect it to a

a press keys in this window and it will

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.699 
a press keys in this window and it will

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:44.800 

it's<00:03:37.709> very<00:03:38.370> simple<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:39.060> doesn't<00:03:39.590> do<00:03:40.590> much<00:03:40.799> I

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.569 

thought<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.870> would<00:03:46.199> be<00:03:46.409> fun<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.799> be<00:03:46.919> able<00:03:47.250> to

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
thought it would be fun to be able to

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.360 
thought it would be fun to be able to
control<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.209> real<00:03:48.689> life<00:03:48.930> turret<00:03:49.349> like<00:03:49.979> you<00:03:50.220> will

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
control a real life turret like you will

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.670 
control a real life turret like you will
probably<00:03:50.669> be<00:03:51.120> able<00:03:51.449> to<00:03:51.599> do<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.199> game<00:03:52.439> or

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
probably be able to do in the game or

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.879 
probably be able to do in the game or
x10<00:03:53.400> see<00:03:53.669> this<00:03:54.599> is<00:03:54.780> easily<00:03:55.019> achieved<00:03:55.620> by

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
x10 see this is easily achieved by

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.679 
x10 see this is easily achieved by

emulators serial output look this is the
