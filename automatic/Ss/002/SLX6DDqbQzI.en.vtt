 I will say for fans of this series, I know 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.230
 that the game deserves first place but 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.510
 because we are talking about the subject 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.760
 cosmos means in the game this should be 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.440
 paid more attention and he stark hud 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.160

 gets a great battlefront game and this 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.340
 the only full-fledged shooter from 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.410
 the first person in this top is pretty 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.500
 typical shooter gameplay which lapped and 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.709
 more accurately built based on the battlefield 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.720
 1942 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.489
 but in the Star Wars universe about the most 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.380
 different planets as well in the game have 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.269
 mod in which you can create your 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.950
 cards in the game give you the opportunity to become 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.750
 not only attack aircraft who have 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.850
 several different classes but also 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.190
 Jedi in the game the main thing is the capture of points 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.989
 and the more points captured the more convenient 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.330
 you play for example you can choose 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.310
 which point will appear as well as the point 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.580
 generates combat equipment the game has 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.739
 good continuation bronze and dead space 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.780
 which translates as lifeless 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.470
 space they are dead space or 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.090
 space 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.670
 it's a third person shooter with elements 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.769
 horror you play for character and ziko 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.540
 who wanders the ship from which he was 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.310
 sent a distress call to shuttle 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.140
 which they flew explode and 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.060
 now through the monsters you need 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.310
 restore the work of this very ship 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.519
 the game is cool and is currently released 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.950
 already three parts the second line mass effect 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.090
 role-playing thriller released file and which 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.950
 actively support 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.290
 gays even changed their logo in honor 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.830
 gay parade and these lovely headlines on 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.800
 kanobu 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.959
 ah but we moved away from the topic of the game itself 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.549
 with a very good game, even the main 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.470
 the hero of the game won the hero award 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.510
 generations from gambling gameplay 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.199
 pretty typical it is also a shooter from 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.210
 third person 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.520
 but this is far from dead space 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.949
 various abilities that resemble 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.810
 magic but it is not like throwing 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.669
 opponents in the last game you can 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.699
 actively influence the ending 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.919
 and the winner today is really 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.169
 unexpected is space invaders in 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.590
 redeployed space invaders released 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.660

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.710
 sold machines only in Japan but 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.840

 sell these machines in the us 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.630
 the game was so good 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.850
 successful which caused a shortage of 100 coins 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.130
 yen the game has a bunch of remakes and even 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.320
 the sequels also the game has affected the culture 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.120
 especially the image of the alien but 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.250
 about this you can read Wikipedia 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.110

 called her the best arcade game 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.520
