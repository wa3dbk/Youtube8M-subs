00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.260
 Now his team would come via call of 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.150
 Duty transport in the archive video again 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.349
 around axl skeletons and although im is now 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.759
 officially confirmed curtain again 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.739
 have excellent multiplayer 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.060
 that's been suspected for a very long time 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.439
 form of many people among others 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.550
 also from me but some people so 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.810
 still in doubt 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.339
 but now it is really official 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.960
 the skeletons have been confirmed 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.640
 multiplayer will have the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.800
 Information comes from youtuber drift 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.720
 and he has a phone call with 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.240
 Michael had a trick and Mike Comrie 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.620
 works swimmer games so you can 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.840
 really believe the information because 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.450
 yes is just what officially published 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.250
 brand was quasi the exoskeleton 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.470
 in the multiplayer of call of duty trance 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.850
 but they will be 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.110
 that one must still similar to much to 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.430
 as with the previous call of duty 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.750
 share and that is also a few 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.660
 There are a few changes 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.310
 but that still feels like 90's 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.750
 like before that is now that one 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.980
 still recognizes that it is call of duty 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.930
 is and very important now 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.340
 point I think was with me personally 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.140
 Almost a bit to me at that 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.759
 singleplayer trailer so the single 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.020
 I have a player gameplay 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.310
 made little worry because I've got 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.859
 not really call of duty metrics 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.210
 seen and that and me in change 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:14.799
 good in itself but i should find myself 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.119
 still feel like call of duty 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.819
 this is very important for everyone 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.799
 me and loud macaulay it does now 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.359
 were still so out of the man michael 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.649
 let's be honest that the exo 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.329
 skeleton in multiplayer does not have power 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.670
 time that they are really very 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.439
 I 'm trying a lot to finance everything 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.209
 let me and I can really 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.679
 very well imagine because he has the advantage 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.789
 in the new developer studio is on everyone 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.950
 case that the first a bit 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.689
 bring in new ideas and fresh wind 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.639
 and to ensure that they really secondly 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.439
 try not to do anything wrong so 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:43.479
 Games, for example, really show you right 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.069
 that's really extreme on the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.719
 community hear that no other 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.579
 developer studio in call of duty else 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.289
 So they are really great 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.549
 motivated and very hardworking and trying 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.539
 really doing everything right and 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.819
 really good game 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.709
 and the brand barely 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.270
 said that it already now begin to 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.950
 try all that remains poised 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 that they almost no later 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.709
 Weapons patch is something to bring out 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.829
 we have everything perfect now 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.969
 is balanced and it is so tina 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.320
 games of four really that you 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.970
 try to let everything happen 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.620
 and of course they know what they are 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.819
 for a responsibility and you 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.349
 have really new things now 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.569
 thus introduced the laser weapons and 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.950
 I can really only do something like that 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.959
 imagine that the whole thing is balanced 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.189
 leave because yes it really is there 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.989
 everyone will look at it now 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.609
 and that's why I tend to think that this 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.889
 laser weapons he will be too weak 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.239
 as too strong on that is me so provided 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.650
 For example , we are weapons now 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.930
 Crossbow or something like that I could be very 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.030
 imagine that's almost it such 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.829
 are weapons and then I have too 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.150
 heard that these laser weapons above all 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.409
 things can be very strong killstreaks 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.480
 maybe so that too, so to speak 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.650
 then he anyway 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.030
 why the thing so to speak just that one 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.549
 So with laser weapons on very well 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.900
 killstreaks but that is now people 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.310
 so that you will not be really good later 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.719
 So that can go with that maybe there 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.760
 a fully automatic weapon even 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.530
 easier to use is yes now wanted 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.209
 get the information that existed 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.500
 you can also be in multiplayer 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.430
 had of course say again because 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.260
 I've done that again 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.209
 that it can be very good that we 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.799
 proxy multiplayer will have the quasi 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.359
 for the access key world power made 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.359
 are so to speak in the updates for the 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.680
 exoskeleton the whole thing will be like that again 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.840
 a bit confirmed and knows 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.000
 it now in single player so that you 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.549
 after each mission you can update eulex 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.560
 that they are almost always new 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.699
 upgrade for the exoskeleton gets the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.500
 yes, it's almost like that already 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.549
 little bit the idea behind it and there could 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.840
 I imagine very well that now 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.040
 I park mine in the multiplayer 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.079
 now you have the skeleton already in 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.549
 You do not make multiplayer tree then 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.199
 directly the perks for that would be pointless 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.489
 there again works for the player himself 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.870
 to do that that could now yes 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.669
 first really make sense with the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.349
 perks used to be that way 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.689
 So, why can he do that now ? 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.040
 Math is this skill but now it is 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.900
 yes really that way you just 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.250
 played the exoskeleton does that 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.530
 Do you really get it right ? 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.519
 I think it makes sense and that's why you can 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.019
 Imagine every case that we can 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.030
 now also perks for the exoskeleton in 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.930
 multiplayer will have but with it 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.989
 no official information yet 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.009
 yes it's over somehow 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.959
 I just wanted to say it for a very short time 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.280
 inform about it because some people 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.689
 still say that it exists 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.519
 but only in singleplayer will be 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.930
 only now officially confirmed 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.120
 that they will also be in multiplayer 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.040
 and that's definitely a small one 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.620
 difference in the movement so there are up 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.789
 in each case new movement possibilities 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.709
 come about through it 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:13.269
 but as I said in the market would have come 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.709
 which is specially said do everything possible 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.659
 that the balance stays and not 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.310
 is overboard and that is where I have 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.419
 also confidential chamber games he 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.459
 please write me what you think about it 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.110
 from this exoskeleton in the multiplayer 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.639
 yes and now what has fallen to me 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.330
 very happy with others 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.330
 that's it for today
