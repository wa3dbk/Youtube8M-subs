00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.429
 It should not just be easy to put on 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.429
 Thier that is probably the here 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.800
 same 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.019
 male 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.710
 Early 30th 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 Bullet holes in the head and upper body 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.890
 interesting case 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.150
 I thought 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.400
 that would be pure routine yes that thought the ORS of the place of discovery the death certificate 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.160
 probably filtered out too 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.040
 but this serve to notice that the corpse has no blood at all 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.630
 the actual cause of death 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.820
 was a completely different one 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.390
 I'm curious Rostocker did not care that interested 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.790
 too complicated 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.230
 finally an interesting case and Piech is just to wash the corpse 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 what would 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 I had the cause of death 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.630
 the Great 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.680
 inwardly 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.180
 the Great 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.590
 but completely safe from the outside 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.790
 but she already knows that 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.890
 in this 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.210
 Henri Hausen is in any case expelled in March 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.290
 Weinzinger in the text leaves 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 probably this is an accident covered up here 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 his things are over there 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 Engineer I would have liked too 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.130
 I have a knack for that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130
 Many people know that in my free time I make inventions 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.530
 Yes / Yes 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.130
 my father pushed me into medical school 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.880
 He always said a golden craft 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.260
 and what did it bring me? 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.990
 a rundown apartment in the street with a lot of street and a job just coli 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.990
 the company 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.769
 Yuma 22 then into the cool father 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.949
 because a nice day 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.259
 also Mark r 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.749
 I could still do it nice 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.749
 but I do not want that 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 this case had a passerby the superstar 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.509
 Dr 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.609
 more the
