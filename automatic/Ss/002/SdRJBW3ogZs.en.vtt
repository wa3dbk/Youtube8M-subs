00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.850
 complicated 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.240
 everything is but closing on opening 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.670

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.380

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.850
 there is a mirror 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.520
 but not often enough 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.310
 grocery store second sponge 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.560
 quite so comfortable 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.250
 he certainly small well, that's me 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:42.040
 like the texture itself 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:44.020
 this is rubberized ready new items and 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.560
 foam chick don't know maybe someone knows how 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:52.710
 Correctly called I write to me 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:57.490

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:05.240
 my shadows to torture 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:11.710
 black and white sphere agama article 50 154 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.710
 and now I will show how they come 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:25.300
 it is a little bit not in Russian charged on 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:31.300
 they are very pigmented they are all 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:34.480
 shine mean this one here comes with 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.260
 large nacre all the rest well 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.110
 rather shimmer they are all evenly 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:45.340
 shiny here on the fingers 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:50.020
 and here's the arm how they give enough 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.770
 not bad give light to me they like to 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.350
 eyes they do not roll down folds not 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.050
 achieve that the prince is 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.330
 the distinctive feature of exactly baked 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.730
 shadows they are very well pigmented we 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.430
 it is already seen they can be applied as 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.310
 tusim so and in a wet way here it is 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.840
 dry right to think it will be wet 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.430
 even brighter 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.110
 dipped in the same chimney tassel well 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.330
 That's as regards wet application 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.670
 such I manage to direct 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.330
 Arrows is a window of the river . here 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.980
 feathering sponge is obtained a 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.020
 tassel 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.590
 Wet blending fails 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:47.260
 On principle, this is logical here 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:51.010
 mini review on some shadows in general 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:55.200

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.600
 public in the body all flights period of history 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.510
 the only drawback we upakovochek 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.700
