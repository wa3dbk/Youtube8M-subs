00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
we age get a lot of extra tissue under

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.970 
we age get a lot of extra tissue under
here<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.570> most<00:00:46.469> people<00:00:46.770> think

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
here and as we do it most people think

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.389 
here and as we do it most people think
it<00:00:47.190> looks<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.789> bat<00:00:48.120> wings<00:00:48.350> now<00:00:49.399> sometimes

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
it looks like bat wings now sometimes

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.939 
it looks like bat wings now sometimes
just<00:00:50.730> genetic<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.870> sometimes<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.530> waylaid

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
just genetic but sometimes it's waylaid

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.549 
just genetic but sometimes it's waylaid
to<00:00:52.980> weight<00:00:53.280> changes<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:55.020> getting<00:00:55.230> older

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
to weight changes or just getting older

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.670 
to weight changes or just getting older
so<00:00:56.489> sometimes<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.390> loose<00:00:57.629> skin<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> when

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
so sometimes it's loose skin and when

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
so sometimes it's loose skin and when
it's<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:59.010> loose<00:00:59.190> skin<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.750> use

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's just loose skin then we can use

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.139 
it's just loose skin then we can use
Thermage<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.980> Thermage<00:01:02.399> does<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> great<00:01:03.090> job

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
Thermage and Thermage does a great job

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.280 
Thermage and Thermage does a great job
of<00:01:04.580> tightening<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> skin<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> reducing<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
of tightening the skin and reducing the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.359 
of tightening the skin and reducing the
amount<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.799> looseness<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.780> also

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
amount of looseness that we see it also

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.090 
amount of looseness that we see it also
gives<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.549> some<00:01:11.820> immediate<00:01:12.600> type<00:01:12.840> results<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
gives you some immediate type results so

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.719 
gives you some immediate type results so
if<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.330> got<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> shot<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> iPad<00:01:16.729> okay

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
if we if we got a shot of the iPad okay

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.800 
if we if we got a shot of the iPad okay
so<00:01:18.720> here's<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.290> great<00:01:19.950> Thermage<00:01:20.400> case<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.240> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so here's a great Thermage case and you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
so here's a great Thermage case and you
can<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.909> look<00:01:24.090> closely

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
you can see the improvement and the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
you can see the improvement and the
wrinkles<00:01:26.400> under<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.540> what's<00:01:27.720> really

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
wrinkles under here but what's really

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.370 
wrinkles under here but what's really
amazing<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:29.040> how<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:29.759> different<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.110> width

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
amazing is how much different the width

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.270 
amazing is how much different the width
of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> arm<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.630> after<00:01:33.630> we've<00:01:33.840> done<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.380> work

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
of the arm is after we've done the work

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.190 
of the arm is after we've done the work
that's<00:01:35.790> pretty<00:01:36.060> drastic<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:37.110> not

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that's pretty drastic because that's not

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
that's pretty drastic because that's not
only<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.619> luke<00:01:37.860> skin<00:01:38.369> we're<00:01:38.729> talking<00:01:38.939> about

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
only just luke skin we're talking about

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.429 
only just luke skin we're talking about
the<00:01:39.150> crepeiness<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.840> appearance<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the crepeiness the appearance and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.050 
the crepeiness the appearance and
texture<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> real

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
texture and it can make a real

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
texture and it can make a real
difference<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> course<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.380> watch<00:01:43.560> has

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
difference and of course the watch has

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.100 
difference and of course the watch has
no<00:01:43.920> downtime<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> these

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
no downtime and we see some of these

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.889 
no downtime and we see some of these
results<00:01:46.320> immediate<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.729> arms<00:01:48.180> really

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
results immediate but on the arms really

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
results immediate but on the arms really
at<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.229> six<00:01:49.560> months<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.280> really

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
at about six months is when we really

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.789 
at about six months is when we really
start<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.149> difference<00:01:51.390> now<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.439> lot<00:01:52.770> of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
start to see a difference now a lot of
