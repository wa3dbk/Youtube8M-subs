00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
down trees without removing the presents

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.940 
down trees without removing the presents
and<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.230> keeps<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> presence

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and if that if that keeps the presence

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.410 
and if that if that keeps the presence
there<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.370> might<00:00:35.579> keep<00:00:35.700> some<00:00:35.760> presents<00:00:36.329> in

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
