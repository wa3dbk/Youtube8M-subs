those two production bringing those
writers<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.610> involved<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
writers in to be involved that was the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
writers in to be involved that was the
bulk<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.200> my<00:00:43.230> job<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
bulk of my job when I was there and I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
bulk of my job when I was there and I
think<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.780> probably<00:00:45.930> largely<00:00:46.379> still<00:00:46.860> true

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
think that's probably largely still true

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.380 
think that's probably largely still true
but<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.550> quickly<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> air<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
but I think as quickly as the air the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.060 
but I think as quickly as the air the
industry<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.809> changing<00:00:48.899> those<00:00:49.469> roles<00:00:49.770> are

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
industry is changing those roles are

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.490 
industry is changing those roles are
transforming<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.120> quickly<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.989> then

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
transforming just as quickly and then

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200 
transforming just as quickly and then
and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> Leo<00:00:53.430> DiCaprio<00:00:53.610> after

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and then it was a Leo DiCaprio after

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.110 
and then it was a Leo DiCaprio after
that<00:00:54.480> yeah<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.430> goal<00:00:56.610> ones<00:00:56.789> company

and 20 scripts / weekend yeah reading

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.970 
and 20 scripts / weekend yeah reading
i'd<00:02:35.700> say<00:02:36.000> between<00:02:36.050> eight<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> ten<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.590> those<00:02:37.739> in

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
i'd say between eight to ten of those in

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.190 
i'd say between eight to ten of those in
full<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.489> then<00:02:38.670> reading<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> others<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.780> part

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
full and then reading the others in part

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.320 
full and then reading the others in part
usually<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.280> part<00:02:41.519> enough<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.000> know<00:02:42.150> whether

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
usually in part enough to know whether

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.110 
usually in part enough to know whether
or<00:02:42.420> not<00:02:42.510> they<00:02:42.750> were<00:02:42.810> good<00:02:43.019> or<00:02:43.050> not<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:45.030> know

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
it's hard to say and i think in

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.040 
it's hard to say and i think in
retrospect<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.550> always<00:02:47.910> remember<00:02:48.569> having

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
retrospect you always remember having

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.440 
retrospect you always remember having
read<00:02:49.319> more<00:02:49.530> than<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.830> probably<00:02:49.950> did<00:02:50.459> but<00:02:50.819> you

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
