 heard this song melody experts for 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.290
 us just clings to the brain quickly 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.330

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.280
 viewers in Kazakhstan in fact 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.590

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.069
 happiness from a visit to Kazakhstan 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.180
 what I heard and read on the Internet 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.310
 Kazakhstan, I think what a show 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.419
 inspiration 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.499
 there is no case yet 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.439

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.579
 Forum Markin We note that previously says that 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.930
 as an example the experience of a number of cultural values 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.469
 And children on there itself risky idea 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.560
 make about travel 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.019
 belongs to the whole world of aziz 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.180
 scene hour of work a lot of fat 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.649
 capitalism 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.460
 the musicians are the players themselves 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.320
 month-leading list 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.500
 included all in great demand 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.120
 same time of midnight 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.960
 in the traditional in our version should 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.419
 be 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.849
 that's about it we just thought that 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.649
 if it will cost 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:02.189
 Well, everyone will be there for eight hours 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.839
 let it be Kazakhstan 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.949
 option so from but at some point he 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.389
 can do what they want 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.479
 kiosk is very hard because 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.409
 In brocking processing songs you would but 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.399
 fashion trends family to do 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.399

 fans don't want to live 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.080
 The official motive of the Kazan club is to 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.080
 understand what the great abai wrote about 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.919
 as a result of the Gorbachev order and 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.339
 should recognize that 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.039
 all this as the valleys of the seventh channel say 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.079
