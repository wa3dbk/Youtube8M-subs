I<00:00:02.480> have<00:00:03.480> there<00:00:03.659> in<00:00:03.750> TV<00:00:03.899> land<00:00:04.049> Joe<00:00:04.950> Fisher

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
I have there in TV land Joe Fisher

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.940 
I have there in TV land Joe Fisher
backing<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.899> I've<00:00:06.899> got<00:00:07.109> my<00:00:07.259> brew<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.620> jammies

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
backing in I've got my brew and jammies

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.759 
backing in I've got my brew and jammies
on<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.990> we're<00:00:09.990> gonna<00:00:10.080> talk<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.290> spending

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
on and we're gonna talk about spending

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.150 
on and we're gonna talk about spending
valves<00:00:11.250> today<00:00:12.469> that's<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> thing<00:00:13.950> right

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
valves today that's this thing right

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.590 
valves today that's this thing right
here<00:00:14.540> basically<00:00:15.540> all<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:17.600> gas

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
here basically all it is is a gas

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.769 
here basically all it is is a gas
quick-connect<00:00:19.670> it<00:00:20.670> steeped<00:00:21.119> into<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.510> gauge

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
quick-connect it steeped into a gauge

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.769 
quick-connect it steeped into a gauge
for<00:00:22.140> pressure<00:00:22.410> gauge<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.449> then<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
for pressure gauge and then this is a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.279 
for pressure gauge and then this is a
pressure<00:00:25.080> relief<00:00:25.470> valve<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> when<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
pressure relief valve so when the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
pressure relief valve so when the
pressure<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.890> side<00:00:29.630> gets<00:00:30.630> passed<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
pressure on this side gets passed the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.799 
pressure on this side gets passed the
setting<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.489> relieves<00:00:32.880> gas<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
setting here it relieves gas out the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.979 
setting here it relieves gas out the
vent<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.969> what<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> originally<00:00:36.480> made<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> for

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
vent and what I originally made it for

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.139 
vent and what I originally made it for
was<00:00:37.260> pressure<00:00:37.620> fermenting<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.739> Rehema<00:00:41.149> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
was pressure fermenting in the Rehema so

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:51.680 
was pressure fermenting in the Rehema so
I'll<00:00:42.570> attach<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:47.870> tri<00:00:48.870> clamp<00:00:50.690> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
I'll attach this with a tri clamp so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.229 
I'll attach this with a tri clamp so
we've<00:00:51.809> got<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> post<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.699> that'll<00:00:53.969> attach

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
we've got a post here so that'll attach

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
we've got a post here so that'll attach
to<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> top<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> brew<00:00:55.860> Hima

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
to the top of the brew Hima

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.240 
to the top of the brew Hima
and<00:00:56.719> then<00:00:57.719> towards<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> end<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.530> fermentation

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and then towards the end of fermentation

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.250 
and then towards the end of fermentation
it'll<00:01:00.559> it'll<00:01:01.559> ferment<00:01:01.829> under<00:01:02.219> pressure<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
it'll it'll ferment under pressure and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.630 
it'll it'll ferment under pressure and
there<00:01:04.260> were<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.470> sorts<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.920> benefits<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
there were all sorts of benefits to that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.870 
there were all sorts of benefits to that
that<00:01:05.820> we'll<00:01:05.939> talk<00:01:06.060> about<00:01:06.299> another<00:01:06.510> time<00:01:07.880> right

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that we'll talk about another time right

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
that we'll talk about another time right
now<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.330> we're<00:01:09.420> gonna<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> use

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
now what we're gonna do is going to use

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.310 
now what we're gonna do is going to use
to<00:01:10.409> jump<00:01:10.710> already<00:01:11.100> carbonated<00:01:11.880> beer<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:13.140> one

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to jump already carbonated beer from one

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
to jump already carbonated beer from one
keg<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.770> another<00:01:14.040> without<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> lot<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.640> foaming

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
keg to another without a lot of foaming

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.950 
keg to another without a lot of foaming
and<00:01:16.070> whatnot<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:18.119> also<00:01:18.450> what<00:01:18.869> we

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and whatnot and that's also what we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
and whatnot and that's also what we
would<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.290> when<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.799> transfer<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
would do when we transfer out of the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.660 
would do when we transfer out of the
brew<00:01:21.000> hema<00:01:21.240> 'the<00:01:21.860> after<00:01:22.860> pressure<00:01:23.100> fermenting

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
brew hema 'the after pressure fermenting

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
brew hema 'the after pressure fermenting
because<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.630> bureau<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.259> some

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
because the bureau will have some

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.200 
because the bureau will have some
carbonation<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.549> fermenting<00:01:27.000> under

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
carbonation in it from fermenting under

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480 
carbonation in it from fermenting under
pressure<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:28.009> like<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.130> would<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.460> put

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
pressure just like it would if you put

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.700 
pressure just like it would if you put
the<00:01:29.700> beer<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> keg<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.420> put<00:01:30.570> co2<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the beer to keg and put co2 on it it's a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.300 
the beer to keg and put co2 on it it's a
very<00:01:31.890> similar<00:01:32.100> idea<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.860> we're<00:01:34.979> gonna<00:01:35.040> do

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
very similar idea so what we're gonna do

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.590 
very similar idea so what we're gonna do
is<00:01:35.520> we're<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> use<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> jumper

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
is we're going to use a jumper

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.550 
is we're going to use a jumper
between<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> two<00:01:37.380> kegs<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.900> all<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.290> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
between the two kegs and all that is is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.210 
between the two kegs and all that is is
a<00:01:41.070> length<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> hose<00:01:42.470> with<00:01:43.470> two<00:01:43.740> liquid<00:01:44.100> out

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
a length of hose with two liquid out

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.359 
a length of hose with two liquid out
connects<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:46.520> and

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.200 

so<00:01:53.359> the<00:01:53.509> idea<00:01:53.840> is<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.729> beer<00:01:58.969> won't

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
so the idea is that the the beer won't

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.410 
so the idea is that the the beer won't
flow<00:01:59.539> until<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.079> pressure<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.560> here<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.069> lower

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
flow until the pressure in here is lower

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.749 
flow until the pressure in here is lower
than<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.569> pressure<00:02:02.780> in<00:02:03.049> here<00:02:03.319> and<00:02:03.609> right<00:02:04.609> now

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
than the pressure in here and right now

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:05.950 
than the pressure in here and right now
the<00:02:04.819> pressure<00:02:05.090> in<00:02:05.240> here<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.539> lower<00:02:05.780> because

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
the pressure in here is lower because

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.719 
the pressure in here is lower because
I've<00:02:06.200> playing<00:02:06.500> with<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:07.310> vented<00:02:07.640> a

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
I've playing with it and I vented a

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:28.510 
I've playing with it and I vented a
bunch<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.090> pressure

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.150 

but<00:02:28.990> if<00:02:29.990> we<00:02:30.140> wanted<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.500> stop<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.920> flow<00:02:31.130> of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
but if we wanted to stop the flow of

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.940 
but if we wanted to stop the flow of
beer<00:02:31.720> we<00:02:32.720> would<00:02:32.900> Bend<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.470> pressure<00:02:33.740> from

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
beer we would Bend the pressure from

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.520 
beer we would Bend the pressure from
here<00:02:37.750> then<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> beer<00:02:39.050> would<00:02:39.140> go<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.410> wrong

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
here then the beer would go the wrong

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.380 
here then the beer would go the wrong
way<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.610> I'm<00:02:40.730> going<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.880> hook<00:02:41.030> up<00:02:41.180> some

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
way so I'm going to hook up some

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.660 
way so I'm going to hook up some
pressure<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:43.070> is<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.250> first<00:02:43.460> time

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
pressure to here this is the first time

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.210 
pressure to here this is the first time
I'm<00:02:43.790> doing<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.120> by<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.330> way<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.050> all

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
I'm doing this by the way so this is all

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:56.839 
I'm doing this by the way so this is all
experimentation

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.880 

obviously<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.749> beer<00:02:57.930> started<00:02:58.409> moving<00:02:58.709> from

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
obviously the beer started moving from

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.649 
obviously the beer started moving from
this<00:02:59.010> keg<00:02:59.280> but<00:02:59.519> into<00:02:59.909> this<00:03:00.030> keg<00:03:00.269> which<00:03:00.480> is

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
this keg but into this keg which is

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:10.990 
this keg but into this keg which is
exactly<00:03:01.049> what<00:03:01.230> I'm<00:03:01.319> looking<00:03:01.590> for

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.760 

and<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.120> I've<00:03:12.240> reached<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.600> point<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
and now I've reached the point that the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.570 
and now I've reached the point that the
valve<00:03:13.980> here<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:15.510> releasing<00:03:16.050> pressure<00:03:16.580> so

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
valve here is is releasing pressure so

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.250 
valve here is is releasing pressure so
that's<00:03:17.760> good<00:03:18.000> that's<00:03:18.840> what<00:03:19.050> I'm<00:03:19.110> looking<00:03:19.380> for

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
that's good that's what I'm looking for

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.140 
that's good that's what I'm looking for
and<00:03:22.260> that's<00:03:22.440> it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
and that's it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.449 
and that's it
we're<00:03:24.720> all<00:03:24.840> done

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.330 

so<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.580> is<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:32.849> experimentation<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.340> you

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
so this is just experimentation and you

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.220 
so this is just experimentation and you
know<00:03:35.459> testing<00:03:36.390> things<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.810> thought<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.080> might

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
know testing things I thought you might

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.220 
know testing things I thought you might
like<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.440> see<00:03:37.709> what<00:03:37.920> goes<00:03:38.099> on<00:03:38.280> here<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.900> in

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
like to see what goes on here in the in

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.270 
like to see what goes on here in the in
the<00:03:40.349> lab<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:41.340> their<00:03:41.580> blue<00:03:41.700> house<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.890> you

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280
