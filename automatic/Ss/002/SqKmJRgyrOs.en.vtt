00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:12.539
 what happens when the filling material is flushed out for attention 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:13.339
 next 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.359
 this decisive lateral 'present injury perry and russell brand said to be ready 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.130
 to sinop 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.249
 the final percent radiography 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.769
 shows the material is leaking through a lateral channel and over obturation 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 of the main channel 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.149
 on the six-year radiography the channel will or can no longer be distinguished 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.220
 the reduction of heat 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.220
 in large quantity of material 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 in response to the population 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 with the consent of the patient was made worse 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.090
 after taking radiographs with 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.180
 ninety degrees the former president was cytologically processed 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.980
 the increase of 24 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.200
 that it is only of material with an apparent empty space 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.300
 informant of the adjacent 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.040
 part of the injury the rating of the cimpor 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.759
 the canine 5,000 cells of foreign body cancer cells 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.460
 of bikini lymphocytes 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.189
 the bottom of the figure shows the microcity 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.830
 and the so-called fibrous capsule with cells 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.150
 inflammation in the upper lip to brown staining for the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.350
 I do not like bacteria 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.000
 does not have this to colonization in the area had calm 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.710
 the small particles present are of cement 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.890
 similar to those found within 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.810
 clinical considerations 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 material of operation in the region would blame the une closet 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 information in a sawing reaction 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.850
 despite the absence of pain 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.930
 the x-ray for this first molar inferior monkey pepper 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.360
 shows about the declaration of the distal radius 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.770
 support I am today that demonstrates the tissue response 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.010
 in the pictures then on the right we have material and have been refused in the area of 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.880
 contact 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 the inflammatory response that already felt ecological is demonstrated in the cut 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200
 lower left 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.919
 this upper lateral incisors was operated by harps and radiotherapic 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.199
 culture radiography has 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.429
 shows the lesion would have 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:19.699
 the histological cut shows the material slightly beyond an outside forced me 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.959
 on the left side he falls short of the maple 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.979
 on the right side it extends beyond the abc 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.929
 the periapical tissue presents information 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.399
 lateral canals current meanings 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:35.699
 has been clearly demonstrated to be biologically undesirable 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.349
 material through lateral channels and quay qualifications 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:44.559
 some throughout the titus stated that with my mind this method indicates a 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.779
 superior technique of endodontic treatment 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:51.419
 we will show that this procedure is not correct indicates a lack of 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.989
 biological knowledge 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.129
 the condition have been changed by the sides and these actions 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.860
 reflect the condition of the channel 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.949
 Jose Claudio 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.949
 this lower first molar is willing to act 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.530
 the track reduced because of 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.149
 pathological house 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.289
 the cut I am today with shows traffic condition 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:13.779
 Rodriguez Carvalho 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.879
 the highest flow increase 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.879
 he speculated on the wall of his bed 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.929
 this concentration of neutrophils 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:30.049
 paulo no jacintinho 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.129
 the third mandate 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.709
 the horse will have the site an area 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.629
 concentration 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.710
 position reflects the position 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.800
 the main channel 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.819
 and concentration 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.819
 diminished approaching the periodontal ligament 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.550
 the most commonly located channel 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.529
 I did not like 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:54.019
 figures drop out of a main channel area where there is smooth information 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.139
 the situation is critical 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.629
 not in shape 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.629
 each will have a chance 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.019
 who also do not appear left 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.019
 the emptiness and the prisons 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:18.699
 channels that have left the main channel are located in 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.710
 the chemicals 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.889
 interested parties will 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.889
 looking for the sides 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.569
 it is very small 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.080
 concentration 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.249
 on leaving the car 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.210
 paul rudd has indicated 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.349
 already in the right-hand side 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.400
 the blue formation 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400
 we insist that the study 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.729
 ninety degrees 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.120
 irrigation will be partially efficient 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.120
 even without being sworn in 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.840
 if these chemicals are strong enough to eliminate 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.309
 bacteria 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:05.309
 they will also affect severely affected 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.629
 the removal of bacteria from the pipe root 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:10.610
 the classification 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.409
 will only be partial 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.159
 during the calculation 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.749
 I reside
