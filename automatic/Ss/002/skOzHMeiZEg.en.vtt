00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.210
 so that's actually my stove 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:11.420
 so it is made of propane 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:16.190
 cylinder sawn cap made here 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.859
 there is a viewing window 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.519
 inside you know that without cost to not to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:30.980
 there was smoke now show now how 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:35.460
 the cap is made of burta double color 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:40.829
 We do a double collar that's it inside 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:46.730
 false asbestos fabric is waiting on the target 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.980
 so that the smoke did not get the garage inside 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.910
 so here we see bad but okay then I 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:04.379
 I will show more means inside the pipe for a long time 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:08.090
 45 millimeter there is a window too with 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.119
 lid it is also asbestos cloth 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:20.430
 compacted so that our smoke also does not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:25.189
 got here means we have a supply tube 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.770
 oil oil copper tube made 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.920
 At first it was done by slag but something 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 very hot 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.820
 You decided to make a copper operation. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.030
 intel tor blowing stove means she 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:47.020
 heats up somewhere here main to her 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.740
 the square here turns red and that's why 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.710
 blowing it from below comes this one 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.579
 homemade heat exchanger i.e. he 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.399
 made here there are two flanges here 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:08.360
 one and one here in Odessa on bolts 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:11.450
 the flanges are welded to the pipe big here 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.470
 inside the thin tube which goes 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:21.069
 here is hot air here is this smoke all 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.870
 exhaust fumes here means a have 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:30.489
 the guard here by the way here and you can see now 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:34.459
 here it is a capacitor a capacitor which 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.019
 runs off when starting the stove ignite 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.810
 this is not heat exchangers condensate 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.680
 formed inside here it flow down here 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:47.620
 so that he doesn't get into the stove 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.980
 it is here in this stub on the street 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:56.480
 also have the same triple actually 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:01.100
 do you want to go home now 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.930
 close on the indicator inflating diameter 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.540
 100 millimeters normal channel 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.130
 the fan is here moving the car is not 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:15.980
 the heat exchanger is made here, too, from 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:19.310
 ventilation heat exchanger here but its here 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.450
 about paul he was unfrozen and behind 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.730
 fan fan who is his 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.139
 blown but made of copper pipes 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.780
 liquid 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:38.599
 you are the master that is the return flow 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.760
 here are those of the sole oscillating pump 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.120
 the normal circulation pump itself 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.250
 cheap well here the koran and set to 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.829
 you could remove the filter there cleared 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.480
 Well, here I tried 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:57.810
 turn it on without a pump 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.280
 also works but biases e here too 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.620
 it works but very bad heat 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.599
 because there is no such circulation as with 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.080
 pump protection 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:15.720
 control of the stove itself here with us 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.709
 the fan turns on this itself 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:26.760
 fan then our temperatures antifreeze 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:31.590
 shows this voltage on pump 19 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.510
 the pump oil from the barrel gives here I 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.270
 then separately show how it is done 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:43.410
 all adapter pipe 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.539
 soldered this so bromine not soldered 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.310
 here too 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:51.090
 the heat exchanger itself is removed because the nuts 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.750
 American women stand here flange but on 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.960
 screw it, you can unscrew the flange here 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.370
 unscrew the nut also remove drain antifreeze 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.680
 Naturally and he is removed Well ignition 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.310
 produced as through this window 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.330
 poured there i usually solvent and 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.700
 Pour somewhere about 300 grams probably 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.740
 I will do a little bit of oil supply here 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.840
 make it forced at night oil 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.610
 and as if by time relay 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:30.030
 here you can see two rudders of time 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:33.750
 they work like that and a lighter 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.419
 usually a lighter and such here 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:44.389
 with a long nose I have the whole thing there 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:44.389
 We light Well, that principle is all
