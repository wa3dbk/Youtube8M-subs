super<00:00:44.010> quick<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.340> simple<00:00:44.460> especially<00:00:44.789> on

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
super quick and simple especially on

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.819 
super quick and simple especially on
this<00:00:45.149> kind<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.629> smaller<00:00:45.989> image<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.590> this

and then I go on to her hair so I'm
using<00:00:49.980> yr<00:00:50.489> 12

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
using yr 12

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600 
using yr 12
laying<00:00:51.960> down<00:00:52.020> my<00:00:52.260> face<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.070> did<00:00:53.280> her

hat<00:00:53.820> band<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> stripes<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.760> her

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
leggings with the same colors and then I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
leggings with the same colors and then I
went<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.370> wire<00:00:59.640> 14<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.410> just

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
went in with the wire 14 and I just

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500 
went in with the wire 14 and I just
blended<00:01:01.859> them<00:01:01.980> together<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.550> could<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.359> added

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
blended them together I could have added

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.880 
blended them together I could have added
a<00:01:03.719> third<00:01:03.930> color<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:04.650> dimension

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
a third color for a bit more dimension

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.649 
a third color for a bit more dimension
but<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.580> happy<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:05.970> how<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> looked<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.630> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
but I was happy with how it looked so I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.620 
but I was happy with how it looked so I
just<00:01:06.869> left<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.420> of

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
just left it as is and then for all of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.679 
just left it as is and then for all of
the<00:01:10.070> black<00:01:11.070> areas<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.119> using<00:01:12.299> Gray's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
the black areas I'm just using Gray's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.170 
the black areas I'm just using Gray's
for<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.220> went<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.640> c5

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
for all of that so I went in with c5

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.080 
for all of that so I went in with c5
first<00:01:15.600> laid<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.170> added<00:01:16.860> some<00:01:17.130> c7<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
first laid that down added some c7 and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.530 
first laid that down added some c7 and
then<00:01:18.840> finally<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.650> ac-9

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
then finally going in ac-9

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.149 
then finally going in ac-9
not<00:01:21.540> doing<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> very<00:01:22.200> neatly<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:22.950> anything

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
not doing it very neatly or anything

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
not doing it very neatly or anything
because<00:01:23.520> once<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.970> start<00:01:24.180> doing<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
because once you start doing the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.399 
because once you start doing the
blending<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.200> kind<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
blending that's when you can kind of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740 
blending that's when you can kind of
even<00:01:25.590> everything<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.369> make<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
even everything out and make it look a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.730 
even everything out and make it look a
lot<00:01:28.259> nicer

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
lot nicer

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.700 
lot nicer
so<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.460> blended<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> c903<00:01:30.450> c7<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
so I blended out the c903 c7 and then I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
so I blended out the c903 c7 and then I
go<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.430> c5<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.930> starting<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
go in with the c5 and really starting to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.830 
go in with the c5 and really starting to
blend<00:01:34.380> everything<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.570> finally<00:01:36.570> on

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
blend everything out and then finally on

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.010 
blend everything out and then finally on
her<00:01:37.470> hat<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> cauldron<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.880> use<00:01:39.119> c3

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
her hat and then the cauldron I use c3

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 
her hat and then the cauldron I use c3
to<00:01:41.009> really<00:01:41.280> blend<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:41.850> together<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.479> bit

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to really blend it all together a bit

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
to really blend it all together a bit
more<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.799> was<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
more and then that was it for that and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.310 
more and then that was it for that and
then<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.540> her<00:01:45.689> dress<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.409> doing<00:01:46.920> BGO<00:01:47.460> 5<00:01:48.320> and

then going in with bgo 7 and then

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.760 
then going in with bgo 7 and then
finally<00:01:53.430> I'll<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.210> geo-9<00:01:54.770> kind

of lighter orange black combo so had to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.330 
of lighter orange black combo so had to
kind<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.269> lay<00:03:15.450> out<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.750> mind<00:03:16.109> before<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> started

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
kind of lay out in mind before I started

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.119 
kind of lay out in mind before I started
this<00:03:17.489> card<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.750> cut<00:03:18.959> all<00:03:19.049> my<00:03:19.079> strips<00:03:19.560> adhered

them<00:03:20.280> onto<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.329> card<00:03:21.569> front<00:03:21.659> and<00:03:22.169> then<00:03:22.379> kind

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
them onto the card front and then kind

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.469 
them onto the card front and then kind
of<00:03:22.709> figure<00:03:22.889> out<00:03:23.010> how<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.519> wanted<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> circle<00:03:24.419> to

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
of figure out how I wanted the circle to

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.960 
of figure out how I wanted the circle to
go<00:03:24.569> I<00:03:24.599> kind<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:24.930> knew<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.109> wanted<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.819> to<00:03:26.819> hang

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
go I kind of knew I wanted it to hang

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.189 
go I kind of knew I wanted it to hang
off<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.239> edge<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.449> it<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:27.599> that<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.840> could<00:03:27.900> trim

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
off the edge of it so that I could trim

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.599 
off the edge of it so that I could trim
it<00:03:28.290> off<00:03:28.409> that's<00:03:28.680> why<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:28.829> stamped<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.519> then

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
it off that's why I stamped and then

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.409 
it off that's why I stamped and then
die-cut<00:03:30.449> the<00:03:30.569> image<00:03:30.900> off-center<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.419> figured

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
die-cut the image off-center so figured

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.879 
die-cut the image off-center so figured
out<00:03:33.540> how<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.750> kind<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.079> wanted<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:34.409> and<00:03:34.709> then

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889

textures<00:03:39.329> ribbon<00:03:39.690> which<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.049> just<00:03:40.290> love<00:03:40.889> and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
textures ribbon which I just love and

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.849 
textures ribbon which I just love and
this<00:03:41.940> yet<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.329> yellow<00:03:42.540> one<00:03:42.780> is<00:03:42.989> perfect<00:03:43.530> for

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
this yet the yellow one is perfect for

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.589 
this yet the yellow one is perfect for
this<00:03:44.370> patterned<00:03:44.760> paper<00:03:44.909> collection<00:03:45.389> because

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
this patterned paper collection because

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.089 
this patterned paper collection because
there's<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.840> kind<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.169> yellowy<00:03:46.470> color<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:46.979> the

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
there's a kind of a yellowy color in the

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.069 
there's a kind of a yellowy color in the
collection<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.819> is<00:03:48.060> almost<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.510> exact<00:03:48.870> same

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
collection that is almost the exact same

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.649 
collection that is almost the exact same
color<00:03:49.319> so<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.949> just<00:03:50.129> worked<00:03:50.280> out<00:03:50.370> perfectly

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
color so that just worked out perfectly

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.819 
color so that just worked out perfectly
so<00:03:51.659> just<00:03:51.840> wrap<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.019> around<00:03:52.199> the<00:03:52.379> card<00:03:52.590> front

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
so just wrap it around the card front

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.270 
so just wrap it around the card front
tie<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.430> bow<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.870> then<00:03:55.319> I'm<00:03:55.979> going<00:03:56.189> to

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
tie that in a bow and then I'm going to

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.030 
tie that in a bow and then I'm going to
matte<00:03:56.689> that<00:03:57.689> with<00:03:58.049> another<00:03:58.349> piece<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.829> just

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
matte that with another piece of just

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.460 
matte that with another piece of just
pattern<00:03:59.430> paper<00:03:59.699> that<00:04:00.359> I<00:04:00.389> had<00:04:00.659> flipped<00:04:00.959> over<00:04:01.139> so

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
pattern paper that I had flipped over so

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.899 
pattern paper that I had flipped over so
it's<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.949> yellow<00:04:02.159> side<00:04:02.430> showing<00:04:02.669> and

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
it's just the yellow side showing and

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.119 
it's just the yellow side showing and
that's<00:04:03.030> where<00:04:03.180> you'll<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.419> able<00:04:03.449> to<00:04:03.599> see<00:04:03.810> that

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
that's where you'll be able to see that

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.530 
that's where you'll be able to see that
how<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.189> ribbon<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:05.909> the<00:04:06.060> pattern<00:04:06.359> paper

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
how the ribbon and the pattern paper

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.589 
how the ribbon and the pattern paper
basically<00:04:06.889> perfectly<00:04:07.889> match<00:04:08.099> each<00:04:08.340> other<00:04:08.599> so

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
basically perfectly match each other so

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.729 
basically perfectly match each other so
it's<00:04:09.720> kind<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.930> fun<00:04:10.109> sometimes<00:04:10.500> when<00:04:10.650> that

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
it's kind of fun sometimes when that

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.300 
it's kind of fun sometimes when that
turns<00:04:11.009> out<00:04:11.159> without<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.459> whole<00:04:11.639> lot<00:04:11.669> of<00:04:11.819> effort

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
turns out without a whole lot of effort

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.490 
turns out without a whole lot of effort
so<00:04:14.310> got<00:04:14.759> that<00:04:14.790> added<00:04:15.209> onto<00:04:15.540> there<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:15.870> now<00:04:16.320> I'm

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
so got that added onto there and now I'm

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.589 
so got that added onto there and now I'm
going<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.949> adhere<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.759> main<00:04:18.030> image<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:18.539> I'm

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
going to adhere the main image so I'm

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.629 
going to adhere the main image so I'm
just<00:04:18.750> applying<00:04:18.900> adhesive<00:04:19.169> on<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.400> area

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
just applying adhesive on the area

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.190 
just applying adhesive on the area
that's<00:04:20.729> actually<00:04:21.180> going<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.510> be<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.959> card

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
that's actually going to be on the card

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.529 
that's actually going to be on the card
front<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.340> I'm<00:04:23.490> not<00:04:23.639> just<00:04:23.880> wasting<00:04:24.029> a<00:04:24.360> whole

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
front so I'm not just wasting a whole

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.220 
front so I'm not just wasting a whole
bunch<00:04:24.719> of<00:04:24.810> adhesive<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.830> helps

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
bunch of adhesive and it helps

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.020 
bunch of adhesive and it helps
sometimes<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:27.310> can<00:04:27.460> hold<00:04:27.670> it<00:04:27.760> up<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:28.000> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
sometimes you can hold it up to the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.610 
sometimes you can hold it up to the
light<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.480> see<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:29.080> light<00:04:29.290> shining<00:04:29.500> through

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
light to see the light shining through

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.020 
light to see the light shining through
so<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:29.950> kind<00:04:30.160> of<00:04:30.190> give<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.370> guide<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:30.910> that

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
so you kind of give a guide so that

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.030 
so you kind of give a guide so that
you're<00:04:31.150> not<00:04:31.270> cutting<00:04:32.230> off<00:04:32.350> any<00:04:32.530> of<00:04:32.650> the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
you're not cutting off any of the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.370 
you're not cutting off any of the
stamped<00:04:33.430> image<00:04:33.810> although<00:04:34.810> really<00:04:34.990> wouldn't

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
stamped image although really wouldn't

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.410 
stamped image although really wouldn't
matter<00:04:35.440> if<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:35.800> did<00:04:36.070> depending<00:04:36.580> on<00:04:36.640> how<00:04:36.850> you

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
matter if you did depending on how you

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.140 
matter if you did depending on how you
wanted<00:04:37.750> your<00:04:37.840> card<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.230> look<00:04:38.820> but<00:04:39.820> yet<00:04:39.910> did

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
wanted your card to look but yet did

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.520 
wanted your card to look but yet did
that<00:04:40.300> flipped<00:04:40.630> over<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.870> card<00:04:41.140> front<00:04:41.350> and

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
that flipped over the card front and

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.900 
that flipped over the card front and
then<00:04:42.220> just<00:04:42.400> use<00:04:42.550> that<00:04:42.580> as<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.060> guide<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.420> cut<00:04:44.910> the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
then just use that as a guide to cut the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.750 
then just use that as a guide to cut the
circle<00:04:46.150> where<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:46.870> wanted<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.770> then<00:04:48.730> I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
circle where I wanted it and then I

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.270 
circle where I wanted it and then I
found<00:04:49.090> three<00:04:49.600> jumbo<00:04:50.230> Brad's<00:04:50.530> in<00:04:50.770> my<00:04:50.950> stash

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
found three jumbo Brad's in my stash

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.220 
found three jumbo Brad's in my stash
that<00:04:51.730> again<00:04:52.060> we're<00:04:52.300> almost<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.810> perfect

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
that again we're almost the perfect

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.540 
that again we're almost the perfect
shade<00:04:53.530> of<00:04:53.560> yellow<00:04:53.890> I<00:04:54.040> think<00:04:54.070> these<00:04:54.340> are<00:04:54.400> like

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
shade of yellow I think these are like

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.030 
shade of yellow I think these are like
some<00:04:54.820> basic<00:04:55.030> gray<00:04:55.390> ones<00:04:55.600> that<00:04:55.900> were<00:04:56.590> in<00:04:56.650> some

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
some basic gray ones that were in some

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.970 
some basic gray ones that were in some
random<00:04:57.280> collection<00:04:57.760> from<00:04:58.180> years<00:04:58.780> ago<00:04:59.020> but

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
random collection from years ago but

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.860 
random collection from years ago but
yeah<00:05:00.400> they<00:05:00.790> were<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.180> perfect<00:05:01.570> shade<00:05:01.720> of

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
yeah they were like the perfect shade of

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.050 
yeah they were like the perfect shade of
yellow<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.470> used<00:05:02.830> my<00:05:03.100> little<00:05:03.400> Stampin<00:05:03.940> Up

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
yellow so I used my little Stampin Up

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.200 
yellow so I used my little Stampin Up
matte<00:05:04.750> pack<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.500> guide<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:06.070> holes<00:05:06.310> for<00:05:06.700> it<00:05:06.850> and

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
matte pack to guide the holes for it and

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.780 
matte pack to guide the holes for it and
then<00:05:07.420> stuck<00:05:07.780> those<00:05:07.960> through<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.860> then<00:05:09.700> the

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
then stuck those through and then the

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.510 
then stuck those through and then the
sentiment<00:05:10.300> is<00:05:10.450> again<00:05:11.170> from<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.680> bewitching

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
sentiment is again from the bewitching

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.430 
sentiment is again from the bewitching
alamode<00:05:13.180> set<00:05:13.480> so<00:05:13.750> I'm<00:05:13.810> just<00:05:13.930> gonna<00:05:14.020> ink<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.380> up

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
alamode set so I'm just gonna ink it up

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.260 
alamode set so I'm just gonna ink it up
with<00:05:14.590> my<00:05:14.740> versafine<00:05:15.130> onyx<00:05:15.160> black<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:16.120> then<00:05:16.240> I

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
with my versafine onyx black and then I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.030

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.920 
had a little strip of the yellow pattern
paper<00:05:18.340> left<00:05:18.640> over<00:05:18.940> from<00:05:19.180> cutting<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.690> front

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930

front so I'm going to adhere that to the
card<00:05:33.370> itself<00:05:33.880> and<00:05:34.780> just<00:05:35.050> use<00:05:35.170> a<00:05:35.200> piece<00:05:35.470> of<00:05:35.620> tape

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
card itself and just use a piece of tape

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.650 
card itself and just use a piece of tape
over<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.220> back<00:05:36.430> of<00:05:36.670> the<00:05:36.760> Brad's<00:05:37.180> piece<00:05:37.480> there

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
over the back of the Brad's piece there

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.020 
over the back of the Brad's piece there
so<00:05:37.930> close<00:05:38.230> to<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:39.220> edge<00:05:39.340> of<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.550> paper<00:05:39.730> there

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
so close to the edge of the paper there

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.550 
so close to the edge of the paper there
that<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.330> wanted<00:05:40.690> to<00:05:40.750> make<00:05:40.870> sure<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.140> adhesive

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
that I wanted to make sure the adhesive

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.410 
that I wanted to make sure the adhesive
stuck<00:05:41.830> so<00:05:42.190> just<00:05:42.520> put<00:05:42.730> a<00:05:42.760> piece<00:05:42.970> of<00:05:43.000> tape<00:05:43.150> over

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
stuck so just put a piece of tape over

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.990 
stuck so just put a piece of tape over
those<00:05:43.720> so<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:44.980> ATG<00:05:45.190> would<00:05:45.520> just<00:05:45.700> glide

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
those so that the ATG would just glide

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.420 
those so that the ATG would just glide
right<00:05:46.030> over<00:05:46.450> it<00:05:46.540> and<00:05:46.720> then<00:05:47.290> my<00:05:47.590> card<00:05:47.860> base<00:05:48.040> is

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
right over it and then my card base is

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.540 
right over it and then my card base is
just<00:05:48.790> some<00:05:49.120> he<00:05:49.810> has<00:05:49.930> taken<00:05:50.440> with<00:05:50.590> teal<00:05:51.130> from

just some he has taken with teal from
Stampin<00:05:52.120> Up<00:05:52.210> I'm<00:05:52.390> pretty<00:05:52.660> sure<00:05:52.930> I<00:05:53.230> don't<00:05:53.650> know

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
Stampin Up I'm pretty sure I don't know

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.050 
Stampin Up I'm pretty sure I don't know
if<00:05:53.860> that's<00:05:54.010> still<00:05:54.130> available<00:05:54.340> or<00:05:54.670> not<00:05:54.850> having

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
if that's still available or not having

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.780

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
stamp it off once onto scratch paper

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.260 
stamp it off once onto scratch paper
just<00:06:11.140> so<00:06:11.230> it's<00:06:11.380> not<00:06:11.530> so<00:06:11.590> dark<00:06:12.340> and<00:06:12.640> then<00:06:13.120> that

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
just so it's not so dark and then that

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.060 
just so it's not so dark and then that
way<00:06:13.390> it's<00:06:13.570> just<00:06:13.600> a<00:06:13.870> light<00:06:14.110> image<00:06:14.470> of<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:14.890> main

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
way it's just a light image of the main

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.530 
way it's just a light image of the main
image<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.550> that<00:06:15.580> way<00:06:15.730> you<00:06:15.790> can<00:06:15.970> write<00:06:16.090> over<00:06:16.390> it

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
image and that way you can write over it

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.180 
image and that way you can write over it
and<00:06:16.780> it's<00:06:16.900> not<00:06:17.080> going<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.530> kind<00:06:17.710> of<00:06:17.770> compete

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
and it's not going to kind of compete

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.950 
and it's not going to kind of compete
with<00:06:18.520> you<00:06:18.760> know<00:06:18.850> if<00:06:18.970> you're<00:06:19.090> using<00:06:19.120> a<00:06:19.420> blue

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
with you know if you're using a blue

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.840 
with you know if you're using a blue
ballpoint<00:06:20.500> pen<00:06:20.740> or<00:06:20.890> anything<00:06:21.070> like<00:06:21.280> that<00:06:21.340> and

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
ballpoint pen or anything like that and

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.750 
ballpoint pen or anything like that and
then<00:06:22.810> I<00:06:22.840> had<00:06:23.080> leftover<00:06:23.440> pieces<00:06:23.800> of<00:06:24.220> patterned

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
then I had leftover pieces of patterned

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.270 
then I had leftover pieces of patterned
paper<00:06:25.000> from<00:06:25.660> what<00:06:25.930> I<00:06:25.960> used<00:06:26.260> on<00:06:26.500> the<00:06:26.650> front<00:06:26.920> so<00:06:27.250> I

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
paper from what I used on the front so I

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.210 
paper from what I used on the front so I
just<00:06:27.610> cut<00:06:27.880> those<00:06:28.200> down<00:06:29.200> a<00:06:29.230> little<00:06:29.470> bit<00:06:29.710> to<00:06:29.950> use

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
just cut those down a little bit to use

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.350 
just cut those down a little bit to use
on<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.550> inside<00:06:30.700> of<00:06:30.880> the<00:06:31.000> card

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
on the inside of the card

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.030 
on the inside of the card
did<00:06:31.750> the<00:06:31.870> same<00:06:32.050> layout<00:06:32.260> just<00:06:32.620> kind<00:06:32.770> of<00:06:32.830> flipped

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
did the same layout just kind of flipped

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.940 
did the same layout just kind of flipped
it<00:06:33.160> around<00:06:33.220> a<00:06:33.460> little<00:06:33.520> bit<00:06:33.810> and<00:06:34.810> then<00:06:35.290> adhered

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
it around a little bit and then adhered

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.400 
it around a little bit and then adhered
the<00:06:36.100> circle<00:06:36.460> and<00:06:36.640> just<00:06:36.780> let<00:06:37.780> a<00:06:37.810> little<00:06:38.080> bit<00:06:38.290> of

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
the circle and just let a little bit of

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.020 
the circle and just let a little bit of
it<00:06:38.500> hang<00:06:38.650> off<00:06:38.800> together<00:06:38.980> one<00:06:39.280> more

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
it hang off together one more

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.640 
it hang off together one more
on<00:06:40.090> the<00:06:40.360> inside<00:06:40.660> so<00:06:40.900> that<00:06:41.020> there's<00:06:41.200> more<00:06:41.260> space

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
on the inside so that there's more space

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.180 
on the inside so that there's more space
to<00:06:41.890> write<00:06:42.330> so<00:06:43.330> trim<00:06:43.720> that<00:06:43.870> off<00:06:43.930> and<00:06:44.410> then<00:06:44.800> I

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
to write so trim that off and then I

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.460 
to write so trim that off and then I
stamped<00:06:45.460> second<00:06:45.970> sentiment<00:06:46.390> in<00:06:46.600> alamode<00:06:47.200> set

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
stamped second sentiment in alamode set

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.430 
stamped second sentiment in alamode set
onto<00:06:47.760> the<00:06:48.760> remaining<00:06:49.090> piece<00:06:49.600> of<00:06:49.930> yellow

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
onto the remaining piece of yellow

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.990 
onto the remaining piece of yellow
patterned<00:06:50.830> paper<00:06:51.040> and<00:06:51.370> I'm<00:06:51.550> just<00:06:51.790> going<00:06:51.910> to

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000
