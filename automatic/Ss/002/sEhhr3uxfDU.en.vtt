00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.940 
isn't even easier I'm really looking
forward<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:20.019> couldn't<00:02:20.319> test<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.739> much

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
forward to it we couldn't test that much

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.920 
forward to it we couldn't test that much
during<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.430> winter<00:02:21.760> let's<00:02:22.299> see<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> big<00:02:22.720> gap

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
during the winter let's see the big gap

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.960 
during the winter let's see the big gap
between<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.349> last<00:02:23.560> place<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.010> now<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.430> really

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
between the last place and now I really

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.850 
between the last place and now I really
want<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.269> first<00:02:25.690> race<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.319> fact<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.680> can

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
want this first race if in fact I can

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.780 
want this first race if in fact I can
have<00:02:27.069> an<00:02:27.220> waitin<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.330> can<00:02:28.510> cycle
