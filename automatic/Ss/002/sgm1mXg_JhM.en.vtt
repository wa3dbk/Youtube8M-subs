00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:53.189
 not at all what i said okay 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.170

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.020
 easier but I do not have okay yet 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.590
 times next time when running again 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.990

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.300

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:20.709
 I also run under the japan 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.549
 winning 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.629
 ok so it's a dream crime so 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.040
 with me is now on the club committees 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:32.590

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.180
 next would have been the ok new 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.599
 rules if you do not select what what 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.950
 Nobody expected it so the dtcc 805 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.840
 with cobra with laser and with the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.269
 Educational brake and I have the ak 12 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.269
 with ace and eaten 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.390
 First of all, I do not get it 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.400
 more behind is too stupid - and 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.030
 Angled ok, I again in the short 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.030
 eck over

 that's my darling I've just got here 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.730
 of the greens on my i turns out 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.810
 I wonder why, after all 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.989
 even if I do that at all 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:23.440
 nothing you can calmly on the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:24.239
 the company screwed up in it becomes one 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.670
 round 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:38.380
 I have one I still have one 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:41.130
 yes I do not know if I give the puke 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.400
 a short self died 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.120
 I have the types that are bigger 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.220
 to be probable 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.950
 so it had to come from today he stands 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.710
 very stupid, well, an opponent of the cities 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.390
 but you can also now 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.910
 says stop thing may also with the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.110
 So clearly, guns do not fight 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.290
 All the time, but I was allowed to 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:10.230
 Of course, throwing in grenades play 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.270
 At the same time we could also pistols and 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.990
 grenades and so on but then make 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.360
 are just 3 and over to infect 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.250
 I just bought the type 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.020
 not paying attention so i think so 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.770

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:39.810

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.080

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.280
 Management only to bed the match man 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:07.180
