who I do not take style tips from I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
who I do not take style tips from I
believe<00:01:33.240> had<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> design<00:01:33.930> similar<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.590> this

believe had a design similar to this
once<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:37.920> why<00:01:38.070> they<00:01:38.220> copied

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670

once and I think that's why they copied
it<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.920> um<00:01:41.119> it's<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> fun
