in this show I'm going to talk about

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.790 
in this show I'm going to talk about
hard<00:00:15.459> cases<00:00:15.910> hard<00:00:16.900> cases<00:00:17.350> are<00:00:17.470> basically

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
hard cases hard cases are basically

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.640 
hard cases hard cases are basically
veneers<00:00:18.699> that<00:00:18.820> are<00:00:19.119> rigid<00:00:19.480> and<00:00:19.750> provide<00:00:20.470> more

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
veneers that are rigid and provide more

protection<00:00:20.949> for<00:00:21.339> your<00:00:21.490> stuff<00:00:21.730> now<00:00:22.509> why<00:00:22.720> would

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
protection for your stuff now why would

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.169 
protection for your stuff now why would
you<00:00:22.929> need<00:00:23.169> a<00:00:23.199> hard<00:00:23.439> case<00:00:23.619> as<00:00:24.519> a<00:00:24.609> photographer<00:00:25.150> I

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 
you need a hard case as a photographer I

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.730 
you need a hard case as a photographer I
carry<00:00:25.480> lots<00:00:25.689> of<00:00:25.839> equipment<00:00:26.050> that<00:00:26.560> need

carry lots of equipment that need

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.009 
carry lots of equipment that need
protection<00:00:27.369> I<00:00:27.699> like<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.480> joke<00:00:28.660> that<00:00:28.720> when<00:00:28.960> I'm

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
protection I like to joke that when I'm

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
protection I like to joke that when I'm
carrying<00:00:29.169> my<00:00:29.349> gear<00:00:29.589> returns<00:00:29.890> my

DIY job and do it yourself one that I

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.200 
DIY job and do it yourself one that I
modified<00:00:48.100> because<00:00:48.519> no<00:00:48.670> one<00:00:48.789> seems<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.120> be

making<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.960> case<00:00:50.590> I<00:00:50.710> worked<00:00:51.010> for<00:00:51.160> me<00:00:51.250> at<00:00:51.309> the

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
making a case I worked for me at the

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.660 
making a case I worked for me at the
time<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.350> case<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.559> a<00:00:53.710> pelican<00:00:54.129> case<00:00:54.309> the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
time so the case is a pelican case the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.119 
time so the case is a pelican case the

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
1450 in orange which is the best color

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.849 
1450 in orange which is the best color
ever<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.989> Pelican<00:00:59.469> cases<00:00:59.620> are

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.590 
one hook for the bottom rail to secure
it<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.390> rack<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:30.460> chose<00:01:30.790> ortley

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
it to the rack and I chose ortley

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.320 
it to the rack and I chose ortley
app<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.140> your<00:01:32.170> hardware<00:01:32.650> because<00:01:33.640> they're

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
app in your hardware because they're

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.790 
app in your hardware because they're
pretty<00:01:35.200> robust<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:36.630> also<00:01:37.630> because<00:01:37.930> they're

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
pretty robust and also because they're

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.000 
pretty robust and also because they're
pretty<00:01:38.950> easy<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.610> adjust<00:01:40.620> so<00:01:41.620> they<00:01:41.740> get<00:01:41.830> this

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
pretty easy to adjust so they get this

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.270 
pretty easy to adjust so they get this
to<00:01:42.160> work<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.640> had<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.660> drill<00:01:43.870> holes<00:01:44.200> in<00:01:44.620> my<00:01:44.770> $1.00

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
to work I had to drill holes in my $1.00

camera two lenses in the flash and when

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.470 
camera two lenses in the flash and when
I<00:02:16.000> pack<00:02:16.239> it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
I pack it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.119 
I pack it
the<00:02:16.629> typical<00:02:16.989> load<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.319> case<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.739> gear<00:02:17.890> come

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
the typical load the case and gear come

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.300 
the typical load the case and gear come
to<00:02:18.159> about<00:02:18.519> 20<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:19.120> 25<00:02:19.360> pounds<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:21.129> not

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
to about 20 to 25 pounds so it's not

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.280 
to about 20 to 25 pounds so it's not

I<00:02:47.709> mean<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.129> 80<00:02:48.310> bucks<00:02:48.549> for<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.819> case<00:02:49.030> that

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
I mean it's 80 bucks for the case that

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.470 
I mean it's 80 bucks for the case that
you<00:02:50.049> have<00:02:50.079> to<00:02:50.290> drill<00:02:50.470> holes<00:02:50.500> into<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.480> another

20<00:02:52.720> dollars<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.079> hardware<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.310> not<00:02:54.459> cheap

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
20 dollars of hardware so it's not cheap

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.949 
20 dollars of hardware so it's not cheap
so<00:02:55.799> that's<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:57.099> for<00:02:57.400> case<00:02:57.790> number<00:02:58.060> one<00:02:58.239> check
