00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.430 
progresses forward and actually it was
one<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.030> fastest<00:02:06.450> songs<00:02:06.720> have<00:02:06.869> written<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
one of the fastest songs have written to

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.949 
one of the fastest songs have written to
which<00:02:07.650> was<00:02:07.770> cool<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.479> just<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.869> out

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
which was cool to just just get it out

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.740 
which was cool to just just get it out
there<00:02:10.200> yeah<00:02:11.100> yeah<00:02:11.640> we're<00:02:12.030> happy<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.600> yeah

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
there yeah yeah we're happy with it yeah

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.730 
there yeah yeah we're happy with it yeah
it's<00:02:13.110> good<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:14.100> differentiate<00:02:15.230> between<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
it's good to differentiate between the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.949 
it's good to differentiate between the
other<00:02:16.830> two<00:02:16.980> songs<00:02:17.540> because<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.660> only<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.930> a

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
other two songs because we only have a

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.970 
other two songs because we only have a
few<00:02:19.170> songs<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.489> guess<00:02:21.260> everyone<00:02:22.260> kind

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
few songs out so I guess everyone kind

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.920 
few songs out so I guess everyone kind
of<00:02:23.100> quite<00:02:23.459> judgmental<00:02:24.060> about<00:02:24.150> what<00:02:24.450> can<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.660> put

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
of quite judgmental about what can I put

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.699 
of quite judgmental about what can I put
out<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.820> now<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> good<00:02:28.020> cross-section<00:02:28.290> I

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
out and it's now a good cross-section I

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.530 
out and it's now a good cross-section I
feel<00:02:28.920> between<00:02:29.220> three<00:02:29.610> songs<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.120> explains

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
slowly more officers William off to do

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.500 
slowly more officers William off to do
the<00:03:37.049> goalposts<00:03:37.650> are<00:03:37.709> always<00:03:37.920> moving<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.549> you

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
the goalposts are always moving and you

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.300 
the goalposts are always moving and you
know<00:03:39.660> we're<00:03:39.900> always<00:03:40.019> working<00:03:40.680> towards<00:03:41.070> an

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.930 
know we're always working towards an
album<00:03:41.640> but<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.440> think<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.530> most

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
album but I think the most

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.930 
album but I think the most
one<00:03:44.060> thing<00:03:44.300> is<00:03:44.420> just<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.750> try<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.170> write<00:03:45.940> focus

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
one thing is just to try and write focus

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.280 
one thing is just to try and write focus
on<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.090> now<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.570> try<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.840> write<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.110> best

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
on the now and try to write the best

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.360 
on the now and try to write the best
songs<00:03:48.530> we<00:03:48.830> possibly<00:03:49.460> can<00:03:49.640> now<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.300> not<00:03:51.370> have

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
songs we possibly can now and not have

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.630 
songs we possibly can now and not have
some<00:03:52.760> abstract<00:03:53.630> idea<00:03:55.030> overhanging<00:03:56.320> that's

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
some abstract idea overhanging that's

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.590 
some abstract idea overhanging that's
dictating<00:03:58.640> what<00:03:58.700> we<00:03:58.850> do<00:03:58.970> yeah<00:03:59.240> we<00:03:59.270> just<00:03:59.420> want
