craft<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.900> didn't<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> crafting

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
craft with it I didn't do the crafting

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.960 
craft with it I didn't do the crafting
recipes<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.250> these<00:00:26.369> because<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
recipes for these because they are the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.179 
recipes for these because they are the
exact<00:00:27.359> same<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.410> would<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.830> any<00:00:29.070> other

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
exact same as you would with any other

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.460 
exact same as you would with any other
things<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.240> find<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.990> smelt<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
things you find the or you smelt it and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
things you find the or you smelt it and
then<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> make<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.000> were

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
then you make this just like if you were

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
then you make this just like if you were
making<00:00:33.360> an<00:00:33.450> iron<00:00:33.719> set<00:00:34.110> or<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:35.219> anything<00:00:35.520> like

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
making an iron set or or anything like

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.520 
making an iron set or or anything like
that<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.329> there's<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> ambrosia<00:00:37.170> bread

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that and then there's the ambrosia bread

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
that and then there's the ambrosia bread
I<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:38.010> not<00:00:38.160> looked<00:00:38.340> much<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.059> does

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
I have not looked much of what that does

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
I have not looked much of what that does
but<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.110> assuming<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:40.920> good<00:00:41.160> bread

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
but I'm assuming it is very good bread

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
but I'm assuming it is very good bread
because<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.820> golden<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.530> have

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
because it's golden so then you have

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.279 
because it's golden so then you have
your<00:00:43.710> celestial<00:00:44.610> bronze<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.329> which<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
your celestial bronze or which is the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
your celestial bronze or which is the
same<00:00:46.500> set<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.070> armor<00:00:47.399> set<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.700> tools<00:00:47.879> crafted

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
same set of armor set of tools crafted

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
same set of armor set of tools crafted
the<00:00:48.480> same<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> smelt<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.309> you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the same way you smelt it just like you

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.850 
the same way you smelt it just like you
wish<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.700> melt<00:00:50.850> anything<00:00:51.149> else<00:00:51.500> moving<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
wish to melt anything else moving on to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.619 
wish to melt anything else moving on to

i don't know if that's in the book or
not<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.509> crafted<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.939> alright<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
not and it's crafted like so alright and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
not and it's crafted like so alright and
the<00:01:33.540> last<00:01:33.570> set<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> weapons<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the last set of weapons here we have the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
the last set of weapons here we have the
ana<00:01:35.220> best<00:01:35.579> knife<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.509> she<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
ana best knife I think she was a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.640 
ana best knife I think she was a
character<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> book<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.470> i'm<00:01:37.530> assuming

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
character in the book so i'm assuming

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.640 
character in the book so i'm assuming
that<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:38.909> from<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> book<00:01:39.470> crafter<00:01:40.470> like

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that that's from the book crafter like

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
that that's from the book crafter like
so<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.610> cool<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> mamehr

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
so and this one is just cool the mamehr

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.969 
so and this one is just cool the mamehr
i<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.380> does<00:01:43.500> anything<00:01:43.680> special

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
i don't know if it does anything special

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.920 
i don't know if it does anything special
but<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.340> has<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> cool<00:01:44.729> crafting<00:01:45.119> recipe<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.940 

looks<00:03:53.300> like<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.569> is<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.780> same<00:03:54.020> so<00:03:54.710> bronze

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
looks like it is the same so bronze

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.580 
looks like it is the same so bronze
armor<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.430> same<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:56.050> believe<00:03:57.050> I<00:03:57.200> test<00:03:57.440> the

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
armor is the same I believe I test the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.040 
armor is the same I believe I test the
pickaxes<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.130> they<00:03:58.310> all<00:03:58.430> mine<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.819> same<00:03:59.090> they

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
pickaxes and they all mine the same they

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.460 
pickaxes and they all mine the same they
can<00:04:00.230> bronze<00:04:00.950> can<00:04:01.130> be<00:04:01.250> mined<00:04:01.580> with<00:04:01.670> any<00:04:01.880> pickaxe

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
can bronze can be mined with any pickaxe

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.650 
can bronze can be mined with any pickaxe
Imperial<00:04:03.470> has<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.709> be<00:04:03.800> mined<00:04:04.010> with<00:04:04.420> iron<00:04:05.420> ore

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660
