this of course is the ribbon cable where

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.839 
this of course is the ribbon cable where
you<00:02:45.230> would<00:02:45.349> plug<00:02:45.590> either<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:47.079> 7200<00:02:48.079> or<00:02:48.849> 10,000

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.780 
now this is the receptacle part of it
and<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.450> course<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.900> would<00:03:12.019> plug<00:03:12.200> into

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
and this of course you would plug into

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.309 
and this of course you would plug into
another<00:03:13.790> ribbon<00:03:14.030> cable<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:14.810> K<00:03:15.019> will<00:03:15.170> be

course this will hear will be powered by
your<00:03:19.849> power<00:03:20.060> supply<00:03:20.329> let<00:03:21.079> me<00:03:21.200> now<00:03:21.349> install<00:03:21.739> a

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
your power supply let me now install a

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.240 
your power supply let me now install a
hard<00:03:22.040> drive<00:03:22.280> into<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.650> have<00:03:25.099> now

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
hard drive into this so I have now

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.759 
hard drive into this so I have now
installed<00:03:25.489> this<00:03:26.239> hard<00:03:26.540> drive<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.109> of<00:03:27.530> course

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
installed this hard drive and of course

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.039 
installed this hard drive and of course
the<00:03:27.919> ribbon<00:03:28.190> cable<00:03:28.609> from<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.419> device<00:03:29.720> goes

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
the ribbon cable from this device goes

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.319 
the ribbon cable from this device goes
into<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.530> hard<00:03:30.739> drive<00:03:30.980> itself<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.609> you<00:03:32.209> have

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
into the hard drive itself and you have

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.270 
into the hard drive itself and you have
a<00:03:32.359> little<00:03:32.569> power<00:03:32.810> cable<00:03:33.319> here<00:03:33.500> from<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:33.950> unit

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
a little power cable here from the unit

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.270 
a little power cable here from the unit
itself<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.419> this<00:03:35.510> goes<00:03:35.750> into<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.709> hard<00:03:37.040> drive

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
itself and this goes into the hard drive

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.729 
itself and this goes into the hard drive
and<00:03:37.639> of<00:03:37.879> course<00:03:37.910> now<00:03:38.329> all<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.660> have<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:39.019> do<00:03:39.169> is

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
and of course now all you have to do is

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.190 
and of course now all you have to do is
slip<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.250> hard<00:03:40.459> drive<00:03:40.730> into<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.269> unit<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.900> then

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
slip the hard drive into a unit and then

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.550 
slip the hard drive into a unit and then
screw<00:03:42.919> it<00:03:43.069> in<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.690> now<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.109> hard<00:03:45.319> drive

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
screw it in so now that the hard drive

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.250 
screw it in so now that the hard drive
is<00:03:45.590> seated<00:03:46.190> inside<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:47.090> would<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.750> screw

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
is seated inside I would just screw

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.129 
is seated inside I would just screw
screws<00:03:48.650> around<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.579> edges<00:03:49.790> four<00:03:50.329> in<00:03:50.629> each<00:03:50.840> one

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
screws around the edges four in each one

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.860 
screws around the edges four in each one
or<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.590> can<00:03:51.709> put<00:03:51.859> six<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:52.459> each<00:03:52.760> side<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.720> make

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
or you can put six in each side to make

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.289 
or you can put six in each side to make
it<00:03:54.079> very<00:03:54.290> secure<00:03:54.919> and<00:03:55.099> then<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.430> course<00:03:55.459> pop

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
it very secure and then of course pop

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.509 
it very secure and then of course pop
the<00:03:56.540> cover<00:03:56.720> back<00:03:56.989> on<00:03:57.230> put<00:03:57.799> it<00:03:57.859> back<00:03:58.099> into<00:03:58.340> the

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
the cover back on put it back into the

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.369 
the cover back on put it back into the
mount<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:59.060> then<00:03:59.449> mount<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.840> whole<00:04:00.079> thing

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
mount and then mount the whole thing

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.800 
mount and then mount the whole thing
into<00:04:00.530> your<00:04:00.799> computer<00:04:01.250> system<00:04:01.639> so<00:04:02.150> before<00:04:02.569> I

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
into your computer system so before I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.150 
into your computer system so before I
install<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.319> shin<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.620> i'm<00:04:03.739> just<00:04:03.769> going<00:04:04.099> to

the<00:04:04.910> hard<00:04:05.150> drive<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:05.389> course<00:04:05.690> is<00:04:05.870> already

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
the hard drive of course is already

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.140 
the hard drive of course is already
installed<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.919> i<00:04:07.250> would<00:04:07.400> just<00:04:07.430> push<00:04:07.819> it<00:04:07.849> into

out when the computer is on you could

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.850 
out when the computer is on you could
fry<00:04:55.370> your<00:04:55.580> hard<00:04:56.570> drive<00:04:56.840> or<00:04:57.050> even<00:04:57.320> worse<00:04:57.500> maybe
