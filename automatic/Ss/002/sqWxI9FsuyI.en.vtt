society and many of us are making many

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
society and many of us are making many
many<00:00:35.969> moves<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.540> we're<00:00:36.660> traveling<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.469> our

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
many moves and we're traveling for our

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.819 
many moves and we're traveling for our
work<00:00:37.950> our<00:00:38.700> careers<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.629> whatever<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
work our careers and whatever it is that

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.369 
work our careers and whatever it is that
we're<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:41.969> family<00:00:42.629> looks<00:00:43.110> very

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
we're up to and so family looks very

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.889 
we're up to and so family looks very
different<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:44.460> ever<00:00:45.000> looked<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.600> any

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
different than it has ever looked at any

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.650 
different than it has ever looked at any
other<00:00:46.079> time<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.469> human<00:00:46.980> history<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.629> I

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
other time in human history and so I

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.069 
other time in human history and so I
think<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.590> important<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:51.239> us<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
think it's very important for us to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.700 
think it's very important for us to
begin<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:53.129> more<00:00:53.550> creative<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.710> more

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
begin to be more creative and more

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.959 
begin to be more creative and more
aligned<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.690> being<00:00:57.690> able<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.430> evolve<00:00:59.430> our

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
aligned with being able to evolve our

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.360 
aligned with being able to evolve our
home<00:01:00.390> life<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.129> more

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
home life so that there is more

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.200 
home life so that there is more
flexibility<00:01:03.210> there's<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.619> room<00:01:05.040> for

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
flexibility there's more room for

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
flexibility there's more room for
self-expression<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.140> idea<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
self-expression so the idea that you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.240 
self-expression so the idea that you
might<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.869> beloved<00:01:10.229> every<00:01:10.799> single

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
might be with your beloved every single

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
might be with your beloved every single
day<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:11.850> life<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.240> sleeping<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
day of your life and sleeping in the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
day of your life and sleeping in the
same<00:01:13.170> bed<00:01:13.229> might<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.920> actually<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.729> what's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
same bed might not actually be what's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
same bed might not actually be what's
how<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> relationship<00:01:16.770> gets<00:01:16.979> designed<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
how the relationship gets designed and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.600 
how the relationship gets designed and
so<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.930> start<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.979> flexible

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
so you want to start to be more flexible

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670 
so you want to start to be more flexible
and<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.210> listen<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> that

create and to contribute to the world to
each<00:01:47.860> individual<00:01:48.670> what<00:01:49.240> we're<00:01:49.390> really<00:01:49.600> about

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
each individual what we're really about

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.289 
each individual what we're really about
as<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.350> couple<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.039> start<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.549> live<00:01:51.820> from

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
as a couple and to start to live from

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.289 
as a couple and to start to live from
there<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.929> that<00:01:53.049> might<00:01:53.259> really<00:01:53.470> expand<00:01:54.340> what

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
there and that might really expand what

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.510 
there and that might really expand what
it<00:01:55.509> looks<00:01:55.780> like<00:01:56.079> to<00:01:56.350> be<00:01:56.500> together<00:01:56.710> as<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.220> couple

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
it looks like to be together as a couple

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.330 
it looks like to be together as a couple
beyond<00:01:58.060> maybe<00:01:58.750> even<00:01:59.140> any<00:01:59.350> role<00:01:59.619> models<00:01:59.979> that

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
beyond maybe even any role models that

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.789 
beyond maybe even any role models that
you've<00:02:00.610> ever<00:02:00.759> seen<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.140> really<00:02:02.439> want<00:02:02.649> to

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
you've ever seen so we really want to
