00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.730
 The worldwide aviation market is one 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.529
 growth market 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.570
 the desire of people's mobility 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.910
 to discover something new the other side 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.140
 the world was visible 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.149
 the wish for freight after 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.040
 globalization also of freight traffic 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.489
 helps the aviation market in sum too 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.190
 to grow 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.750
 the growth market aviation is increasing 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.909
 be with as many as four to five percent 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.790
 output every year and the 23rd 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.920
 we are involved with new eco-efficient ones 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.989
 engine with the beer to the fan here the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.430
 even then the acceptance of aviation 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.050
 market through the lower 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.449
 Fuel consumption but also by 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.100
 significantly lower noise emissions in the 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.699
 to support broad populations 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.410
 help 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.550
 We need the entire aerospace market 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.430
 then look in the next 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.949
 20 years to renew the fleets de facto 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.179
 There will be 20,000 planes in the 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.860
 area in which greed weapons 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.289
 it will be delivered 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.030
 There will be another 10,000 aircraft in the 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.259
 whiteboard the segments to the bmt too 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 is represented very prominently with 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.580
 program lines are delivered 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 so we know the right market 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.399
 with the right products and for 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.399
 right time also in the fans 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.159
 and mtu have been on this for years 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.409
 prepared 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.420
 technologically now also in the main 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.880
 We are working very hard to develop 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.680
 put this model in the market together 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.720
 20 15 airbus also deliver 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.280
 What is the special thing about the great thing 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.530
 this device to buy the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.240
 fuel consumption drops by 15 percent 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.049
 that is, when I look again 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.420
 what are the essentials 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.190
 operating costs an airline and 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.040
 there are expressed in the cache operating 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.039
 costs are the operating costs with approx 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.899
 80 percent and 15 percent reduction 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.610
 this operating cost does not mean 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.880
 less than a million dollars 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.300
 savings per a 320 for each airline 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.300
 per year 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.689
 same dimensions but will be synonymous with these 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.360
 three wax model of noise reduced and 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:20.209
 Reduction of noise specifically one of the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.829
 elements of what they densely populated 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 In addition, additional 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.489
 acceptance for the increase of the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.829
 Generating air traffic here is the 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.569
 Called will be 50 percent quieter 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.349
 than comparable Soderbergh today 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.239
 generation 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.470
 instead we see on the left side 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.629
 behavior and the resulting 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.400
 Noise carpet on the floor of a 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.769
 conventional aircraft and on the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.750
 right side instead of the simulated one 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.920
 with the new weapons and his clear 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.510
 low noise emissions 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.489
 We will add the order backlog 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.680
 These engine models are approximate 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.299
 4000 models before the first delivery 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.310
 of the model 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.840
 that's really world record her something 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.840
 There has never been anywhere in the industry 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.540
 is a great company is the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.790
 technology it is the connection 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.650
 our to our partners to the 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.290
 Great of the world here general electric 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.940
 strangers will not be the ones most of all 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.650
 humans are the people who 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.590
 cooperation the problems in very much 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.790
 solve every day, every day 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.620
 animal in these areas very much 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.330
 unique company speak out 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.920
 Experience I've been in for over 20 years 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.930
 the eu active and different 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.570
 positions development production or 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.020
 recently the program departments are 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.020
 great team
