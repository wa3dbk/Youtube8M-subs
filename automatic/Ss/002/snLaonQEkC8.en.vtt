00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
on your hair what you could do is when

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.610 
on your hair what you could do is when
your<00:03:11.160> hair's<00:03:11.310> parted<00:03:11.550> into<00:03:11.940> four<00:03:12.180> sections

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
your hair's parted into four sections

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.120 
your hair's parted into four sections
take<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> ribbon<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.510> just<00:03:15.510> tie<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.800> the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
take a ribbon and just tie it to the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.380 
take a ribbon and just tie it to the
first<00:03:17.459> strand<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.330> then<00:03:19.320> count<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:20.180> like<00:03:21.180> it's

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
first strand and then count it like it's

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.100 
first strand and then count it like it's
a<00:03:21.510> second<00:03:21.959> strand<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.730> what<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.690> mean<00:03:24.900> by<00:03:24.959> that

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
a second strand so what I mean by that

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.480 
a second strand so what I mean by that
is<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.890> second<00:03:26.400> strand<00:03:26.760> will<00:03:27.450> be<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> ribbon

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
is this second strand will be the ribbon

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.770 
is this second strand will be the ribbon
so<00:03:29.490> basically<00:03:29.850> divide<00:03:30.209> your<00:03:30.390> hair<00:03:30.420> into<00:03:30.600> three

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
so basically divide your hair into three

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.080 
so basically divide your hair into three
equal<00:03:31.050> sections<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.980> tire<00:03:32.490> rub<00:03:32.730> into<00:03:32.880> this

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
equal sections and tire rub into this

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.230 
equal sections and tire rub into this
