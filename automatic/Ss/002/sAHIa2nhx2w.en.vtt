into first thing tomorrow morning as

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.110 
into first thing tomorrow morning as
well<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.070> dealing<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.370> fog<00:00:44.700> we're

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
well so we're dealing with fog we're

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.580 
well so we're dealing with fog we're
also<00:00:45.329> dealing<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> chance<00:00:46.469> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
also dealing with a chance of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.290 
also dealing with a chance of
thunderstorms<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:47.399> did<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.730> some<00:00:47.789> reports

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
thunderstorms we did get some reports

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
thunderstorms we did get some reports
very<00:00:48.690> windy<00:00:49.320> conditions<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.980> parts<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.309> San

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
very windy conditions in parts of San

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.369 
very windy conditions in parts of San
Bernardino<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> high<00:00:51.270> desert<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:51.930> even

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
Bernardino the high desert as well even

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
Bernardino the high desert as well even
a<00:00:52.559> few<00:00:52.710> reports<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.190> dust<00:00:53.579> storm<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.329> again

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
a few reports of dust storm so again

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360 
a few reports of dust storm so again
where's<00:00:55.050> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> sandwiched<00:00:55.920> between<00:00:56.039> these

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
where's kind of sandwiched between these

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.740 
where's kind of sandwiched between these
two<00:00:56.520> pressure<00:00:56.760> gradients<00:00:57.270> we've<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.539> high

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
two pressure gradients we've got high

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.569 
two pressure gradients we've got high
pressure<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.350> we've<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:58.949> low<00:00:59.250> pressure

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
pressure and we've got low pressure

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
pressure and we've got low pressure
making<00:01:00.000> its<00:01:00.090> way<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.270> Southern<00:01:00.690> California

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
making its way into Southern California

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
making its way into Southern California
so<00:01:01.410> that's<00:01:01.980> bringing<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.940> chance<00:01:03.149> maybe

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so that's bringing well the chance maybe

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.149 
so that's bringing well the chance maybe
a<00:01:03.539> shower<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:03.989> thunderstorm<00:01:04.409> cooler<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
a shower or thunderstorm cooler and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.679 
a shower or thunderstorm cooler and
cloud<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.549> conditions<00:01:06.060> high<00:01:06.450> pressure

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
cloud your conditions high pressure

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.380 
cloud your conditions high pressure
bringing<00:01:07.200> pretty<00:01:07.590> warm<00:01:08.159> conditions<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:09.090> us<00:01:09.240> as

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
bringing pretty warm conditions to us as

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
bringing pretty warm conditions to us as
well<00:01:09.600> we're<00:01:09.810> warming<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.290> tomorrow<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.159> then

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
well we're warming up tomorrow and then

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.160 
well we're warming up tomorrow and then
on<00:01:11.850> top<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.299> again<00:01:12.750> since<00:01:12.990> we're

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
on top of that again since we're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.210 
on top of that again since we're
sandwiched<00:01:13.470> between<00:01:13.680> these<00:01:14.010> pressure

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
sandwiched between these pressure

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.060 
sandwiched between these pressure
gradients<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.729> are<00:01:14.970> looking<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:15.540> very<00:01:16.170> windy

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
gradients we are looking at very windy

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
gradients we are looking at very windy
conditions<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.270> spots<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.930> that's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
conditions in some spots so that's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.390 
conditions in some spots so that's
something<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.530> watching<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
something we're watching out for and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.890 
something we're watching out for and
there's<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.880> yellow<00:01:21.180> highlighting<00:01:21.780> right

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
there's that yellow highlighting right

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.539 
there's that yellow highlighting right
there<00:01:22.110> indicating<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> dense<00:01:22.979> fog<00:01:23.189> advisory

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
there indicating that dense fog advisory

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
there indicating that dense fog advisory
so<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.030> forget<00:01:24.290> that's<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.439> effect<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> LA

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
so don't forget that's an effect the LA

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
so don't forget that's an effect the LA

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
top of that we're dealing with a lot of

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.450 
top of that we're dealing with a lot of
moisture<00:04:30.510> low<00:04:31.080> pressure<00:04:31.350> starting<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.250> make

moisture low pressure starting to make

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
its way into Southern California so with

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.020 
its way into Southern California so with
that<00:04:34.830> we've<00:04:35.100> actually<00:04:35.340> been<00:04:35.640> looking<00:04:35.940> at<00:04:36.000> a

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
that we've actually been looking at a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.220 
that we've actually been looking at a
little<00:04:36.210> bit<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.360> moisture<00:04:36.510> cooler<00:04:37.020> and

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
little bit of moisture cooler and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.110 
little bit of moisture cooler and
cloudier<00:04:37.560> conditions<00:04:38.040> along<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.400> coast<00:04:38.640> high

cloudier conditions along the coast high

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.180 
cloudier conditions along the coast high
pressure<00:04:39.450> is<00:04:39.630> still<00:04:39.810> dominating<00:04:40.440> inland<00:04:40.890> so

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
pressure is still dominating inland so

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.530 
pressure is still dominating inland so
with<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.580> very<00:04:41.850> tight<00:04:42.180> pressure<00:04:42.360> gradient

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
with that very tight pressure gradient

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.810 
with that very tight pressure gradient
we've<00:04:42.960> seen<00:04:43.140> some<00:04:43.320> very<00:04:43.710> windy<00:04:44.370> conditions

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
we've seen some very windy conditions

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.430 
we've seen some very windy conditions
