00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.920
 Hi 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.300
 hello welcome to marian for today 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.940
 We go to the fire to stabbing 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.550
 we use the rough edges for this 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.130
 bunsen burner a lighter 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.760
 digital thermometer and a test tube 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.560
 clamp 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.720
 respond what we are going the burner 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.370
 connect to the main tap 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.710
 then we check if the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.710
 gas tap and air supply 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.390
 are open and the main tap is closed 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.210
 then press the measure and quarter turn 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.590
 turn the grass straw down to the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.630
 burner 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.060
 carry you turns on the gas demand 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.130
 you must ensure that there is a flame fashion man 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.130
 with if you don't do this the other 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.700
 now open the gas tap 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.690
 This is a yellow flame also called paulus flame 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.640
 and this is a soot in the flame 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.170
 You can see you through test tube in that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.880
 yellow flame and this is a flame 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.950
 which you never heat when you do 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.160
 when heated, you run the risk that 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.690
 all the glassware turns completely black 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.850
 comes through the rookie of the flame may comes 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.369
 control the temperature with the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.119
 air supply all people for half 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.810
 flan 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.909
 just about just giving 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.530
 if you just do nothing to the fires 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.960
 so you let him plan the poster 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.479
 temperatures meters from the chimney 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.479
 and see that the temperature increases 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.490
 in the blue cone you are at its hottest 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.490
 and then the temperature decreases again 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.479
 if you want to put the white turn the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.649
 main crane height 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.360
 then waited five seconds and then 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.349
 also the gas tap must be treated 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.040
 closed and now you can fire safely 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.040
 thanks wa vianen hear
