00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 to give you a kiss but first I want you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.700

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.179

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:21.450
 I know what to do 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:24.369
 but I really do not see any more than those kisses 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.350
 very delicious so leave me all the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.350
 lip full of evolution 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.100
 one 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.500
 i 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.500
 and my mom 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.199
 good but I'll tell you that I'm also 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.700
 psychology student and that the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.700
 people look like goodies 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:25.649
 they look like me I look like 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.649
 you look like monster chocolate 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.810
 it is not obvious 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:43.110
 the sneakers because nobody eats it 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.110
 because he does not have candy 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.140
 more than ever it gets hard 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.750
 Christmas chocolate because all the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.750
 The world wants to spend a night 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:10.520
 so long the chocolate 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.570
 you are a sublime for the sweet not 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.570
 because you have a little hand 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.890
 in chocolate expired because it looks 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.890
 nice but people burn 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:41.659
 I 'm not like they say to the old man with the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.659
 choco t because he only likes the old 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.799
 They say to him and they say caramel 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 bewitches and is given by a menu 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.240
 and how and why it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.720
 because it took your breath away you erase it
