 now it's really worth it 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.629
 then it's super nice to have 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.320

 and the color of your choice 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.360
 or 15000 6 functions for external slope 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 also to twist the girls and a son of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.820
 nylon so we take the nylon yarn and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.100
 we come twice around his 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.770
 post once we have the right length 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.140
 with the multifunctional loss we come 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 cut the thread of a thousand years for those who 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 have a needle that would be easier 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.729
 but it's the nylon thread to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.530
 inside the church and you me 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 do not extinguish me happy for 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.259
 my part I did not have the church so 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.640
 I took a nail this round and I 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.950
 fired inside to make 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.390
 pass the wire inside the camp 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.689
 in there we have to look for better 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.689
 understand 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.630
 once the placed son we pass the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.189
 pompom in the middle of the wire and to us from 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.140
 put beads on each side of the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:09.239
 a long time, so we locked him up 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:11.190
 or 5 lose I always place well my 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.220
 good candy in the middle and I come to do 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.720
 a knot for not that my pearls and 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.489
 montpon skin does not move so I actually 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.120
 even 2 in order to hold 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.459
 so be careful to do the name well 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.920
 in the right place it will allow the roots 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.230
 not to move not to go from 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.860
 not go for a truism more than a snack 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.860
 than another 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.030
 I put the pearls on the other side and 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.209
 I do once again twice 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.750
 little knot so even though a big 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.030
 place at the hardest part of the diois 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.110
 to make a sliding knot so there I 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.519
 will send you back to another video 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.760
 because I know we see nothing on the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.859
 mine 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.900
 and yet god knows that I tried to 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.639
 Well, you filmed it and I told you 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.709
 liam sends that block of information in 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.370
 to learn how to make a sliding 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.370
 on his bracelet 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:19.159
 once both slides a movie I 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.610
 come cut the ends of nylon threads 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.860
 who are in excess using my forceps 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.480
 multifunctional and I also come after 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.739
 burn the little piece of nylon thread 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.049
 with a lighter now everyone is doing 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.640
 as he wants we cut the bridge good to the 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.640
 desired length for his bracelet 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.380
 here is the result for you to play with 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.820
 the colors you want me to you 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.930
 shows examples of bracelets pass 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.240
 the second why 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.620
 then there is a 6 mm term of the 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.480
 color of his choice me for my part 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.220
 I took the runs ice and pearls 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.480
 swarovski 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.150
 then it will take a string so 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.980
 usually the wines of the parameter one 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.590
 clasp if you want it all depends 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.370
 the length of your collar two 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.790
 nails round head of 50 gymnasts depends 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.540
 so here I will need four for me and 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.890
 a still multifunctional loss is then 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.450
 after if you want a no ah I 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.120
 ties but actually there's no need 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.310
 of nests the nanny the task so I 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.290
 will make a tea the nail round head and 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.860
 I put it so I think I put in 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.200
 bern 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.200
 so here I write the neon pink pearls 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.760
 benmouna in his ranks 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.080
 1 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.660
 using my multifunctional person 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.820
 I come a little bit turned the nail 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.130
 round head of the coup I come to make a 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.699
 second round head let's say and I 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.250
 come cut my nail because he will be 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.930
 of course too big but I do not close it 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.880
 not to be able to actually leave 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.880
 to pass the chain afterwards 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.510
 so once the chain put there I come 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.130
 well closed the new pet of my own 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.740
 I come then cut the chain 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.840
 says to be able to place the pompoms 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.340
 it will be celebrating the pompom it will be the 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.370
 lowest part of our necklace 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.140
 so I cut it to the desired height 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.990
 and then then I take again one more 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.340
 cloud is round and I pass but 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.680
 so there can I have my hand 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.690
 chose several pink afferents to do 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.290
 a gradient of pink I find it a little 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.290
 a little more fun 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.259
 before closing my nail round head the 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.849
 part where the parents head and that I 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.710
 come in net of hit the chain with 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.800
 the little beads at the end and I come 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.050
 close up crazy round head on this side 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.300
 and I just cut the part of the 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.949
 bigger jaws that exceed more 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.719
 early so now we have on one side the 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.370

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.650
