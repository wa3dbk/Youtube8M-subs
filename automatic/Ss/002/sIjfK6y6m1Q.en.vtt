horns
yeah<00:00:41.579> half<00:00:41.879> inch<00:00:42.180> holes<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:44.300> we're

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
yeah half inch holes and we're

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.910 
yeah half inch holes and we're
eventually<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:47.190> four

eventually going to be really four

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
eventually going to be really four
identical<00:00:49.920> holes<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.750> like<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.140> we're

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
identical holes just like and then we're

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.170 
identical holes just like and then we're
gonna<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.500> bolting<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.699> some<00:00:53.969> really

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
gonna be bolting it on with some really
meaty<00:00:54.870> bolts<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:57.020> yeah<00:00:58.020> half<00:00:58.260> inch<00:00:58.440> bolts<00:00:58.739> are

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
meaty bolts and yeah half inch bolts are

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.030 
meaty bolts and yeah half inch bolts are
pretty<00:00:59.039> meaty<00:01:03.290> yeah<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> rest<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> the

media right okay and here's our back

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.200 
media right okay and here's our back
wheel<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.290> timing<00:01:10.680> pulley<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.909> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
wheel and the timing pulley and it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
wheel and the timing pulley and it's
gonna<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.510> position<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.200> been<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:13.530> here

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
gonna be position just been right here

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.630 
gonna be position just been right here
with<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.130> line<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:17.119> yeah<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> motor

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
with this line and yeah and the motor

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.440 
with this line and yeah and the motor
spot<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.759> here

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
spot right here

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
spot right here
and<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> batteries<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and the batteries will be right here and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.749 
and the batteries will be right here and
y'all<00:01:24.000> go<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> pretty<00:01:24.570> good<00:01:24.780> pulley

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.120 

yeah<00:01:29.759> alright<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> first

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
yeah alright so that's it for the first

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.660 
yeah alright so that's it for the first
phase<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.869> next<00:01:34.079> phase<00:01:34.290> will<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:35.060> cutting<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
phase the next phase will be cutting a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.359 
phase the next phase will be cutting a
huge<00:01:38.670> hole<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:40.100> for<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> wheel<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
huge hole right here for the wheel to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.530 
huge hole right here for the wheel to
fit<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:42.560> like<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:45.799> yeah<00:01:46.799> hopefully<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.090> works

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
fit in like so yeah hopefully it works

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
fit in like so yeah hopefully it works
out<00:01:48.930> by<00:01:49.320> securing<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> axle<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> saw

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
out by securing the axle of you saw

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.830 
out by securing the axle of you saw
u-bolts<00:01:52.579> somehow<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.119> well<00:01:54.630> we're<00:01:54.750> gonna

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
u-bolts somehow so well we're gonna

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.149 
u-bolts somehow so well we're gonna
figure<00:01:55.020> out<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.320> works<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:55.860> go<00:01:56.040> in

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
figure out how that works and then go in

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.790 
figure out how that works and then go in
the<00:01:56.250> next<00:01:56.460> video<00:01:56.790> mm-hmm<00:01:57.950> indeed<00:01:58.950> bye
