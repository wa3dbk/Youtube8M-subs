00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello to all its detractors welcome on the video presentation 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.770
 the most worthy of their quest 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.299
 which allows to secure free bodies 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.299
 out of the 130 contracts 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.369
 more modest to several features 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.220
 it can protect the screen the doors 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.659
 holy cocos 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.060
 and double hit 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.999
 so show it 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.310
 do this 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.630
 so to protect from a door 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.100
 in the middle the top of the door 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.760
 these recommend 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.590
 click here 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.760
 in parantheses 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.550
 if the door 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.060
 I use only a year for chemistry it is not necessary 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.280
 bourges parquet the second half 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 the public marc lorti automatically 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.990
 this for me by astrium eads and musicians 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990
 so more can not be worn 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.400
 but I know he was counting on me or another 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 finesse and the door 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 that's what are in the circuits to save the day 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 so you see 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 could not be reopened 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.950
 so now we will protect the kof in the same way we can we 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 to place a sign in front of 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.439
 we do the same way we mark keys on the first line 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.239
 so considered for example we do not want to see 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.290
 a second person pixar for example for everyone 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.069
 the second line and automatically creates alas the trunk that is 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.069
 protected 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.979
 it also works chukov 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.879
 taller 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.259
 like these 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.509
 and what to protect yourself 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:44.989
 if we want 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.149
 then modified 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.029
 as to the deficit 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.479
 we must do so 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.489
 the order that goes off the case 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.199
 floquet that everyone 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.889
 Dupuis 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.579
 finally the modem 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.219
 if for example on hygiene but I do not want to see any more pillars 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.119
 but she does not know where we are going 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.119
 from mulhouse 10h33 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.269
 jemaa couple in action 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.119
 the group number of the line 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.119
 and then 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.169
 drinking chic to replace formulates his weight which is now fixed 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.719
 if the owner 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.949
 of the panel 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.639
 exchanged the 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.769
 henri people who can four men who have deleted 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.989
 So here is this first video tutorial I hope I love you 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.879
 to protect my frank body 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.549
 do not forget that on our fate come see what allowed 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.949
 and that if you do not protect you may have to visit the guides of 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.309
 thieves 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.819
 source have a good evening 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:54.399
