00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
rocking K every flash preco and the most

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
rocking K every flash preco and the most
interesting<00:01:12.090> thing<00:01:12.240> about<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:12.960> can

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
interesting thing about it as you can

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.640 
interesting thing about it as you can
see<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.740> its<00:01:14.189> design<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.970> looks<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.259> bit

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
see is its design it looks more a bit

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.090 
see is its design it looks more a bit
like<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.930> cubic<00:01:20.090> ice<00:01:21.090> cube<00:01:21.600> effect<00:01:22.100> they've

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
like a cubic ice cube effect they've

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.850 
like a cubic ice cube effect they've
made<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.630> square<00:01:24.900> which<00:01:25.140> design<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
made a kind of square which design I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.630 
made a kind of square which design I
think<00:01:26.810> they<00:01:27.810> could<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.110> made<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.950> bit

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
think they could have made it a bit

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.260 
think they could have made it a bit
round<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> side<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:32.270> they've

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
round and two on the side but they've

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
round and two on the side but they've
probably<00:01:33.659> decide<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.650> more<00:01:34.920> creative<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
probably decide to be more creative and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.399 
probably decide to be more creative and
original<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:39.409> they've

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
original and I think that they've

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.800 
original and I think that they've
managed<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.680> well<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.659> an

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
managed to do it so well this is an

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.999 
managed to do it so well this is an
ocular<00:01:46.399> 502<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:48.600> should<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.140> expecting<00:01:49.259> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
ocular 502 we should be expecting it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.389 
ocular 502 we should be expecting it
