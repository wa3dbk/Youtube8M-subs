 contact the rubik cube rubik forum 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.990
 Well, this time, we're going to do what 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.120
 which is the review of the new diane seeks 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.960
 a b2 then I hope thank you 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.500
 new start 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.400
 the things that you have to see is that you do not 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.920
 It was a lot of work to copy 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.510
 this treatment work and it happens to happen 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.170
 and that will be flying the pieces when 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.460
 I hit you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.460
 recovering the piece 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.190
 we can see that at a glance it can 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.810
 it seems that what many say is something 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.550
 coarse to say that it's just a luxury with 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:49.430
 stop we leave it like this this part 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.170
 is no longer identical to that of a is very 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.230
 inspired said we will do version 2 nothing 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.650
 more but these parts are no longer identical 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.810
 they are more careful and have a friction 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.540
 I say that apart from the integrated head 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.870
 that there is already something normal in dalián 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.870
 now 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.580
 the corners the corners already have this 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.229
 equal part and more careful in the part 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.020
 of drawing this part was like that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.390
 a bit more abrupt and usually this 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.090
 he had to be used to 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.100
 will improve and then also the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.229
 characteristic of the new ones is that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.509
 these parts are no longer fixed these 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.670
 parties already dance then this gives you a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.860
 better mobility with respect to cutting 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.690
 corners 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.360
 another interesting thing that I liked about 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.520
 this juice is that the core filled with the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.700
 emails diane usually used that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.010
 they were pretty much this bad things in 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.570
 quality come all full of burrs 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.310
 stars from a plastic apparently from 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.850
 better quality and all the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.850
 of burrs 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 we can already see how things are a bit 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.630
 difficult to place the pieces well because 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.930
 is that 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.000
 even though it moves pretty fast 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.280
 the corner cut is very good 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.670
 short past the 45 degrees without any 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.670
 problem 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.910
 it's because without anything we're not short anymore 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.130
 more not so much problem to where it arrives 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.540
 to cost the universe is equal what 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.450
 regularly cut any player 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.160
 Adrián almost reaching the edge of 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.950
 when the rounding part of 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.750
 the pieces that are cut we see here already 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.890
 when it happened more even to cut but 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.890
 he was cast first 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.489
 how can you realize this too 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.310
 this is another thing that sets it apart from 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.620
 a bus with b 1 practically does not 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.290
 noise and not modified as well as 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.959
 comes from home only what's under this 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.880
 name that has not been compared 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.680
 of a group in b1 that at the time of his 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.880
 tour is very noisy and it's much more 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.450
 rough is very very soft 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.960
 it's practically the same knows that a 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.430
 saint is also very fast with what 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.220
 it is difficult for me 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.950
 control it and has certain things very 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.020
 particular there is something that I do not like 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.270
 who are already using it when 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.640
 start grabbing video to make it 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.790
 move fast has a feeling a 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.030
 so strange that it reminds me of 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.620
 cube that you modify to do it the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.540
 drawing in which says this that of 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.220
 suddenly tends to when we call fast 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.730
 to do too too hard to 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.710
 control 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:36.070
 even difficult for two to finish 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.630
 this one tends to be complicated I do not know what 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.290
 this is due I need to see more 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.209
 in detail the mechanism 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.370
 but if it's something that caught my attention 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.810
 that at first you do not notice this 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.000
 You can have two or three days 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.069
 and it's not very notorious because suddenly 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.080
 you start to give another account 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.200
 it is not hard to dominate the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.330
 speed was very smooth and in a 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.220
 principle does not have to move slower and 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.800
 This gave them much less apply 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.280
 force that someone else like yesterday 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.830
 because this one moves much easier 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.130
 He arrived without doing anything because finally 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.620
 others as you go makes you be the 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.120
 modifications of the edges and 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.769
 round the inside of the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.410
 corners so you have less flex 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.450
 pets this as it comes from box 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.450
 this is a lot our selection 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.770
 you do not need anything 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.050
 Without much force the cube rotates quite 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.139
 easy 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.970
 I really liked it, in fact I've been 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.639
 I am thinking a lot if I'm going to change for 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.349
 me sanchez to do what I need 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.120
 use a little more because it's a matter of 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:46.159
 getting used to is a very particular one 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.409
 energy that does not look like any other 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.759
 let's say that even though in the 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.190
 society then the widening and the 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.629
 speed of scheveningen cutting 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.740
 corners can be from a goya well 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.740
 adjusted but 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.690
 It is very particular 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.130
 not the best I have not been able to get used to 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.810
 In fact, in my time, a 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.120
 little bit with this tube even though 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.060
 speed aggregation but contario 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.770
 let's say if it happens work be able to 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.330
 in doing movements for the same 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.900
 deficient is that he had just as 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.780
 there can go 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.130
 then more plastic than anything else 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.139
 that the game becomes bad new to 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.940
 otherwise it is very good but it is so good 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.169
 that one must adapt to him then 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.360
 I recommend it, I say nothing 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.550
 to raise and change a sanchis by 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.400
 this the simple one I 'm going to review 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.439
 irreplaceable but that would be with very 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.810
 very good to be able to take the place and 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:44.680
 he is fighting 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.680
 especially because 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.570
 but if you can buy it I understand what 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.830
 I recommend and Ryan is showing that 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.360
 every time will innovate more and that 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.050
 simply in three portals it does not have 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.050
 competition
