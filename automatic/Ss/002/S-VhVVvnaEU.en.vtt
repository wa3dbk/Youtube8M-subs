in<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.539> machine<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.709> embalming<00:00:02.190> fluid<00:00:02.669> in

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
in this machine is embalming fluid in

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.190 
in this machine is embalming fluid in
this<00:00:02.909> case<00:00:03.120> we've<00:00:03.330> little<00:00:03.570> bit<00:00:03.659> we<00:00:03.750> have<00:00:03.899> water

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
this case we've little bit we have water

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.220 
this case we've little bit we have water
and<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:05.310> pressure<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.420> turn<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:06.930> and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
and the pressure and you turn it on and

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.470 
and the pressure and you turn it on and
the<00:00:07.470> pressure<00:00:07.710> forces<00:00:08.670> out<00:00:08.970> yes<00:00:10.130> sure<00:00:11.130> okay<00:00:11.730> so

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
the pressure forces out yes sure okay so

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.780 
the pressure forces out yes sure okay so
I<00:00:12.780> can<00:00:13.110> decide<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:13.799> example<00:00:13.830> if<00:00:14.309> I'm<00:00:14.460> going<00:00:14.670> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
I can decide for example if I'm going to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.380 
I can decide for example if I'm going to
be<00:00:14.940> involving<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.900> person's<00:00:16.410> face<00:00:17.100> I'm<00:00:17.609> going

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
be involving a person's face I'm going

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.970 
be involving a person's face I'm going
to<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> lot<00:00:18.990> less<00:00:19.170> pressure<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:19.949> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
to use a lot less pressure because I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.590 
to use a lot less pressure because I
don't<00:00:20.279> want<00:00:20.430> swelling<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.029> occur

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
don't want swelling to occur

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.420 
don't want swelling to occur
but<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:21.960> I'm<00:00:22.140> embalming<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.890> trunk<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
but if I'm embalming the trunk of a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.589 
but if I'm embalming the trunk of a
person<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.119> might<00:00:25.050> use<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.769> little<00:00:26.220> bit<00:00:26.340> more

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
person I might use a little bit more

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.290 
person I might use a little bit more
flow<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.930> might<00:00:28.199> use<00:00:28.410> more<00:00:29.070> pressure<00:00:29.340> this

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
flow I might use more pressure this

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.130 
flow I might use more pressure this

this is this is just put in there to
color<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> fluid<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.470> embalmer<00:01:07.950> as

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
color the fluid so that the embalmer as

however you can you can see the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.980 
however you can you can see the
difference<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> look<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:24.869> how

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
difference if you look you can see how

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.539 
difference if you look you can see how
that<00:01:25.200> actually<00:01:25.409> coats<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.040> inside<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.490> the

bottle mm-hmm that's actually going to
color<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.700> skin<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> things<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
color the skin one of the things that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.330 
color the skin one of the things that
can<00:01:31.320> happen<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.340> put<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.450> strong

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
can happen is if we put a very strong

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
can happen is if we put a very strong
formaldehyde<00:01:35.340> based<00:01:36.020> embalming<00:01:37.020> fluid<00:01:37.530> in

formaldehyde based embalming fluid in

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.359 
formaldehyde based embalming fluid in
them<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.240> react<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> bile<00:01:41.009> that's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
them it can react with the bile that's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
them it can react with the bile that's
in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> body<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> actually<00:01:42.869> turn<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
in the body and it can actually turn the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
in the body and it can actually turn the
body<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.189> really<00:01:45.060> bright<00:01:45.659> bright<00:01:46.500> green<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
body a really bright bright green and I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.370 
body a really bright bright green and I
think<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.240> part<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:48.960> happened

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
think that that's part of what happened

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.380 
think that that's part of what happened
in<00:01:49.530> Hollywood<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:50.369> started<00:01:50.790> doing<00:01:50.970> all

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
in Hollywood when they started doing all

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.380 
in Hollywood when they started doing all
of<00:01:51.420> their<00:01:51.890> zombie<00:01:52.890> movies<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
of their zombie movies in the in the
