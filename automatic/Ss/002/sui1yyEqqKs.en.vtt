starting<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.530> inch<00:02:35.040> away<00:02:35.420> yes<00:02:36.450> Dartmouth<00:02:37.170> now

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
starting to inch away yes Dartmouth now

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.240 
starting to inch away yes Dartmouth now
has<00:02:37.650> six<00:02:38.040> seats<00:02:38.370> over<00:02:38.670> third<00:02:39.060> place<00:02:39.360> Princeton

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
has six seats over third place Princeton

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.470

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.839 
that are still basically level 750
meters<00:02:48.620> into<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.159> race

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
meters into this race

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.809 
meters into this race
so<00:02:50.390> it's<00:02:50.569> Harvard<00:02:51.080> trying<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.159> get<00:02:52.370> further

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819
