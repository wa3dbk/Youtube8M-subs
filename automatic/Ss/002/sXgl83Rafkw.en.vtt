is<00:05:41.300> something<00:05:41.690> very<00:05:41.870> much<00:05:42.050> in<00:05:42.110> common<00:05:42.260> if<00:05:42.710> you

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
is something very much in common if you

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.090 
is something very much in common if you
ask<00:05:42.980> me<00:05:43.220> they<00:05:43.940> are<00:05:44.090> a<00:05:44.120> great<00:05:44.510> convenience<00:05:45.410> but

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
ask me they are a great convenience but

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.670 
ask me they are a great convenience but
a<00:05:46.160> necessity<00:05:46.640> I<00:05:47.180> don't<00:05:47.960> think<00:05:48.230> so

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
a necessity I don't think so

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.830 
a necessity I don't think so
there's<00:05:49.100> nothing<00:05:49.490> that<00:05:49.670> you<00:05:49.790> can<00:05:50.030> do<00:05:50.240> here

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
there's nothing that you can do here

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.560 
there's nothing that you can do here

certainly<00:05:54.170> cutting<00:05:54.620> down<00:05:54.800> on<00:05:54.980> time<00:05:55.250> but

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
certainly cutting down on time but

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.120 
certainly cutting down on time but
really<00:05:56.480> I<00:05:56.660> think<00:05:56.810> these<00:05:57.230> plots<00:05:57.560> of<00:05:57.710> land<00:05:57.740> can

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
really I think these plots of land can
