you type as much as you want now this is
this<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> reason<00:01:17.610> why<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.240> glitch

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this is a reason why I like this glitch

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.670 
this is a reason why I like this glitch
a<00:01:18.570> lot<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:18.900> first<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> all<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.470> didn't

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
a lot it's because first of all I didn't

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.960 
a lot it's because first of all I didn't
really<00:01:19.830> know<00:01:20.009> about<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> second<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:20.790> it's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
really know about it second of all it's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.929 
really know about it second of all it's
simple<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.320> third<00:01:22.500> reason<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.189> think

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
simple and the third reason is I think

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
simple and the third reason is I think
it's<00:01:24.030> cool<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.020> kind<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it's cool because you can kind of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.990 
it's cool because you can kind of
customize<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:26.040> own<00:01:26.100> card<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.909> bit

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
customize your own card for a little bit

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.929 
customize your own card for a little bit
so<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.360> did<00:01:28.159> Club<00:01:29.159> Penguin<00:01:29.430> youtuber<00:01:29.909> or

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
so if I did Club Penguin youtuber or
