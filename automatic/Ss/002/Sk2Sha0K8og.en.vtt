netrunner I can't recall if I was

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.050 
netrunner I can't recall if I was
playing<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.250> actually<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.699> print<00:00:24.000> or

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
playing when it was actually in print or

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
playing when it was actually in print or
not<00:00:24.240> okay<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.560> did<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
not okay and what did you think of that

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.269 
not okay and what did you think of that
one<00:00:26.730> has<00:00:26.880> compared<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.330> one<00:00:27.390> um<00:00:28.279> there's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
one has compared to this one um there's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669 
one has compared to this one um there's
a<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:30.449> card<00:00:30.660> pool<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.050> smaller<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.470> this

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
a the card pool is a lot smaller in this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.410 
a the card pool is a lot smaller in this
one<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:32.820> came<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.149> so

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
one because it just it just came out so

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.910 
one because it just it just came out so
that<00:00:33.570> will<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.780> better<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.469> expansions

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that will get better as the expansions

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
that will get better as the expansions
go<00:00:35.040> along<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:35.880> there<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
go along so right now there was not a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.690 
go along so right now there was not a
whole<00:00:37.469> lot<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.680> options<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> deck

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
whole lot of options for the deck

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.209 
whole lot of options for the deck
building<00:00:39.059> right<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.260> does<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.980> how

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
building right but it does I do like how

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.670 
building right but it does I do like how
the<00:00:41.809> it's<00:00:42.809> been<00:00:42.960> kind<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> slowed<00:00:43.440> down

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the it's been kind of slowed down

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.970 
the it's been kind of slowed down
because<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.250> agendas<00:00:44.700> are<00:00:44.730> there's<00:00:45.980> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
because all the agendas are there's the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.229 
because all the agendas are there's the
agendas<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.430> smaller<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.090> takes

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
agendas are all smaller so it takes

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.760 
agendas are all smaller so it takes
longer<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.960> score<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> agendas<00:00:50.149> I<00:00:51.469> like<00:00:52.469> it's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
longer to score the agendas I like it's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
longer to score the agendas I like it's
mixing<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.969> agendas<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
mixing it up with some like agendas that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
mixing it up with some like agendas that
you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.750> score<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.289> turn<00:00:55.530> instead<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you can score in one turn instead of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.930 
you can score in one turn instead of
taking<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.699> full<00:00:56.879> turn<00:00:57.149> ice<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.199> keep<00:00:58.320> advance

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
taking the full turn ice to keep advance

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.260 
taking the full turn ice to keep advance
sorts<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:01.399> interesting<00:01:02.399> themes<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.059> it'll

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
sorts of interesting themes that it'll

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.880 
sorts of interesting themes that it'll
be<00:01:03.329> nice<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.660> played<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> any<00:01:04.439> expansions

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
be nice to see played on any expansions

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.640 
be nice to see played on any expansions
cool<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.850> did<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.720> did<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.500> like

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
know on I think this was the same way in

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
know on I think this was the same way in
the<00:01:13.650> original<00:01:13.770> netrunner<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.580> doesn't<00:01:15.240> matter

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the original netrunner it doesn't matter

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.910 
the original netrunner it doesn't matter
which<00:01:15.630> side<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.170> whichever<00:01:16.500> side<00:01:16.740> I'm

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
which side of like whichever side I'm

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
which side of like whichever side I'm
playing<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.520> feel<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.000> I've<00:01:18.390> had<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> massive

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
playing I feel like I've had a massive

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.020 
playing I feel like I've had a massive
disadvantage<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.920> well<00:01:20.340> I'm<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
disadvantage really well I'm on the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.370 
disadvantage really well I'm on the
carpets<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> runner<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.290> get

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
carpets like how the runner can just get

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.690 
carpets like how the runner can just get
through<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.650> my<00:01:22.799> stuff<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.430> gonna<00:01:23.520> run

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
through all my stuff and I'm gonna run

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940 
through all my stuff and I'm gonna run
er<00:01:23.729> ah<00:01:23.820> hey<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.450> me<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.840> ice<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.740> kind<00:01:25.890> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
er ah hey it's me this ice what kind of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.600 
er ah hey it's me this ice what kind of
built<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.310> filling<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.909> though<00:01:27.110> um

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
built up filling up in you though um

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
built up filling up in you though um
well<00:01:29.610> mostly<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> uncertainty<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
well mostly is that the uncertainty of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.490 
well mostly is that the uncertainty of
like<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.579> they're<00:01:32.670> doing<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.229> that's<00:01:34.229> more

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
like what they're doing or that's more

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.560 
like what they're doing or that's more
the<00:01:34.680> well<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.850> corp<00:01:36.030> site<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the well from the corp site it's more of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.090 
the well from the corp site it's more of
a<00:01:36.659> certainty<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.320> UH<00:01:37.350> he's<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:37.979> those

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
