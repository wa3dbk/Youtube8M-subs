00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
usually it takes about we work a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
usually it takes about we work a
ten-hour<00:00:50.399> shift<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> it'll<00:00:51.300> take<00:00:51.480> basically

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
ten-hour shift and it'll take basically

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.850 
ten-hour shift and it'll take basically
the<00:00:52.140> whole<00:00:52.260> time<00:00:52.500> got<00:00:53.840> over<00:00:54.840> 40<00:00:55.170> features<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the whole time got over 40 features this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.139 
the whole time got over 40 features this
year<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.660> is<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.350> busy

year so is your really really busy
there's<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> real<00:01:00.420> science<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:02.210> going<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
there's a real science to it going to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.170 
there's a real science to it going to
work<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.510> gravity<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.799> usually<00:01:05.640> helps

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
work with gravity it's usually helps

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.830

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
a idea variety for rails and jumps so it

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.950 
a idea variety for rails and jumps so it
makes<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:04.369> easy<00:02:04.729> for<00:02:04.850> all<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.270> riders<00:02:05.450> just<00:02:05.840> to

makes it easy for all the riders just to

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.669 
makes it easy for all the riders just to
hit<00:02:06.170> smoothly<00:02:07.130> consistently<00:02:08.229> they<00:02:09.229> know

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
hit smoothly consistently they know

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.170 
hit smoothly consistently they know
what's<00:02:09.890> up<00:02:10.069> they've<00:02:10.280> all<00:02:10.640> been<00:02:10.789> doing<00:02:11.030> this

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
what's up they've all been doing this

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.990 
what's up they've all been doing this
for<00:02:11.450> years<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.069> it's<00:02:13.069> looking<00:02:13.670> better<00:02:13.760> and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
for years and it's looking better and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.130 
for years and it's looking better and
better<00:02:14.060> every<00:02:14.420> year

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.810 

so<00:02:21.140> what<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.530> think<00:02:21.680> about<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.070> terrain

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
so what do you think about the terrain

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.630 
so what do you think about the terrain
park<00:02:22.850> here<00:02:23.150> at<00:02:23.360> stevens<00:02:23.870> back<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:25.370> pretty

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
park here at stevens back it's pretty

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.420 
park here at stevens back it's pretty
sweet<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.080> screamed<00:02:27.650> really<00:02:27.830> well<00:02:28.130> and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
sweet and it screamed really well and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.100 
sweet and it screamed really well and
all<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.760> jumps<00:02:29.000> are<00:02:29.090> smooth<00:02:29.330> how<00:02:29.870> about<00:02:30.020> you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
all the jumps are smooth how about you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.970 
all the jumps are smooth how about you
