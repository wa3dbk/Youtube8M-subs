doc Jerry's you could download and a lot
of<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:40.050> actually<00:00:40.200> don't<00:00:40.500> come<00:00:40.830> with<00:00:41.070> any<00:00:41.220> jad

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.490 
of them actually don't come with any jad

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.720 
of them actually don't come with any jad
file<00:00:42.080> so<00:00:43.160> for<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> while<00:00:44.310> I<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.580> actually

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
file so for a while I was actually

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.350 
file so for a while I was actually
developing<00:00:45.270> my<00:00:45.450> own<00:00:45.480> program<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.740> this<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
developing my own program to do this and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.680 
developing my own program to do this and
which<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.660> called<00:00:48.870> jad<00:00:49.230> maker<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.480> I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
which I just called jad maker and and I

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.220 
which I just called jad maker and and I
was<00:00:51.870> working<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> while<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.230> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
was working for a while but and the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.420 
was working for a while but and the
script<00:00:55.560> that<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> had<00:00:56.130> built<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.700> on<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:58.430> fails

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
script that I had built it on and fails

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.420 
script that I had built it on and fails
to<00:00:59.700> work<00:00:59.810> with<00:01:00.810> newer<00:01:01.410> versions<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:01.980> Ubuntu

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
to work with newer versions of Ubuntu

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.460 
to work with newer versions of Ubuntu
and<00:01:02.610> that's<00:01:03.510> obviously<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and that's obviously because the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.760 
and that's obviously because the
scripting<00:01:04.830> language<00:01:05.159> bash<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:05.640> upgraded<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
scripting language bash was upgraded and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.140 
scripting language bash was upgraded and
so<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.890> looking<00:01:07.980> for<00:01:08.250> more<00:01:08.370> solutions<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
so I was looking for more solutions and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.540 
so I was looking for more solutions and
here's<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> found<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> works<00:01:10.890> pretty

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
here's what I found and it works pretty

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.120 
here's what I found and it works pretty
damn<00:01:12.000> nicely<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> only<00:01:14.040> problem

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
damn nicely and now the only problem

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340 
damn nicely and now the only problem
with<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> you're<00:01:15.660> gonna<00:01:15.810> need<00:01:16.020> wine

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
with this is that you're gonna need wine

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.580 
with this is that you're gonna need wine
and<00:01:17.300> if<00:01:18.300> you<00:01:18.390> don't<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.690> what<00:01:18.840> wine<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.140> then

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and if you don't know what wine is then

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.460 
and if you don't know what wine is then
look<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:21.530> Wayne<00:01:22.530> HQ<00:01:23.130> org<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.790> think

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
look it up and Wayne HQ org I think

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.460 
look it up and Wayne HQ org I think
and<00:01:25.620> and<00:01:26.340> you'd<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> install<00:01:27.810> wine<00:01:28.140> with

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and and you'd want to install wine with

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
and and you'd want to install wine with
a<00:01:28.500> PPA<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.760> you<00:01:29.850> don't<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.120> what<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.300> PPA

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
a PPA and if you don't know what a PPA

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.700 
a PPA and if you don't know what a PPA
is<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.530> personal<00:01:32.070> package<00:01:32.370> archive<00:01:32.940> and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
is it's a personal package archive and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.690 
is it's a personal package archive and
what<00:01:34.710> you'd<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:35.010> to<00:01:35.100> look<00:01:35.160> up<00:01:35.370> a<00:01:35.400> separate

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
what you'd want to look up a separate

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.860 
what you'd want to look up a separate
video<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.240> because<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.690> going<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
video for that because I'm not going to

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.800 
video for that because I'm not going to
cover<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> once<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> add<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.630> wine

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
cover out here so once you add the wine

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.170 
cover out here so once you add the wine
PPA<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> install<00:01:40.980> wine<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.550> you're

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
PPA and install wine and you're

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.960 
PPA and install wine and you're
basically<00:01:42.450> good<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.870> go<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.580> then<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:44.730> want

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
basically good to go and then you want

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.190 
basically good to go and then you want
to<00:01:45.090> download<00:01:45.300> this<00:01:46.140> kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.830> jad<00:01:47.220> wizard<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
to download this kind of jad wizard and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
to download this kind of jad wizard and
and<00:01:49.200> I'll<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> link<00:01:50.190> down<00:01:50.430> below<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and I'll have to link down below so you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.390 
and I'll have to link down below so you
can<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.390> straight<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.410> once<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
can go straight to that and once you

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.030 
can go straight to that and once you
download<00:01:53.730> you<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.060> extract<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.830> think

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
download you just extract and I think

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
download you just extract and I think
there's<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.280> folder<00:01:56.580> with<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.910> source<00:01:57.210> code

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
there's a folder with the source code

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.930 
there's a folder with the source code
but<00:01:57.900> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.410> ignore<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.220> or<00:01:59.369> delete<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.820> or

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
but you can ignore it or delete it or

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.170 
but you can ignore it or delete it or
whatever<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.650> all<00:02:01.650> you<00:02:01.860> want<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
whatever and all you want really is the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.490 
whatever and all you want really is the
wizard<00:02:03.570> Exe<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:05.810> you're<00:02:06.810> basically<00:02:07.080> good<00:02:07.410> to
