I'd<00:00:03.659> love<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.140> start<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.500> painting<00:00:05.089> with

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
I'd love to start a painting with

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.350 
I'd love to start a painting with
accidental<00:00:07.319> effects<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.580> that's<00:00:08.849> basically

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
accidental effects and that's basically

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
paint that had been scrubbed on some

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.689 
paint that had been scrubbed on some
reddish<00:00:16.109> tone<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.590> little<00:00:16.619> bit<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.070> blue<00:00:17.400> a

little bit of amber and red and now

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.560 
little bit of amber and red and now
we're<00:00:20.490> gonna<00:00:20.580> make<00:00:20.850> something<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
we're gonna make something out of that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.230 
we're gonna make something out of that
so<00:00:21.930> I'm<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.410> start<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.070> we'll<00:00:23.880> put<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
so I'm going to start and we'll put a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.259 
so I'm going to start and we'll put a
little<00:00:24.810> bit<00:00:24.930> more<00:00:25.170> red<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> sky<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:27.210> is

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
little bit more red in the sky this is

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.560 
little bit more red in the sky this is
natural<00:00:27.720> red<00:00:28.580> very<00:00:29.580> fine

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
natural red very fine

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.790 
natural red very fine
powerful<00:00:31.140> red<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.930> course<00:00:34.200> anything<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
powerful red and of course anything that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.760 
powerful red and of course anything that
goes<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> sky<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.020> certainly<00:00:37.020> reflected

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
goes in the sky is certainly reflected

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.549 
goes in the sky is certainly reflected
in<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> water<00:00:41.510> I'm<00:00:42.510> using<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.899> fan<00:00:43.200> brush<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
in the water I'm using a fan brush and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.290 
in the water I'm using a fan brush and
I'm<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> stick<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.820> fan<00:00:45.090> brush

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
I'm going to stick with the fan brush

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.380 
I'm going to stick with the fan brush
because<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.500> use<00:00:47.039> very<00:00:47.460> little<00:00:47.789> paint<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
because I can use very little paint and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.590 
because I can use very little paint and
force<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.379> around<00:00:49.789> to<00:00:50.789> respond<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.570> I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
force it around to respond to what I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.380 
force it around to respond to what I
want<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.469> using<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.610> lot<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> corner

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
want this is using a lot of the corner

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.869 
want this is using a lot of the corner
of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> fan<00:00:54.780> brush<00:00:55.340> building<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.579> tree<00:00:56.850> over

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
of the fan brush building up a tree over

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.889 
of the fan brush building up a tree over
on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.960> side<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> canvas<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
on the right side of the canvas and you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.859 
on the right side of the canvas and you
notice<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.640> leave<00:01:05.880> little<00:01:06.390> openings

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
notice if you can leave little openings

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.399 
notice if you can leave little openings
here<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.590> that'll<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.960> save<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.200> so

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
here and there that'll just save it so

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.050 
here and there that'll just save it so
that<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> put<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> red<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.520> we'd<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
that when you put the red in we'd be a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
that when you put the red in we'd be a
little<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:12.510> pure<00:01:12.930> rather<00:01:13.470> than<00:01:13.650> working

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
little more pure rather than working

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.789 
little more pure rather than working
into<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> dark<00:01:14.580> wet<00:01:15.060> paint<00:01:15.420> over<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> left

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
into a dark wet paint over on the left

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.320 
into a dark wet paint over on the left
side<00:01:16.979> some<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> same<00:01:17.759> thing<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.150> would

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
side some of the same thing this would

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.929 
side some of the same thing this would
be<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.750> lower<00:01:18.930> tree<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.369> have

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
be a little lower tree and then you have

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.260 
be a little lower tree and then you have
in<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> far<00:01:22.020> distance<00:01:22.729> is<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> recent

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
in the in the far distance is a recent

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
in the in the far distance is a recent
thing<00:01:24.450> such<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.200> close<00:01:25.560> distance<00:01:25.799> far

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
thing such as a close distance far

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.539 
thing such as a close distance far
distance<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> little<00:01:28.110> bit<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.680> soft

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
distance we have a little bit of soft

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.510 
distance we have a little bit of soft
tree<00:01:29.939> line<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.890> let<00:01:32.310> me

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
tree line and that's going to be let me

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390 
tree line and that's going to be let me
come<00:01:32.759> down<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.390> both<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.770> reflections

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
come down with this both for reflections

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.359 
come down with this both for reflections
and<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.180> some<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:38.270> Bank<00:01:39.270> work<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.130> far

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and for some of Bank work so on the far

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
and for some of Bank work so on the far
reflections<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:44.340> far<00:01:44.640> distant<00:01:45.299> trees<00:01:45.600> will

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
reflections the far distant trees will

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.719 
reflections the far distant trees will
use<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> little<00:01:46.680> blue<00:01:48.979> I'll<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.430> case

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
use a little blue I'll see in this case

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.380 
use a little blue I'll see in this case
we're<00:01:51.420> putting<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:52.020> things<00:01:52.470> very<00:01:52.860> early<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
we're putting on things very early that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.770 
we're putting on things very early that
will<00:01:54.630> make<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.770> help<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.759> us<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.420> at<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> same

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
will make a help for us but at the same

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.510 
will make a help for us but at the same
time<00:01:58.049> you're<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.560> holding<00:01:58.829> back<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.430> I'm

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
time you're kind of holding back now I'm

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.709 
time you're kind of holding back now I'm
gonna<00:01:59.670> put<00:01:59.850> some<00:01:59.969> reflections<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.630> water

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
gonna put some reflections in the water

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.200 
gonna put some reflections in the water
holding<00:02:01.710> back<00:02:01.920> your<00:02:02.100> lightest<00:02:02.579> light<00:02:02.880> you're

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
holding back your lightest light you're

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.760 
holding back your lightest light you're
building<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:04.259> desert<00:02:06.500> building<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.649> the

and<00:02:11.560> I'm<00:02:11.680> going<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.070> push<00:02:12.520> just<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:13.510> little<00:02:13.810> bit

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
and I'm going to push just a little bit

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.260 
and I'm going to push just a little bit
of<00:02:14.080> dark<00:02:14.380> down<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.920> here<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.880> we<00:02:16.030> have

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
of dark down in here so we have

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.820 
of dark down in here so we have
something<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> strong<00:02:17.680> gleams<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.880> do

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
something for the strong gleams to do

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.460 
something for the strong gleams to do
but<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:20.950> against<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.760> they<00:02:22.000> will<00:02:22.300> give<00:02:23.230> us<00:02:23.350> a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
but up against and they will give us a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.010 
but up against and they will give us a
further<00:02:23.800> contrast<00:02:26.940> okay<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.540> have<00:02:28.780> just

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
further contrast okay so we have just

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.770 
further contrast okay so we have just
kind<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.700> semblance<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:31.060> there<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:33.780> where

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
kind of a semblance in there of of where

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.890 
kind of a semblance in there of of where
what<00:02:35.140> we<00:02:35.350> want<00:02:35.760> placed<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.150> now<00:02:37.540> I'm<00:02:37.690> going<00:02:37.840> to

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
what we want placed and now I'm going to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.300 
what we want placed and now I'm going to
build<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.230> little<00:02:38.350> lights<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.860> I'm<00:02:38.920> using<00:02:39.130> a

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
build a little lights and I'm using a

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.960 
build a little lights and I'm using a
knife<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.990> this<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.230> taking<00:02:41.740> raw<00:02:42.340> sienna<00:02:42.790> and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
knife and this is taking raw sienna and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.900 
knife and this is taking raw sienna and
white<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.870> push<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.290> quite<00:02:47.620> hard<00:02:47.980> as<00:02:48.280> I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
white and I push that quite hard as I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.280 
white and I push that quite hard as I
blend<00:02:49.210> away<00:02:50.490> away<00:02:51.490> from<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.850> first<00:02:52.810> impact

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
blend away away from the first impact

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.680 
blend away away from the first impact
and<00:02:53.650> then<00:02:54.580> we'll<00:02:54.760> put<00:02:54.940> some<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.360> as<00:02:55.660> a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
and then we'll put some of this as a

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.870 
and then we'll put some of this as a
reflection<00:02:56.500> down<00:02:56.860> in<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.340> water<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:59.760> this<00:03:00.760> is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
reflection down in the water and this is

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.980 
reflection down in the water and this is
what<00:03:01.030> we're<00:03:01.150> talking<00:03:01.300> about<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.720> straight

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
what we're talking about the straight

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.700 
what we're talking about the straight
path<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:03.220> will<00:03:03.400> go<00:03:03.700> right<00:03:04.030> against<00:03:04.710> the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
path so this will go right against the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
path so this will go right against the
embankment<00:03:06.280> there<00:03:07.920> okay<00:03:08.920> let's<00:03:08.950> go<00:03:09.430> even

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
embankment there okay let's go even

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.990 
embankment there okay let's go even
lighter<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.930> take<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.310> white<00:03:12.670> with<00:03:12.970> a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
lighter so we take this is white with a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.600 
lighter so we take this is white with a
little<00:03:13.390> yellow<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.950> will<00:03:15.160> give<00:03:15.190> us<00:03:15.340> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
little yellow in it this will give us a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.320 
little yellow in it this will give us a
real<00:03:15.940> strong<00:03:16.420> light<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:17.520> think<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.880> Sun<00:03:19.150> was

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
real strong light I think the Sun was

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.620 
real strong light I think the Sun was
trying<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.660> be<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:19.870> two<00:03:20.020> places<00:03:20.290> at<00:03:20.590> once

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.380 

and<00:03:26.130> again<00:03:27.300> we'll<00:03:28.300> continue<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:30.390> coming

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
and again we'll continue this coming

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.150 
and again we'll continue this coming
down<00:03:31.540> there<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.110> don't<00:03:32.710> you<00:03:32.830> have<00:03:33.010> that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
down there like that don't you have that

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.440 
down there like that don't you have that
strongly<00:03:33.850> now<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:35.700> what<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.730> would<00:03:36.940> like<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.300> do

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
strongly now and what I would like to do

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.540 
strongly now and what I would like to do
next<00:03:37.720> would<00:03:38.020> be<00:03:38.050> to<00:03:38.200> put<00:03:38.620> just<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:39.040> little<00:03:39.370> bit

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
next would be to put just a little bit

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.740 
next would be to put just a little bit
above<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.870> Reds<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:42.460> reflecting<00:03:43.450> around

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
above the Reds of reflecting around

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.840 
above the Reds of reflecting around
through<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.380> trees<00:03:44.710> not<00:03:45.040> reflecting<00:03:45.730> but

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
through the trees not reflecting but

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.060 
through the trees not reflecting but
they're<00:03:46.000> just<00:03:46.240> peeking<00:03:46.960> through<00:03:50.040> put<00:03:51.040> a

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
they're just peeking through put a

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.860 
they're just peeking through put a
little<00:03:51.250> bit<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.520> green<00:03:51.760> on<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.270> bank<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.810> is

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
little bit of green on the bank this is

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:01.980 
little bit of green on the bank this is
a<00:03:53.430> radiant<00:03:54.430> green<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:56.190> raw<00:03:57.190> Sienna<00:04:00.990> both

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
a radiant green and raw Sienna both

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.960 
a radiant green and raw Sienna both
sides<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.530> little<00:04:02.650> bit<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.190> will<00:04:03.760> have

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
sides a little bit of that will have

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.840 
sides a little bit of that will have
more<00:04:04.440> light<00:04:05.440> on<00:04:05.710> this<00:04:06.070> side<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.670> little

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
more light on this side so a little

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.420 
more light on this side so a little
extra<00:04:07.000> yellow<00:04:07.420> on<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:08.020> close<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:09.070> where<00:04:09.250> the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
extra yellow on it close to where the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.140 
extra yellow on it close to where the
Sun<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:10.060> coming<00:04:11.250> but<00:04:12.250> let's<00:04:12.460> have<00:04:12.670> just<00:04:13.000> a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
Sun is coming but let's have just a

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.350 
Sun is coming but let's have just a
little<00:04:13.510> bit<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.960> pink<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.640> corn<00:04:16.060> acumen

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
little bit of pink this is corn acumen

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.020 
little bit of pink this is corn acumen
rosin<00:04:16.840> white<00:04:17.110> just<00:04:18.010> some<00:04:18.220> little<00:04:18.370> secondary

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
rosin white just some little secondary

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.660 
rosin white just some little secondary
clouds<00:04:19.450> up<00:04:19.750> above<00:04:19.930> so<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:21.070> have<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.340> large

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
clouds up above so you have a large

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.210 
clouds up above so you have a large
expansive<00:04:22.480> sky<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.620> we<00:04:23.740> want<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.040> make<00:04:24.190> sure

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
expansive sky so we want to make sure

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.340 
expansive sky so we want to make sure
that<00:04:24.670> there<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.030> something<00:04:25.360> happening<00:04:25.870> up

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
that there is something happening up

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.550 
that there is something happening up
there<00:04:26.380> with<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:28.270> always<00:04:28.600> like<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.020> idea

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
there with it and I always like the idea

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.090 
there with it and I always like the idea
of<00:04:30.270> let's<00:04:31.270> bring<00:04:31.570> some<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.170> sky<00:04:32.470> down<00:04:32.770> into

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
of let's bring some of the sky down into

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.770 
of let's bring some of the sky down into
the<00:04:33.220> water<00:04:35.790> I'll<00:04:36.790> put<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.060> little<00:04:37.240> bit<00:04:37.420> of<00:04:37.540> green

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
the water I'll put a little bit of green

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.640 
the water I'll put a little bit of green
in<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.770> foreground<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:42.930> then<00:04:43.930> what<00:04:44.170> I<00:04:44.200> think

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
in the foreground and then what I think

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.590 
in the foreground and then what I think
would<00:04:44.830> be<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.980> kind<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.430> almost<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.910> finalizing

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
would be a kind of almost a finalizing

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.170 
would be a kind of almost a finalizing
thing<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:46.960> if<00:04:47.140> you<00:04:47.290> have<00:04:47.500> some<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.180> feeling

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
thing is if you have some of the feeling

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.730

paint for a posad and you could always
say<00:05:06.820> add<00:05:06.940> in<00:05:07.570> tree<00:05:07.960> branches<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:09.040> a

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.700

cetera<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.770> that's<00:05:11.950> the<00:05:12.430> stuff
