00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.069
 why all these 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.490
 we play everything 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.009
 the cylinder already debuted in which are three types of 60 fuel 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.849
 title that did not offer as many characters as lands could fall and 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.130
 three triples that are two or so many plots of the series 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.439
 but with remarkable quality 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.069
 similar king could be considered as one of the titles of the cylinder 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.470
 more complete 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.649
 now all affected from the different game modes 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.840
 let's go by parts 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.110
 In this type of games it is highly recommended to first go through the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.930
 tutorial 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.149
 the title to teach to songo'o year 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.210
 all movements including special 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.200
 very easy to perform fund as he showed conscious energy i 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.300
 the versus mode has been inhibited by what teams the tournament that can be faced 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.320
 the warriors to get the title the arcade mode the momo out mode 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.830
 survival 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.730
 among many others the path of the dragon 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.170
 as the main voice 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.950
 they configure all game modes 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.360
 it is in this last mode where the different posed patterns are presented 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.310
 as an alternative story with confrontations situations that never 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.110
 they happened 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.120
 what would happen 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.820
 from the beginning we will have the most main characters available 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.150
 with enough to unlock especially evolved characters and 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.890
 rifles 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.780
 the very intuitive control allowed us to tell of the beautiful doing combats 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.160
 spectacular 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.400
 the dramatic pieces have been removed and now the special attacks themselves 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.630
 of each character is activated by moving the puppets are the direction today run 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.530
 a definitive attack by pressing digestyc 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.549
 we can assign offensive and defensive attacks to the four directions 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580
 basic 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.310
 the rapidity influences of civil movements in scenes almost totally 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.470
 accessible 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.370
 nolan that seem like combats of the series 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.860
 reinforced impression when presenting the Celtic characters 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.629
 according to claims melee attacks we recover you 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.459
 as well as pressing down on the crosshead 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.280
 if we run out of time we know weary for a few seconds 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.729
 enough for the opponent to leave 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.809
 to win battles we accumulate points that we can also get 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.379
 collecting capsule 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.239
 in a minigame that is cimente fought combat during the loading time 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.069
 these points allow us to buy accessories in the store to harm 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.100
 to the fighters 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.889
 as well as attacks and improvements 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.579
 king without gas a offering very varied game modes with enough hours of 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.279
 game if we want to complete the season there are two important aspects 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.359
 the first one is the one that except the special movements the rest of 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.150
 basic icomo movements are identical with all the used ones vary 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.369
 of a potential defenseless attack according to the level of the character 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.539
 the scenarios are very broad and we can move freely for it 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.119
 but the camera we also wanted network 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.639
 losing the enemy sight too many times 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.999
 and not because it's cool 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.839
 these two factors restrain the initial enthusiasm that the first 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:14.079
 moments of game 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.089
 lowering a paper 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.529
 It is more complete game modes and spectacular min types 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.099
 and other characters over a quarantine made it more customizable 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.439
 pearls important challenges like france fighters depth of game and 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.429
 control 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:29.969
 maybe a bit our equestrian
