you can head as little or as much as
you'd<00:02:36.700> like<00:02:36.870> depending<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:37.990> what<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.380> like<00:02:40.320> as

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
you can probably figure out by now I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.260 
you can probably figure out by now I
like<00:02:43.690> query<00:02:44.200> pepper<00:02:47.790> now<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:48.910> don't<00:02:49.060> want

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270
