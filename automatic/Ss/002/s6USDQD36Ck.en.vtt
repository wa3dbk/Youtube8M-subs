it's hard enough for me to game with the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.950 
it's hard enough for me to game with the
chatpad<00:03:57.390> on<00:03:57.870> there<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.580> I'd<00:04:00.300> usually<00:04:00.510> take<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
chatpad on there so I'd usually take it

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.870 
chatpad on there so I'd usually take it
