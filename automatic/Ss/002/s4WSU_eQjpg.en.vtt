thing going in front of a CR 1 1:26
dummy<00:00:40.470> going<00:00:41.309> through<00:00:41.489> your<00:00:41.579> loadout<00:00:41.880> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
dummy going through your loadout and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.310 
dummy going through your loadout and
then<00:00:42.090> another<00:00:42.360> thing<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.630> actually<00:00:43.140> going

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
then another thing is actually going

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.479 
then another thing is actually going
into<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> raid<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> seeing<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> damage

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
into a raid and seeing the damage

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.869 
into a raid and seeing the damage
properly<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:46.649> let's<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:47.370> through<00:00:47.730> I'm<00:00:47.850> not

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
just want to show you the loadout show

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
just want to show you the loadout show
you<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> read<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.320> send<00:00:52.530> you

so let's go and check it out so first we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229 
so let's go and check it out so first we
got<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> geo<00:00:58.739> Kinesis<00:00:59.160> tree<00:00:59.370> select

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
got the geo Kinesis tree select

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
got the geo Kinesis tree select
everything<00:01:00.660> apart<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> envelop<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
everything apart from the envelop on the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.310 
everything apart from the envelop on the
right<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:02.670> need<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.059> seismic<00:01:03.809> tree<00:01:04.289> I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
right you don't need that seismic tree I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.990 
right you don't need that seismic tree I
haven't<00:01:04.770> picked<00:01:04.860> anything<00:01:05.160> from<00:01:05.399> the<00:01:05.520> seismic

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
haven't picked anything from the seismic

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.810 
haven't picked anything from the seismic
tree<00:01:06.860> obviously<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:08.039> weapon<00:01:08.340> expert<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
tree obviously got weapon expert and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.370 
tree obviously got weapon expert and
tactical<00:01:09.210> genius<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:09.930> you've<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.200> 2

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
tactical genius and then you've got 2

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.130 
tactical genius and then you've got 2
left<00:01:10.619> over<00:01:10.770> I've<00:01:11.190> gone<00:01:11.430> from<00:01:11.729> listening<00:01:12.149> or<00:01:12.360> so

to pop it to give crystal power because

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.130 
to pop it to give crystal power because
that's<00:02:18.280> where<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.760> majority<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.450> your<00:02:19.780> damage

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
that's where the majority of your damage

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.290 
that's where the majority of your damage
will<00:02:20.320> come<00:02:20.530> from<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.910> then<00:02:22.030> we've<00:02:22.180> got

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
will come from and then we've got

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.479 
will come from and then we've got
reinforce<00:02:22.959> which<00:02:23.290> increases<00:02:23.980> your<00:02:24.010> precision

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
reinforce which increases your precision

reinforce which increases your precision
and<00:02:24.820> your<00:02:25.000> critical<00:02:25.450> attack<00:02:25.870> chance<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
and your critical attack chance and you

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.840 
and your critical attack chance and you
get<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> massive<00:02:28.260> massive<00:02:29.260> precision<00:02:29.890> and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
get a massive massive precision and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.760 
get a massive massive precision and
bonus<00:02:31.360> on<00:02:31.600> your<00:02:31.989> horse<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.470> also

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
bonus on your horse this also

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.730 
bonus on your horse this also
so<00:02:34.370> you'll<00:02:34.700> see<00:02:34.910> how<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.150> clip<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.680> a

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
so you'll see how I clip this in a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.370 
so you'll see how I clip this in a

moment anecdotally the rotation so that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.090 
moment anecdotally the rotation so that
is<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.890> load-out<00:02:40.190> let's<00:02:40.670> go<00:02:40.850> across<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.390> here

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.430 
is the load-out let's go across to here
I'm<00:02:43.100> trying<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.760> get<00:02:43.970> as<00:02:44.180> much<00:02:44.480> precision<00:02:44.960> as<00:02:45.260> I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
I'm trying to get as much precision as I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.070 
I'm trying to get as much precision as I
can<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.100> loadout<00:02:46.400> because<00:02:46.880> I'm<00:02:47.120> pretty

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
can with this loadout because I'm pretty

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.800 
can with this loadout because I'm pretty
much<00:02:48.290> relying<00:02:48.650> crystal<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.250> do<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.490> damage

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
much relying crystal to do the damage

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.000 
much relying crystal to do the damage
putting<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.900> laying<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.260> couple<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.590> dots<00:02:51.770> to

but I'm you know the extra precision is

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.180 
but I'm you know the extra precision is
more<00:03:29.390> useful<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:30.050> this<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.710> case<00:03:30.920> when

four<00:03:49.040> six<00:03:49.250> seconds<00:03:49.640> onwards<00:03:50.050> so<00:03:51.310> there<00:03:52.310> we<00:03:52.430> go

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
four six seconds onwards so there we go
