 leaven in Kharkov 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.750
 since in our city such a ferment is not 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.230

 our first trial version why we 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.770
 bought this sourdough 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:29.680
 read on the Internet there as they say 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.810
 so they told about it and bought 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.230
 of course we will try others 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:44.920

 all the news continues to lose weight 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.990
