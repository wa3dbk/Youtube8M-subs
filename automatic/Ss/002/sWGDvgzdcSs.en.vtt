00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.710 

does<00:00:14.280> also<00:00:14.610> work

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
does also work

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.570 
does also work
but<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:17.869> key<00:00:17.990> notice<00:00:18.350> on<00:00:19.010> shift<00:00:19.369> to<00:00:19.490> the

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
fastest program d3 it's also the gears

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:42.700 
fastest program d3 it's also the gears
longer<00:00:28.240> at<00:00:29.240> lower<00:00:29.599> gears

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.829 

it's<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.860> joy<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.370> drive

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.720 

slowly<00:00:47.839> then

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
slowly then

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.780 
slowly then
and<00:00:50.150> relaxing

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
and relaxing

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.840 
and relaxing
there<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.690> second<00:00:53.230> year<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.770> if<00:00:54.100> I<00:00:54.280> switch

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
there is a second year and if I switch

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.779 
there is a second year and if I switch
to<00:00:55.210> d1<00:00:55.900> done<00:00:56.380> probably<00:00:57.370> will<00:00:57.550> go<00:00:58.290> down<00:00:59.290> too

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
to d1 done probably will go down too

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.010 
to d1 done probably will go down too
or<00:01:01.179> up<00:01:01.420> -<00:01:01.629> sorry<00:01:01.839> fourth<00:01:02.559> gear

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
or up - sorry fourth gear

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:14.680 
or up - sorry fourth gear
different<00:01:04.440> fifth<00:01:04.620> giver

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.290 

but<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.260> most<00:01:15.440> obvious<00:01:15.950> mode<00:01:16.490> for<00:01:16.790> this<00:01:16.880> type

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
but the most obvious mode for this type

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.469 
but the most obvious mode for this type
of<00:01:17.510> driving<00:01:17.750> would<00:01:18.020> be<00:01:18.460> just

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.800 

it<00:01:22.259> has<00:01:23.719> here<00:01:24.719> efficient<00:01:25.969> comfort<00:01:26.969> comfort

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.459 

just<00:01:31.470> to

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.219 

have<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.249> relaxing<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.969> possible<00:01:36.509> until

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
have it as relaxing as possible until

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.570 
have it as relaxing as possible until
the<00:01:37.409> Dungeness<00:01:38.359> warm

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.590 

you<00:01:43.910> have<00:01:44.830> somebody

you have somebody
wondering<00:01:47.439> why<00:01:47.560> I'm<00:01:47.740> filming

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 

anyway<00:01:52.500> tomorrow<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.100> airfield<00:01:53.640> time<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.120> we

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
anyway tomorrow it's airfield time so we

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.930 
anyway tomorrow it's airfield time so we
could<00:01:54.420> let<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.960> car<00:01:55.470> loose<00:01:56.540> which<00:01:57.540> will<00:01:57.750> be

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
could let this car loose which will be

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.010 
could let this car loose which will be
interesting

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.530 

with<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> good<00:02:02.829> grip<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:03.250> think<00:02:03.280> good<00:02:03.939> times<00:02:04.240> are

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
with a good grip I think good times are

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.290 
with a good grip I think good times are
set<00:02:05.079> Valley<00:02:05.350> we<00:02:05.740> managed<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.130> do<00:02:08.520> 4.30<00:02:09.520> two

hundred<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:11.050> two<00:02:11.200> baths<00:02:11.500> which<00:02:11.830> i<00:02:11.980> think<00:02:12.040> is

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
hundred on two baths which i think is

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.150
