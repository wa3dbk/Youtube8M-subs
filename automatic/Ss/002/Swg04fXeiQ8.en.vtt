00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.810
 we continue in the Mazatlan aquarium 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.070
 and we find what we are trying to promote 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.740
 some on the one hand others on the other hand but all with exactly the same idea 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.569
 we are trying to build 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.419
 with garbage that is not garbage 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:20.239
 the largest aquarium is also collecting 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.149
 already bottles are already full of sand and we are precisely in the area where 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.179
 is going to build a large laboratory cry and incubation 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.869
 for the thick ones that the aquarium manages 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.180
 and logically 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.250
 we are happy to discover these people are in the line that we are the ones that 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.920
 We are wanting initial 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.150
 and we are trying to provoke in this case l be the director of the aquarium 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.920
 mazatlán would like you to tell us what is the answer you have had your 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.570
 everything with the compilation of this garbage that really bring us their destiny 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.170
 Well the answer was 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.320
 or it is better than what I expected the dire fatal response of the people where they have 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.270
 the visitors themselves collaborated the tourists the containers that we knew 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.940
 motivates them to throw the boat I enjoyed having the other maps and connect it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.250
 we are seeing is that the work of peers 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.510
 that they spend those free time to fill bottles 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.890
 we are already with the art already we have here we are the design 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 the block design is going to be the egg incubation laboratory of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.390
 turtle and conservation of the roads 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 it really is a good idea we are using material that the garbage for 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.229
 others and that for us saves us the expense the expense of bricks saving the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.980
 material expense and that as we are seeing 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.180
 it lasted much longer 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.440
 what invitation would you do to all the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.980
 people who are involved in the construction 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.990
 looking, maybe mazatlán was starting to give a message to the performance and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.740
 can a message to the world because it is all must have a seclusion take 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.920
 from the economic and tourist point of view so that 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.520
 add to this kind of effort well I think the builders have a lot 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.860
 more ideas than we can use 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.290
 this has been an idea that was born dgt that does not leave us another position although 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.540
 we are seeing that the containers as the opinion as insulators of the breasts 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.210
 lighten the breasts there are thousands of applications of a consensus 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.760
 It was in being able to have the same patience 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.579
 okay no eager to do any commercial 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.290
 we take a sweep over the huge amount of bottles he's recovering 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.569
 the aquarium to keep working 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.089
 by mazatlán is still working in the end 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.250
 for the planet 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.970
 thank you
