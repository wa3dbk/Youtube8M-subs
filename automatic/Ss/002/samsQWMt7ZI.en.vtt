00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.620
 That's what they should look like 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.610

 we are curious 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.650
 I will heat up the pan now and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.680
 I'll make the crispy fillets now 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.980

 to be right there we are back 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.209
 the whole thing has something over ten now 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.909
 minutes lasted but a bit 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:53.970
 Delicious took longer but it smells 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:04:04.970
 yummy does not even look that way 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:08.390
 bad from here already from the marinade 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.129
 already got something out of the thing 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:16.670
 I have the wrong side too 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.670
 that's how it has to be 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:47.449
 the normal high that is logical 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:52.009
 that this is not so much therefore is 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:56.740
 sees the marinade, or couples 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.740
 marinade the fish 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.790
 The broccoli made me worse 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.889
 presented 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.660
 Frankly I do not like a problem though 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:36.210
 this works out 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:37.190
 that tastes very delicious cheese 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:48.500
