00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.180
 a phase with grass pitch of the strong 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:38.800
 as in the divisions but what remained 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:41.770
 Wednesday optimistic what that brings 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.579
 something drain the screw given 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.300
 jason priestley canada surpassed that 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:53.160
 brute the nyse over stories over 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.160
 make the daily situation 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.850
 soy is there even the style of their own 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.320
 amsterdam is you spasti millions 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.600
 Mark won really convincing 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.190
 is there something like simple victories or 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.470
 It was no easy victory from the outside 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.130
 like it was definitely not an easy 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.750
 saw 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.610
 that is really very bayreuth 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.320
 I know they say in every talk 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.030
 but once they have a run 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.010
 is it really very loud and with you 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.750
 already 18 in front and there is of course 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.620
 abroad always difficult in nyc man 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.479
 maybe this is a bit too 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.590
 easy to take and has bayreuth 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.390
 life has fought us great 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.820
 very difficult really very good 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.070
 defended and arrived once 50 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.420
 and then I think then you do it 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.110
 The quality of John Bryant then 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.850
 maybe even a game like that 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.010
 away vaira vike difficult throw 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.290
 that does not hit 10 and then calmed down 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.820
 I'm not there for me again 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.140
 Professional play may be so 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.570
 than would you in the third quarter in 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.680
 switching back is the way or have 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.970
 her then also a problem and at 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.380
 motto simply in the phase also good 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.420
 which were held which were very well I 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.920
 I think I 'm among the first 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.360
 Half-time 25 percent out of the field 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.429
 thrown that is underground 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.960
 not a lot of simple things met 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.009
 if they had done that to her then 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.990
 it would also be too hot is already scarce 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.610
 We knew that now 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.380
 hard work we will have 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.090
 last week at 13 at half-time 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.800
 have continued home located forward yet 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.910
 that's why we were finally lost 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.380
 the hat but it is always the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.210
 know difference between something and 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.100
 then really make it for what 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.720
 is it with you in the regular season 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.670
 wanted there already the first one 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.600
 table space or do you want for 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.980
 the play offs will be 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.390
 I think we have to look a bit 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.330
 acknowledge that now in the last 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.920
 weeks with the double load 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.569
 That will be difficult for us 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.520
 First place to pick, I think if 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.400
 bamberg long in the 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.390
 euro would have been there and we 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.740
 not then maybe we would have one 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.880
 chance but we have one now 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.230
 given a few we do not give 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.740
 We wanted to have it clear in Frankfurt 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.260
 lost 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.600
 and you just have to say that clearly 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.470
 We want to watch again now 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 that we are sixth 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.820
 make it clear for the round and in the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.590
 to qualify for the quarter-finals 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.050
 one before to the bbc you believe 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.380
 eat playoff candidate well i hope 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.940
 but I do not think so 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.600
 similar situation of ulm you have 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.970
 decided 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.590
 with young German or simply 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.140
 only German to work 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.580
 in between you have seen today that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.540
 nico and simon and tom are on the field 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.800
 and then there is some time left 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.570
 Bank that's a great thing and me 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.950
 I hope that this is a project next to 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.450
 next to it also established and 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.450
 also in the play-off playoff teams
