00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.710 
actually going to use our texture brush
and<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> really<00:02:34.790> great<00:02:35.030> brush<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.690> use

and this is a really great brush to use

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.900 
and this is a really great brush to use
because<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.290> has<00:02:36.590> almost<00:02:37.220> like<00:02:37.550> two<00:02:37.730> different

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
because it has almost like two different

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.630 
because it has almost like two different
textures<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.510> hair<00:02:38.900> follicles<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:40.069> top<00:02:40.340> part

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
textures of hair follicles the top part

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.160 
textures of hair follicles the top part
which<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.910> see<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.150> white<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.690> actually

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
which you see is white is actually

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.930 
which you see is white is actually
softer<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.860> base<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.580> actually<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> little

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
softer and the base is actually a little

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.610 
softer and the base is actually a little
bit<00:02:44.150> firmer<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:44.600> provides<00:02:44.930> more<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.319> sheer

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
bit firmer so provides more of a sheer

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.550 
bit firmer so provides more of a sheer
to<00:02:46.250> kind<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.610> like<00:02:46.760> intermediate<00:02:47.560> application
