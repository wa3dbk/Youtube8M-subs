00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello everyone guys 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.209
 welcome back to the canal playing clash 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.029
 of plants today we are here with the first 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.250
 episode of the long-awaited series between 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.220
 we have the long awaited quotation marks 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.230
 call what you would like about clash of girls 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 in fact this series will collect the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.920
 your proposals 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.900
 and a true the things you would like to see 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.220
 in the next update in the future 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.519
 flash updates 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.500
 in general then below in the comments 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:40.409
 leave us your proposals then 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.339
 we will do with the second episode of this one 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:46.100
 series works as a kind of 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:51.390
 ranking let's say the most original ones 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.489
 and therefore we invite you again to tell us 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 what you would like in the next ones 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.229
 your original proposal updates 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.080
 always look for original as possible 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:04.470
 I recommend you not say things already said 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.659
 direct as for example what you 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.909
 troops survived in battle 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.130
 these come back to the camps 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.830
 things that obviously will never put 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.010
 so we have find out intentions 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.150
 five of your proposals each time 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.940
 then we start now the number is 5 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.590
 the idea of ​​a disputed Matthew who says 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.540
 healers at 5 in the next 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.110
 update as coming generally 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.650
 this could be an idea 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.659
 quite good because the healer goes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.900
 well apart from that it has four levels there 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.300
 still to be made a lot ahead 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.420
 it also has a lot that does not come out a 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.720
 update of the healer and comes 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.210
 also very little used I don't know right 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.000
 those with the municipality viii max it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.670
 they use the healer or in certain 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.120
 situations such as certain 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.110
 attacks with giants but not things from her 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.770
 and high 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.650
 let's move on to the number 4 and the gamer has us 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.800
 said to want a mastiff 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.720
 the friend at 4 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.160
 this too could be one 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.070
 interesting proposal since it is ok 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.400
 It was also invented recently, we say the 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.850
 however, see a new lava mastiff 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.040
 maximum level the friend could 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.420
 be something useful 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.280
 we put it to the wolf at number 4 is 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.650
 instead which alone because in our opinion 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.530
 there is also a greater need indeed 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.340
 to have a massino in vico at 4th place 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.230
 maybe in a language it goes back to 5 because 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.050
 the mastiff is much more use much more 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.700
 used by the creditor then arrived 3 is 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:57.500
 really low to the number 3 we see 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.530
 a truly original idea of ​​cordoba 200 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.680
 level 2 masons or faster 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.220
 surely he lost on the never said 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.170
 that there will be no upgrades to the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.720
 But the mason's hut if there will be 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.120
 they will put them that they cost in gems and 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.580
 therefore they will not attack him 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.060
 concern because it is seen that it breaks it 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.330
 to the tip very much to the use of gems e 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.100
 so the masons will not be there 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.790
 maybe they will be 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.660
 used enhanced with gems and then 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.610
 we also think the elixir neher however nola 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.630
 lysis and black is not feasible 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.440
 anyway a good second idea 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.340
 position 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.770
 there are dragons at 5 proposed by erwin 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.650
 osmani because as you will have noticed here vi 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.080
 we also have some replay defenses 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.020
 all 8 are really too strong 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.260
 against the inter they put about ten 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.900
 even a little less shots to knock them down 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.970
 and so he gets the 5 would be one 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.280
 excellent solution for those who use it 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.560
 the summer really as a counterweight 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.750
 there is also to say that they invented the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.630
 mastiffs precisely to counteract the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.580
 air defenses however in certain cases for whom 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.920
 wants to continue using dragons from 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.180
 alone does not want to waste lysis and black 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.150
 in the attack 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.150
 it is not right that is a good thing 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.000
 then these dragons at 5 first 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.110
 position we find already that splash 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.430
 we say goodbye and propose a potion that 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.430
 called friendship of love 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.560
 and then there is to see that practice 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.720
 would allow for enemy troops 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.830
 or caste sails with at least when 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:54.050
 home dog attacks hero to be part 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:56.800
 of your army for as long as there is 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.430
 much to discuss about this because 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.099
 it could be at the beam ie the troops 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.500
 in a certain radius or in any case yes 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.680
 concentrate the moment the costs arrive 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.820
 of activation of the function e 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.830
 they still act in that 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.580
 determined place and then the stop and 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.759
 attack his troops 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.990
 however there is also to say that if you are up 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.669
 neither the troops of the Cistern clan in the 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.770
 meaning that let out as well as shots 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.560
 outside the walls and then throw us right away 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.940
 spell and there is the town hall near the 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.639
 clan castle 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.949
 it could be too strong 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.960
 so for this there is to be discussed 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.780
 the same applies to the heroes 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.270
 however, it is still the most original idea 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.449
 for this it deserved the first place 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.240
 having said that the episode ends hopefully 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:53.060
 you enjoyed it if so let us a 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.740
 like encouragement to continue it 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.320
 and above all, propose something to us 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.919
 particular and original and that nobody has 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.360
 never seen 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:07.460
 all three are synonyms but these 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.880
 so please thank you 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.530
 participants if we want to call them that 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.150
 we urge them not to leave comments 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.159
 and proposals and see you at the next 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.159
 video a greeting from evil and iron
