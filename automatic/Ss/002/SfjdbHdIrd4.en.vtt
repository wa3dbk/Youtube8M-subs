00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.819
 hello everyone soon this is a point that should spawn a ball like 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:04.850
 promised 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.850
 I will make my new video that you have been waiting for a week 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:09.619
 since I came back 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.899
 jonker 20 today you have to learn how to make a house 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.060
 so a house had been asked for a lot of points 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.269
 generate a margin I reaped the pam ann of resources 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.970
 with the help of all but united 1-1 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.330
 so you harvest and resources is good but for them dominic term 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.369
 are even better 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.689
 so for samba 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.349
 leave to put in poorer 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.930
 so it's already done 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.730
 so here you are there I have all the necessary ingredients as well for 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.270
 make a hand 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.630
 so we will choose a rather flat terrain to dominate the mountain 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.600
 because when you dominate the mountain, you have a little advantage over 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 monstroplantes for its own medium waves 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.730
 so as I told you in my video for the losc this special on a 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 cap I like everything on the air takes ten artists 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.570
 no spam 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.010
 and for that a little 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.800
 I made currents 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.430
 trambouze 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 suspicious houses in the mouth 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.710
 so when I add some show my beautiful fireplace I did it in it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010
 a wooden house but it was my brother that he had created 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.690
 and here I will show you how to make a real beautiful house 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.590
 so online video 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.060
 it will be really pgm as usual 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.860
 so those 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.810
 you have to remember you need the info site 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.150
 for the door because if you have no door or prou on your broken feet 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.480
 cults to enter the house and I find it rather cool 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.030
 so percentage 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.910
 those who have retained a little tutorial how to make a workshop where you know 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.560
 how to make simple 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.630
 the tax for the first 23 and to ask me ie6 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.520
 and you're going to make a door so that the commentary a spokesperson 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.960
 good it's difficult as usual but it's learned quickly project I 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.420
 thought that like that 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.540
 then place at the door 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 as you want on the club there 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 we do not like this plan that I find it rather cool 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.210
 and we can continue the house 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.850
 so for me what I like is the windows 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.610
 but it turns out that stupid kind put green 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.280
 for windows what we can not hit monsters around the world 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.820
 I leave more delicate 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.469
 and in addition it is much more aesthetic 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.469
 you see I find it rather a squat the leaders like that 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.809
 certainly it is much more aesthetic means 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.839
 so the pace I continue 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.659
 I leave that little or nothing 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.129
 one click on two 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.179
 for 100 th put the monsters 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.179
 like that 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.989
 here I am really a beautiful house 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.359
 like that pretty cool 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.249
 So here we go now 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.429
 I hope I'll have enough bush 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:43.939
 on this point 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.319
 I continue 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.919
 on that side 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.159
 this time 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.309
 point 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.549
 still a little bit 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.549
 and for once at home begins to take shape we know pretty pretty 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.749
 like everything else I do 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:03.029
 I hate I will not brag but I'm pretty good at a mini kraft 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.989
 page turns to the window and that's it 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.909
 and there we are already pretty well protected so if the monsters want to come they 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:11.859
 can not 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.389
 because you see that benji titles to type them like that 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.129
 with a sword I'm going to show you how to do 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.689
 so we make sticks we have to put in beating in August two wheels in the 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:22.409
 floor 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.799
 we are here 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.799
 and we liked it like that 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.559
 the sequel does not announce it does not stop there 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.279
 and not in the andy wheel 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.279
 jean-claude in the evening that some phones I find it rather cool 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.919
 for now 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.540
 house amat% 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.280
 and comfortable there is room and moreover its insolent white so it's 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.519
 carpet I think it's pretty pretty made carpet 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.979
 I will show you 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.909
 essential you must know what is obviously a fireplace but 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.589
 this time I will take my precautions to make it not like the 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.849
 last time 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.849
 it helps me a lot more cool boyer 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.439
 and now so I can do that 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.979
 and I have a fireplace 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.829
 so my house is pretty cool 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.799
 % 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.109
 what could i 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.989
 it's true that drinking it 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.370
 my brother told me that 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.819
 it's not cool all the time with the fire 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.259
 despite everything nothing had told me it was cool 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.620
 I will level it down 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.620
 that's what we have a nice fireplace we can warm up at night 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.029
 no but they are going to the comfortable storing the carpet the carpet in the process of 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.639
 disappear 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.139
 so that's really not cool 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.199
 short 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.680
 I hope you enjoyed my house 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.230
 I will leave you a nice view from above so that you can% 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.960
 to reproduce it if you want 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.590
 in addition I found it rather well 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.130
 in addition if you see that it stretches seaside so it's farting plants 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.080
 and we can hit monsters the protected property 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.800
 so I hope you enjoyed it and see you soon
