g'day<00:00:01.230> folks<00:00:01.410> I<00:00:02.149> forget<00:00:03.149> before<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.419> throw<00:00:03.689> it

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
g'day folks I forget before I throw it

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.960 
g'day folks I forget before I throw it
out<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.200> might<00:00:04.440> as<00:00:04.620> well<00:00:04.680> autopsy<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.520> talking

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
out I might as well autopsy this talking

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.259 
out I might as well autopsy this talking
better<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.450> show<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.049> just<00:00:07.259> how<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.620> works<00:00:07.859> I

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
better and show you just how it works I

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.049 
better and show you just how it works I
still<00:00:09.269> have<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:10.160> input<00:00:11.160> shaft<00:00:11.400> assemblies

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
still have the input shaft assemblies

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.640 
still have the input shaft assemblies

while<00:00:15.719> ago<00:00:16.400> I<00:00:17.400> forgot<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.940> autopsy<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.720> oil

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
while ago I forgot to autopsy this oil

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.450 
while ago I forgot to autopsy this oil
pump<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.470> I'll<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.650> taking<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:19.980> apart<00:00:20.310> as

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
pump so I'll be taking that apart as

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.210 
pump so I'll be taking that apart as
well<00:00:20.930> and<00:00:21.930> I'll<00:00:22.050> demonstrate<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.830> how<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
well and I'll demonstrate just how to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.009

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
big but that is what drives the car it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.330 
big but that is what drives the car it
uses<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.610> fluid<00:02:06.600> friction<00:02:07.280> or<00:02:08.280> resistance

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
that doesn't move this container fits on

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.970 
that doesn't move this container fits on
other<00:03:39.720> words<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> bushing<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:40.680> maybe<00:03:40.830> it

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
other words a bushing in it so maybe it

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.970 
other words a bushing in it so maybe it
does<00:03:41.100> move<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.580> little<00:03:42.120> bit<00:03:42.590> I'll<00:03:43.590> cut<00:03:43.800> one<00:03:43.830> way

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
does move a little bit I'll cut one way

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.710 
does move a little bit I'll cut one way
clutch<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.640> actually<00:03:44.760> yeah

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
clutch on it actually yeah

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.490 
clutch on it actually yeah
silly<00:03:46.200> me<00:03:50.570> as<00:03:51.570> you<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.810> tell<00:03:52.020> I'm<00:03:52.140> not<00:03:52.170> an<00:03:52.380> auto

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
silly me as you can tell I'm not an auto

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.770 
silly me as you can tell I'm not an auto
transpose

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
transpose

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.880 
transpose
but<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.960> only<00:03:55.080> goes<00:03:55.320> one<00:03:55.380> way<00:03:57.020> so<00:03:58.020> yeah<00:03:58.650> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
but it only goes one way so yeah it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.420 
but it only goes one way so yeah it
can't<00:03:59.130> rotate<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.060> opposite<00:04:00.360> direction

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.090 

no<00:04:08.430> there<00:04:09.210> you<00:04:09.300> have<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.600> at<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.100> torque

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
no there you have it at the torque

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.000 
no there you have it at the torque
converter<00:04:11.250> -<00:04:11.910> an<00:04:12.000> automatic<00:04:12.420> transmission

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.360 

and<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.669> is<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.269> auto<00:04:17.900> change<00:04:18.350> fluid<00:04:19.130> pump

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
and that is the auto change fluid pump

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.640 
and that is the auto change fluid pump
which<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.180> proven<00:04:20.630> at<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.840> same<00:04:21.049> speed<00:04:21.380> as<00:04:21.530> the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
which is proven at the same speed as the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.760 
which is proven at the same speed as the
engine<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.660> that's<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.960> drive<00:04:24.229> gear<00:04:24.500> there

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
engine so that's the drive gear there

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.790 
engine so that's the drive gear there
with<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.010> square<00:04:25.510> keys<00:04:26.510> on<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:29.680> it's<00:04:30.680> just

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
with the square keys on it and it's just

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.240 
with the square keys on it and it's just
basically<00:04:31.250> gear<00:04:31.669> type<00:04:32.000> hydraulic<00:04:32.600> pump

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
basically gear type hydraulic pump

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.620 
basically gear type hydraulic pump
fluids<00:04:34.250> forced<00:04:34.639> through<00:04:34.940> this<00:04:35.120> passageway

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
fluids forced through this passageway

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.680 
fluids forced through this passageway
here<00:04:36.639> taught<00:04:37.639> me<00:04:37.820> which<00:04:37.970> way<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.210> one<00:04:38.449> goes

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
here taught me which way this one goes

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.680 
here taught me which way this one goes
but<00:04:38.990> there's<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.830> big<00:04:40.370> passageway<00:04:40.880> here<00:04:41.210> here

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
but there's a big passageway here here

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.950 
but there's a big passageway here here
and<00:04:42.050> here

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
and here

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:53.680 
and here
this<00:04:44.960> is<00:04:45.169> through<00:04:47.800> here<00:04:48.800> out<00:04:52.240> there's<00:04:53.240> two

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
this is through here out there's two

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.629 
this is through here out there's two
passage<00:04:54.050> rows<00:04:54.229> in<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.770> one<00:04:54.949> out<00:04:54.979> sighs<00:04:55.430> out

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
passage rows in and one out sighs out

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:12.400 
passage rows in and one out sighs out

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:30.740 

Paige<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:13.220> spit<00:05:13.430> on<00:05:13.610> top
