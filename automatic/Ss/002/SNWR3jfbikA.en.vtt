00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 I am a finger The product to introduce today is here 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:12.540
 dj mix track pro and it's a fine product 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.620
 The other day I raised the video of dj play, but what I was using at that time a 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.220
 It becomes this 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.020
 Well then, this doesn't mean that you can do dj alone 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.100
 I put dj software on my computer 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.300
 The dj software will be run on this controller 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.360
 Though I say to the dj using a PC in the wind that pcdj 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.890
 After all pcdj is easy to manage the station 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.620
 You can put all the songs there and call them there and do barts . 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.239
 Then why do you use it for trial 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.879
 Yes the setting is over and the connection with the personal computer is actually this usb cable 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:51.969
 It 's so easy to do with one book 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:54.010
 I choose a song from here that I want to put together and manage my favorite songs 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:58.810
 It means that you should do 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.790
 When you decide on the song you want to stream , press this load 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.440
 With Bain 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.440
 It's not a problem, for example 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.210
 Like 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 Guy in this mast What this Haipasupi the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.250
 It proposed doing this is being opened 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.420
 On the other hand it's leaving only this 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.420
 If it is a low pass filter 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.740
 The heat insulation is turned off 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.640
 When the bass remains, there is a function called flanger after that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:46.820
 Love effects are applied and there is a hot class, so this is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.820
 You can register the place there at the moment you 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.950
 I did it now 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.950
 Rice cost 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.750
 You can register like that, but there are many other functions, but for now it's here 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.750
 I want to end 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.360
