that there are four steps to this cast
on<00:01:09.189> and<00:01:09.549> it<00:01:09.970> makes<00:01:10.180> two<00:01:10.509> stitches<00:01:11.140> at<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.409> time

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
on and it makes two stitches at a time

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.480 
on and it makes two stitches at a time
and<00:01:12.189> I'm<00:01:12.700> going<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.560> describe<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:15.069> needle

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
and I'm going to describe the needle

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.599 
and I'm going to describe the needle
movement<00:01:15.969> not<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.630> yarn<00:01:16.840> movement<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.609> after

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
movement not the yarn movement and after

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.480 
movement not the yarn movement and after
every<00:01:19.090> step<00:01:19.659> of<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:20.289> four<00:01:20.530> steps<00:01:20.829> bring<00:01:21.310> your

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
every step of the four steps bring your

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.779 
every step of the four steps bring your
needle<00:01:21.670> up<00:01:21.819> into<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:23.439> between<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.189> two<00:01:24.429> yarns

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
needle up into in between the two yarns

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.510 
needle up into in between the two yarns
just<00:01:25.630> for<00:01:25.869> clarity<00:01:26.409> until<00:01:26.829> you<00:01:26.979> really<00:01:27.280> get

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
just for clarity until you really get

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.959 
just for clarity until you really get
the<00:01:27.670> idea<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:28.240> this<00:01:28.420> cast<00:01:28.749> on<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:30.100> I'm<00:01:30.459> going<00:01:30.909> to

color yarn don't let go of the Slipknot
or<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:33.140> might<00:02:33.350> lose<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> stitch<00:02:34.600> here's<00:02:35.600> an

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
or you might lose a stitch here's an

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.350 
or you might lose a stitch here's an
example<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.560> knitted<00:02:37.070> showing<00:02:37.760> this

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
example that I knitted showing this

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.840 
example that I knitted showing this
invisible<00:02:39.140> cast<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.740> I've<00:02:40.100> knitted<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.610> few

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
invisible cast on I've knitted a few

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.680 
invisible cast on I've knitted a few
rows<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.370> see<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.210> I<00:02:44.420> want

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
rows and so you can see that if I want

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.840 
rows and so you can see that if I want
to<00:02:44.960> knit<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.320> opposite<00:02:45.770> direction<00:02:45.950> now<00:02:46.430> I

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
to knit in the opposite direction now I

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.540 
to knit in the opposite direction now I
can<00:02:47.330> just<00:02:47.510> slip<00:02:48.050> these<00:02:48.350> stitches<00:02:48.680> onto<00:02:49.220> a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
can just slip these stitches onto a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.330 
can just slip these stitches onto a
needle<00:02:49.910> here's<00:02:50.600> my<00:02:50.840> slipknot<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.740> would<00:02:52.130> just

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
needle here's my slipknot I would just

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.860 
needle here's my slipknot I would just
pull<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.700> out<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:54.880> slip<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.060> stitches<00:02:56.390> onto

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
pull that out and slip the stitches onto

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.290 
pull that out and slip the stitches onto
the<00:02:57.170> needle<00:02:57.470> now<00:02:57.650> one<00:02:58.190> thing<00:02:58.490> you<00:02:58.700> want<00:02:58.730> to

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
the needle now one thing you want to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.070 
the needle now one thing you want to
realize<00:02:59.600> is<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:00.710> particular<00:03:00.980> cast<00:03:01.700> on

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
realize is that this particular cast on

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.820 
realize is that this particular cast on
its<00:03:03.080> twists<00:03:03.740> every<00:03:04.400> other<00:03:04.610> stitch<00:03:05.620> here<00:03:06.620> you

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
its twists every other stitch here you

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.670 
its twists every other stitch here you
can<00:03:07.040> see<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> stitch<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.120> note<00:03:08.990> that<00:03:09.020> this<00:03:09.440> is

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
can see a stitch and note that this is

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.430 
can see a stitch and note that this is
the<00:03:09.830> right<00:03:10.160> side<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.970> stitch<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:12.170> is

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the right side of the stitch and this is

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.870 
the right side of the stitch and this is
the<00:03:13.040> left<00:03:13.490> side<00:03:13.820> of<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.360> stitch<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.880> typically

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
the left side of the stitch so typically

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.930 
the left side of the stitch so typically
knitters<00:03:17.510> work<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.860> right<00:03:19.190> side<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.820> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
knitters work with the right side of the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.720 
knitters work with the right side of the
stitch<00:03:20.210> in<00:03:20.540> front<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.230> needle<00:03:21.440> now<00:03:22.190> if<00:03:22.430> you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
stitch in front of the needle now if you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.010 
stitch in front of the needle now if you
work<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:24.080> combination<00:03:24.920> method<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:26.239> have<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
work the combination method you have the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.440 
work the combination method you have the
left<00:03:27.380> side<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.220> stitch<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:28.790> front<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.300> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
left side of the stitch in front of the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.190 
left side of the stitch in front of the
needle<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.760> both<00:03:31.760> ways<00:03:32.060> are<00:03:32.300> correct<00:03:32.810> it's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
needle so both ways are correct it's

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.640 
needle so both ways are correct it's
just<00:03:33.620> being<00:03:33.890> consistent<00:03:34.780> knowing<00:03:35.780> your<00:03:36.110> style

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
just being consistent knowing your style

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.090 
just being consistent knowing your style
so<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.940> provisional<00:03:38.450> cast-on<00:03:38.989> causes<00:03:39.739> every

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
so the provisional cast-on causes every

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.150 
so the provisional cast-on causes every
other<00:03:40.220> stitch<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:40.970> be<00:03:41.090> twisted<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.680> want

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
other stitch to be twisted so you want

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.729 
other stitch to be twisted so you want
to<00:03:43.580> put<00:03:44.510> all<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.900> stitches<00:03:45.350> on<00:03:45.530> your<00:03:45.560> needle

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
to put all the stitches on your needle

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.270 
to put all the stitches on your needle
and<00:03:46.160> then<00:03:48.220> go<00:03:49.220> through<00:03:49.610> again<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:51.040> make<00:03:52.040> them

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
and then go through again and make them

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.120 
and then go through again and make them
all<00:03:52.510> consistent<00:03:53.510> on<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.260> way<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.680> they<00:03:54.920> are

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
all consistent on the way that they are

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.190 
all consistent on the way that they are
oriented<00:03:55.550> on<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.150> needle<00:03:58.540> here<00:03:59.540> I've<00:03:59.810> slipped

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
oriented on the needle here I've slipped

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.979 
oriented on the needle here I've slipped
some<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.980> stitches<00:04:01.640> onto<00:04:02.000> another<00:04:02.600> needle

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
some of the stitches onto another needle

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.860 
some of the stitches onto another needle
from<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.890> holding<00:04:04.310> yarn<00:04:04.610> from<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:04.970> invisible

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
from the holding yarn from the invisible

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.600 
from the holding yarn from the invisible
cast<00:04:06.380> on<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:07.010> if<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.390> can<00:04:08.660> see<00:04:09.310> some<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.340> the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
cast on and if you can see some of the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.229 
cast on and if you can see some of the
stitches<00:04:11.030> seem<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.630> be<00:04:11.810> angled<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:13.670> that's

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
stitches seem to be angled and that's

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.500 
stitches seem to be angled and that's
because<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.440> left<00:04:15.769> side<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.820> stitch<00:04:17.150> is

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
because the left side of the stitch is

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.170 
because the left side of the stitch is
in<00:04:18.109> front<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.980> needle<00:04:19.130> rather<00:04:19.609> than<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
in front of the needle rather than the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.620 
in front of the needle rather than the
right<00:04:20.419> side<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.019> stitch<00:04:21.910> this<00:04:22.910> stitch<00:04:23.180> is

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
right side of the stitch this stitch is

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.440 
right side of the stitch this stitch is
oriented<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:25.220> way<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:25.400> normally<00:04:26.030> knit<00:04:26.240> which

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
oriented the way I normally knit which

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.540 
oriented the way I normally knit which
is<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.810> right<00:04:26.990> side<00:04:27.290> of<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.919> stitch<00:04:28.130> in<00:04:28.310> front

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
is the right side of the stitch in front

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.159 
is the right side of the stitch in front
of<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.760> needle<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.060> I'll<00:04:29.360> just<00:04:29.570> slip<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:29.990> off

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
of the needle so I'll just slip that off

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.130 
of the needle so I'll just slip that off
purl<00:04:30.560> wise<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.520> next<00:04:31.880> stitch<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.690> can<00:04:32.870> see

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
purl wise the next stitch you can see

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.390 
purl wise the next stitch you can see
that<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.560> left<00:04:33.860> side

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
that the left side

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.520 
that the left side
of<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.669> stitch<00:04:34.970> is<00:04:35.240> in<00:04:35.509> front<00:04:35.840> of<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.169> needle

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
of the stitch is in front of the needle

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.969 
of the stitch is in front of the needle
and<00:04:36.680> I'm<00:04:37.520> going<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:37.910> slip<00:04:38.449> that<00:04:38.720> from<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.770> back

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
and I'm going to slip that from the back

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.120 
and I'm going to slip that from the back
so<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:41.180> causes<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.410> right<00:04:42.620> side<00:04:42.979> of

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
so that that causes the right side of

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.670 
so that that causes the right side of
the<00:04:43.220> stitch<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.580> be<00:04:43.970> in<00:04:44.060> front<00:04:44.360> now<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:45.320> next

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
the stitch to be in front now the next

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.060 
the stitch to be in front now the next
one<00:04:45.889> is<00:04:46.840> normal<00:04:47.840> for<00:04:48.050> my<00:04:48.199> way<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.560> knitting<00:04:48.919> and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
one is normal for my way of knitting and

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.050
