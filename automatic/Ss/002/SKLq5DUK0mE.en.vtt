the<00:00:19.449> t-square<00:00:19.900> fractal<00:00:20.349> technically<00:00:21.099> this<00:00:21.400> is

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
the t-square fractal technically this is

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.849 
the t-square fractal technically this is
a<00:00:22.060> two<00:00:22.630> dimensional<00:00:22.779> fractal<00:00:23.349> but<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:23.710> does

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
a two dimensional fractal but it does

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.920 
a two dimensional fractal but it does
translate<00:00:24.340> into<00:00:24.550> three<00:00:24.790> dimensions<00:00:25.270> very

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
translate into three dimensions very

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.560 
translate into three dimensions very
easily<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.500> very<00:00:26.559> well<00:00:27.000> its<00:00:28.000> construction<00:00:28.360> is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
easily and very well its construction is

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.299 
easily and very well its construction is
very<00:00:28.599> similar<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:29.079> the<00:00:29.230> cantle<00:00:29.619> dust<00:00:29.860> which<00:00:30.129> I

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:30.309 
very similar to the cantle dust which I

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.369 
very similar to the cantle dust which I
did<00:00:30.579> in<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:30.790> previous<00:00:31.149> tutorial<00:00:31.719> but<00:00:32.259> it's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
did in the previous tutorial but it's

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.130 
did in the previous tutorial but it's
got<00:00:32.469> a<00:00:32.500> couple<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.770> extra<00:00:32.920> steps<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.899> let's<00:00:35.050> get

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
got a couple of extra steps so let's get

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.400 
got a couple of extra steps so let's get
started<00:00:35.559> I'm<00:00:35.770> going<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:35.980> start<00:00:36.190> with<00:00:36.309> a<00:00:36.340> cube

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
started I'm going to start with a cube

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.470 
started I'm going to start with a cube
what<00:00:38.410> did<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:38.590> mentioned<00:00:39.090> one<00:00:40.090> one<00:00:40.300> one

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
what did I mentioned one one one

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.100 
what did I mentioned one one one
millimeters<00:00:42.150> like<00:00:43.150> all<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.450> like<00:00:44.020> all

fractals<00:00:44.500> in<00:00:44.650> cinema<00:00:44.920> 4d<00:00:45.130> it's<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.400> lot<00:00:45.550> easier

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
fractals in cinema 4d it's a lot easier

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.600 
fractals in cinema 4d it's a lot easier
to<00:00:45.940> start<00:00:46.090> small<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.780> get<00:00:47.200> larger<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:48.100> divide

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
to start small and get larger and divide

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.110 
to start small and get larger and divide
a<00:00:48.640> larger<00:00:49.090> object<00:00:49.210> into<00:00:50.110> smaller<00:00:50.380> ones<00:00:51.120> press

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
a larger object into smaller ones press

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.670 
a larger object into smaller ones press
H<00:00:52.329> on<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.540> keyboard<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:52.960> zoom<00:00:52.989> into<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.440> cube

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
H on the keyboard to zoom into the cube

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.569 
H on the keyboard to zoom into the cube
and<00:00:53.890> then<00:00:54.820> with<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.030> cube<00:00:55.239> selected<00:00:56.399> insert<00:00:57.399> a

and then with the cube selected insert a

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.229 
and then with the cube selected insert a
cloner<00:00:58.180> object<00:00:58.950> whilst<00:00:59.950> holding<00:01:00.219> alt<00:01:00.640> to

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
cloner object whilst holding alt to

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.540 
cloner object whilst holding alt to
instantly<00:01:01.960> make<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.260> cube<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.710> child<00:01:03.040> of<00:01:03.309> a

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
instantly make the cube a child of a

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.190 
instantly make the cube a child of a
cloner<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:07.270> what<00:01:07.689> I'm<00:01:07.750> going<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:07.899> do<00:01:07.990> is

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
cloner and then what I'm going to do is

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.069 
cloner and then what I'm going to do is
change<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.590> cloner<00:01:08.829> from<00:01:09.520> linear<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.450> grid

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
change the cloner from linear to grid

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.690 
change the cloner from linear to grid
array<00:01:12.270> count<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.719> 2<00:01:13.959> and<00:01:14.999> the<00:01:15.999> size<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.780> 2<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
array count to 2 and the size to 2 and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.899 
array count to 2 and the size to 2 and
this<00:01:18.909> gives<00:01:19.090> us<00:01:19.209> these<00:01:19.420> 8<00:01:19.899> cubes<00:01:20.319> now<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.670> last

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
this gives us these 8 cubes now the last

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.639 
this gives us these 8 cubes now the last
step<00:01:22.149> in<00:01:22.329> making<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.869> first<00:01:23.020> iteration<00:01:23.409> of

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
step in making the first iteration of

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.709 
step in making the first iteration of
the<00:01:23.770> t-square<00:01:24.100> fractal<00:01:24.459> is<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:25.299> make<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.479> new

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
the t-square fractal is to make a new

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.139 
the t-square fractal is to make a new
cube<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.259> for<00:01:26.439> this<00:01:26.529> I'll<00:01:26.709> just<00:01:26.889> drag<00:01:27.850> out<00:01:28.119> my

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
cube and for this I'll just drag out my

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.989 
cube and for this I'll just drag out my
original<00:01:28.749> oops<00:01:29.759> drag<00:01:30.759> out<00:01:30.909> my<00:01:30.939> original<00:01:31.539> and

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
original oops drag out my original and

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:36.349 
original oops drag out my original and
double<00:01:33.999> the<00:01:34.090> dimensions<00:01:34.719> to<00:01:35.049> 2<00:01:35.229> millimeters

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
double the dimensions to 2 millimeters

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.059 
double the dimensions to 2 millimeters
and<00:01:37.359> then<00:01:37.959> the<00:01:38.079> next<00:01:38.289> step<00:01:38.439> is<00:01:38.469> to<00:01:38.770> make<00:01:38.920> the

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
and then the next step is to make the

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.879 
and then the next step is to make the
cloner<00:01:39.369> object<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.849> child<00:01:40.119> of<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:41.229> large<00:01:41.469> cube

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
cloner object a child of the large cube

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:47.190 
cloner object a child of the large cube
and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:44.439> to<00:01:45.240> control<00:01:46.240> drag<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.810> cloner

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
and then to control drag the cloner

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.800 
and then to control drag the cloner
object<00:01:47.849> to<00:01:48.849> make<00:01:48.969> a<00:01:48.999> new<00:01:49.179> copy<00:01:49.389> of<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.689> and

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
object to make a new copy of it and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.980 
object to make a new copy of it and
delete<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.139> cube<00:01:50.289> that<00:01:50.439> was<00:01:50.590> inside<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.130> and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
delete the cube that was inside it and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.739 
delete the cube that was inside it and
then<00:01:52.990> double<00:01:53.349> these<00:01:53.560> dimensions<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.759> 4<00:01:54.969> and

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
then double these dimensions to 4 and

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.370 
then double these dimensions to 4 and
put<00:01:56.229> this<00:01:56.349> cube<00:01:56.649> inside<00:01:56.919> the<00:01:57.130> new<00:01:57.279> cloner<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
put this cube inside the new cloner and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.330 
put this cube inside the new cloner and
again<00:01:59.619> like<00:01:59.799> before<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:02.439> going<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.649> control

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
again like before I'm going to control

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.599 
again like before I'm going to control
drag<00:02:03.369> out<00:02:03.789> a<00:02:03.819> new<00:02:04.119> cube<00:02:04.419> and<00:02:04.979> these<00:02:05.979> this<00:02:06.399> cube

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
drag out a new cube and these this cube

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.580 
drag out a new cube and these this cube
needs<00:02:06.849> our<00:02:06.939> dimensions<00:02:07.359> of<00:02:07.539> 4<00:02:08.080> millimeters

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
needs our dimensions of 4 millimeters

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.740 
needs our dimensions of 4 millimeters
and<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.970> we<00:02:10.060> go<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.420> second

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
and there we go it's the second

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.990 
and there we go it's the second
iteration<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.770> t-square<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.430> fractal<00:02:12.819> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
iteration of the t-square a fractal and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.430 
iteration of the t-square a fractal and
it<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.660> literally<00:02:14.410> just<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.390> kenza<00:02:17.260> dust

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
it is literally just like the kenza dust

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.870 
it is literally just like the kenza dust
it's<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> case<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.130> lather<00:02:18.520> rinse<00:02:18.670> repeat

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
it's the case of lather rinse repeat

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.710 
it's the case of lather rinse repeat
control<00:02:19.870> drag<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.560> cloner

the cube in the center copy out the cube
I<00:02:49.580> need<00:02:50.209> double<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.750> last<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.140> mentioned<00:02:51.500> which

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
I need double the last I mentioned which

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.380 
I need double the last I mentioned which
again<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.340> 8<00:02:53.239> millimeters<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.880> learn<00:02:56.060> inside

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
again is 8 millimeters to learn inside

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.330 
again is 8 millimeters to learn inside
the<00:02:56.569> cube<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.349> there<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:57.709> go<00:02:57.829> that's<00:02:58.220> the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
the cube and there we go that's the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.729 
the cube and there we go that's the
third<00:02:58.790> iteration<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.959> really<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.349> as<00:03:00.500> simple

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
third iteration it really is as simple

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.240 
third iteration it really is as simple
as<00:03:00.860> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
as that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.670 
as that
