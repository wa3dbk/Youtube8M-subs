there's a conflict between science and

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.440 
there's a conflict between science and
religion<00:04:27.290> science<00:04:28.130> should<00:04:28.520> trump<00:04:28.880> religion

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
religion science should trump religion

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.070

fundamentalist but I see science is the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.440 
fundamentalist but I see science is the
