00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the branches but the roots are just

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.959 
the branches but the roots are just
growing<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:42.660> I've<00:00:42.870> combed<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.649> roots

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969

this<00:01:12.090> cover<00:01:14.359> all<00:01:15.359> right<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.749> I<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:15.869> I'm

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
this cover all right but I think I'm

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
this cover all right but I think I'm
going<00:01:16.319> to<00:01:16.409> try<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.649> put<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.249> bones<00:01:17.429> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
going to try to put this on the bones I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.559 
going to try to put this on the bones I
thought<00:01:17.789> this<00:01:18.000> morning<00:01:18.829> I<00:01:19.829> may<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:21.179> little

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
thought this morning I may do a little

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.779 
thought this morning I may do a little

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
more root pruning here to see what kind

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
I can expose it's probably going to go

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.059
