00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.729 
whether we can put a room together
that's<00:02:18.889> been<00:02:19.069> difficult<00:02:19.219> all<00:02:19.579> season<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.739> we

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
that's been difficult all season but we

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.099 
that's been difficult all season but we
why<00:02:22.129> ever<00:02:22.340> there's<00:02:22.549> a<00:02:22.629> chance<00:02:23.629> we<00:02:24.290> will<00:02:24.499> be

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
why ever there's a chance we will be

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.209 
why ever there's a chance we will be
giving<00:02:27.109> it<00:02:27.200> everything<00:02:27.409> that<00:02:27.560> we've<00:02:27.769> got<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
giving it everything that we've got and

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.009 
giving it everything that we've got and
that<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.790> point<00:02:28.969> that<00:02:29.329> that<00:02:29.689> there's

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
that is the point that that there's

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.800 
that is the point that that there's
always<00:02:30.170> side<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.859> come<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.459> late<00:02:31.810> charges

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
always side to come with late charges

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.069 
always side to come with late charges
and<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.349> think<00:02:33.620> because<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.879> that<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.359> gives<00:02:35.689> a

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
and I think because of that it gives a

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.099 
and I think because of that it gives a
lot<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.709> clubs<00:02:36.950> there<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.599> belief<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:38.900> that

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
lot of clubs there the belief that that

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.050 
lot of clubs there the belief that that
can<00:02:39.290> do<00:02:39.409> that<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.519> speak<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.879> any<00:02:41.000> of

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
can do that and if you speak to any of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.909 
can do that and if you speak to any of
our<00:02:41.150> players<00:02:41.419> they're<00:02:41.719> still<00:02:41.959> really<00:02:42.260> up<00:02:42.650> for

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
our players they're still really up for

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.929 
our players they're still really up for
the<00:02:42.980> challenge<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:43.489> although<00:02:44.269> it's<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.769> know

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
the challenge in although it's you know

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.429 
the challenge in although it's you know
it's<00:02:46.939> going<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.180> be<00:02:47.269> difficult<00:02:47.480> yeah<00:02:48.139> we<00:02:48.290> can

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
it's going to be difficult yeah we can

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.240 
it's going to be difficult yeah we can
still<00:02:48.620> do<00:02:48.769> it<00:02:48.799> if<00:02:49.159> you<00:02:49.340> had<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.519> give<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.389> novice

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
still do it if you had to give a novice

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.250 
still do it if you had to give a novice
manager<00:02:52.250> going<00:02:52.430> into<00:02:52.760> management<00:02:53.150> one<00:02:54.049> piece

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
manager going into management one piece

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.539 
manager going into management one piece
of<00:02:54.409> advice<00:02:54.739> what<00:02:54.980> would<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.219> be

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
of advice what would it be

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.240 
of advice what would it be
be<00:02:55.879> yourself<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:57.459> think<00:02:58.459> the<00:03:00.129> people<00:03:01.129> always

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
influence and I think and the answer

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.849 
influence and I think and the answer
that<00:03:05.389> a<00:03:05.419> lot<00:03:05.659> of<00:03:05.719> people<00:03:05.959> say<00:03:06.169> oh<00:03:06.199> as<00:03:06.349> well<00:03:06.560> you

go<00:03:24.139> down<00:03:24.349> bat<00:03:25.389> but<00:03:26.389> I<00:03:26.810> think<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:27.889> try<00:03:28.099> and

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
go down bat but I think if you try and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.420 
go down bat but I think if you try and
be<00:03:28.579> somebody<00:03:29.209> else<00:03:29.419> you're<00:03:30.259> gonna<00:03:30.400> come<00:03:31.400> a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
be somebody else you're gonna come a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.679 
be somebody else you're gonna come a
cropper<00:03:31.699> because<00:03:33.040> clearly<00:03:34.239> you've<00:03:35.239> got<00:03:35.449> to<00:03:35.569> be

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
cropper because clearly you've got to be

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.460 
cropper because clearly you've got to be
yourself<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.489> people<00:03:37.959> won't<00:03:38.959> always<00:03:39.169> like

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
yourself and people won't always like

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.559 
yourself and people won't always like
that<00:03:39.709> but<00:03:39.949> it<00:03:40.040> doesn't<00:03:40.069> matter<00:03:40.489> what<00:03:41.239> people

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
that but it doesn't matter what people

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.110 
that but it doesn't matter what people
see<00:03:41.780> out<00:03:42.439> there<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:42.919> not<00:03:43.040> always<00:03:43.250> what<00:03:43.639> happens

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
see out there is not always what happens

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.469 
see out there is not always what happens
in<00:03:44.299> here<00:03:44.509> anyway<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.849> people's<00:03:46.849> perceptions

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
in here anyway so people's perceptions

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.319 
in here anyway so people's perceptions
of<00:03:47.979> the<00:03:48.979> personalities<00:03:49.729> of<00:03:49.879> managers<00:03:50.299> and

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
of the personalities of managers and

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.899 
of the personalities of managers and
players<00:03:50.870> may<00:03:51.379> be<00:03:51.409> totally<00:03:52.370> different<00:03:52.549> from

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
players may be totally different from

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.999 
players may be totally different from
what<00:03:53.000> they<00:03:53.269> actually<00:03:53.419> are<00:03:53.689> but<00:03:54.019> you've<00:03:54.739> got<00:03:54.919> to

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.009 
what they actually are but you've got to

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.679 
what they actually are but you've got to
be<00:03:55.069> yourself<00:03:55.129> because<00:03:55.579> when<00:03:56.209> you're<00:03:56.389> under

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
be yourself because when you're under

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.749 
be yourself because when you're under
pressure<00:03:56.829> it's<00:03:57.829> your<00:03:57.979> own<00:03:58.099> personality<00:03:58.669> that

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
pressure it's your own personality that

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:05.060 
pressure it's your own personality that
