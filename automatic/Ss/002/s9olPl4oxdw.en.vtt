first<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.770> was<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:13.920> little<00:04:13.950> bit<00:04:14.190> worried<00:04:14.430> about

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
first I was a little bit worried about

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.070 
first I was a little bit worried about
that<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:15.210> ledge<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.570> have<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.780> have<00:04:15.870> fly

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
that that ledge you have to have fly

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.740 
that that ledge you have to have fly
then<00:04:16.260> once<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.470> saw<00:04:16.590> how<00:04:16.709> far<00:04:16.950> away<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.850> was<00:04:18.030> you

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
then once I saw how far away it was you

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.270 
then once I saw how far away it was you
know<00:04:18.840> we<00:04:18.959> just<00:04:19.140> knew<00:04:19.290> sailing<00:04:19.680> tonight<00:04:19.769> got<00:04:20.250> a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
know we just knew sailing tonight got a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.879 
know we just knew sailing tonight got a
nice<00:04:20.459> little<00:04:20.609> flight<00:04:21.570> out<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.750> it

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.110 

wingsuits<00:04:26.889> make<00:04:27.159> the<00:04:27.280> jumpers<00:04:27.669> even<00:04:27.939> more

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
wingsuits make the jumpers even more

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.749 
wingsuits make the jumpers even more
aerodynamic<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.289> I<00:04:29.650> think<00:04:29.919> it's<00:04:30.159> the<00:04:30.310> closest

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
aerodynamic and I think it's the closest

flight one of my favorite parts is the

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.679 
flight one of my favorite parts is the
first<00:04:45.460> few<00:04:45.669> seconds<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.210> feels<00:04:46.389> like<00:04:46.539> you're

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
first few seconds it feels like you're

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.959

floating<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:47.620> feels<00:04:47.830> like<00:04:48.009> there's<00:04:48.550> no<00:04:48.729> wind

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
floating it feels like there's no wind

floating it feels like there's no wind
you<00:04:49.150> just<00:04:49.360> jumped<00:04:49.960> off<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.080> cliff<00:04:50.229> and<00:04:50.590> it's
