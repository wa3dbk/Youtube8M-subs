00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:10.160
 you're beautiful seven weeks without down 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.129
 make that is the motto of 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.900
 fast action 7 weeks without 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:20.539
 in 2015, from the ash Wednesday I 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.820
 It will not be easy for everyone 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.980
 on ash Wednesday morning in the mirror 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.420
 to watch I think of rhinelander I 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.580
 but also think of people in 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.529
 alemannic so in the morning on 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.050
 Ash Wednesday brush your teeth in 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:38.210
 to look mirror and say you are 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.379
 nice because you might have it then 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.469
 on tuesday and on rose Monday 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.480
 the dmi ways stand 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.280
 So because you are a long road 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.680
 go through and what else 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.070
 I think we should nevertheless 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.660
 Make sure we start in the morning 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.850
 with whom you are beautiful and not us 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.489
 make yourself down and then in the sense 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.920
 Love your next one like yourself 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.810
 others also make that clear 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.300
 God-pleasing existence in the Christian 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.310
 sense not to do with the massacre 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.820
 did not mess with himself 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.540
 to do the same with the other one 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.050
 but with what we commonly 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.860
 to name acceptance 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.560
 the way we are we are wanted 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.490
 we children of god wyss in biblical 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.670
 language means the children of god and the god 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.090
 this jesus of nazareth the god's son 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.170
 which means calling yourself human 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.390
 God has a human face 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.610
 given because we are all children of God 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.320
 and because he creates these siblings 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.910
 make this brotherhood visible 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.070
 that's our topic in this 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.380
 time of 7 weeks without 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.900
 that means we want a little bit 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.620
 this forced optimization please 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.000
 starting with the last stroke of the question 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.190
 should not you still a crown 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.790
 crown on your wisdom tooth 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.979
 no, we want wisdom without a crown 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.140
 make visible and wisdom not 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.230
 only on the teeth but the wisdom 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.970
 which we can give each other by ourselves 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.450
 encourage others and each other 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.090
 Respect and enjoy each other 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.569
 even a fold can be nice 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.500
 also a grown earlobe can 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.810
 be beautiful 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.430
 I mean the beauty surgeons 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.709
 about this motto of seven weeks without 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.900
 not very happy for us 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.459
 Do not operate your business and if 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.370
 They promote that you are beautiful by it 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.209
 want it to be weeks on the wine 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.360
 on beer or on a crackpot sausage 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.099
 renounce 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.079
 that does not mean that in the 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.090
 Evangelical senses means fasting 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.750
 That's what the great reformer tells us 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.370
 ulrich zwingli met the word fast 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.530
 for example in English summed up 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.400
 news items or in german sister 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.040
 word 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.629
 fasting means resolving 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.790
 decide like jesus in the desert 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.440
 He has not done in the desert around 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.090
 nothing to eat but has little 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.160
 Eaten because there was little in the desert 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.410
 but it is the desert to be alone 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.730
 can think about whether it creates this 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.650
 away from him his heavenly father 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.870
 has pointed with the cross and 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.459
 Resurrection to end and we 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.200
 should collect us and maybe 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.780
 Talk about how we can talk in groups 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.290
 our lives make it 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.690
 to make people more friendly 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.700
 starting with the friendliness to us 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.799
 even how can we decide to 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.230
 say you are beautiful and as I said 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.310
 also in the morning before Ash Wednesday 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.310
 start with it
