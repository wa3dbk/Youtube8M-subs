let's jump in okay so the first thing
with<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.740> new<00:00:26.130> oculus<00:00:26.580> rift<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
with the new oculus rift is the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.990 
with the new oculus rift is the
positional<00:00:27.689> tracking<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:29.310> ability<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> like

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
positional tracking the ability to like

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
positional tracking the ability to like
not<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.779> move<00:00:30.929> your<00:00:31.080> head<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.619> move<00:00:31.769> your

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
not just move your head but move your

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
not just move your head but move your
orientation<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:34.410> works<00:00:34.710> extremely<00:00:35.640> well

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
orientation and it works extremely well

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.540 
orientation and it works extremely well
like<00:00:36.450> looking<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> cage<00:00:37.440> around<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
like looking at the cage around this a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.119 
like looking at the cage around this a
little<00:00:38.940> hovercraft<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:40.350> being<00:00:40.649> able<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
little hovercraft like being able to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.000 
little hovercraft like being able to
like<00:00:42.059> move<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.750> look<00:00:42.899> around<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.559> objects

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
like move and look around the objects

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.900 
like move and look around the objects
like<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:45.000> wild<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.489> really

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
like this is is wild it really really

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.209 
like this is is wild it really really
adds<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> immersion<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.710> almost<00:00:52.980> don't

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
adds to the immersion you almost don't

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.010 
adds to the immersion you almost don't
notice<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.300> definitely<00:00:54.629> done<00:00:54.780> well

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
notice it so it's definitely done well

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.360 
notice it so it's definitely done well
when<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> don't<00:00:55.680> even<00:00:55.770> really<00:00:55.949> notice<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
when you don't even really notice the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
when you don't even really notice the
positional<00:00:56.760> tracking<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.770> brain

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
positional tracking you know your brain

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
positional tracking you know your brain
just<00:00:58.949> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> accepts<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.050> now<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.350> this

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
just kind of accepts it now for this

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.609 
just kind of accepts it now for this
game<00:01:02.629> it's<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> racing<00:01:03.989> game<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.530> we're

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
game it's like a racing game and we're

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
game it's like a racing game and we're
kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.949> along<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.250> wire<00:01:05.610> inside<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
kind of going along a wire inside of a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.870 
kind of going along a wire inside of a
computer<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.490> neat<00:01:08.700> concept

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
computer so it's a really neat concept

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
computer so it's a really neat concept
and<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.450> surprisingly<00:01:10.080> goes<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.830> well

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and it surprisingly goes really well

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
and it surprisingly goes really well
with<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> rift<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.000> I've<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.869> joystick<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
with the rift so I've got a joystick in

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.570 
with the rift so I've got a joystick in
front<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> me<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.010> set<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:16.400> kind<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> use

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
front of me here set up and kind of use

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580 
front of me here set up and kind of use
that<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.909> maneuver<00:01:18.270> along<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> wire<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.439> can

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that to maneuver along the wire you can

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.330 
that to maneuver along the wire you can
spin<00:01:19.799> around<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.130> 360<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:22.340> really

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
spin around in 360 it's it's a really

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:37.050 
spin around in 360 it's it's a really
interesting<00:01:23.430> concept

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.730 

so<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.720> mean<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:37.990> resolution<00:01:38.530> on<00:01:38.619> this

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
so I mean the resolution on this

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.730 
so I mean the resolution on this
headsets<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.280> lot<00:01:39.460> better<00:01:39.610> than<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:39.939> last<00:01:39.970> one

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
headsets a lot better than the last one

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130 
headsets a lot better than the last one
it's<00:01:41.740> definitely<00:01:42.070> good<00:01:42.430> enough<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.759> play

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
it's definitely good enough to play

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.219 
it's definitely good enough to play
there's<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.229> samsung<00:01:44.740> galaxy<00:01:45.360> note<00:01:46.360> 3<00:01:46.689> screen

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
there's a samsung galaxy note 3 screen

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.069 
there's a samsung galaxy note 3 screen
in<00:01:47.350> here<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:48.490> it's<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:48.850> under<00:01:49.060> 400<00:01:49.450> pixels

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
in here so it's just under 400 pixels

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.520 
in here so it's just under 400 pixels
per<00:01:50.259> inch<00:01:50.289> it's<00:01:50.860> definitely<00:01:52.530> definitely

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
per inch it's definitely definitely

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.410 
per inch it's definitely definitely
playable<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.549> obviously<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.030> don't<00:02:01.210> want<00:02:01.240> to

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
playable so obviously you don't want to

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.999 
playable so obviously you don't want to
hit<00:02:01.509> those<00:02:01.720> red<00:02:02.020> things<00:02:02.049> they'll<00:02:02.740> slow<00:02:02.950> you

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
hit those red things they'll slow you

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.200 
hit those red things they'll slow you
down<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:06.340> know<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:06.520> just<00:02:06.670> try<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.909> kind<00:02:07.090> of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
down you know you just try to kind of

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.680 
down you know you just try to kind of
slip<00:02:07.420> through<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:09.090> hit<00:02:10.090> as<00:02:10.209> many<00:02:10.360> as<00:02:10.569> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
slip through and hit as many as the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.030 
slip through and hit as many as the
green<00:02:10.869> pads<00:02:11.110> as<00:02:11.319> possible

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.309 

now<00:02:16.579> at<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.879> time<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.360> I'm<00:02:17.480> filming<00:02:17.959> this

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.709 

you<00:02:21.319> know<00:02:21.409> not<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> lot<00:02:21.799> of<00:02:21.950> people<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.719> not

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
you know not a lot of people have not

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.660 
you know not a lot of people have not
get<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:23.959> script<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.469> have<00:02:24.799> this<00:02:24.920> technology<00:02:25.129> so

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
get a script and have this technology so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.690 
get a script and have this technology so
i<00:02:25.909> think<00:02:26.480> there's<00:02:26.810> about<00:02:26.870> 800<00:02:27.650> people<00:02:28.250> or<00:02:28.489> so

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
i think there's about 800 people or so

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.429 
i think there's about 800 people or so
who<00:02:28.909> have<00:02:29.030> played<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.329> game<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:29.719> far<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.170> i'm

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
who have played this game so far and i'm

currently ranked 7 yeah you can see the
little<00:02:36.950> screen<00:02:37.400> down<00:02:37.670> in<00:02:37.819> front<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.120> me<00:02:38.180> there

little screen down in front of me there

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.179 
little screen down in front of me there
it<00:02:40.159> tells<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.549> your<00:02:40.670> current<00:02:41.060> track<00:02:41.420> time<00:02:42.189> the

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
it tells you your current track time the

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.059 
it tells you your current track time the
world<00:02:43.430> record<00:02:43.939> and<00:02:44.060> then<00:02:44.780> obviously<00:02:45.560> your

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
world record and then obviously your

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.160 
world record and then obviously your
best<00:02:48.939> now<00:02:49.939> one<00:02:50.209> thing<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.599> devs<00:02:50.810> are<00:02:50.959> going<00:02:51.109> to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
best now one thing the devs are going to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.929 
best now one thing the devs are going to
have<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.409> do<00:02:51.560> with<00:02:51.709> this<00:02:51.829> game<00:02:52.069> it'd<00:02:52.519> be<00:02:52.730> really

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
have to do with this game it'd be really

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.720 
have to do with this game it'd be really
nice<00:02:53.180> if<00:02:55.299> you<00:02:56.299> could<00:02:56.450> select<00:02:56.689> your<00:02:56.930> own<00:02:56.989> music

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
nice if you could select your own music

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.580 
nice if you could select your own music
generally<00:02:58.730> when<00:02:58.819> I'm<00:02:58.970> playing<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.750> load

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
generally when I'm playing this I load

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.399 
generally when I'm playing this I load
up<00:03:00.620> my<00:03:00.829> own<00:03:00.980> playlist<00:03:01.519> I<00:03:04.450> mean<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.780> looks<00:03:05.989> looks

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
up my own playlist I mean it looks looks

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.170 
up my own playlist I mean it looks looks
fantastic<00:03:06.919> like<00:03:07.340> just<00:03:07.549> looking<00:03:07.760> around<00:03:07.849> at

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
fantastic like just looking around at

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.330 
fantastic like just looking around at
things

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.580 

it<00:03:14.879> looks<00:03:15.060> incredible

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.559 

now<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.220> don't<00:03:21.489> really<00:03:21.700> get<00:03:21.879> motion<00:03:22.239> sick<00:03:22.450> from

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
now I don't really get motion sick from

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.119 
now I don't really get motion sick from
this<00:03:22.750> game<00:03:22.959> I'm<00:03:23.290> not<00:03:23.470> sure<00:03:23.709> if<00:03:23.890> it's<00:03:23.980> because

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
this game I'm not sure if it's because

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.880 
this game I'm not sure if it's because
I've<00:03:25.060> logged<00:03:25.420> several<00:03:26.050> hundred<00:03:26.319> hours<00:03:26.440> in

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
I've logged several hundred hours in

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.699 
I've logged several hundred hours in
virtual<00:03:27.430> reality<00:03:27.459> or<00:03:28.110> if<00:03:29.110> it's<00:03:29.349> kind<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.590> a

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
virtual reality or if it's kind of a

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.190 
virtual reality or if it's kind of a
concept<00:03:30.129> of<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> game<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:31.750> spinning<00:03:32.110> around

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
concept of the game like spinning around

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.199 
concept of the game like spinning around
this<00:03:32.440> wire<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:33.010> having<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:33.760> feeling<00:03:34.090> as<00:03:34.180> if

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
this wire and having like feeling as if

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.790 
this wire and having like feeling as if
the<00:03:34.390> gravity<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.110> center<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.620> wire

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
the gravity is in the center of the wire

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.650 
the gravity is in the center of the wire
opposed<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.640> there<00:03:36.910> being<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.269> an<00:03:37.420> up<00:03:37.540> and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
opposed to there being like an up and

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.309 
opposed to there being like an up and
down<00:03:39.120> I'm<00:03:40.120> not<00:03:40.269> really<00:03:40.420> sure<00:03:40.510> which<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:41.049> but

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
down I'm not really sure which it is but

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.770 
down I'm not really sure which it is but
you<00:03:41.620> know<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.670> as<00:03:43.150> I'm<00:03:43.330> sure<00:03:43.360> you've<00:03:43.599> noticed

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
you know it as I'm sure you've noticed

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.830 
you know it as I'm sure you've noticed
you<00:03:44.110> can<00:03:44.200> get<00:03:44.319> going<00:03:44.590> pretty<00:03:44.799> fast<00:03:45.629> of<00:03:46.629> course

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
you can get going pretty fast of course

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.400 
you can get going pretty fast of course
if<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.019> stop<00:03:47.230> hating<00:03:47.500> those<00:03:47.590> red<00:03:47.799> things<00:03:49.410> you

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
if I stop hating those red things you

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.289 
if I stop hating those red things you
know<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.620> really<00:03:51.010> get<00:03:51.250> moving<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:51.700> it

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
know you really get moving and it

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:59.990 
know you really get moving and it
doesn't<00:03:52.599> seem<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.810> make<00:03:53.410> me<00:03:53.560> feel<00:03:53.739> sick<00:03:53.950> at<00:03:54.069> all

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.450 

so<00:04:00.630> my<00:04:00.810> best<00:04:01.080> time<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> minute<00:04:01.890> 23<00:04:02.780> which<00:04:03.780> is

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
so my best time is a minute 23 which is

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.040 
so my best time is a minute 23 which is
just<00:04:05.460> like<00:04:05.640> two<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.090> half<00:04:06.240> seconds<00:04:06.780> behind

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
just like two and a half seconds behind

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.660 
just like two and a half seconds behind
the<00:04:07.530> world<00:04:07.710> record<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.720> I'm<00:04:09.720> definitely

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
the world record and I'm definitely

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.940 
the world record and I'm definitely
going<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.790> try<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.090> take<00:04:12.210> that<00:04:12.270> spot<00:04:12.800> this<00:04:13.800> is

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
going to try and take that spot this is

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.190 
going to try and take that spot this is
one<00:04:14.100> of<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> better<00:04:14.460> VR<00:04:15.270> experiences<00:04:15.930> that's

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
one of the better VR experiences that's

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.289 
one of the better VR experiences that's
currently<00:04:16.709> available<00:04:19.700> now<00:04:20.700> my<00:04:20.850> computer<00:04:21.239> is

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
currently available now my computer is

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.060 
currently available now my computer is
really<00:04:21.480> good<00:04:21.750> at<00:04:21.870> doing<00:04:22.260> one<00:04:22.500> thing<00:04:22.530> very

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
really good at doing one thing very

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.380 
really good at doing one thing very
efficiently<00:04:23.730> but<00:04:23.970> when<00:04:24.090> i<00:04:24.120> start

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
efficiently but when i start

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.450 
efficiently but when i start
multitasking<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.500> kind<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.770> slows<00:04:26.010> down<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.310> bit

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
multitasking it kind of slows down a bit

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.090 
multitasking it kind of slows down a bit
so<00:04:26.730> my<00:04:26.820> frame<00:04:27.090> rates<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.360> little<00:04:27.390> low<00:04:27.980> while<00:04:28.980> I'm

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
so my frame rates a little low while I'm

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.000 
so my frame rates a little low while I'm
filming<00:04:29.370> but<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:31.200> know<00:04:31.290> even<00:04:31.590> with<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:31.830> low

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
filming but you know even with it low

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.360 
filming but you know even with it low
it's<00:04:32.280> still<00:04:33.350> no<00:04:34.350> definitely<00:04:34.740> playable<00:04:35.160> with

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
it's still no definitely playable with

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.760 
it's still no definitely playable with
the<00:04:36.270> new<00:04:36.419> oculus<00:04:36.870> rift<00:04:37.140> you<00:04:37.320> want<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.620> be<00:04:37.680> able

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
the new oculus rift you want to be able

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.460 
the new oculus rift you want to be able
to<00:04:37.980> hold<00:04:38.270> probably<00:04:39.270> 75<00:04:40.370> frames<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.520> second<00:04:42.110> I

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.840 

guess<00:04:46.470> anything<00:04:46.830> above<00:04:47.040> 60<00:04:47.460> would<00:04:47.610> be<00:04:47.730> good

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
guess anything above 60 would be good

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.250 
guess anything above 60 would be good
but<00:04:48.060> if<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.240> start<00:04:48.419> getting<00:04:48.540> less<00:04:48.840> than<00:04:49.110> that

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
but if you start getting less than that

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.900 
but if you start getting less than that
it's<00:04:49.590> not<00:04:49.770> going<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.010> be<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:50.160> joyful<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.820> an

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
it's not going to be that joyful of an

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.500 
it's not going to be that joyful of an
experience<00:04:52.370> but

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.630 

the<00:04:56.080> concept<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:56.890> is<00:04:57.010> amazing<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.610> can't

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
the concept of this is amazing I can't
