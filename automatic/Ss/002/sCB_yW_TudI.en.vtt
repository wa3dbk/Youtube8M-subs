00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.790
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.670
 I think it was that we are in a new 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.590
 video with a news only one but 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.350
 quite interesting and is that they have 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.539
 added at last on the server provides the 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.039
 game mode to force one the one 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.840
 we had previously seen that 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.760
 leaked a file and we could prove it 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.220
 all in in aran good really in 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.630
 any map could be so good already 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.090
 is available and what is going to 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.829
 happen now river has taken out games 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.600
 recommended and the first one will be this 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.399
 that we will be able to prove it, I suppose 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.100
 it can also be approved on the server 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.059
 main for good to give an opinion 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.399
 about the type of game they will get more 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.339
 games based on the logically but 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.559
 with modifications to the best with six 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.289
 champions I do not know I'm not sure of the 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.030
 everything still but good we will see I know that 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.609
 they have prepared enough they have said 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.129
 I leave the page in the in the 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.829
 description of the link video and have 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.900
 said that good of those games that 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.510
 more like it may be put back there 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.760
 such so good is interesting that 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.860
 river I took things out of this style to 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.530
 to change a bit to liven up a 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.270
 egg more also 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 which is ranked such that I have done 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.960
 a split partisans of these together 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.280
 with a great one because it also clears and if 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 not so to hang out with your 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.710
 friends 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.690
 it's interesting that I do not take it too much 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.030
 to chest because this game is for 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.860
 really have fun and I'm going to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.619
 explain a little how it works and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.470
 soon we will have good video 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.810
 watching as as as it is with a game 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.700
 to see if something funny comes out and something 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.619
 interesting we went to the next 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.479
 screen and here we have nor how would 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.190
 now when we enter for 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.560
 know that there is a game of these a 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.470
 game 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.290
 limited time will leave us a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.890
 little star in pp and there we have it pvp 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.009
 sorry i want for al 1 for all that is 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.259
 the same five levels against 5 live 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.799
 trans for example what happens that now 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.630
 is better organized goes by vote and you 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:11.300
 I will explain how it really works 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.590
 it would be something like that the first image we have 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.480
 2 ruben and 2 nest and I am one of them 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.980
 of one of the dallys and for example 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.840
 there is one that is in interrogation that 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.459
 you have not chosen any if that person 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.319
 would have chosen rubén would leave 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.080
 automatically riven if I had chosen 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.870
 nest box and automatically exit or televise 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.900
 person chose fit and system 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.549
 automatically vote between the two 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 popular I mean between the two most 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.510
 selected in this case rubén in 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.510
 italy stump and dali and there we see the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.069
 right already fixed all with nesting and that 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.170
 it would be like this we can not see the team 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.989
 we can not see that he has caught 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.750
 it touched us against a libya to give us a 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.350
 sovereign beating the truth 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.450
 well that does not matter either 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.820
 really just that you know how it 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.550
 you do not have to shoot before there's 6 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.220
 bans as in start 3 for each 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.670
 team and once banned we already know that 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.920
 there may be champions for example in 5 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.260
 or nest and they touch their noses a lot 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.030
 along with lucy tal in this case in this 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.340
 case they were not handled but good who 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.410
 knows who will win I would win 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.300
 Champions that are not usually caught in 565 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.730
 since for example neither dallys against 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.440
 looks and things like that would be pretty 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.090
 interesting pretty white play it and 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.730
 well this is the news highlighted me 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.489
 I create a new game mode let's hope 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.360
 to incorporate it soon on the server 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.860
