00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 However, you can orient yourself 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.589
 the last comparable game and that 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.660
 was eleven in 2000 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.040
 in the meeting pauli against schalke the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.750
 line judge from a cup on his head 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.519
 also had to hit the game 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 be canceled and the hamburger 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.380
 were punished with a place ban 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.279
 estimated loss then half 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.220
 million euros 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.740
 so could this also osnabrück 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.730
 times the great question will bloom in front of this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.260
 meeting was 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.210
 how have the fans on this 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.010
 scandalous game boris bukowski reacts 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 against violence and discrimination that is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.950
 but at least none 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.840
 naturalness 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.050
 t shirts printed and sold for 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.579
 symbolic 98 at a meeting 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.950
 Last week were all 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.170
 Representatives agree with the club and also 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.250
 Today it is clear to see the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.010
 Lighter throw is absolutely unacceptable 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.420
 the team of vfl coach maik walpurgis 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.309
 has to focus on football 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 the season start with only two points it 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.989
 moderately you need the first win of the season 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.119
 and penetrates in the usual purple 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 osnabrück and rostock at the beginning 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.200
 apparently their fans do not try 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.890
 to over-inflate excessively 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.119
 ball win ball loss ball win 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.890
 peaceful ball losing 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.180
 Mittelfeldgeplänkel in the first 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.520
 quarter of an hour 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.940
 It is also a special game for you 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.000
 alexander sata from grimma but so far 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.020
 nothing exciting now but maybe 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.540
 eckball rostock ii and hansa reclaimed 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.860
 Immediately hand play went with the head 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.360
 alexander the ball jumps 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.580
 actually on hand but no 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.010
 intention to right no criminal offense 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.650
 the other side freestoß vfl in the 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:52.740
 middle clasps kofler adapt 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:58.090
 that gives yellow and free kick osnabrück 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.390
 a thing for marcos alvarez good 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.390
 attempt 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:09.960
 alvarez with perfect attitude something 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.140
 warped osnabrück now determines that 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.630
 but the offensive is easy too 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.750
 harmless a goal in three games that is 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.870
 a meager balance 37 minutes again 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.840
 alvarez 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.830
 he tries marcos at least once 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.980
 alvarez joined the team 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.019
 not more courageous 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.810
 It's a quiet game, let's say 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.099
 everything is relaxed in the first 45 minutes 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.099
 good on the ranks 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.510
 karsten baumann hansas coach is allowed too 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.769
 be satisfied the second half 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.609
 Osnabrück has to do more than anyone can 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.540
 wait 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:56.170
 50 minutes played osnabrück gets 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.180
 do not get the ball out 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.280
 Christian dorda 30 meters in it for what 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.400
 a stroke in the osnabrücker country 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.959
 does the 0 to 1 yes where did that come from? 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.700
 here 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.739
 christian dorner left-back with 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.110
 he can do it on the right stick 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.610
 even better with links but the thing can 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.709
 he let himself be framed 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.420
 his first goal for hansa rostock 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.560
 eight minutes later the next attempt 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.910
 from hansa again dorda dares 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:37.330
 now all this time with the left 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.330
 on the right is from today his strong foot 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.080
 hansas fans still have a new one 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.300
 Darling 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.610
 the other side played 67 minutes 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.430
 vfl crawls over standards run halil 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.330
 saffron 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.040
 that was the best vfl chance so far 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:00.550
 forgive it goes back and forth 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.550
 eckball rostock peanut man and hover 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:10.970
 dennis erdmann strong and marvin hover 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.520
 even better osnabrück with many 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:18.739
 eckbällen but still without goal 80 minutes 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.510
 over in the middle there again grassi it 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.660
 At the moment, nothing works for the 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.300
 vfl that 's it 0 to 1 3 points for 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.760
 Rostock a positive experience with the 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:35.030
 osnabrücker of course we have today 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.560
 then even after the goal already 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.230
 realized that it was a bit to us 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.520
 the current situation but there 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.930
 we have to work on that and have to 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.150
 we get up again now and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.310
 get out of the game but lost 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.760
 maybe their fans have an insight 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.830
 won that would be worth something 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.650
 that is absolutely true but the season is 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.010
 under no good star for osnabrück 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.020
 only two points and only one 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.010
 Tor shot we come to chemnitz 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.010
 against holstein kiel
