00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
hard drive to free up space with iMovie

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.630 
hard drive to free up space with iMovie
there<00:00:29.750> is<00:00:29.900> some<00:00:30.109> sensitive<00:00:30.980> steps<00:00:31.310> that<00:00:31.519> you

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
there is some sensitive steps that you

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.310 
there is some sensitive steps that you
have<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:31.970> be<00:00:32.059> careful<00:00:32.480> before<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:32.900> do<00:00:33.140> that

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
have to be careful before you do that

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.810 
have to be careful before you do that
and<00:00:33.559> I'm<00:00:33.650> going<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:33.980> go<00:00:34.160> over<00:00:34.400> some<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:34.699> those

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
and I'm going to go over some of those

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.840 
and I'm going to go over some of those
so<00:00:35.750> here's<00:00:36.140> an<00:00:36.260> example<00:00:36.380> of<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.160> project<00:00:37.399> called

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
so here's an example of a project called

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.630 
so here's an example of a project called
alligator<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.860> I'm<00:00:39.860> going<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:40.250> move<00:00:40.399> that

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
alligator and I'm going to move that

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.150 
alligator and I'm going to move that
project<00:00:41.210> over<00:00:41.510> onto<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:41.989> hard<00:00:42.469> drive<00:00:42.559> that<00:00:43.010> is

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
project over onto a hard drive that is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.799 
project over onto a hard drive that is
connected<00:00:43.820> that's<00:00:43.969> an<00:00:44.120> external<00:00:44.600> hard<00:00:44.750> drive

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
connected that's an external hard drive

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.060 
connected that's an external hard drive
and<00:00:46.180> you<00:00:47.180> may<00:00:47.360> be<00:00:47.420> tempted<00:00:47.540> to<00:00:48.200> do<00:00:48.410> this<00:00:48.649> in<00:00:48.980> the

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
and you may be tempted to do this in the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.040 
and you may be tempted to do this in the
way<00:00:49.219> that<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:49.670> many<00:00:49.850> other<00:00:50.030> things<00:00:50.120> happen<00:00:50.840> on

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
way that so many other things happen on

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.410 
way that so many other things happen on
the<00:00:51.110> iMac<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.399> that's<00:00:52.579> by<00:00:52.820> simply<00:00:53.270> grabbing

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
the iMac and that's by simply grabbing

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.330 
the iMac and that's by simply grabbing
it<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:53.930> dragging<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.590> putting<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:55.070> on<00:00:55.160> the

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
it and dragging it and putting it on the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.369 
it and dragging it and putting it on the
hard<00:00:55.489> drive<00:00:55.699> you'll<00:00:56.480> notice<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:56.899> just<00:00:57.079> sprang

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
hard drive you'll notice it just sprang

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.569 
hard drive you'll notice it just sprang
right<00:00:57.649> back<00:00:57.860> it<00:00:58.100> didn't<00:00:58.370> work<00:00:58.550> so<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:01.160> correct

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
right back it didn't work so the correct

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.290 
right back it didn't work so the correct
way<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.789> do<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:02.270> is<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.289> move<00:01:03.469> it<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:04.399> the<00:01:05.030> hard

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
way to do this is to move it to the hard

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.789 
way to do this is to move it to the hard
drive<00:01:05.570> which<00:01:05.810> also<00:01:06.050> appears<00:01:06.890> on<00:01:07.100> your<00:01:08.000> library

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
drive which also appears on your library

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.800 
drive which also appears on your library
before<00:01:09.799> I<00:01:10.010> do<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.280> let's<00:01:10.880> just<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.540> show<00:01:11.750> you

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
before I do that let's just to show you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.770 
before I do that let's just to show you
how<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.650> file<00:01:12.890> structure<00:01:13.400> works<00:01:13.670> with<00:01:14.030> iMovie

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
how the file structure works with iMovie

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.840 
how the file structure works with iMovie
I've<00:01:14.960> got<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.890> finder<00:01:16.310> sitting<00:01:16.670> in<00:01:16.760> the

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
I've got the finder sitting in the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.990 
I've got the finder sitting in the
background<00:01:17.270> here<00:01:17.510> so<00:01:17.540> let's<00:01:17.900> click<00:01:18.140> on<00:01:18.290> that

we'll<00:01:20.000> go<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.180> movies<00:01:20.630> because<00:01:21.259> that's<00:01:21.530> the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
we'll go to movies because that's the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.980 
we'll go to movies because that's the
default<00:01:22.100> folder<00:01:22.549> that<00:01:22.729> iMovie<00:01:23.299> always<00:01:23.600> uses

if<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:23.240> copy<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.870> project<00:02:25.030> what<00:02:26.030> you're

if you copy the project what you're

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.290 
if you copy the project what you're
copying<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.680> project<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
copying is just the project that is the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.870 
copying is just the project that is the
the<00:02:30.290> video<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.010> created<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.640> not

the video that you created it's not

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.600 
the video that you created it's not
copying<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.630> events<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.860> if<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.130> use<00:02:34.370> this

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
copying the events so if you use this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.300 
copying the events so if you use this
approach<00:02:35.110> you're<00:02:36.110> only<00:02:36.410> copying<00:02:36.860> you're<00:02:37.130> only

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
approach you're only copying you're only

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.580 
approach you're only copying you're only
moving<00:02:37.670> four<00:02:37.910> megabytes<00:02:38.300> instead<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.840> 185

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.660 
moving four megabytes instead of 185
megabytes<00:02:40.220> but<00:02:41.440> if<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.860> were<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.160> go<00:02:43.280> back<00:02:43.460> and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
megabytes but if you were to go back and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.610 
megabytes but if you were to go back and
want<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.210> edit<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.660> project<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.350> would<00:02:45.470> have

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
want to edit this project you would have

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.830 
want to edit this project you would have
to<00:02:45.830> attach<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.430> hard<00:02:46.670> drive<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.210> go<00:02:47.390> out<00:02:47.570> and

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
to attach that hard drive and go out and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.470 
to attach that hard drive and go out and
use<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.410> project<00:02:49.010> because<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.970> has<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.330> come

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
use this project because it has to come

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.450 
use this project because it has to come
back<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.020> host<00:02:51.200> computer<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:52.040> get<00:02:52.130> all<00:02:52.310> the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
back to the host computer to get all the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.150 
back to the host computer to get all the
events<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.900> better<00:02:54.110> way<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.350> do<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.740> is<00:02:55.010> to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
events so a better way to do that is to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.750 
events so a better way to do that is to
click<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:55.580> copy<00:02:55.940> project<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.650> events<00:02:58.130> now

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
click on copy project and events now

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.100 
click on copy project and events now
it's<00:02:59.000> going<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.270> take<00:02:59.480> everything<00:02:59.870> that's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
it's going to take everything that's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.350 
it's going to take everything that's
here<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.590> everything<00:03:01.310> that's<00:03:01.430> down<00:03:01.640> here<00:03:01.670> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
here and everything that's down here and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.750 
here and everything that's down here and
move<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.750> whole<00:03:03.050> thing<00:03:03.440> over<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.550> hard

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
move the whole thing over to the hard

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.970 
move the whole thing over to the hard
drive<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.200> could<00:03:06.380> actually<00:03:06.620> take

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
drive so that you could actually take

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.000 
drive so that you could actually take
that<00:03:07.190> hard<00:03:07.460> drive<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.910> another<00:03:08.150> computer

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
that hard drive to another computer

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.470 
that hard drive to another computer
connect<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.310> if<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.550> has<00:03:10.700> iMovie<00:03:11.180> on<00:03:11.210> it

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
connect it and if it has iMovie on it

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.940 
connect it and if it has iMovie on it
you'd<00:03:11.630> be<00:03:11.750> able<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.960> edit<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.320> project<00:03:12.860> in

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
you'd be able to edit the project in

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.190 
you'd be able to edit the project in
that<00:03:12.980> folder<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.150> let's<00:03:14.180> do<00:03:14.570> that<00:03:14.600> let's<00:03:14.780> click

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
that folder so let's do that let's click

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.820 
that folder so let's do that let's click
copy<00:03:15.530> projects<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:16.640> events<00:03:17.150> now<00:03:18.080> it's<00:03:18.380> busy

copying<00:03:19.160> this<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> small<00:03:20.150> project<00:03:21.080> so<00:03:21.410> it

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
copying this is a small project so it

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.940 
copying this is a small project so it
didn't<00:03:21.920> take<00:03:22.100> very<00:03:22.130> long<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:23.560> it's<00:03:24.560> almost

didn't take very long and it's almost

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.490 
didn't take very long and it's almost

look<00:03:27.680> what's<00:03:27.890> happened<00:03:28.280> under<00:03:29.270> my<00:03:29.510> book<00:03:29.780> FCE

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
look what's happened under my book FCE

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.190 
look what's happened under my book FCE
is<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:31.070> alligator<00:03:31.490> project<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:32.360> it's<00:03:32.780> also

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
is the alligator project but it's also

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.280 
is the alligator project but it's also
down<00:03:33.890> here<00:03:33.920> it's<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.480> family<00:03:35.660> projects

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
down here it's in the family projects

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.530 
down here it's in the family projects
well<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.130> whole<00:03:37.250> reason<00:03:37.640> for<00:03:37.670> copying<00:03:38.240> it<00:03:38.360> was

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
well the whole reason for copying it was

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.200 
well the whole reason for copying it was
the<00:03:38.660> free<00:03:38.870> up<00:03:38.990> space<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:40.040> easy<00:03:40.520> enough<00:03:40.940> let's

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
the free up space so easy enough let's

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.790 
the free up space so easy enough let's
select<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.690> here<00:03:41.990> I'm<00:03:42.290> going<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.530> right<00:03:42.770> click

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
select it here I'm going to right click

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.300 
select it here I'm going to right click
and<00:03:43.310> I'm<00:03:43.940> going<00:03:44.300> to<00:03:44.330> pick<00:03:44.680> move<00:03:45.680> project<00:03:46.220> to

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
and I'm going to pick move project to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.390 
and I'm going to pick move project to
trash<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:47.000> now<00:03:47.500> I'm<00:03:48.500> going<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.710> go<00:03:48.830> down<00:03:49.010> here

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
trash and now I'm going to go down here

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.100 
trash and now I'm going to go down here
to<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.790> event<00:03:50.060> file<00:03:50.300> and<00:03:50.630> I'm<00:03:50.780> going<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.020> do

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
to the event file and I'm going to do

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.450 
to the event file and I'm going to do
the<00:03:51.260> same<00:03:51.470> thing<00:03:51.770> I'm<00:03:51.950> going<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.190> right-click

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
the same thing I'm going to right-click

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.060 
the same thing I'm going to right-click
on<00:03:52.910> that<00:03:53.120> event<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:54.260> I'm<00:03:54.380> going<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.650> say<00:03:54.830> move

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
on that event and I'm going to say move

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.960 
on that event and I'm going to say move
event<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.880> trash<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:57.400> just<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.640> prove<00:03:58.910> that

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
event to trash and just to prove that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.210 
event to trash and just to prove that
all<00:03:59.540> this<00:03:59.840> has<00:04:00.080> happened<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.950> way<00:04:01.070> it's

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
which is hiding behind the screen and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.140 
which is hiding behind the screen and
now<00:04:05.810> let's<00:04:06.050> go<00:04:06.230> look<00:04:06.410> at<00:04:06.650> iMovies<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:07.970> let's

under<00:04:12.170> family<00:04:12.380> projects<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.840> alligator

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
under family projects and the alligator

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.090 
under family projects and the alligator

events

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
events

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.140 
events
and<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.949> think<00:04:22.949> last<00:04:23.250> time<00:04:23.370> we<00:04:23.610> were<00:04:23.760> here<00:04:23.790> we

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
and I think last time we were here we

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.540 
and I think last time we were here we
saw<00:04:24.389> one<00:04:24.720> right<00:04:24.930> up<00:04:25.050> here<00:04:25.290> for<00:04:25.470> Alligator<00:04:25.860> so

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
saw one right up here for Alligator so

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
it has cleared out that project from the

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.450 
it has cleared out that project from the
harddrive<00:04:30.870> on<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.440> host<00:04:31.650> computer<00:04:31.919> now<00:04:32.250> let's

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
harddrive on the host computer now let's

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.120

that<00:04:57.389> project<00:04:57.900> again<00:04:58.020> it's<00:04:58.590> still<00:04:58.889> there

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
that project again it's still there

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.189 
that project again it's still there
when<00:04:59.910> you<00:05:00.000> click<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.449> it<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:00.900> want<00:05:01.110> to

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
edit it it's going to actually go out

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.390

and<00:05:03.539> use<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.020> project<00:05:04.229> on<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:04.710> other<00:05:05.130> hard

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
and use the project on that other hard

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.909 
and use the project on that other hard
drive<00:05:05.690> so<00:05:06.690> that's<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.320> end<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.620> this<00:05:07.740> video

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919

follow these instructions you shouldn't

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.320 
follow these instructions you shouldn't
have<00:05:13.110> any<00:05:13.289> trouble<00:05:13.490> freeing<00:05:14.490> up<00:05:14.639> plenty<00:05:15.150> of
