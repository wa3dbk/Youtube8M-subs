and I found this one pretty interesting

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.040 
and I found this one pretty interesting
just<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.070> four-wheel-drive<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
just because it was four-wheel-drive and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
just because it was four-wheel-drive and
after<00:00:46.050> looking<00:00:46.350> online<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.370> seeing<00:00:47.670> some

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
after looking online and seeing some

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.080 
after looking online and seeing some
people<00:00:48.059> wheel<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:48.660> things<00:00:49.820> they're<00:00:50.820> pretty

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
people wheel these things they're pretty

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.069 
people wheel these things they're pretty
pretty<00:00:51.930> amazing<00:00:53.480> basically<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.750> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
pretty amazing basically what it is is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
pretty amazing basically what it is is
it's<00:00:55.260> two<00:00:55.680> dumpsters<00:00:56.750> put<00:00:57.750> together<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:59.180> with

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it's two dumpsters put together and with

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.100 
it's two dumpsters put together and with
a<00:01:00.590> rotating<00:01:01.590> Center<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.930> basically<00:01:03.930> if

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a rotating Center so basically if

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.310 
a rotating Center so basically if
something<00:01:04.470> gets<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:06.960> something

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
something gets you know if something

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.090 
something gets you know if something
gets<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> way<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.140> thing<00:01:10.320> goes<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
gets in the way the thing goes up on it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.300 
gets in the way the thing goes up on it
and<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.700> four<00:01:12.000> wheels<00:01:12.299> stay<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> ground

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and all four wheels stay on the ground

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
and all four wheels stay on the ground
I'm<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> show<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.729> how<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.330> works<00:01:17.689> by

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
I'm going to show you how this works by

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.770 
I'm going to show you how this works by
putting<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:19.110> jack<00:01:19.439> under<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.780> jacking

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
putting my jack under here and jacking

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.779 
putting my jack under here and jacking
up<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.140> side

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:38.279 

so<00:01:28.789> you're<00:01:28.969> gonna<00:01:29.090> see<00:01:29.420> this<00:01:29.659> start<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:30.500> move

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.569 

and<00:01:39.289> my<00:01:39.500> Jack<00:01:39.740> might<00:01:39.950> not<00:01:40.100> be<00:01:40.250> far<00:01:40.490> enough

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
and my Jack might not be far enough

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.080 
and my Jack might not be far enough
under<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:43.189> can<00:01:43.310> actually<00:01:43.490> see<00:01:43.819> how<00:01:44.030> the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
under but you can actually see how the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.389 
under but you can actually see how the
back<00:01:44.390> part<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:46.090> moving<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:48.619> front<00:01:49.159> part

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
back part is moving and the front part

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.990 
back part is moving and the front part
is<00:01:49.610> staying<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.270> ground<00:01:51.219> and<00:01:52.219> I'm<00:01:52.610> you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
is staying on the ground and I'm you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.660 
is staying on the ground and I'm you
know<00:01:53.119> pretty<00:01:53.329> hard<00:01:53.600> pretty<00:01:53.869> far<00:01:54.140> up<00:01:54.319> here<00:01:54.670> so

has the original motor

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.140 
has the original motor
I<00:02:16.579> believe<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:17.630> original<00:02:18.079> and<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.880> just

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
I believe it's original and it just

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.410 
I believe it's original and it just
looks<00:02:20.360> looks<00:02:20.750> vintage<00:02:22.120> 70s<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:25.310> believe<00:02:26.269> it

and I believe those are the bolts that
the<00:02:30.680> starter<00:02:31.069> went<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:32.750> also<00:02:32.900> has<00:02:33.230> this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.860 
there's the shaft - I don't know if it
has<00:02:52.130> forward<00:02:52.519> or<00:02:52.639> reverse<00:02:52.760> or<00:02:53.269> what<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.720> has

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
has forward or reverse or what it has

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.879 
has forward or reverse or what it has
but<00:02:54.799> it<00:02:54.889> has<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.329> there<00:02:56.329> as<00:02:56.480> well<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.650> this

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
but it has that there as well and this

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:04.690 
but it has that there as well and this
basically<00:02:59.709> goes<00:03:01.540> screws<00:03:02.540> right<00:03:02.780> here<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:04.579> this

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
basically goes screws right here to this

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.750 
basically goes screws right here to this
part<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.209> then<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:05.840> bolts<00:03:06.380> down<00:03:06.760> right

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
part and then this bolts down right

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.539 
part and then this bolts down right
there<00:03:08.030> now<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.680> chain<00:03:10.040> right<00:03:10.280> here

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
there now you have a chain right here

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.670 
there now you have a chain right here
and<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.930> chain<00:03:12.260> goes<00:03:12.859> around<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:14.329> clutch

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
and this chain goes around the clutch

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.890 
and this chain goes around the clutch
okay<00:03:15.680> or<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.549> goes<00:03:16.700> around<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.540> training

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
okay or it goes around the the training

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.599 
okay or it goes around the the training
and<00:03:18.680> then<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.519> have<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:20.090> belt<00:03:21.190> let's<00:03:22.190> see<00:03:22.370> where

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
with the belt but those are the seat

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.660 
with the belt but those are the seat
frames<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.669> see<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.090> under<00:03:32.329> there

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
frames and the see is it under there

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.820 
frames and the see is it under there

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
right around this portion right here

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.110 
right around this portion right here
goes<00:03:43.660> around<00:03:43.930> here<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.590> also<00:03:45.280> through<00:03:45.849> there

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
goes around here and also through there

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.860 
goes around here and also through there
oh<00:03:46.390> there's<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.530> belt<00:03:47.709> right<00:03:47.950> here<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.870> don't

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
oh there's the belt right here I don't

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.400 
oh there's the belt right here I don't
know<00:03:50.110> if<00:03:50.230> it's<00:03:50.319> original<00:03:50.830> or<00:03:50.950> not<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:53.260> looks

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
know if it's original or not it looks

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.370 
know if it's original or not it looks
just<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.830> heavy-duty<00:03:54.160> serpentine<00:03:55.090> belt

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
just like a heavy-duty serpentine belt

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.660 
just like a heavy-duty serpentine belt
and<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.680> also<00:03:56.800> looks<00:03:57.069> like<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.280> have<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.489> take

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
and it also looks like you have to take

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.130 
and it also looks like you have to take
the<00:03:57.819> driveshaft<00:03:58.600> off<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.440> get<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.190> belt<00:04:00.370> on<00:04:00.580> so

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
the driveshaft off to get the belt on so

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.250 
the driveshaft off to get the belt on so
that<00:04:02.140> goes<00:04:02.319> around<00:04:02.560> there<00:04:02.830> as<00:04:02.950> well<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:04.260> then

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
that goes around there as well and then

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.220 
that goes around there as well and then
I<00:04:05.319> have<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.680> piece<00:04:05.769> here<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.780> it's

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
I have this piece here that it's

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.170 
I have this piece here that it's
basically<00:04:08.500> just<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:09.010> shield<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.910> whenever

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
don't even know what this is called a

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.610 
don't even know what this is called a
drive<00:04:59.320> gear<00:04:59.800> the<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:01.870> know<00:05:01.930> axle<00:05:02.350> shaft

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
drive gear the you know axle shaft

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.210 
drive gear the you know axle shaft
that's<00:05:03.460> where<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:03.789> axle<00:05:04.240> meets<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.560> gear<00:05:05.830> and

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
that's where the axle meets the gear and

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.390 
that's where the axle meets the gear and
the<00:05:06.430> worm<00:05:06.580> gear<00:05:06.910> and<00:05:07.830> there's<00:05:08.830> a<00:05:08.919> gear<00:05:09.160> on<00:05:09.280> the

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
the worm gear and there's a gear on the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.250 
the worm gear and there's a gear on the
axle<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:09.910> it<00:05:10.090> basically<00:05:10.419> keeps<00:05:10.660> one<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:11.140> those

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
axle and it basically keeps one of those

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.300 
axle and it basically keeps one of those
tires<00:05:11.530> going<00:05:11.800> forward<00:05:13.500> it's<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.620> really<00:05:15.070> good

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
tires going forward it's a really good

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.850 
tires going forward it's a really good
shape<00:05:15.640> I<00:05:15.910> was<00:05:16.300> really<00:05:16.600> surprised<00:05:17.020> not<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.620> find

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
shape I was really surprised not to find

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.779 
shape I was really surprised not to find
any<00:05:18.280> water<00:05:18.550> in<00:05:18.880> here<00:05:19.180> it's<00:05:20.050> it's<00:05:21.039> still<00:05:21.430> really

that<00:05:38.220> you<00:05:38.550> know<00:05:38.670> basically<00:05:38.910> how<00:05:39.210> we<00:05:39.270> started

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
that you know basically how we started

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.200 
that you know basically how we started
and<00:05:41.010> then<00:05:41.190> right<00:05:41.400> here<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:41.640> can<00:05:41.940> see<00:05:42.090> you<00:05:42.180> have

you<00:05:53.730> know<00:05:54.210> protection<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.310> some<00:05:56.310> of<00:05:56.430> these

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
you know protection and some of these

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.040 
you know protection and some of these
came<00:05:56.820> I<00:05:57.290> believe<00:05:58.290> with<00:05:58.800> hole<00:05:59.100> right<00:05:59.370> here<00:05:59.430> and

came I believe with hole right here and

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.190 
came I believe with hole right here and
the<00:06:01.050> propeller<00:06:01.440> shaft<00:06:01.830> would<00:06:02.610> come<00:06:02.850> out<00:06:03.200> back

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
the propeller shaft would come out back

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.820 
the propeller shaft would come out back
here<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.800> you<00:06:05.520> would<00:06:05.670> have<00:06:05.880> your<00:06:06.470> your<00:06:07.470> little

here and you would have your your little
propeller<00:06:08.400> back<00:06:08.730> here<00:06:08.970> with<00:06:09.120> hopefully<00:06:09.570> some

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
propeller back here with hopefully some

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.400 
propeller back here with hopefully some
some<00:06:10.650> metal<00:06:10.919> guarding<00:06:11.310> it<00:06:11.810> from<00:06:12.810> you<00:06:13.290> know

another piece that's missing is this
would<00:06:47.760> go<00:06:47.940> to<00:06:48.500> the<00:06:49.970> transmission<00:06:50.970> and<00:06:52.370> then<00:06:53.370> I

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
would go to the transmission and then I

00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:01.690 
would go to the transmission and then I
believe<00:06:53.880> this<00:06:54.210> right<00:06:54.450> here<00:06:54.900> is<00:06:55.530> the<00:06:55.860> actual

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
stuff you know we had a start button and

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.659 
stuff you know we had a start button and
a<00:07:08.550> stop<00:07:08.880> button<00:07:09.240> and<00:07:09.510> and<00:07:10.370> you<00:07:11.370> know<00:07:11.490> of<00:07:11.610> course
