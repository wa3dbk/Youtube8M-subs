00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.490
 Hello dear friends with you again for 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.740
 load but your screens you see the first 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.959
 tangled year guide which goes without 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.940
 exclusive rights for the site navigator 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.950
 game world for those who do not know 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.980
 a sad event happened a week ago 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.140
 our collaboration has been frozen 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.849
 This guide will feature one of 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.880
 first options for new visual 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.759
 guide style 2 will be presented in the guide 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.860
 in column 4 after the release of thunderstorms in our 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.079
 group will vote in which you 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.420
 select a new visual style 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.700
 I recommend to join our group link 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.190
 is in the description wanna draw your 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.940
 attention is what you see today only 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.739
 sketch 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.629
 and the concept of giving numbers will be 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.840
 refined so in the comments 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.660
 write a detailed feed back and today in 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.199
 our hands got legends from the battlefield 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.530
 3 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.960
 british machine gun IL-86 and two 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.239
 This machine gun was part of the weapon but 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.750
 box that went along with the last 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:09.400
 patch in addition to the machine gun IL-86 we got 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.830
 Abakan a thunderstorm and the mayor fell ill l 862 as well as all 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.680
 gun barrel will not require 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.689
 opening it is available immediately difference from 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.790
 options from battlefield 3 minimum 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.560
 options with battlefield 4 have more 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.990
 low rate of fire whether long 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.939
 recharge and small shop at 30 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.549
 cartridges 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.310
 maximum damage 24.5 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.470
 damage minimum 18 shooting rate 700 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 shots minutes recharge full 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.100
 take 4 seconds tactical 2.6 seconds 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.200
 the appearance of IL-86 and two strongly diluted 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.689
 assault machine gun class which 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.640
 for some unknown reason, very weakly 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.829
 presented in battlefield 4 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.259
 this british occupied an assault niche 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.750
 machine gun for medium distances which 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.210
 before his appearance was empty because 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.759
 rpk we calculated for long distance 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.850
 and to have short and with as any 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.920
 trunk for medium distances a86 is quite 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.110
 feels comfortable in others 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.399
 on short distances he 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.129
 good for accuracy when shooting 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.110
 but on the distant due to low returns though 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.140
 as well as many variable weapons he 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.790
 loses to the above 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.769
 specialized trunks difference from 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.810
 options from battlefield 3 is to 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.060
 decreasing the rate of fire by 50 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 rpm rate increase 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.920
 recharging almost half a second and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.349
 store reduction by 15 rounds 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.079
 the latter case it gave realism so 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.150
 as in real life IL-86 and 2 has 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.790
 shop for only 30 rounds 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.920
 the store can be called one of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.200
 the main disadvantages of this machine gun 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.720
 with such a long recharge it is real 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.519
 I could not clearly explain 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.060
 so strange step by balance 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.670
 IL-86 games canâ€™t be called pain 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.220
 and especially in the game there are no modules increased 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.129
 stores what reason is so small 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.189
 shopping and such a long recharge days 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.549
 can you explain to us well if not then 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:11.420
 let's but the poet to the next patch 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.769
 fix this module wrong 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.379
 short stick to reduce 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.540
 maximum crowd scatter for 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.150
 reduce scatter when shooting from 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.049
 hip and thickened trunk to increase 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.889
 accuracy in the end you can say 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.470
 il-86 real English knight and 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.930
 intelligent with a good pedigree he 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.269
 shows itself well almost 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.819
 it's nice to shoot any situation 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.609
 even despite the strange decision to give in 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.319
 balance of this weapon but think on 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.440
 this is all dear friends subscribe 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.120
 on our new string onovic tviche servant 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.599
 is in the description put the likes 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.489
 write your opinion about IL-86 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.489
 and see you on the battlefield for now
