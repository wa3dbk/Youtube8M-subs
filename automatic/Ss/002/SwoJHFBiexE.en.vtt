never really able to clean the mud out
and<00:03:10.350> Kubota<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.790> put<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.690> very<00:03:12.990> simple

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
and Kubota just put this very simple

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.630 
and Kubota just put this very simple
blocking<00:03:15.510> mechanism<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.380> here<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.310> allows

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
blocking mechanism in here and it allows

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.000 
blocking mechanism in here and it allows
when<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:18.360> pull<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.840> out<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.650> can<00:03:19.800> take<00:03:19.980> a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
when you pull that out you can take a

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.449 
when you pull that out you can take a
hose<00:03:20.760> or<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:22.020> small<00:03:22.350> shovel<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.010> shovel<00:03:23.310> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
hose or a small shovel and shovel the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.910 
hose or a small shovel and shovel the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
dirt and the dirt comes comes right out

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.820 
dirt and the dirt comes comes right out
here<00:03:26.370> Kubota<00:03:27.120> also<00:03:27.720> came<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.230> here<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.739> they

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
here Kubota also came in here and they

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.790 
here Kubota also came in here and they
put<00:03:28.860> much<00:03:29.400> larger<00:03:30.060> pins<00:03:30.420> than<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.530> the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
put much larger pins than what the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.670 
put much larger pins than what the
competition<00:03:32.519> offers<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.120> those<00:03:33.900> much<00:03:34.170> larger

competition offers and those much larger

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.880 
competition offers and those much larger
pins<00:03:35.010> are<00:03:35.250> going<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.459> give<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.760> longer<00:03:36.209> life
