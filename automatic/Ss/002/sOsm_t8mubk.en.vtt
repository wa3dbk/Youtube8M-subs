hi guys I'm nice smart and they're

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.519 
hi guys I'm nice smart and they're
buying<00:00:04.830> factorial<00:00:05.549> it's<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.180> game<00:00:06.359> about

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
buying factorial it's a game about

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.339 
buying factorial it's a game about
basically<00:00:07.529> building<00:00:08.189> factories<00:00:08.929> so<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.990> have

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
basically building factories so I have

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.560 
basically building factories so I have
my<00:00:10.559> huge<00:00:10.889> factory<00:00:11.370> right<00:00:11.580> here<00:00:11.969> well<00:00:12.330> maybe

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
my huge factory right here well maybe

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.150 
my huge factory right here well maybe
not<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:12.990> huge<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.950> pretty<00:00:14.190> big<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:16.160> yes

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
not so huge but it's pretty big and yes

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.260 
not so huge but it's pretty big and yes
so<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:17.760> trying<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.660> rate<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.650> base<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.369> those

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so I'm trying to rate the base of those

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.340 
so I'm trying to rate the base of those
guys<00:00:21.510> yep<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.740> time<00:00:23.029> whoops<00:00:24.080> waste<00:00:25.080> rock

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
guys yep just in time whoops waste rock

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.330 
guys yep just in time whoops waste rock
in<00:00:25.560> there

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.040

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
alright so today I will teach you guys

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.729 
alright so today I will teach you guys
how<00:00:34.379> to<00:00:34.559> base<00:00:34.860> curate<00:00:35.370> their<00:00:35.760> base<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.739> there

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
how to base curate their base so there

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.240 
how to base curate their base so there
are<00:00:37.770> two<00:00:38.219> ways<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.660> know<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> first

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
are two ways that I know of so the first

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.180 
are two ways that I know of so the first
way<00:00:41.519> is<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.750> tried<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.860> first

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
way is the one that I tried the first

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
way is the one that I tried the first
basically<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> basically<00:00:46.860> had<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.820> few<00:00:48.269> turds

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
basically so I basically had a few turds

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.469 
basically so I basically had a few turds
I<00:00:49.159> think<00:00:50.159> like<00:00:50.309> four<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.729> five<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.149> enough

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
I think like four or five this enough

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.520 
I think like four or five this enough
and<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:52.040> I<00:00:53.269> just<00:00:54.269> went<00:00:54.750> closer<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.440> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and just I just went closer and I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.880 
and just I just went closer and I
started<00:00:56.280> shooting<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.649> already

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
started shooting like this and I already

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.389 
started shooting like this and I already
destroyed<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.989> went<00:01:01.949> back<00:01:02.190> when

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
destroyed one and I just went back when

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.240 
destroyed one and I just went back when
I<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.909> was<00:01:03.149> low<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.629> health<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:05.070> just

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
I when I was low on health and I just

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.130 
I when I was low on health and I just
recovered<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.240> went<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.780> again

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
recovered and then went like this again

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.820 
recovered and then went like this again
I<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:11.580> keep<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.840> kept<00:01:13.020> shooting<00:01:13.049> their

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
I just keep I just kept shooting their

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.450 
I just keep I just kept shooting their
towers<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.049> then<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.320> recovered<00:01:16.829> and<00:01:17.100> I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
towers and then just recovered and I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.840 
towers and then just recovered and I
returned<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.450> second<00:01:21.900> way<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:23.100> very

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
returned and the second way it's a very

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120 
returned and the second way it's a very
long<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.229> need<00:01:25.380> patience<00:01:25.890> because

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
long way and you need patience because

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850 
long way and you need patience because
you<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.880> rockets<00:01:27.329> so<00:01:27.689> here's<00:01:28.619> our

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you just get rockets so here's our

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.240 
you just get rockets so here's our
rocket<00:01:29.340> launcher<00:01:30.439> right<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.920> won't<00:01:32.130> be

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
rocket launcher right so we won't be

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.719 
rocket launcher right so we won't be
able<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.850> much<00:01:33.000> right<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:37.729> they

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
able to see much right now right so they

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.380 
able to see much right now right so they
have<00:01:39.060> their<00:01:39.300> tower<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.130> right<00:01:41.130> there

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
have their tower right there right there

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
have their tower right there right there
so<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.810> sake<00:01:43.140> our<00:01:43.320> rocket<00:01:43.710> launcher<00:01:44.190> and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
so it's sake our rocket launcher and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.890 
so it's sake our rocket launcher and
press<00:01:45.120> space

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
press space

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.430 
press space
and<00:01:47.020> now<00:01:48.120> towers<00:01:49.120> are<00:01:49.270> gone<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:49.780> we<00:01:50.050> can<00:01:50.200> go

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
and now towers are gone and we can go

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.980 
and now towers are gone and we can go
for<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.920> creepers<00:01:51.430> powder<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.660> Third's

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
for the creepers powder and the Third's

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.160 
for the creepers powder and the Third's
should<00:01:53.440> check<00:01:53.770> out<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.130> creepers<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.930> right

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
should check out the creepers so right

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:06.030 
should check out the creepers so right
there<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.880> this<00:02:04.090> an<00:02:04.480> easier<00:02:05.050> way<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.800> takes

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
there so this an easier way but it takes

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.490 
there so this an easier way but it takes
more<00:02:06.280> time

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.350 

so<00:02:13.500> we're<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:14.640> rid<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:14.879> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so we're just going to get rid of the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.800 
so we're just going to get rid of the
rest<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> towers<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.739> can<00:02:16.890> get<00:02:17.040> closer

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:33.800 

all<00:02:24.810> right<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:31.549> I'll<00:02:32.549> take<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:32.940> cut<00:02:33.209> here<00:02:33.629> and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
all right so I'll take a cut here and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.800 
all right so I'll take a cut here and
i'll<00:02:34.500> get<00:02:34.650> back<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:35.250> when<00:02:35.459> i<00:02:35.790> get<00:02:36.360> rid<00:02:36.569> of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
i'll get back to you when i get rid of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.850 
i'll get back to you when i get rid of

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
all those yeah all those spawners and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.449 
all those yeah all those spawners and
all<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.430> towers<00:02:43.700> um<00:02:45.290> ok<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.709> try<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.190> take

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
all the towers um ok so I try to take

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.670 
all the towers um ok so I try to take
down<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.819> spawner<00:02:48.180> here<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.349> wasn't

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
down the spawner here and I wasn't

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.740 
down the spawner here and I wasn't
paying<00:02:49.859> attention<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:51.180> had<00:02:51.390> me<00:02:51.569> in<00:02:51.599> a

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
paying attention and they had me in a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.289 
paying attention and they had me in a
circle<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.379> tried<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.370> run<00:02:53.519> away<00:02:53.549> but<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.229 
couldn't move so yeah I'd see if they if
they<00:02:58.470> are<00:02:58.530> starting<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.819> you<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.150> a

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
they are starting to have you in a

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.970 
they are starting to have you in a
circle<00:03:00.659> then<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.500> run<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> yeah<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.650> get<00:03:04.829> the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
circle then just run so yeah you get the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.460 
circle then just run so yeah you get the
idea<00:03:05.010> there<00:03:05.549> are<00:03:05.609> two<00:03:05.909> ways<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.959> slow<00:03:07.230> way

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
idea there are two ways so the slow way

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.210 
idea there are two ways so the slow way
is<00:03:07.739> by<00:03:08.250> making<00:03:08.519> those<00:03:08.879> stars<00:03:09.329> and<00:03:10.040> then<00:03:11.040> just

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
is by making those stars and then just

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.960 
is by making those stars and then just
saw<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.700> taken<00:03:12.060> down<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.310> towers<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
saw it taken down the and the towers and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.890 
saw it taken down the and the towers and
the<00:03:15.030> spawners<00:03:15.720> using<00:03:16.290> my<00:03:16.410> machine<00:03:16.980> gun<00:03:17.010> or<00:03:18.000> you

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
the spawners using my machine gun or you

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.129 
the spawners using my machine gun or you
have<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.530> research<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.480> takes<00:03:21.810> a

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
have to research and then it takes a

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.170 
have to research and then it takes a
long<00:03:22.290> time<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.650> research<00:03:23.069> but<00:03:23.400> afterwards

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
long time to research but afterwards
