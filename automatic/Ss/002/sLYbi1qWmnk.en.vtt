you<00:02:49.109> go<00:02:49.200> from<00:02:49.349> 1<00:02:49.590> all<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.159> way<00:02:50.189> to<00:02:50.310> 20<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.970> just

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
you go from 1 all the way to 20 and just

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.970 
you go from 1 all the way to 20 and just
collect<00:02:51.359> everything<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:52.169> on<00:02:52.439> the<00:02:52.799> first

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
collect everything because on the first

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.610 
collect everything because on the first
levels<00:02:53.519> I<00:02:53.609> think<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:53.819> like<00:02:53.909> 1<00:02:54.060> through<00:02:54.389> 10<00:02:55.349> 1

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
levels I think it's like 1 through 10 1

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.780 
levels I think it's like 1 through 10 1
through<00:02:55.799> 11<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:56.159> can't<00:02:56.340> collect<00:02:56.489> them<00:02:56.700> all

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
through 11 you can't collect them all

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.039 
through 11 you can't collect them all
yet<00:02:56.939> because<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:57.389> do<00:02:57.480> not<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.780> all<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
yet because you just do not have all the
