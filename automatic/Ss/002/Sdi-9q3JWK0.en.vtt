B<00:04:22.210> flat<00:04:22.419> seven<00:04:22.930> then<00:04:23.800> sliding<00:04:24.190> down<00:04:24.460> view<00:04:24.610> a

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
B flat seven then sliding down view a

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.300 
B flat seven then sliding down view a
seven<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.560> flat<00:04:26.800> seven<00:04:27.069> is<00:04:27.159> just

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
seven so the flat seven is just

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.969 
seven so the flat seven is just
borrowing<00:04:27.639> across<00:04:27.879> the<00:04:28.110> first<00:04:29.110> fret<00:04:29.409> relative

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
borrowing across the first fret relative

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:41.260 
borrowing across the first fret relative
to<00:04:30.069> the<00:04:30.159> caper<00:04:30.690> with<00:04:31.690> your<00:04:31.810> a7<00:04:32.229> shape

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.810 

I<00:04:41.980> suppose<00:04:42.980> this<00:04:43.130> is<00:04:43.280> what<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.550> call<00:04:43.730> the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
I suppose this is what you call the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.590 
I suppose this is what you call the
chorus<00:04:45.730> which<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:46.940> chords<00:04:47.270> are<00:04:47.360> just<00:04:47.510> the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
chorus which the chords are just the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.450 
chorus which the chords are just the
same<00:04:47.780> as<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.140> second<00:04:49.070> line<00:04:49.190> of<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.370> verse

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460
