00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.480 

here<00:00:07.380> is<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.640> neon<00:00:08.640> goby<00:00:09.120> tank<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.370> think<00:00:11.370> it's

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
here is a neon goby tank I think it's

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.840 
here is a neon goby tank I think it's
like<00:00:11.670> about<00:00:11.940> 25<00:00:12.480> days<00:00:13.010> this<00:00:14.010> is<00:00:14.250> just<00:00:14.700> when

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
like about 25 days this is just when

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.949 
like about 25 days this is just when
they<00:00:14.969> start<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.389> through<00:00:15.540> metamorphosis

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959 
they start going through metamorphosis

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.520 
they start going through metamorphosis
so<00:00:16.800> if<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:18.210> see<00:00:19.520> some<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.550> them<00:00:20.760> already

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
so if you can see some of them already

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.820 
so if you can see some of them already
turn<00:00:22.530> black<00:00:22.860> and<00:00:22.920> blue<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:25.200> majority<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> them

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
turn black and blue the majority of them

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
turn black and blue the majority of them
haven't<00:00:26.220> haven't<00:00:27.000> gone<00:00:27.300> through<00:00:27.540> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
haven't haven't gone through the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.650 
haven't haven't gone through the
metamorphosis<00:00:28.380> yet<00:00:29.120> they<00:00:30.120> spook<00:00:30.360> pretty

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
metamorphosis yet they spook pretty

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.030 
metamorphosis yet they spook pretty
easily<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.170> they're<00:00:31.350> all<00:00:31.440> on<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.650> other<00:00:31.770> side

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
easily so they're all on the other side

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.939 
easily so they're all on the other side
of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.219> tank<00:00:32.719> but

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.220 

that's<00:00:39.519> them<00:00:39.820> this<00:00:40.239> is<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.420> really<00:00:40.780> good<00:00:40.960> tank

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
that's them this is a really good tank

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.399 
that's them this is a really good tank
I'm<00:00:42.219> estimating<00:00:42.579> there's<00:00:42.940> about<00:00:43.120> 250<00:00:43.780> in<00:00:43.989> here

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
I'm estimating there's about 250 in here

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:52.979 
I'm estimating there's about 250 in here
and<00:00:45.000> there<00:00:46.000> were<00:00:46.120> three<00:00:46.449> spawns<00:00:47.729> put<00:00:48.729> in<00:00:48.850> here

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.240 

and<00:00:53.370> we've<00:00:54.370> got<00:00:54.520> another<00:00:54.760> tank<00:00:55.920> next<00:00:56.920> door

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
and we've got another tank next door

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.380 
and we've got another tank next door
with<00:00:57.579> some<00:00:57.820> awful<00:00:58.239> air<00:00:58.390> nvm<00:00:59.230> go<00:00:59.260> be<00:00:59.620> mixed<00:01:00.390> all

Solaris like to go up towards the top
not<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.890> good<00:01:06.130> idea<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.460> mix<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.850> neon<00:01:07.090> gobies

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
not a good idea to mix the neon gobies

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.560 
not a good idea to mix the neon gobies
in<00:01:07.659> off<00:01:07.780> hilarious<00:01:08.259> because<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.890> awful<00:01:09.220> aris

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
wasn't even a very big spawn but there's

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.050 
wasn't even a very big spawn but there's
a<00:01:25.780> ton<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.050> them<00:01:26.259> in<00:01:26.350> here<00:01:26.640> hard<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.759> see<00:01:27.940> from

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
a ton of them in here hard to see from

the top they got their stripes about 10
days<00:01:39.610> ago<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:40.179> think<00:01:40.750> they're<00:01:40.899> about<00:01:41.050> 18<00:01:41.500> days

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
days ago I think they're about 18 days

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.770 
days ago I think they're about 18 days
old<00:01:41.950> I'll<00:01:42.369> be<00:01:42.520> moving<00:01:42.850> them<00:01:42.970> out<00:01:43.149> to<00:01:43.390> grow<00:01:43.570> out

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
old I'll be moving them out to grow out

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:53.309 
old I'll be moving them out to grow out
in<00:01:44.520> 10<00:01:45.520> days<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:49.500> redhead<00:01:50.500> gobies<00:01:52.200> hard<00:01:53.200> to

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
in 10 days and redhead gobies hard to

in 10 days and redhead gobies hard to
tell<00:01:53.530> if<00:01:53.649> they've<00:01:53.800> gone<00:01:53.979> through<00:01:54.039> met<00:01:54.490> there

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.480 
tell if they've gone through met there
at<00:01:54.909> like<00:01:55.090> day<00:01:55.270> 36<00:01:55.869> I<00:01:56.229> think<00:01:57.040> some<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.250> them<00:01:57.460> have

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
at like day 36 I think some of them have

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.240 
at like day 36 I think some of them have
but<00:01:58.030> they're<00:01:58.180> still<00:01:58.390> mostly<00:01:58.689> transparent

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
but they're still mostly transparent

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.789 
but they're still mostly transparent
it's<00:02:00.250> not<00:02:00.840> totally<00:02:01.840> obvious<00:02:01.990> like<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.560> neon

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
it's not totally obvious like in neon

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.010 
it's not totally obvious like in neon
gobies<00:02:03.189> but<00:02:03.640> it's<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.420> pretty<00:02:04.570> good<00:02:04.659> tank

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
gobies but it's a pretty good tank

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.539 
gobies but it's a pretty good tank
that's<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.320> first<00:02:05.560> time<00:02:05.740> I've<00:02:05.890> done<00:02:05.920> redheads

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
that's the first time I've done redheads

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.289 
that's the first time I've done redheads
and<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:07.119> just<00:02:07.810> made<00:02:08.110> there's<00:02:08.350> about<00:02:08.700> 150<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.970> 100

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299

hard to see them the newly-hatched ank
won't<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.330> able<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.540> see<00:02:19.690> those<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:21.250> we

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
won't be able to see those and here we

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.130 
won't be able to see those and here we
have<00:02:21.580> neon<00:02:21.970> gobies<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.599> all<00:02:22.720> went<00:02:22.900> through

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
have neon gobies that all went through
