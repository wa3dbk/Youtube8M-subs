00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
ninth photo now the third project is we

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.150 
ninth photo now the third project is we
went<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.629> the<00:03:13.750> cliff<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.500> basically<00:03:15.010> the

it vertically from above right and so

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.030 
it vertically from above right and so
what's<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.579> idea<00:03:18.639> with<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.239> one<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.799> one

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
what's the idea with this one this one

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.360 
what's the idea with this one this one
was<00:03:21.220> more<00:03:21.489> about<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.540> it's<00:03:23.200> very<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.769> picture

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
was more about that it's very a picture

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.520 
was more about that it's very a picture
to<00:03:24.549> show<00:03:24.849> how<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:25.209> can<00:03:25.419> work<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.079> have<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.290> great

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
to show how we can work to have a great

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.280 
to show how we can work to have a great
depth<00:03:26.859> on<00:03:27.099> picture<00:03:27.519> with<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.120> first<00:03:28.419> part

landscape you cannot have a nice steps
but<00:03:50.410> after<00:03:50.919> that<00:03:51.160> how<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.819> increase<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.540> depth

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
but after that how to increase the depth

but after that how to increase the depth
and<00:03:53.049> that<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.319> very<00:03:53.560> what<00:03:53.859> we<00:03:53.889> work<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.370> this

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
and that is very what we work on this

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
the foreground the milligram the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.020 
the foreground the milligram the
background<00:03:59.889> is<00:04:00.010> very<00:04:00.069> important<00:04:00.639> that<00:04:00.790> photo

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
asked for because this is something I've

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.210 
asked for because this is something I've
always<00:04:09.669> dreamed<00:04:10.060> about<00:04:10.299> doing<00:04:10.449> it's<00:04:11.319> a<00:04:11.590> high

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220

always dreamed about doing it's a high
key<00:04:12.699> landscape<00:04:13.329> this<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.169> before<00:04:14.530> photo

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
key landscape this is the before photo

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.800 
key landscape this is the before photo
now<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.579> is<00:04:15.730> not<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:15.940> row<00:04:16.180> file<00:04:16.449> from<00:04:16.660> the

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
now this is not a row file from the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.800 
now this is not a row file from the
Nikon<00:04:17.199> d700<00:04:17.680> like<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.220> three<00:04:18.669> hours<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:19.539> is

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
Nikon d700 like the three hours this is

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.570 
Nikon d700 like the three hours this is
a<00:04:20.410> scan<00:04:21.099> from<00:04:21.459> his<00:04:21.669> old<00:04:21.940> cenar<00:04:23.130> 1949<00:04:24.130> camera

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
a scan from his old cenar 1949 camera

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.120 
a scan from his old cenar 1949 camera
right<00:04:24.820> that's<00:04:25.180> right

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
right that's right

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.370 
right that's right
and<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:27.360> looks<00:04:27.600> like<00:04:27.810> there's<00:04:27.990> not<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:28.290> much

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
and so it looks like there's not so much

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.440 
and so it looks like there's not so much
change<00:04:28.710> in<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.890> before<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.400> after<00:04:29.730> but<00:04:30.240> look

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
change in the before and after but look

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.990 
change in the before and after but look
at<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.660> final<00:04:30.990> result<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.470> have<00:04:31.680> an<00:04:32.130> amazing

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
at the final result you have an amazing

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.480 
at the final result you have an amazing
high<00:04:33.750> key<00:04:34.050> landscape<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.800> that's<00:04:35.160> something

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
high key landscape and that's something

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.190 
high key landscape and that's something
this<00:04:35.640> is<00:04:35.820> some<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.120> personal<00:04:36.480> request<00:04:36.750> because

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
this is some a personal request because

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.430 
this is some a personal request because
I've<00:04:37.530> never<00:04:38.250> managed<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:38.910> do<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.030> great<00:04:39.440> high

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.820 
key landscape and I think you managed to
do<00:04:42.060> one<00:04:42.210> there<00:04:42.420> right<00:04:42.450> yeah<00:04:43.230> this<00:04:43.470> one<00:04:43.680> is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
funny for me because I had no idea to do

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.490 
funny for me because I had no idea to do
that<00:04:46.230> before<00:04:46.650> we<00:04:47.070> talked<00:04:47.580> about<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.500> because
