cognitive psychologist Alison Gopnik
says<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.449> babies<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.930> born<00:00:28.170> into<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.590> buzzing

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
says that babies are born into a buzzing

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
says that babies are born into a buzzing
booming<00:00:30.449> confusion<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.380> world<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.920> mean

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
booming confusion of a world I mean

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.639 
booming confusion of a world I mean
think<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> everything<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.840> new<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.530> them

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
think about it everything is new to them

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.560 
think about it everything is new to them
and<00:00:34.920> they<00:00:35.040> can't<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.399> pinpoint<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:36.270> or<00:00:36.420> two

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and they can't just pinpoint one or two

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.060 
and they can't just pinpoint one or two
things<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.050> they<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.440> concentrate<00:00:37.860> on

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
things that they want to concentrate on

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.369 
things that they want to concentrate on
they<00:00:38.640> take<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.719> all<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.200> this

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
they take it all in all of this

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.459 
they take it all in all of this
information<00:00:40.649> rich<00:00:41.579> data<00:00:42.000> around<00:00:42.450> us<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:43.110> this

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
information rich data around us now this

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.350 
information rich data around us now this
makes<00:00:43.770> them<00:00:43.920> differently<00:00:44.370> conscious<00:00:44.969> than

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
makes them differently conscious than

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.779 
makes them differently conscious than
adults<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.559> results<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.340> kind<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
adults and it results in this kind of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.080 
adults and it results in this kind of
lantern<00:00:48.360> vision<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.020> which<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.739> wide<00:00:50.129> swath<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
lantern vision in which a wide swath of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.119 
lantern vision in which a wide swath of
the<00:00:51.210> world<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.780> illuminated<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the world is illuminated for them the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
the world is illuminated for them the
reason<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.699> babies<00:00:54.210> rings<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.660> pretty

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
reason is that babies rings are pretty

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
reason is that babies rings are pretty
much<00:00:55.079> marinating<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.360> neurotransmitters

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
much marinating and neurotransmitters

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.420 
much marinating and neurotransmitters
this<00:00:57.629> means<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.530> reacting<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
this means that they are reacting to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
this means that they are reacting to
every<00:01:00.149> little<00:01:00.600> thing<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.079> their<00:01:01.320> environment

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
every little thing in their environment

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.290 
every little thing in their environment
and<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.460> starkly<00:01:02.760> different<00:01:02.879> from

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and this is starkly different from

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.910 
and this is starkly different from
adults<00:01:03.390> whose<00:01:03.809> neural<00:01:04.229> connections<00:01:04.769> have

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
adults whose neural connections have

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
adults whose neural connections have
been<00:01:04.979> pruned<00:01:05.519> away<00:01:05.670> over<00:01:06.210> time<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.960> gives<00:01:07.200> us

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
been pruned away over time that gives us

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.100 
been pruned away over time that gives us
the<00:01:07.560> ability<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.670> focus<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.750> things

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the ability to really focus in on things

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.250 
the ability to really focus in on things
and<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.560> gives<00:01:10.740> us<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> flashlight<00:01:12.020> view<00:01:13.020> as

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and it gives us that flashlight view as

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260 
and it gives us that flashlight view as
opposed<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> lantern<00:01:14.549> view<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> world

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
opposed to a lantern view of the world

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
opposed to a lantern view of the world
we<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.780> illuminate<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.439> tiny<00:01:16.650> little

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
we can illuminate the tiny little

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
we can illuminate the tiny little
corners<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.520> our<00:01:17.610> world<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
corners of our world and really kind of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.620 
corners of our world and really kind of
dig<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.950> concentrate<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.060> about<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> we

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
dig in and concentrate think about it we

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
dig in and concentrate think about it we
operate<00:01:22.259> under<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.740> illusion<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.430> we're

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
operate under this illusion that we're

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210 
operate under this illusion that we're
always<00:01:24.030> paying<00:01:24.689> attention<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> truth<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
always paying attention but the truth of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.130 
always paying attention but the truth of
the<00:01:26.310> matter<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.820> our<00:01:27.180> brains<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.840> really

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the matter is that our brains are really

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.490 
the matter is that our brains are really
for<00:01:28.320> creating<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.040> 3d<00:01:30.049> computational<00:01:31.049> model

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
for creating this 3d computational model

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.609 
for creating this 3d computational model
for<00:01:32.159> us<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.579> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.060> memory<00:01:33.509> cheat<00:01:34.020> sheet<00:01:34.259> so

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
for us a kind of memory cheat sheet so

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.710 
for us a kind of memory cheat sheet so
think<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.189> commuting<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.240> work<00:01:36.270> for

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
think about commuting to work for

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.510 
think about commuting to work for
instance<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.320> pull<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.680> car<00:01:37.920> into<00:01:37.950> your

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
instance you pull your car into your

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
instance you pull your car into your
parking<00:01:38.700> space<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.119> work<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.689> feel<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
parking space at work you feel like you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.410 
parking space at work you feel like you
paid<00:01:40.590> attention<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.100> entire<00:01:41.400> time<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
paid attention the entire time but the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330 
paid attention the entire time but the
fact<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> matter<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.979> could

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
fact of the matter is is that you could

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.590 
fact of the matter is is that you could
have<00:01:44.579> actually<00:01:44.729> passed<00:01:45.030> something<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
have actually passed something like a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.020 
have actually passed something like a
yellow<00:01:46.380> rhinoceros<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.640> even<00:01:48.000> have

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
yellow rhinoceros and not even have

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.179 
yellow rhinoceros and not even have
noticed<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.170> very<00:01:49.380> likely<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.950> our

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
noticed it but it's very likely that our

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.399 
noticed it but it's very likely that our
flashlights<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.450> consciousness<00:01:52.079> was

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
flashlights like consciousness was

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
have seen it if that baby in the back

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.289 
have seen it if that baby in the back

honking horn of a car she sees the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.059 
honking horn of a car she sees the
yellow<00:02:09.090> rhinoceros<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
yellow rhinoceros and

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.250 
yellow rhinoceros and
has<00:02:10.219> stared<00:02:10.609> into<00:02:10.999> its<00:02:11.150> eyes<00:02:11.329> this<00:02:11.959> is

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
has stared into its eyes this is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.899 
has stared into its eyes this is
probably<00:02:12.590> why<00:02:12.890> she's<00:02:13.129> not<00:02:13.310> driving<00:02:13.519> by<00:02:13.849> the

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
probably why she's not driving by the

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.369 
probably why she's not driving by the
way<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.420> what<00:02:14.749> else<00:02:14.930> can<00:02:15.139> we<00:02:15.230> learn<00:02:15.319> from

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
way so what else can we learn from

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.809 
way so what else can we learn from
babies<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:16.159> they're<00:02:16.340> differently

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
babies that they're differently

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.610 
babies that they're differently
conscious<00:02:17.329> from<00:02:17.480> us<00:02:17.629> adult<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.139> fact<00:02:18.409> even

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
conscious from us adult in fact even

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.470 
conscious from us adult in fact even
more<00:02:19.069> conscious<00:02:19.579> and<00:02:19.730> that's<00:02:19.939> just<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.269> tip

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
more conscious and that's just the tip

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.119 
more conscious and that's just the tip
of<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.719> iceberg<00:02:20.810> because<00:02:21.409> babies<00:02:21.889> when<00:02:22.040> they

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
of the iceberg because babies when they

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.640 
of the iceberg because babies when they

the ability to acquire new languages at
breakneck<00:02:31.549> speeds<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.870> what<00:02:33.260> else<00:02:33.439> might<00:02:33.709> they

breakneck speeds so what else might they

breakneck speeds so what else might they
be<00:02:33.980> hiding<00:02:34.430> from<00:02:34.730> us<00:02:34.939> so<00:02:35.389> what<00:02:35.540> about<00:02:35.689> you<00:02:35.870> do
