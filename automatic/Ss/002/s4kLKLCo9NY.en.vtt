00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.999

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.280
 that the piece of chicken that I like the most 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.250
 strangely it's got like little taste 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.530
 and I 'm not boning menu is not true 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.040
 I asked the gentleman of the pollero 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.430
 I saw them force the machine and hook that 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.840
 already I arrived from the super lave 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.660
 perfectly one knows perfectly 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.550
 for one you remove the skin excites and the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.560
 Perfect mom bone 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.480
 ok we agree on this mommy 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.140
 love the idea 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.690
 I'm going to start to be a mom because 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.510
 I'm going to use a drop of oil that will be 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.200
 I'm going to cook them cela lola cedar 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.470
 I'm going to know from the hand you're going to be 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.260
 contains the chicken 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.450
 will develop a coast and I want 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.450
 well they are already starting to see more 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.670
 5 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.780
 how nothing gets stuck 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.569
 because I'm using flavor stone the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.539
 material without ninth no more than 2 million 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:24.539
 of batteries sold will be yours and mine 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.590
 of fat please 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:40.390
 it seems to me that it is not one more and very fast 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.020
 and this because we have a super 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.940
 layer not a superconducting layer that 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.740
 they allow everything to cost much more 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.590
 even look how are all those what 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.479
 even wall and see him devouring pretty 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.220
 seeing is perfect itself no longer me 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.470
 love the idea that looks nothing more 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.390
 how we are really and if you can 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.040
 develop a good thing that will get us 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.560
 serve to present back at the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.110
 cooking and taste much richer because 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.640
 they beat to verify the rays that do not 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.590
 allows the juices to come out 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.780
 it exists that in the writing went into 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.060
 normal because we want that before 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.890
 which is already so that the ones did not leave 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 juices but really what you do is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.750
 presentation presentation diagram 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.450

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.840
 which kitchen even be save a 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.790
 Golden 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.650
 now we do not have to be completely 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.040
 known because he's going to enter another 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.769
 cooking right now because the recipe is me 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.959
 I love having these easy to 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:42.090
 Kleberson with these pans because

 they are free of perfluorooctanoic acid 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 with good fluoride or perfluorooctanoic 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.870
 by right there that contain the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.209
 most of the pans just and it is very 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.359
 toxic some seals have it not 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.010
 all but some and the truth is 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.109
 we really have to get rid of 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.169

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.249
 invest in the family and also that 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:14.109
 to overcome all life is as Olga says 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:17.819
 healthy when I die in María José 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.819
 a neighbor and the most 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:25.419
 we can see how they are perfectly 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.090

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.719
 aroma we can immediately feel 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.489
 comes the wonderful dust that is the 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:47.280
 curry powder that is made up of 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.280

 coconut milk they find it in 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.720
 any super and there are times that we 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.930
 It complicated a bit to find half the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.240
 curry paste because for me it was a lot 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.620
 easier to put the recipe effect 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.750

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.800
 the juices released by the chicken are the most 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.380
 rich 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.250
