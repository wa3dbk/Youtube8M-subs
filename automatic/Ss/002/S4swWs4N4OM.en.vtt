 hello to all of you in this 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.230
 video i'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.639
 the use of nfc tags for 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.620
 lock and unlock the samsung 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.820
 galaxy s iii for those who 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.070
 would like to know how to do it 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.990
 tutorial available on samsung website 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.840
 galaxy s iii point fr 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 in the category tutorials and tips 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.380
 so to start the material a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 samsung galaxy s iii a keychain of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.980
 keys with an nfc tag that serves to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.590
 unlock the building doors and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 a portfolio with an NFC tag that I have 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.840
 recovered in the box of my galaxy s2 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.090
 cityzi and I'm going to go back like that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.770
 you will see that it goes through 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.160
 several layers thick enough when 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.920
 even so the galaxy s iii is locked 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 I press on unlock we arrive on 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.000
 the lockscreen and first solution I 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.430
 want to unlock it by hand like this 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 that someone who would have for example 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.660
 steal your phone would do and there it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:02.219
 falls on a code so the code here for 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.780
 the tutorial galaxy s3 point fr when we do 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.060
 ok we see that it unlocks a lot of 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.080
 phone and we are on the menus 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.360
 normal now I'm going to them 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.720
 locked so we come back to the point of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 departure 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.080
 and now I'm going to unlock it 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.299
 but instead of this time clicked on 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.630
 the unlock icon and have to type the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.770
 code 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.880
 I just want to put it on the nfc tag 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.350
 that will unlock any one of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.670
 phone is conducted on the menus and one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:34.079
 will try with the other nfc tags to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.850
 through the wallet and here we are 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.740
 call and unlock now 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.990
 I installed a small improvement 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.780
 we will say that I am at home so 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.180
 I activate the wifi we made it to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 activate and connect here and 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.810
 now if I lock the galaxy the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.549
 blow the wi fi activated so he knows that I 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.600
 am at home with no big risk 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.210
 that my phone was stolen 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.700
 so when I press on unlock and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.860
 that I want to unravel like that not hop 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.210
 need to enter a code and if I their 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 do I still can I still 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.310
 use that to unlock it 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.470
 I hope you enjoyed this video and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.500
 I will try to hold a tutorial one day 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.510
 for my new discoveries and if 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.970
 never did anyone know how 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.950
 disable the sound you hear when 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.880
 of reading an nfc without putting the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.980
 Silent phone 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.390
