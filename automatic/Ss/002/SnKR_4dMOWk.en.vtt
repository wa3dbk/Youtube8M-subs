00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
within a key now I'm going to base this

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.210 
within a key now I'm going to base this
lesson<00:00:15.509> off<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.900> George<00:00:16.529> Winston<00:00:16.800> style

based off of kind of like the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.479 
based off of kind of like the
progression<00:00:35.820> from<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.780> autumn<00:00:37.230> CD<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.280> is

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
progression from the autumn CD this is

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.889 
progression from the autumn CD this is
colors<00:00:38.910> dancing<00:00:41.300> all<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.570> you've<00:00:42.719> heard

colors dancing all right so you've heard

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.510 
colors dancing all right so you've heard
that<00:00:43.020> won't<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.649> doing<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> melody<00:00:44.340> though

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that won't be doing the melody though

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.380

for<00:00:45.210> copyright<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.800> anyway<00:00:47.120> diatonic<00:00:48.120> some<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
for copyright so anyway diatonic some of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
for copyright so anyway diatonic some of
course<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.079> reason<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.410> brought<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.739> all<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
course the reason I brought up all of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.709 
course the reason I brought up all of
that<00:00:50.430> about<00:00:50.550> George<00:00:50.910> voice<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that about George voice is because the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
that about George voice is because the
song<00:00:51.930> isn't<00:00:52.140> EPMA<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> know

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
song isn't EPMA so you have to know

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.959 
song isn't EPMA so you have to know
you're<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.480> major<00:00:54.750> scale<00:00:56.539> now<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.579> next<00:00:59.850> thing

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
you're a major scale now the next thing

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
you're a major scale now the next thing
is<00:01:00.500> creating<00:01:01.670> diatonic<00:01:02.690> treatment<00:01:03.690> meaning

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
is creating diatonic treatment meaning

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.880 
is creating diatonic treatment meaning
seventh<00:01:05.220> chords<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.670> each<00:01:06.090> note<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.659> scale

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
seventh chords on each note of the scale

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.020 
seventh chords on each note of the scale
using<00:01:07.890> only<00:01:08.100> notes<00:01:08.490> from<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> scale

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
using only notes from the scale

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.160 
using only notes from the scale
hey<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.350> major<00:01:12.560> 7<00:01:13.040> B<00:01:13.640> minor<00:01:13.910> 7<00:01:14.210> C

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.109 
triads are much easier a major B minor
ok<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:52.210> c-sharp<00:01:53.210> minor<00:01:53.540> D<00:01:54.170> major<00:01:54.440> E<00:01:54.830> major<00:01:55.460> F

minor C sharp minor F sharp minor so the
one<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.800> 4<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> 5<00:02:13.520> are<00:02:14.030> major<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.810> 2<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
one the 4 and the 5 are major the 2 the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.370 
one the 4 and the 5 are major the 2 the
3<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.340> 6<00:02:16.610> are<00:02:16.910> minor<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.750> 7<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.230> my

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
3 and the 6 are minor and the 7 is my

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.039 
3 and the 6 are minor and the 7 is my
kind<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.650> like<00:02:18.799> that<00:02:18.950> oddball<00:02:19.840> diminished<00:02:20.840> 1

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
kind of like that oddball diminished 1

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.430 
kind of like that oddball diminished 1
ok<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:23.330> that's<00:02:23.570> something<00:02:23.750> good<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.260> just

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
ok so that's something good to just

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.460 
ok so that's something good to just
remember<00:02:24.680> one<00:02:25.160> four<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.489> five<00:02:25.850> major<00:02:26.570> ok<00:02:27.170> and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
remember one four and five major ok and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.830 
remember one four and five major ok and
then<00:02:27.680> even<00:02:28.010> if<00:02:28.130> it's<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.670> major<00:02:28.850> 7<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.450> still<00:02:29.660> a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
then even if it's a major 7 it's still a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.020 
then even if it's a major 7 it's still a
12o<00:02:30.500> dominant<00:02:31.070> someone's<00:02:31.310> for<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.489> e<00:02:31.640> it's

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
12o dominant someone's for the e it's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.670 
12o dominant someone's for the e it's
still<00:02:32.299> kind<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.690> major<00:02:34.750> esketh<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:36.290> still

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
still kind of a major esketh is still

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.360 
still kind of a major esketh is still
major<00:02:36.980> ok<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.730> doesn't<00:02:37.970> sound<00:02:38.120> minor

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
major ok so it doesn't sound minor

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.479 
major ok so it doesn't sound minor
whereas<00:02:40.370> 2<00:02:40.910> 3<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.630> 6<00:02:41.900> or<00:02:42.170> minor<00:02:42.410> one<00:02:42.980> four<00:02:43.250> five

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
whereas 2 3 and 6 or minor one four five

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.569 
whereas 2 3 and 6 or minor one four five
major<00:02:43.880> 2<00:02:44.480> 3<00:02:44.750> 6<00:02:45.049> Maya<00:02:45.440> ok<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.040> good<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.280> like

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
major 2 3 6 Maya ok it's good to like

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.729 
major 2 3 6 Maya ok it's good to like
remind<00:02:47.000> yourself<00:02:47.390> about<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:48.019> review

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
remind yourself about that and review

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.150 
remind yourself about that and review
that<00:02:49.750> ok<00:02:50.750> now<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.049> next<00:02:51.170> thing<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:51.950> want

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
that ok now the next thing is you want

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.009 
that ok now the next thing is you want
it<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.730> should<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:53.269> comfortable<00:02:53.750> to

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
it like that should be comfortable to

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.900 
it like that should be comfortable to
you<00:02:54.200> yeah<00:02:54.680> if<00:02:54.950> that's<00:02:55.070> not<00:02:55.280> comfortable<00:02:55.700> to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you yeah if that's not comfortable to

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.190 
you yeah if that's not comfortable to
you<00:02:56.030> then<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.269> gonna<00:02:56.360> be<00:02:56.510> difficult<00:02:57.019> for<00:02:57.079> you

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
you then it's gonna be difficult for you

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.660 
you then it's gonna be difficult for you
to<00:02:57.290> be<00:02:57.380> able<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.560> create<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.920> progression<00:02:58.370> and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
to be able to create a progression and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.340 
to be able to create a progression and
understand<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.360> progression<00:02:59.510> ok<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:00.079> make

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
understand the progression ok so make

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.170 
understand the progression ok so make
sure<00:03:00.380> take<00:03:01.010> some<00:03:01.220> time<00:03:01.459> with<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.730> sit<00:03:02.000> with

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
sure take some time with that sit with

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.090 
sure take some time with that sit with
that<00:03:02.360> make<00:03:02.540> sure<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.810> understand<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.410> again

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
that make sure you understand that again

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.259 
that make sure you understand that again
what<00:03:04.340> I'm<00:03:04.430> doing<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.760> I'm<00:03:04.910> building

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
what I'm doing is that I'm building

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.170 
what I'm doing is that I'm building
those<00:03:05.989> chords<00:03:06.410> using<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:07.160> notes<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.760> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
those chords using just notes of the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.210 
those chords using just notes of the
scale<00:03:08.299> ok<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:09.739> here<00:03:10.579> is<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.850> major<00:03:11.110> B<00:03:12.110> minor<00:03:12.440> ok

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
scale ok so here is a major B minor ok

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.340 
scale ok so here is a major B minor ok
you<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:13.430> see<00:03:13.579> I'm<00:03:13.640> only<00:03:13.820> using<00:03:14.150> notes<00:03:14.540> from

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
you can see I'm only using notes from

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.460 
you can see I'm only using notes from
scam<00:03:15.650> alright<00:03:16.310> now<00:03:16.670> we're<00:03:17.360> doing<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.840> Triads

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
scam alright now we're doing the Triads

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.960 
scam alright now we're doing the Triads
you<00:03:18.890> should<00:03:19.070> be<00:03:19.160> able<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.370> do<00:03:19.550> them<00:03:19.760> in

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
you should be able to do them in

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.180 
you should be able to do them in
inversion<00:03:20.630> as<00:03:20.750> well<00:03:20.930> as<00:03:21.050> well<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:21.890> if<00:03:21.950> we<00:03:22.040> do

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
inversion as well as well so if we do

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.880 
inversion as well as well so if we do
first<00:03:22.490> inversion<00:03:22.850> there's<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.480> major<00:03:23.720> B<00:03:24.560> minor

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
first inversion there's a major B minor

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.100 
first inversion there's a major B minor
right<00:03:25.490> C<00:03:26.150> sharp<00:03:26.450> minor<00:03:26.770> D<00:03:27.770> major<00:03:28.040> E<00:03:28.460> major<00:03:29.270> C

sharp minor G G sharp diminished and in

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.740 
sharp minor G G sharp diminished and in
a<00:03:33.920> matrix<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.520> first<00:03:34.880> inversion<00:03:35.150> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
a matrix that is first inversion the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.010 
a matrix that is first inversion the
other<00:03:35.900> do<00:03:36.050> second<00:03:36.470> inversion<00:03:36.710> as<00:03:36.950> well<00:03:37.100> okay

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
other do second inversion as well okay

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.450 
other do second inversion as well okay
and<00:03:39.020> if<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.230> want<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.470> kind<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.770> like<00:03:39.860> get<00:03:40.160> more

of a rock ask new-age piano kind of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.130 
of a rock ask new-age piano kind of
sound<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:43.940> can<00:03:44.150> get<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.450> octaves<00:03:44.960> in<00:03:45.050> the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
sound you can get the octaves in the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:53.020 
sound you can get the octaves in the
left<00:03:45.320> hand<00:03:45.530> hey<00:03:46.010> hey<00:03:46.760> B<00:03:47.570> minor<00:03:48.280> C<00:03:49.280> sharp<00:03:49.640> minor

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.369 

my<00:03:54.030> brain<00:03:54.299> today<00:03:54.510> me<00:03:54.989> major<00:03:55.290> E<00:03:55.790> major<00:03:57.379> f-sharp

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
my brain today me major E major f-sharp

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.300 
my brain today me major E major f-sharp
minor

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
minor

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.930 
minor
alright<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.940> then<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.269> have<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:01.610> G<00:04:02.610> sharp

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
alright and then you have that G sharp

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.979 
alright and then you have that G sharp
diminished<00:04:04.459> that's<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.580> major<00:04:05.940> okay<00:04:06.629> so<00:04:06.720> that's

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
diminished that's a major okay so that's

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.119 
diminished that's a major okay so that's
second<00:04:07.530> inversion

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
second inversion

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.250 
second inversion
okay<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:08.909> make<00:04:09.239> sure<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.690> could<00:04:09.840> do<00:04:10.049> the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
okay so make sure that you could do the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.380 
okay so make sure that you could do the
root<00:04:10.530> position<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:11.459> first<00:04:11.730> inversion<00:04:12.060> and

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
root position the first inversion and

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.559

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
that you always stay away from the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.439 
that you always stay away from the
seventh<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.100> lot<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.520> times<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.000> seventh

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
seventh but a lot of times the seventh

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.029 
seventh but a lot of times the seventh
makes<00:04:30.720> them<00:04:30.870> sound<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.289> little<00:04:31.500> bit<00:04:31.590> more<00:04:31.800> I

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
makes them sound a little bit more I

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.890 
makes them sound a little bit more I
guess<00:04:32.580> for<00:04:33.090> lack<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.419> better<00:04:33.539> word<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.810> little

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
guess for lack of a better word a little

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.830 
guess for lack of a better word a little
bit<00:04:34.080> more<00:04:34.229> jazzy<00:04:34.830> right<00:04:35.400> let<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:35.970> harmonies<00:04:36.810> a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
bit more jazzy right let the harmonies a

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.020 
bit more jazzy right let the harmonies a
little<00:04:37.139> bit<00:04:37.229> more<00:04:37.440> complex<00:04:38.190> so<00:04:38.699> you<00:04:38.760> notice

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
little bit more complex so you notice

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.930 
little bit more complex so you notice
that<00:04:39.090> there's<00:04:39.300> more<00:04:39.600> triatic<00:04:40.590> based<00:04:41.039> okay<00:04:41.610> not

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
that there's more triatic based okay not

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.029 
that there's more triatic based okay not
all<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.270> time<00:04:42.479> but<00:04:42.930> yeah<00:04:43.350> it's<00:04:43.500> kind<00:04:43.919> of<00:04:43.949> a

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
all the time but yeah it's kind of a

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.830 
all the time but yeah it's kind of a
good<00:04:44.190> rule<00:04:44.490> of<00:04:44.520> thumb<00:04:44.669> if<00:04:45.090> you're<00:04:45.449> gonna<00:04:45.600> sit

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
good rule of thumb if you're gonna sit

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.960 
good rule of thumb if you're gonna sit
down<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.199> start<00:04:46.320> playing<00:04:46.530> new-age<00:04:46.949> piano<00:04:49.970> you

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
can hear like right away that starts to

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.710 
can hear like right away that starts to
sound<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.889> little<00:04:52.979> bit<00:04:53.100> more<00:04:53.220> jazzy<00:04:53.729> or<00:04:54.000> arm<00:04:54.330> be
