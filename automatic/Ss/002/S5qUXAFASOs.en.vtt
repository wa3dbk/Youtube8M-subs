 normal download 1 downloaded 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.840
 it will be a weird file 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:53.950
 megaman legends light 0 06 03 the archive 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.409
 what they are going to do is give you right click 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.740
 extract here I will need the wing 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.300
 see if they do not have highly in the section 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.300
 d 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.430
 of video games pcex part 1 I do not have 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.979
 winrar for the doubts because I the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.430
 games on the tablets if it is not stepping 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.430
 so good I do not have here this is going 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.890
 to get out these three files are the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.060
 I have ordered here in folders with him 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.390
 murray in what has been canceled what I 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.860
 good use these three folders these three 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.860
 files will leave you where you 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.230
 want because there is no need to say 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.090
 where they want to stay but 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.780
 I recommend that you make a folder of 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.700
 games and there put one more folder of the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.830
 game that they want and in the archives 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.750
 well it's not going to be everything is for branch and 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.720
 the emulator is going to be more orderly 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.150
 good if they have murray of what they're going 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.520
 to do is open the tools daemon that 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.520
 I also have the web 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.780
 and they give you virtual right click been and 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.540
 room 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.030
 and here it's going to come out, it's really going 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.510
 to leave like this 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.150
 good if you do not get this option vain 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.590
 they are going to make country numbers and put a 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.860
 drive 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.390
 good good besides it's 21 average and they 're going to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.260
 mount email or mount image 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.310
 and look in the folder or file reading 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.440
 Double-click DC point 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.330
 If you open the binder for them there is no 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.280
 problem they close them alone 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.350
 to show what it has inside and 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.830
 good just raiden to play remember 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:39.040
 in which they must open is the murray in 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:43.730
 psx emulator fast good and with the gps x 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.890
 1.7 point 0 or 1.6 point zero the only thing 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.530
 what they should do is run did and look for the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.380
 file in email format that's why 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.520
 has three types of format for 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.200
 doubts that use a different emulator 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.290
 so that the pcex 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.360
 who is not the suicide who serves to 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.660
 disassemble the email to 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.670
