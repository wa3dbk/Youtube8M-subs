there's several specifications for this

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.720 
there's several specifications for this
upgrade<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.739> some<00:02:35.739> engine<00:02:36.130> may<00:02:36.310> require<00:02:36.700> only

upgrade and some engine may require only

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.010 
upgrade and some engine may require only
one<00:02:37.329> hose<00:02:37.919> the<00:02:39.000> n62<00:02:40.139> for<00:02:41.139> the<00:02:41.970> e60<00:02:42.970> models<00:02:43.450> were

one hose the n62 for the e60 models were

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.059 
one hose the n62 for the e60 models were

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.479 

now<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:51.939> problem<00:02:52.540> with<00:02:52.689> these<00:02:52.870> hoses<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.680> that

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
now the problem with these hoses is that

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.319 
now the problem with these hoses is that
the<00:02:55.359> original<00:02:56.010> design<00:02:57.010> was<00:02:57.450> very<00:02:58.450> flimsy<00:02:58.870> and

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
the original design was very flimsy and

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.809 
the original design was very flimsy and
was<00:03:01.329> not<00:03:01.569> insulated<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.549> during<00:03:03.549> cold

temperatures<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:05.290> exhaust<00:03:06.280> fumes<00:03:07.109> would

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
temperatures the exhaust fumes would

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.800 
temperatures the exhaust fumes would
freeze<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.340> through<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> moisture<00:03:10.599> in<00:03:10.689> the

freeze and through the moisture in the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.479 
freeze and through the moisture in the
hoses<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.849> caused<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:13.180> crankcase<00:03:13.689> valve

been cases where engines have been
damaged<00:03:38.769> as<00:03:39.010> well<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.629> see<00:03:40.840> with<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.290> new

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
damaged as well you can see with the new

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.890 
damaged as well you can see with the new
design<00:03:42.569> includes<00:03:45.359> quite<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.419> bit<00:03:46.720> of

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
design includes quite a bit of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.010 
design includes quite a bit of
insulation<00:03:47.439> around<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.489> hoses

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.560 

and<00:03:55.020> comparing<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.770> new<00:03:55.950> design<00:03:56.400> hoses<00:03:57.120> with

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
and comparing the new design hoses with

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.070 
and comparing the new design hoses with
the<00:03:57.780> current<00:03:58.230> design<00:03:59.090> which<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.300> right<00:04:00.510> here<00:04:00.540> a

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
the current design which is right here a

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.250 
the current design which is right here a
very<00:04:01.920> thin<00:04:02.660> plastic<00:04:03.710> material<00:04:04.850> which<00:04:05.850> is

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
very thin plastic material which is

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.160 
very thin plastic material which is
inadequate<00:04:07.260> for<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.920> types<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.170> coat

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
inadequate for the types of coat

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.060 
inadequate for the types of coat
temperature<00:04:10.710> extremes<00:04:11.220> even<00:04:12.230> mild<00:04:13.230> cold<00:04:13.770> I

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
temperature extremes even mild cold I

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.479 
temperature extremes even mild cold I
would<00:04:14.250> think<00:04:14.490> would<00:04:14.760> have<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.090> an<00:04:15.510> effect<00:04:16.140> on

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
would think would have a an effect on

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.030 
would think would have a an effect on
the<00:04:17.489> operation<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.630> these<00:04:18.750> hoses<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.560> by<00:04:19.830> Meza

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
the operation of these hoses and by Meza

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.150 
the operation of these hoses and by Meza
turns<00:04:20.400> out<00:04:21.170> many<00:04:22.170> people<00:04:22.530> have<00:04:22.620> had<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.950> have

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
turns out many people have had to have

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.780 
turns out many people have had to have
their<00:04:23.490> valve<00:04:23.790> cover<00:04:24.120> replaced<00:04:25.280> as<00:04:26.280> well<00:04:26.340> as

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
their valve cover replaced as well as

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.900 
their valve cover replaced as well as
other<00:04:27.090> engine<00:04:27.840> leaks<00:04:28.110> timing<00:04:29.040> covers<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.760> so

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
other engine leaks timing covers and so

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.360 
other engine leaks timing covers and so
forth<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.480> think<00:04:31.050> maybe<00:04:31.260> related<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:31.920> that<00:04:32.160> as

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
forth I think maybe related to that as

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.210 
forth I think maybe related to that as
well<00:04:32.550> but<00:04:32.820> certainly<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.920> right-hand<00:04:34.920> side

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
well but certainly the right-hand side

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.360 
well but certainly the right-hand side
valve<00:04:35.640> cover<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:37.080> can<00:04:37.230> see<00:04:37.440> where<00:04:37.920> this<00:04:38.160> one

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
valve cover you can see where this one

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.820 
valve cover you can see where this one
has<00:04:38.610> been<00:04:39.000> replaced<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.680> new

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
has been replaced and a new

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.310 
has been replaced and a new
specification<00:04:41.220> calls<00:04:41.910> for<00:04:42.300> not<00:04:42.900> just<00:04:43.170> a

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
specification calls for not just a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.510 
specification calls for not just a
gasket<00:04:43.920> but<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.760> new<00:04:45.300> cover<00:04:45.630> as<00:04:46.170> well<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.700> so

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
gasket but a new cover as well and so

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.880 
gasket but a new cover as well and so
you'll<00:04:50.520> want<00:04:50.730> to<00:04:50.790> take<00:04:51.000> care<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.270> these<00:04:51.450> hoses

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
you'll want to take care of these hoses

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.970 
you'll want to take care of these hoses
to<00:04:52.890> try<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.130> prevent<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:53.670> problem<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.980> if

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
to try to prevent this problem and if

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.150 
to try to prevent this problem and if
you've<00:04:56.130> replaced<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.000> valve<00:04:58.490> cover<00:04:59.510> already

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
you've replaced the valve cover already

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.880 
you've replaced the valve cover already
then<00:05:02.630> you'll<00:05:03.630> certainly<00:05:03.960> want<00:05:04.200> to<00:05:04.560> replace

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
then you'll certainly want to replace

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:15.559 
then you'll certainly want to replace
the<00:05:05.130> hoses<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.700> prevent<00:05:06.090> further<00:05:06.330> problems

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.629
