00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.350
 last tuesday 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.680
 whereas this happened and 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 happens probably they annoy you 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.760
 live 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.930
 often do not match many cool 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.130
 functional user 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.140
 perhaps because such 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.830
 that is, such moments were the second 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.780
 the business interests of the investigation are very 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.370
 beautiful and newborn work 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 for free from five hours will play 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.270
 matches without delay in communication 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.720
 email Russian citizens 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.130
 it all literally begets big 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.370
 dose by touching the screen 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.080
 besides 3000 202 for the past day with 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.370
 productivity within 250 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.710
 percent 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.670
 the secret is simple and the action is new 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.830
 the law of this first almost half a century of the poet 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.770
 random access memory 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.460
 and secondly the hardware platform will begin 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.080
 qualcomm snapdragon 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.040
 similar conversations began to be told in 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 Company 279 Pavlov 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.460
 this form of relationship is itself 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.320
 she married directed only to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140
 which which we have in which you can 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.440
 was to take advantage 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.480
 percentage of sales categories soon 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.130
 communicator the most important part of skating 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.790
 she-wolf this percentage in the thigh which 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.660
 binds all the costs of all modules increasingly 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.550
 in the phone the report is processed and 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.520
 together with the Polish that is essentially it 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.780
 his brains 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.270
 in general, we used here 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.250
 the last hours the company qualcomm model 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.610
 called m to networks 8 for fifty and what 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.290
 is good 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.920
 first there is one gigahertz 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.550
 further percentage and here everything is building 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.320
 video accelerator it handles 22 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.590
 million polygons per second or 133 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.210
 million 3d pixels per second yard saw 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.760
 Movies I will stay the account of the very big 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.889
 crane all the fingers of the ships loads 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.139
 gradually everything goes to this and it requires 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.849
 party members and circles and composition therefore 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.479
 using this type of cancer is the key to success 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.369
 and pledge a good result of the device 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:34.060
 also percent garden percentage 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.139
 the shelf has been optimized 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.999
 drug use then there are great heights 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.209
 calculations they are not always him 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.119
 is necessary 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.649
 at the core of the work, their benefit is not 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.459
 use browsing for their weight 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.869
 adjust and tune in to 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.749
 once again for three years 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:50.819
 percent 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.379
 another achievement is the scientific face 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.209
 network 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.560
 in the regions themselves calibration well and in 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.909
 which allow to make a debate 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.469
 Contact our judge 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:02.159
 operators 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.760
 and in a communication exhibition this is important 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.409
 because in the phone jail 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.349
 a service that always allows 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.609
 stay connected to 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.159
 social networks like facebook 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.519
 for example twitter in this chipset percentage 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.849
 built-in eat support 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.369
 Works in Sochi plays 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.229
 that is, during a cold start 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.899
 make up a little more than thirty 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:26.369
 seconds will be very fast 9 percent 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:27.859
 so complete with a communicator we 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.869
 offer built-in lawn 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.869
 the decision is very recently Russia 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.579
 so this 1202 is not only one of 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:36.989
 most professional 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.459
 cadre them was a big sponsor 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.189
 the screen 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.069
 but also a super high-speed smartphone 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.559
 who is able to pull out the country and 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.589
 resource intensive tasks but that's not all 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.790
 these two seem like a hall he is fine for sure 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.079
 work with popular Internet services I 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.039
 so in the next story later
