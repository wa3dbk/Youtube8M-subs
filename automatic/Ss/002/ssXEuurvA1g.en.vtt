Congress for his own political benefit
under<00:03:16.739> circumstances<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.549> he<00:03:17.820> deems

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
under circumstances that he deems

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.640 
under circumstances that he deems
difficult<00:03:18.600> where<00:03:18.989> he<00:03:19.140> considers<00:03:19.560> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
difficult where he considers it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.949 
difficult where he considers it
inconvenient<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:21.000> go<00:03:21.120> through<00:03:21.360> Congress<00:03:21.780> and

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
inconvenient to go through Congress and

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.440 
inconvenient to go through Congress and
that's<00:03:22.079> wrong<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.620> unconstitutional<00:03:23.450> so

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
that's wrong it's unconstitutional so

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.080 
that's wrong it's unconstitutional so
perhaps<00:03:25.230> folks<00:03:25.739> at<00:03:25.890> home<00:03:26.040> say<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:26.670> what<00:03:27.030> are

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090

perhaps folks at home say so what are
you<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.329> what<00:03:27.510> are<00:03:27.570> going<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:27.959> about

you going to what are going to do about
it<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.459> lawsuit<00:03:29.820> that<00:03:30.600> has<00:03:30.810> been

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
it and that this lawsuit that has been

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.810 
it and that this lawsuit that has been
enacted<00:03:31.470> what<00:03:31.620> does<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.829> mean<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.519> know<00:03:32.610> for

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
enacted what does it mean you know for

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.330 
enacted what does it mean you know for
people<00:03:33.060> at<00:03:33.150> home<00:03:33.180> who<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:34.350> been<00:03:34.620> hit<00:03:34.890> some<00:03:35.190> of

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
people at home who have been hit some of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.410 
people at home who have been hit some of
them<00:03:35.489> hard<00:03:36.000> by<00:03:36.269> Obamacare<00:03:37.940> yeah<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.180> it's

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
them hard by Obamacare yeah so it's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.870 
them hard by Obamacare yeah so it's
difficult<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.590> challenge<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.310> president

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
difficult to challenge a president

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.060 
difficult to challenge a president
because<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:42.510> much<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.290> president's<00:03:43.829> power

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
because so much of the president's power

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.220 
because so much of the president's power
is<00:03:44.459> inherent<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.209> office<00:03:45.630> itself<00:03:45.989> but

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.280 
respect for the rule of law but these
things<00:05:32.220> can't<00:05:32.520> be<00:05:32.610> all<00:05:32.850> wrapped<00:05:33.290> together

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
things can't be all wrapped together

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.100 
things can't be all wrapped together
they<00:05:34.800> can't<00:05:35.130> all<00:05:35.280> happen<00:05:35.790> at<00:05:35.940> once<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.540> we

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
they can't all happen at once and we

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.990 
they can't all happen at once and we
need<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.290> undertake<00:05:37.740> those<00:05:38.040> first<00:05:38.520> two<00:05:38.760> steps

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
need to undertake those first two steps

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.390 
need to undertake those first two steps
first<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.630> complete<00:05:40.050> them<00:05:40.260> before<00:05:41.100> we<00:05:41.220> move

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
first and complete them before we move

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.159 
first and complete them before we move
on<00:05:41.550> to<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:41.790> third<00:05:41.970> so<00:05:42.030> how<00:05:42.360> likely<00:05:42.600> how<00:05:43.050> much

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
on to the third so how likely how much

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.290 
on to the third so how likely how much
room<00:05:43.380> is<00:05:43.530> there<00:05:43.590> for<00:05:44.310> negotiation<00:05:45.060> on<00:05:45.180> this

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
room is there for negotiation on this

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.909 
room is there for negotiation on this
issue<00:05:45.419> because<00:05:45.720> this<00:05:45.870> is<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.080> one<00:05:46.320> thing<00:05:46.650> that

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
issue because this is the one thing that

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.890 
issue because this is the one thing that
I<00:05:47.280> think<00:05:47.550> Americans<00:05:47.940> look<00:05:48.090> at<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.360> say<00:05:48.540> well

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
I think Americans look at and say well

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.540 
I think Americans look at and say well
if<00:05:49.020> they<00:05:49.140> can't<00:05:49.380> do<00:05:49.530> this<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:50.280> know<00:05:50.370> if<00:05:50.460> they

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
if they can't do this you know if they

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.890 
if they can't do this you know if they
can't<00:05:50.760> get<00:05:50.880> together<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:51.600> figure<00:05:51.750> out

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
can't get together and figure out

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.719 
can't get together and figure out
something<00:05:52.020> on<00:05:52.410> this<00:05:52.590> maybe<00:05:53.220> they<00:05:53.400> can't<00:05:53.640> do

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
something on this maybe they can't do

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.680 
something on this maybe they can't do
anything<00:05:55.160> yeah<00:05:56.160> I<00:05:56.190> think<00:05:56.669> compromise<00:05:57.479> and

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
anything yeah I think compromise and

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.690 
anything yeah I think compromise and
negotiation<00:05:58.200> are<00:05:58.500> not<00:05:58.650> only<00:05:58.830> possible<00:05:59.610> I

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
negotiation are not only possible I

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.909 
negotiation are not only possible I
think<00:05:59.910> they're<00:06:00.030> imperative<00:06:00.660> and<00:06:01.500> I<00:06:01.620> think<00:06:01.830> the

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
think they're imperative and I think the

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.650 
think they're imperative and I think the
best<00:06:02.160> way<00:06:02.250> to<00:06:02.400> achieve<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:03.000> is<00:06:03.210> to<00:06:03.240> start

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
best way to achieve that is to start

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.380 
best way to achieve that is to start
with<00:06:03.720> this<00:06:04.020> step-by-step<00:06:04.350> approach

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
with this step-by-step approach

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.550 
with this step-by-step approach
Americans<00:06:06.390> understand<00:06:06.960> that<00:06:07.169> we<00:06:07.290> need<00:06:07.320> to

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
Americans understand that we need to

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.930 
Americans understand that we need to
secure<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:08.010> border<00:06:08.280> and<00:06:08.370> they<00:06:08.460> understand

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
secure the border and they understand

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.810 
secure the border and they understand
that<00:06:09.270> our<00:06:09.479> legal<00:06:10.229> immigration<00:06:10.580> process<00:06:11.580> is

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
that our legal immigration process is

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.000 
that our legal immigration process is
broken<00:06:12.419> and<00:06:12.570> that<00:06:12.630> it's<00:06:12.990> antiquated<00:06:13.410> and<00:06:13.830> that

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
broken and that it's antiquated and that

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.159 
broken and that it's antiquated and that
it<00:06:14.100> needs<00:06:14.280> to<00:06:14.400> be<00:06:14.520> updated<00:06:14.700> and<00:06:15.180> reformed<00:06:16.050> and

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
it needs to be updated and reformed and

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.690 
it needs to be updated and reformed and
we<00:06:16.290> ought<00:06:16.410> to<00:06:16.530> start<00:06:16.800> with<00:06:17.160> those<00:06:17.340> areas

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
we ought to start with those areas

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.280 
we ought to start with those areas
because<00:06:18.000> those<00:06:18.330> are<00:06:18.479> the<00:06:18.540> areas<00:06:18.630> as<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.140> which

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
because those are the areas as to which

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.680 
because those are the areas as to which
there<00:06:19.470> is<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.710> most<00:06:19.919> broad-based<00:06:20.690> bipartisan

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
there is the most broad-based bipartisan

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.560 
there is the most broad-based bipartisan
consensus<00:06:22.140> let's<00:06:22.979> start<00:06:23.070> with<00:06:23.310> those<00:06:23.669> and<00:06:23.970> get

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
consensus let's start with those and get

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.450 
consensus let's start with those and get
those<00:06:24.780> things<00:06:25.080> done<00:06:25.229> and<00:06:25.650> then<00:06:26.040> we<00:06:26.160> can<00:06:26.340> move

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
those things done and then we can move

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.760 
those things done and then we can move
toward<00:06:26.820> consensus<00:06:27.390> toward<00:06:28.260> dealing<00:06:28.620> with

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
toward consensus toward dealing with

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.350 
toward consensus toward dealing with
some<00:06:28.919> of<00:06:29.040> the<00:06:29.130> other<00:06:29.160> more<00:06:29.550> vexing<00:06:29.790> problems

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360
