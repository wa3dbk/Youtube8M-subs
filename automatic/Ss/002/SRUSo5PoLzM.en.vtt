hi<00:00:09.300> farmers<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.990> dairy<00:00:10.679> protein<00:00:11.309> which<00:00:11.880> has

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
hi farmers a dairy protein which has

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.690 
hi farmers a dairy protein which has
been<00:00:12.330> specifically<00:00:12.960> designed<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:14.070> mimic<00:00:14.309> an

fruit or vegetable juices something on
fat-free<00:00:20.580> medium<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.500> will<00:00:22.680> erase

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
fat-free medium and it will erase

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.240 
fat-free medium and it will erase
exactly<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.240> an<00:00:24.390> egg<00:00:24.539> white<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.250> Chi

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
exactly like an egg white will do Chi
