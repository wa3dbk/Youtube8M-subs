00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
to the playoffs is kind of predicted so

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.550 
to the playoffs is kind of predicted so
yeah<00:00:49.880> it's<00:00:50.420> I<00:00:50.630> don't<00:00:50.899> know<00:00:50.960> it's<00:00:51.140> been<00:00:51.290> kind<00:00:51.500> of

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
yeah it's I don't know it's been kind of

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.170 
yeah it's I don't know it's been kind of
a<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.310> tournament<00:00:52.640> I<00:00:52.670> feel<00:00:52.880> like<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.000> lot<00:00:53.120> of

a the tournament I feel like a lot of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.090

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
know we came second our group so we

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.230

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
predicted we're going to against not be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.780 
predicted we're going to against not be
anyways<00:01:33.140> because<00:01:33.380> they<00:01:34.100> usually<00:01:34.369> did<00:01:34.520> breaks

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
anyways because they usually did breaks

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.310 
anyways because they usually did breaks
between<00:01:35.030> most<00:01:35.420> teams<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:35.869> since<00:01:36.020> we<00:01:36.200> both

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
between most teams and since we both

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.899 
between most teams and since we both
played<00:01:36.590> on<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.799> first<00:01:37.040> day<00:01:37.189> I<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:37.460> assumed

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
played on the first day I just assumed

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.420 
played on the first day I just assumed
we'd<00:01:38.090> probably<00:01:38.299> claim<00:01:38.540> today<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:40.250> really

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
we'd probably claim today and so really

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.280 
we'd probably claim today and so really
we<00:01:40.850> are<00:01:41.000> gonna<00:01:41.150> play<00:01:41.330> him<00:01:41.420> today<00:01:41.630> but<00:01:41.990> yeah<00:01:42.140> I'm

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.609 
definitely confident going against um
yeah<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.630> guess<00:01:44.840> that's<00:01:44.990> an<00:01:45.080> important<00:01:45.409> part

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
yeah I guess that's an important part

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.520 
yeah I guess that's an important part
because<00:01:46.040> that<00:01:46.220> also<00:01:46.460> reminds<00:01:46.820> me<00:01:46.939> of<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.500> talk<00:01:48.500> I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
because that also reminds me of a talk I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.289 
because that also reminds me of a talk I
had<00:01:48.650> with<00:01:48.799> wagah<00:01:49.159> earlier<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.820> he<00:01:50.150> also

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
had with wagah earlier and he also

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.060 
had with wagah earlier and he also
mentioned<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:51.049> him<00:01:51.170> personally<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
mentioned that for him personally the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.580 
mentioned that for him personally the
key<00:01:52.610> thing<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.479> going<00:01:53.659> up<00:01:53.750> against<00:01:54.049> Navi<00:01:54.380> is

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
key thing and going up against Navi is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.219 
key thing and going up against Navi is
making<00:01:54.979> sure<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.400> don't<00:01:55.869> let<00:01:56.869> them<00:01:57.080> play

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
making sure that you don't let them play

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.510 
making sure that you don't let them play
in<00:01:57.350> their<00:01:57.470> comfort<00:01:57.830> zone<00:01:57.979> don't<00:01:58.159> let<00:01:58.340> their

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
in their comfort zone don't let their

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.340 
in their comfort zone don't let their
game<00:01:58.759> develop<00:01:59.210> don't<00:01:59.450> kind<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.900> bow<00:02:00.049> down<00:02:00.320> to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
game develop don't kind of bow down to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.200 
game develop don't kind of bow down to
what<00:02:00.590> they<00:02:00.710> try<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.890> do<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.159> you<00:02:01.220> on<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.400> map<00:02:01.579> do

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
what they try to do to you on the map do

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.880 
what they try to do to you on the map do
you<00:02:02.270> do<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.479> see<00:02:02.630> things<00:02:02.780> similarly<00:02:03.320> or<00:02:03.500> is<00:02:03.680> it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
you do you see things similarly or is it

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.300 
you do you see things similarly or is it
we<00:02:04.130> can<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.369> even<00:02:04.939> expand<00:02:05.329> on<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.479> Oh

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
we can you even expand on that Oh

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.679 
we can you even expand on that Oh
basically<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.369> think<00:02:07.579> it's<00:02:07.729> navi<00:02:08.119> in

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:08.689 
basically I think it's navi in

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.470 
basically I think it's navi in
particular<00:02:09.140> we're<00:02:09.590> going<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.769> focus

the<00:02:29.090> map<00:02:29.270> defending<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:30.050> should<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.319> fine<00:02:30.670> and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
count on that because I personally I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.170 
count on that because I personally I
haven't<00:02:42.920> seen<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.070> lot<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.370> them<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.790> games<00:02:44.030> I

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
did cast that were online they really

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.370 
did cast that were online they really
didn't<00:02:46.910> strike<00:02:47.120> me<00:02:47.150> as<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.450> top<00:02:47.810> team<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.290> be

didn't strike me as a top team to be
completely<00:02:48.739> honest<00:02:49.070> but<00:02:49.550> they<00:02:49.910> are<00:02:50.269> I<00:02:50.330> think

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
before I can really have a huge opinion

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.160 
before I can really have a huge opinion
on<00:02:58.940> them<00:02:59.090> they<00:02:59.330> played<00:02:59.600> really<00:02:59.780> well<00:02:59.930> of

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
on them they played really well of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.500 
on them they played really well of
course<00:03:00.410> they've<00:03:00.650> got<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:01.390> strategy<00:03:02.390> where

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
course they've got this strategy where

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.570 
course they've got this strategy where
they'd<00:03:02.630> like<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.810> push<00:03:03.050> towers<00:03:03.890> really<00:03:04.250> early

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
they'd like to push towers really early

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.790 
they'd like to push towers really early
and<00:03:04.610> fall<00:03:05.090> back<00:03:05.300> on<00:03:05.510> some<00:03:05.750> hard<00:03:06.019> carry<00:03:06.380> which

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
and fall back on some hard carry which

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.320 
and fall back on some hard carry which
is<00:03:06.920> working<00:03:07.190> out<00:03:07.280> really<00:03:07.340> well<00:03:07.580> for<00:03:07.760> them<00:03:08.090> and

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
is working out really well for them and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.940 
is working out really well for them and
it<00:03:08.720> all<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:08.870> be<00:03:09.200> curious<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.500> see<00:03:09.680> if<00:03:09.769> that

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
it all just be curious to see if that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.620 
it all just be curious to see if that
style<00:03:10.340> continues<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:10.970> work<00:03:11.090> throughout<00:03:11.390> the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
style continues to work throughout the

style continues to work throughout the
playoffs<00:03:12.130> one<00:03:13.130> last<00:03:13.310> question<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.910> think<00:03:13.940> many

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
playoffs one last question I think many
