it you can see half is pretty much done
and<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> other<00:00:38.160> half<00:00:38.690> still<00:00:39.690> needs<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.020> get

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and the other half still needs to get

and the other half still needs to get
done<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.770> we've<00:00:40.890> got<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> lot<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.280> work<00:00:41.430> ahead<00:00:41.610> of

along<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> way<00:01:04.470> we've<00:01:04.710> also<00:01:04.920> created<00:01:05.850> our

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
along the way we've also created our

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.539 
along the way we've also created our
coopered<00:01:06.420> headrest<00:01:06.920> which<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> created<00:01:08.430> with

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
coopered headrest which is created with

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429 
coopered headrest which is created with
six<00:01:08.820> blocks<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.420> some<00:01:09.570> angles<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.049> each<00:01:10.080> side

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
six blocks with some angles on each side

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
six blocks with some angles on each side
and<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:10.830> they're<00:01:11.010> glued<00:01:11.189> together<00:01:11.510> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and then they're glued together the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.000 
and then they're glued together the
first<00:01:12.750> pair<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.080> fairly<00:01:13.350> simple<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.770> glue

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
first pair is fairly simple to glue

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
first pair is fairly simple to glue
together<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.640> F<00:01:14.790> clamps<00:01:15.740> but<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
together with some F clamps but then the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.910 
together with some F clamps but then the
curve<00:01:17.250> becomes<00:01:17.549> too<00:01:17.790> much<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.390> use

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
curve becomes too much we have to use

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
curve becomes too much we have to use
some<00:01:19.920> unique<00:01:20.220> tools<00:01:20.549> called<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.180> pinch<00:01:21.390> dog

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
some unique tools called a pinch dog

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.480 
some unique tools called a pinch dog
they<00:01:22.320> get<00:01:22.470> hammered<00:01:22.680> into<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> top<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
they get hammered into the top of the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.780 
they get hammered into the top of the
headrest<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.950> pull<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.040> nice<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.250> tight<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
headrest and pull it nice and tight the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.300 
headrest and pull it nice and tight the
glue<00:01:26.939> line<00:01:27.119> works<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.540> very<00:01:27.570> well<00:01:28.189> here's<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
glue line works out very well here's a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.499 
glue line works out very well here's a

this<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.069> two<00:02:10.369> board<00:02:10.700> seat<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.840> we<00:02:11.930> get<00:02:12.080> a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
this is a two board seat so we get a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.430 
this is a two board seat so we get a
beautiful<00:02:12.440> grain<00:02:12.830> match<00:02:13.069> going<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.670> with<00:02:13.940> it

so<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.470> always<00:02:15.680> try<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.010> pick<00:02:16.250> lumber<00:02:16.670> that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
so I always try and pick lumber that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.710 
so I always try and pick lumber that
we're<00:02:17.060> gonna<00:02:17.150> get<00:02:19.299> boards<00:02:20.299> that<00:02:20.390> are<00:02:20.540> wide

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
we're gonna get boards that are wide

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.600 
we're gonna get boards that are wide
enough<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.049> when<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.739> cut<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.280> turn<00:02:22.580> it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
enough that when we cut it and turn it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.789 
enough that when we cut it and turn it
we're<00:02:22.910> able<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.569> generate<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.350> whole<00:02:24.530> seat

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
we're able to generate the whole seat

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.640 
we're able to generate the whole seat
out<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.160> single<00:02:25.489> board<00:02:26.110> offers<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.200> very<00:02:27.380> nice

can move the whole bunch of material

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.610 
can move the whole bunch of material
we've<00:02:43.819> got<00:02:44.000> our<00:02:44.120> six<00:02:44.390> degree<00:02:44.720> angle<00:02:45.290> cut<00:02:45.319> on

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
we've got our six degree angle cut on

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.280 
we've got our six degree angle cut on
the<00:02:45.709> bottom<00:02:46.150> eight<00:02:47.150> degree<00:02:47.540> angle<00:02:47.870> cut<00:02:47.900> on<00:02:48.170> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
top the arm joints ready to go and we've

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.060 
top the arm joints ready to go and we've
shaped<00:02:53.540> them<00:02:53.780> as<00:02:53.900> best<00:02:54.109> we<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.530> here<00:02:54.950> at<00:02:55.040> the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
shaped them as best we can here at the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.069 
shaped them as best we can here at the
router<00:02:55.340> table<00:02:55.900> using<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.989> doughnut<00:02:57.880> which

that way we're able to get as close as

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.750 
that way we're able to get as close as
we<00:03:05.780> can<00:03:06.079> to<00:03:06.290> most<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.829> our<00:03:06.890> joinery<00:03:07.310> because<00:03:07.640> of

chairs around here for my students to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.039 
chairs around here for my students to
see<00:03:27.850> exactly<00:03:28.850> what<00:03:29.150> we're<00:03:29.269> going<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.420> be<00:03:29.600> doing

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049

see exactly what we're going to be doing
because<00:03:30.500> really<00:03:30.709> we<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:31.819> three<00:03:32.209> days

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
because really we have three days

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.750 
because really we have three days
sometimes<00:03:33.230> four<00:03:33.530> days<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.250> working<00:03:34.519> on

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
sometimes four days of just working on

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.970 
sometimes four days of just working on
individual<00:03:35.299> parts<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.769> thing's

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
individual parts and that thing's

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.009 
individual parts and that thing's
actually<00:03:37.130> glued<00:03:37.730> up<00:03:37.910> or<00:03:38.180> even<00:03:38.209> resembles<00:03:38.930> a

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
to do it and you get to see a chair that

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.759 
to do it and you get to see a chair that
has<00:03:47.120> been<00:03:47.269> fully<00:03:47.510> fabricated<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.410> not<00:03:48.560> yet

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
has been fully fabricated and not yet

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.250 
has been fully fabricated and not yet
sculpted<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.519> also<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.659> course<00:03:50.840> have<00:03:51.110> some

fully
finished<00:03:52.090> chairs<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.390> get<00:03:55.629> to<00:03:55.750> see<00:03:55.959> from

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
finished chairs that you get to see from

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.759 
finished chairs that you get to see from
here<00:03:56.590> what<00:03:57.340> should<00:03:58.269> be<00:03:58.420> done<00:03:58.599> to<00:03:59.590> get<00:03:59.709> it

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
here what should be done to get it

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.339 
here what should be done to get it
finished<00:04:00.099> off<00:04:00.569> over<00:04:01.569> here<00:04:01.720> we<00:04:01.989> have<00:04:02.110> more

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
finished off over here we have more

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.250 
finished off over here we have more
chair<00:04:02.590> parts<00:04:03.420> we<00:04:04.420> have<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.780> first<00:04:04.989> set<00:04:05.230> of

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
chair parts we have the first set of

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.839 
chair parts we have the first set of
baton<00:04:05.590> laminated<00:04:06.010> back<00:04:06.159> braces<00:04:06.579> that<00:04:06.700> were

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
baton laminated back braces that were

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.240 
baton laminated back braces that were
taken<00:04:07.120> out<00:04:07.239> of<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.420> form<00:04:07.659> yesterday<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.349> like

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
taken out of the form yesterday I like

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.920 
taken out of the form yesterday I like
to<00:04:09.340> keep<00:04:09.459> them<00:04:09.640> all<00:04:09.760> clamped<00:04:10.090> together<00:04:10.209> just

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
to keep them all clamped together just

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.860 
to keep them all clamped together just
so<00:04:11.079> they<00:04:11.849> they<00:04:12.849> match<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.299> same<00:04:13.450> curve<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
so they they match the same curve the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.720 
so they they match the same curve the
whole<00:04:14.019> time<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.500> just<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:15.040> case<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.400> chance

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
whole time that just in case is a chance

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.390 
whole time that just in case is a chance
they<00:04:15.940> move<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.269> little<00:04:16.389> or<00:04:16.660> something<00:04:17.340> more<00:04:18.340> of

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
they move a little or something more of

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.310 
they move a little or something more of
an<00:04:18.489> issue<00:04:18.609> if<00:04:18.910> say<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.239> take<00:04:19.479> two<00:04:19.780> months<00:04:19.959> or

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
an issue if say you take two months or

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.260 
an issue if say you take two months or
four<00:04:20.590> months<00:04:20.829> to<00:04:20.889> make<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.160> chair<00:04:21.519> in<00:04:22.090> this

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
four months to make a chair in this

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.870 
four months to make a chair in this
situation<00:04:22.810> we're<00:04:22.960> taking<00:04:23.289> six<00:04:23.680> days<00:04:23.889> so

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
situation we're taking six days so

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.050 
situation we're taking six days so
really<00:04:25.150> there<00:04:25.300> should<00:04:25.330> be<00:04:25.570> no<00:04:25.660> issues<00:04:25.990> there

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
really there should be no issues there

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.610 
really there should be no issues there
we<00:04:28.060> have<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.300> front<00:04:28.539> legs<00:04:28.750> with<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.289> joinery

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
we have the front legs with the joinery

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.200 
we have the front legs with the joinery
complete<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:33.490> front<00:04:33.729> legs<00:04:33.910> actually

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
complete and the front legs actually

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.600 
complete and the front legs actually
have<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.360> decent<00:04:34.960> angle<00:04:35.289> when<00:04:36.100> viewed<00:04:36.340> from<00:04:36.460> the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
have a decent angle when viewed from the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.000 
have a decent angle when viewed from the
front<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.810> is<00:04:37.870> accomplished<00:04:38.470> by<00:04:38.560> adding<00:04:38.770> a

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
front this is accomplished by adding a

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.650 
front this is accomplished by adding a
Nadder<00:04:39.190> block<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.760> them<00:04:39.910> as<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.060> see<00:04:40.360> here<00:04:40.570> in

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
Nadder block to them as you see here in

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.900 
Nadder block to them as you see here in
the<00:04:40.720> middle<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:42.280> will<00:04:42.400> be<00:04:42.520> cutting<00:04:42.789> that

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
the middle and it will be cutting that

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.150 
the middle and it will be cutting that
outer<00:04:43.120> block<00:04:43.389> at<00:04:43.570> an<00:04:43.690> angle<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.650> give<00:04:44.830> us<00:04:44.979> our

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
outer block at an angle to give us our

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.510 
outer block at an angle to give us our
angle<00:04:45.729> on<00:04:45.850> both<00:04:46.060> legs<00:04:46.360> at<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.600> same<00:04:46.840> time

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.930 

we<00:04:50.120> have<00:04:50.240> some<00:04:50.389> arms<00:04:51.160> we<00:04:52.160> have<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.520> coopered

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
we have some arms we have a coopered

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.379 
we have some arms we have a coopered
headrest<00:04:53.860> which<00:04:54.860> has<00:04:55.099> all<00:04:55.370> six<00:04:55.610> blocks<00:04:56.000> glued

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
headrest which has all six blocks glued

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.219 
headrest which has all six blocks glued
up<00:04:56.569> I<00:04:57.849> can<00:04:58.849> see<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.090> pinch<00:04:59.300> dogs<00:04:59.599> in<00:04:59.840> action

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
up I can see the pinch dogs in action

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.610 
up I can see the pinch dogs in action
here<00:05:01.330> they<00:05:02.330> work<00:05:02.509> very<00:05:02.539> very<00:05:02.840> well<00:05:03.080> give<00:05:03.530> us

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
here they work very very well give us

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.700 
here they work very very well give us
some<00:05:03.800> nice<00:05:03.919> tight<00:05:04.280> blue<00:05:04.550> lines<00:05:05.289> and<00:05:06.289> along<00:05:06.560> the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
some nice tight blue lines and along the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.200 
some nice tight blue lines and along the
way<00:05:06.830> we're<00:05:07.039> always<00:05:07.250> concerned<00:05:07.729> about<00:05:07.819> grain

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
way we're always concerned about grain

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.809 
way we're always concerned about grain
matching<00:05:08.660> all<00:05:09.530> of<00:05:09.770> our<00:05:09.889> pieces<00:05:10.069> so<00:05:10.430> we<00:05:10.520> can<00:05:10.669> see

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
matching all of our pieces so we can see

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.550 
matching all of our pieces so we can see
along<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.180> top<00:05:11.360> edge<00:05:11.389> of<00:05:11.720> this<00:05:11.840> headrest<00:05:12.050> here

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
along the top edge of this headrest here

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.719 
along the top edge of this headrest here
how<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.400> grain<00:05:13.789> flows<00:05:14.210> along<00:05:15.580> because<00:05:16.580> we're

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
how the grain flows along because we're

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.339 
how the grain flows along because we're
gonna<00:05:16.849> be<00:05:17.060> creating<00:05:17.360> a<00:05:17.539> large<00:05:17.750> round<00:05:17.960> over<00:05:18.319> on

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
gonna be creating a large round over on

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.219 
gonna be creating a large round over on
the<00:05:18.530> front<00:05:18.770> edge<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:20.630> screen<00:05:20.930> will<00:05:21.139> be

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
the front edge the screen will be

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.960 
the front edge the screen will be
exposed<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.949> and<00:05:22.159> really<00:05:22.550> adds<00:05:22.789> a<00:05:22.849> nice

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
exposed and and really adds a nice

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.159 
exposed and and really adds a nice
visual<00:05:23.389> touch<00:05:23.569> to<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.900> chair<00:05:25.960> so<00:05:26.960> a<00:05:26.990> lot<00:05:27.139> of

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
visual touch to the chair so a lot of

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.809 
visual touch to the chair so a lot of
work<00:05:27.349> left<00:05:27.470> on<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.710> headrest<00:05:27.889> too<00:05:28.250> because<00:05:28.580> as

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
work left on the headrest too because as

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.219 
work left on the headrest too because as
of<00:05:28.880> right<00:05:29.090> now<00:05:29.300> we've<00:05:29.479> just<00:05:29.509> made<00:05:29.810> some<00:05:29.990> blocks

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
of right now we've just made some blocks

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.770 
of right now we've just made some blocks
and<00:05:30.409> glued<00:05:30.650> them<00:05:30.860> together

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
and glued them together

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.899 
and glued them together
we<00:05:32.780> got<00:05:32.930> a<00:05:32.960> cut<00:05:33.560> out<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.710> curve<00:05:34.039> cut<00:05:34.639> out<00:05:34.729> some

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 
we got a cut out a curve cut out some

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.089 
we got a cut out a curve cut out some
more<00:05:35.060> curves<00:05:35.620> drill<00:05:36.620> some<00:05:36.800> holes<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:39.099> cut

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
more curves drill some holes and cut

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.749 
more curves drill some holes and cut
some<00:05:40.220> angles<00:05:40.610> so<00:05:40.789> they<00:05:40.909> fit<00:05:41.120> between<00:05:41.539> our<00:05:41.840> legs
