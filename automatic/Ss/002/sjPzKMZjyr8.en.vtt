 gilmar teaches basketball at this club 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.160

 paulistas who have as objective 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.449
 discover new talents with sports 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.359
 modality 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.029

 grace the techniques of sports in basketball 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.850
 as in any sport to be a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.649
 champion, it takes training and dedication 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 seems easy but learn to put the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.010
 ball in the basket is a difficult task 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 the boys do stretching learn the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:03.359
 do ball control passes hit and miss 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.030
 err but do not give up 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.020
 Always give a working 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.939
 heating together with stretching and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.860

 exercises all activities all 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.619
 things that involve basketball dribble 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.090
 cast and finish with 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.330
 a game here is more delicious than them 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.729
 adore the coach also states that for 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.619
 to hit more than miss is necessary 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.890
 train at least twice a week 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.600
 and with the most enthusiastic design can 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.329
 train every day 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.250

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.950
 that with basketball it is possible to learn 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.299
 more than to take a siesta to the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.899
 fellowship that has many friends 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.409
 me to share and today what's your 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.960
 dream to play at nbb and tiago trains from 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.329
 small and also dreams that basketball 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.540
 Whether your future is only played in the 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.149
 professional we take with a difficult game 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.399
 but not impossible and who has already 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.329
 your goals believe that this is 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.460
 possible 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.210
 the holder of the Brazilian national 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.399
 basketball 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.830
 Larry Taylor advises who is 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.020
 starting or entering you will not 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.550
 can not make a good speech 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.220
 the first thing you have to do is 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.010
 training always has to focus on what 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.480
 do things to take care of your body 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.390
 who wants to become a professional player 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.970
 in the future it will have to continue 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.970
 training and having dogs suffocate
