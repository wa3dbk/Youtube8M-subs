that because it had been crash proof by
killer<00:01:39.329> planes<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> thing

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
killer planes so I get the thing

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
crash-proof by killer planes we take off

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.480 
crash-proof by killer planes we take off
again

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490
