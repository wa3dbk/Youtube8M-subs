tutorial<00:00:09.380> because<00:00:10.380> Sam<00:00:11.219> was<00:00:11.580> getting<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.360> my

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
tutorial because Sam was getting on my

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.820 
tutorial because Sam was getting on my
case<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:20.270> in<00:00:21.270> comparison<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.410> some<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
case so in comparison to some of the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.650 
case so in comparison to some of the
knots<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.310> qeqae<00:00:23.880> has<00:00:24.000> been<00:00:24.240> giving<00:00:24.510> me

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
knots that qeqae has been giving me

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.830 
knots that qeqae has been giving me
recently<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.769> thing<00:00:26.240> feels<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> breeze

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
recently this thing feels like a breeze

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.660 
recently this thing feels like a breeze
but<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> used<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> hardest<00:00:29.070> not<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.580> me

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
but it used to be the hardest not for me

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.450 
but it used to be the hardest not for me
to<00:00:29.730> string<00:00:30.439> it's<00:00:31.439> definitely<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> hardest

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
to string it's definitely the hardest

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.260 
to string it's definitely the hardest
not<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.239> me<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> teach<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.870> younger<00:00:34.170> guys<00:00:34.380> so

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
not for me to teach to younger guys so

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.040 
not for me to teach to younger guys so
but<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:38.040> bridge<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.899> can

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
but it is it is a bridge not that can

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.459 
but it is it is a bridge not that can
really<00:00:40.790> further<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.719> performance<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.350> your

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
really further the performance of your

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.279 
really further the performance of your
pocket<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
pocket so what you're going to do is

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.340 
pocket so what you're going to do is
right<00:00:47.010> about<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> start<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> use<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
right about at the start the the use of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
right about at the start the the use of
the<00:00:52.469> knot<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> really<00:00:53.190> transition<00:00:53.760> from

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the knot is to really transition from

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
the knot is to really transition from
the<00:00:54.930> channeling<00:00:55.530> section<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> head<00:00:56.399> were

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the channeling section of the head were

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
the channeling section of the head were
you<00:00:56.579> yanking<00:00:57.059> down<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.750> into<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> start<00:00:58.469> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
you yanking down right into the start of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.849 
you yanking down right into the start of
your<00:00:58.649> pocket<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> you're<00:01:01.410> always<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
your pocket so you're always going to

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.290 
your pocket so you're always going to
want<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.309> don't<00:01:02.430> want<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.910> too<00:01:03.090> high

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
want it you don't want it to be too high

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.969 
want it you don't want it to be too high
up<00:01:03.510> otherwise<00:01:03.809> you're<00:01:04.019> gonna<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.290> sacrificing

right where that curve of the offset is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.080 
right where that curve of the offset is
right<00:01:22.920> where<00:01:23.070> we're<00:01:23.220> starting<00:01:23.430> our<00:01:23.640> pockets

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
right where we're starting our pockets

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
gonna want to go down through one mesh

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.700 
gonna want to go down through one mesh
hole<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.430> gonna<00:01:35.520> go<00:01:35.820> down

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
hole and then you're gonna go down

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
through another mesh hole okay so you're

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.340 
through another mesh hole okay so you're
going<00:01:40.979> through<00:01:41.280> down<00:01:41.700> through<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:44.009> Mitchells

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
going through down through to Mitchells

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.090 
going through down through to Mitchells

then you're going to go from the outside
in<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:51.329> sidewall<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.970> now<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.840> gonna

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
in of the sidewall and now you're gonna

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.560 
in of the sidewall and now you're gonna
be<00:01:55.259> weaving<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:55.950> back<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.540> through

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
be weaving your way back up through

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.940 
be weaving your way back up through
these<00:01:58.439> two<00:01:58.799> holes<00:01:59.159> now<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.680> bit

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
these two holes now it is a little bit

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.380 
these two holes now it is a little bit
important<00:02:02.430> kind<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.030> talked<00:02:03.270> about

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
important kind of like we talked about

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.600 
important kind of like we talked about
with<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> SI<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.860> don't<00:02:05.100> want<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> just

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
with the SI you don't want to just

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.449 
with the SI you don't want to just
actually<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.689> does<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.619> matter<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.129> does

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
actually know does that matter that does

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.529 
actually know does that matter that does
matter<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.000> don't<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> make<00:02:09.509> sure

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
matter so you don't want to make sure

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.949 
matter so you don't want to make sure
you're<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:12.030> you're<00:02:12.209> coming<00:02:12.569> from<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
you're going that you're coming from the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.589 
you're going that you're coming from the
out

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
out

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.330 
out
and<00:02:13.959> rapping<00:02:15.450> making<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.569> twist<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:18.069> that

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
and rapping making this twist like that

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.399 
and rapping making this twist like that
so<00:02:18.939> you<00:02:18.999> do<00:02:19.239> want<00:02:19.389> to<00:02:19.420> make<00:02:19.599> sure<00:02:19.629> just<00:02:20.109> like<00:02:20.230> an

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
so you do want to make sure just like an

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.199 
so you do want to make sure just like an
SI<00:02:20.769> you're<00:02:21.069> coming<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.609> and<00:02:21.760> you're<00:02:21.849> feeding

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
SI you're coming up and you're feeding

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.369 
SI you're coming up and you're feeding
it<00:02:22.540> through<00:02:23.159> that<00:02:24.159> little<00:02:24.519> gap<00:02:24.730> underneath<00:02:25.599> so

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
it through that little gap underneath so

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.679 
it through that little gap underneath so
when<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.590> feed<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.069> through<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.969> first<00:02:28.299> mesh

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
when you feed it through the first mesh

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.550 
when you feed it through the first mesh
hole<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.200> see<00:02:29.439> there's<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.969> twist<00:02:31.870> so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
hole you see there's not that twist so

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.660 
hole you see there's not that twist so
you're<00:02:32.650> gonna<00:02:32.739> go<00:02:32.980> up<00:02:33.359> through<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.980> second

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
you're gonna go up through the second

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.000 
you're gonna go up through the second
sidewall<00:02:37.389> hole<00:02:37.659> I<00:02:37.900> mean<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.319> second<00:02:38.709> mesh

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
sidewall hole I mean the second mesh

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.259 
sidewall hole I mean the second mesh
hole<00:02:39.219> then<00:02:39.909> up<00:02:40.469> through<00:02:41.469> the<00:02:42.430> first<00:02:42.760> mesh<00:02:43.060> hole

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
hole then up through the first mesh hole

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.539 
hole then up through the first mesh hole
and<00:02:43.480> then<00:02:43.629> you'll<00:02:43.810> see<00:02:44.079> you<00:02:44.769> can<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:45.219> tighten

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
and then you'll see you can just tighten

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.309 
and then you'll see you can just tighten
it<00:02:45.760> right<00:02:45.819> down<00:02:46.359> and<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.930> forms<00:02:47.230> this

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
it right down and it forms this

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:56.939 
it right down and it forms this
beautiful<00:02:47.769> little<00:02:48.040> stack<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:56.379> best<00:02:56.650> way

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:56.949 
beautiful little stack so the best way

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.189 
beautiful little stack so the best way
the<00:02:57.340> best<00:02:57.370> way<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.790> kind<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.180> conceptualize<00:02:58.510> it

00:02:59.189 --> 00:02:59.199 
the best way to kind of conceptualize it

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.720 
the best way to kind of conceptualize it
and<00:02:59.349> make<00:02:59.500> sure<00:02:59.530> you're<00:02:59.889> not<00:02:59.919> doing<00:03:00.250> anything

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and make sure you're not doing anything

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.449 
and make sure you're not doing anything
out<00:03:00.879> of<00:03:00.909> order<00:03:01.329> is<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:02.139> go<00:03:02.319> down<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.010> then<00:03:03.280> up

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
out of order is you go down and then up

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.309 
out of order is you go down and then up
and<00:03:03.760> then<00:03:04.030> down<00:03:04.739> you're<00:03:05.739> gonna<00:03:05.859> go<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.870> review

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
and then down you're gonna go in review

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.649 
and then down you're gonna go in review
what<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.189> biggest<00:03:09.579> issue<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.849> see<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.180> kids

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
what the the biggest issue I see is kids

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.429 
what the the biggest issue I see is kids
go<00:03:11.159> down<00:03:12.159> down<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.599> down<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.959> first<00:03:14.169> one<00:03:14.319> down

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
go down down so down the first one down

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.689 
go down down so down the first one down
the<00:03:14.620> second<00:03:15.010> one<00:03:15.129> and<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:15.370> through<00:03:15.579> the

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:15.699 
the second one and then through the

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.610 
the second one and then through the
sidewall<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.120> then<00:03:16.449> they<00:03:16.599> try<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.810> go<00:03:16.989> up<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
sidewall and then they try to go up the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.830 
sidewall and then they try to go up the
first<00:03:17.859> one<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.250> up<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.639> second<00:03:19.060> one<00:03:19.180> but<00:03:19.720> it

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
first one and up the second one but it

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.589 
first one and up the second one but it
goes<00:03:20.019> 1<00:03:20.799> 2<00:03:21.009> 2<00:03:21.849> 1<00:03:22.299> 1<00:03:22.599> 2<00:03:23.549> down<00:03:24.549> then<00:03:24.970> up<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.540> then

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
goes 1 2 2 1 1 2 down then up and then

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.319 
goes 1 2 2 1 1 2 down then up and then
down<00:03:26.129> so<00:03:27.129> interview<00:03:27.400> we're<00:03:27.729> going<00:03:27.759> down

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
down so interview we're going down

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.969 
down so interview we're going down
through<00:03:29.549> these<00:03:30.549> two<00:03:30.819> mesh<00:03:31.060> holes<00:03:31.799> from<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:32.979 
through these two mesh holes from the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:38.429 
through these two mesh holes from the
outside<00:03:33.489> end<00:03:33.729> of<00:03:33.849> the<00:03:33.939> sidewall<00:03:36.780> up<00:03:37.780> through

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
outside end of the sidewall up through

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.740 
outside end of the sidewall up through
the<00:03:38.530> second<00:03:40.799> up<00:03:41.799> through<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.519> first<00:03:42.759> so<00:03:43.359> down

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
the second up through the first so down

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.390 
the second up through the first so down
up<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.000> then<00:03:46.000> we<00:03:46.659> rank<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.349> down<00:03:47.979> into<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
up and then we rank it down into the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.409 
up and then we rank it down into the
outside<00:03:49.290> for<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.349> stacked<00:03:50.620> si<00:03:51.209> that's<00:03:52.209> how<00:03:52.359> you

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
outside for a stacked si that's how you

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.670 
outside for a stacked si that's how you
do<00:03:52.659> it<00:03:52.810> if<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.530> want<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:54.099> add<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.729> knotted

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
do it if you want to add a knotted

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.719 
do it if you want to add a knotted
version<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.829> this<00:03:57.009> all<00:03:57.969> you<00:03:58.030> have<00:03:58.509> to<00:03:58.689> do<00:03:58.900> is

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
version of this all you have to do is

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:05.759 
version of this all you have to do is
treat<00:04:00.729> it<00:04:00.909> like<00:04:01.449> you're<00:04:01.629> tying<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:02.409> 2<00:04:03.900> first<00:04:04.900> so

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
treat it like you're tying a 2 first so

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.080 
treat it like you're tying a 2 first so
as<00:04:06.359> we<00:04:07.359> talked<00:04:07.569> about<00:04:07.719> in<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.840> 2<00:04:08.019> tutorial<00:04:09.090> you

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
as we talked about in the 2 tutorial you

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.449 
as we talked about in the 2 tutorial you
make<00:04:10.379> you<00:04:11.379> make<00:04:11.560> your<00:04:11.769> knot<00:04:11.949> and<00:04:12.189> it's<00:04:12.310> going

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
make you make your knot and it's going

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.879 
make you make your knot and it's going
to<00:04:12.549> look<00:04:12.729> like<00:04:12.789> a<00:04:12.969> 2<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.539> then<00:04:14.259> from<00:04:14.469> there<00:04:14.680> all

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
to look like a 2 and then from there all

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.469 
to look like a 2 and then from there all
you<00:04:15.039> do<00:04:15.219> is<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.549> just<00:04:15.579> go<00:04:15.909> right<00:04:15.939> back<00:04:16.479> up

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
you do is you just go right back up

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.390 
you do is you just go right back up
through<00:04:19.479> those<00:04:19.690> two<00:04:19.930> diamonds<00:04:20.289> same<00:04:20.829> ways<00:04:21.099> if

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
through those two diamonds same ways if

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.250 
through those two diamonds same ways if
you're<00:04:21.519> doing<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.880> stacked<00:04:22.150> si<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.779> then

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
you're doing a stacked si and then

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.140 
you're doing a stacked si and then
you'll<00:04:23.380> see<00:04:23.590> when<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.860> gank<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.219> down<00:04:24.400> you

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
you'll see when you gank it down you

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.969 
you'll see when you gank it down you
have<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.750> knot<00:04:26.440> in

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.290 

for<00:04:29.979> me<00:04:30.280> this<00:04:31.180> can<00:04:32.639> I've<00:04:33.639> actually<00:04:33.880> moved

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
for me this can I've actually moved

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.450 
for me this can I've actually moved
almost<00:04:34.810> completely<00:04:35.139> away<00:04:35.470> from<00:04:35.500> doing<00:04:36.160> the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
almost completely away from doing the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.290 
almost completely away from doing the
knotted<00:04:36.880> si<00:04:37.330> knotted<00:04:38.259> stacked<00:04:38.560> s<00:04:38.770> eyes

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
knotted si knotted stacked s eyes

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.659 
knotted si knotted stacked s eyes
because<00:04:40.300> part<00:04:40.539> of<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.690> beauty<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.620> si<00:04:42.009> to

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
me of the stacked si is that it has a

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.920 
me of the stacked si is that it has a
little<00:04:44.860> bit<00:04:45.100> of<00:04:45.220> give<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.699> so<00:04:46.330> what<00:04:46.479> it<00:04:46.600> can<00:04:46.720> do

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.439 
little bit of give and so what it can do
is<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.139> can<00:04:47.350> add<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.919> little<00:04:48.430> more<00:04:48.699> hold<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.389> a

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
is it can add a little more hold and a

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.150 
is it can add a little more hold and a
little<00:04:49.720> more<00:04:49.870> whip<00:04:50.080> on<00:04:50.229> your<00:04:50.380> shots<00:04:50.680> but<00:04:50.979> not

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
little more whip on your shots but not

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.730 
little more whip on your shots but not
when<00:04:51.340> you're<00:04:51.460> just<00:04:51.699> passing<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.389> I<00:04:53.050> find<00:04:53.380> that

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
when you're just passing and I find that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.159 
when you're just passing and I find that
the<00:04:54.039> knotted<00:04:54.490> version<00:04:54.910> is<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:55.660> much<00:04:55.900> more

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
the knotted version is so much more

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.969 
the knotted version is so much more
locked<00:04:56.500> down<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.360> works<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:59.560> doesn't

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
locked down that it works it doesn't

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.219 
locked down that it works it doesn't
work<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:01.060> same<00:05:01.090> way<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.810> doesn't<00:05:01.990> have<00:05:02.199> that

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
work the same way it doesn't have that

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.870 
work the same way it doesn't have that
same<00:05:02.520> elasticity<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:06.070> just<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.490> normal

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
same elasticity that just the normal

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.750 
same elasticity that just the normal
version<00:05:07.570> does<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:07.960> when<00:05:08.139> we're<00:05:08.350> using<00:05:08.760> stacked

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
version does so when we're using stacked

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.120 
version does so when we're using stacked
s<00:05:10.000> eyes<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.570> you'll<00:05:10.720> hear<00:05:10.960> me<00:05:11.080> say<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.620> know

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
s eyes and you'll hear me say you know

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.040 
s eyes and you'll hear me say you know
especially<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.820> in<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.300> nas<00:05:13.539> pattern

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
especially in the in the nas pattern

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.409 
especially in the in the nas pattern
it's<00:05:14.590> all<00:05:15.070> of<00:05:15.280> these<00:05:15.400> knots<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:16.060> then<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.270> one

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
it's all of these knots and then the one

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.450 
it's all of these knots and then the one
thing<00:05:16.600> that<00:05:16.780> isn't<00:05:16.960> knotted<00:05:17.560> is<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.190> stacked

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
thing that isn't knotted is the stacked

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.480 
thing that isn't knotted is the stacked
si<00:05:18.880> just<00:05:19.660> because<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.050> find<00:05:20.560> that<00:05:20.650> functions<00:05:21.400> a

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
si just because I find that functions a

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.560 
si just because I find that functions a
little<00:05:21.610> bit<00:05:21.820> better<00:05:23.760> so<00:05:24.760> that's<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.120> down<00:05:25.330> and

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
little bit better so that's the down and

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.620 
little bit better so that's the down and
dirty<00:05:25.630> with<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.259> stack<00:05:27.330> we're<00:05:28.330> going<00:05:28.449> to<00:05:28.509> be

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
dirty with the stack we're going to be

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.439 
dirty with the stack we're going to be
finishing<00:05:29.199> up<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:29.639> lacota<00:05:30.639> now<00:05:30.849> so<00:05:31.120> we<00:05:31.240> can

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
finishing up this lacota now so we can

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.480 
finishing up this lacota now so we can
put<00:05:31.690> up<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.870> pattern<00:05:32.199> later<00:05:33.160> this<00:05:33.310> afternoon

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
put up the pattern later this afternoon

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.760 
put up the pattern later this afternoon
and<00:05:34.150> catch<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.050> guys<00:05:35.139> next<00:05:35.199> time

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
and catch you guys next time

and catch you guys next time
did<00:05:36.430> I<00:05:36.490> clap<00:05:36.729> at<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:36.970> end<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.360> now<00:05:37.449> at<00:05:37.510> the

did I clap at the end and now at the

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.909 
did I clap at the end and now at the
beginning<00:05:37.900> it's<00:05:38.289> quite<00:05:38.500> claps<00:05:38.710> at<00:05:38.860> the
