Duramax diesel truck it torques the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.600 
Duramax diesel truck it torques the
truck<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.730> pretty<00:01:02.879> solid<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.449> oh<00:01:03.600> yeah

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
absolutely this thing's got a 715 inch

absolutely this thing's got a 715 inch
lift<00:01:09.030> cam<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> lot<00:01:11.130> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
lift cam in it and so there's a lot of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.590 
lift cam in it and so there's a lot of
overlap<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:13.340> if<00:01:14.340> anything's<00:01:14.880> gonna<00:01:15.060> test<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
overlap and if anything's gonna test the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
overlap and if anything's gonna test the
stand<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.590> does<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:17.820> little

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
stand like this this does it very little

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
stand like this this does it very little
vibration<00:01:18.210> comes<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.140> oh<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.409> mounted<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
vibration comes out oh we mounted the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340 
vibration comes out oh we mounted the
engine<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.420> rubber<00:01:21.420> motor<00:01:21.720> mounts<00:01:22.080> instead

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
engine with rubber motor mounts instead

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
engine with rubber motor mounts instead
of<00:01:22.470> steel<00:01:22.799> mounts<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.640> knew<00:01:23.790> we're

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
of steel mounts because we knew we're

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.969 
of steel mounts because we knew we're
going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.210> firing<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.900> lot<00:01:25.080> didn't

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
going to be firing it up a lot didn't

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.670 
going to be firing it up a lot didn't
want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.689> transfer<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.049> vibration

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
want to transfer all that vibration

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.069 
want to transfer all that vibration
through<00:01:28.950> into<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:30.659> works<00:01:30.810> out

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
through into this it works out

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.090 
through into this it works out
absolutely<00:01:32.040> great<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.640> mean<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.030> thing<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
absolutely great I mean this thing is

absolutely great I mean this thing is
it's<00:01:35.100> amazing<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.759> went<00:01:35.909> together<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.450> fast

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it's amazing it went together so fast

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.420 
it's amazing it went together so fast
and<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.350> find<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> only<00:01:40.860> wood<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.310> we

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and and so find the only wood that we

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.600 
and and so find the only wood that we
did<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:43.049> had<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> grind<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.579> little

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
of the powder coating off because it's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.620 
of the powder coating off because it's
too<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.820> couldn't<00:01:48.090> get<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> good<00:01:48.390> enough

but this plate on the back of it here
I'm<00:02:33.510> not<00:02:33.750> sorry<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.110> mean<00:02:34.230> put<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.500> attachment

I'm not sorry I mean put this attachment
here<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.959> dropped<00:02:37.260> right<00:02:37.440> down

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
here on and it just dropped right down

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.949 
here on and it just dropped right down
plenty<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.970> clearance<00:02:39.180> with<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.480> radiator<00:02:39.840> on

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
plenty of clearance with the radiator on

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:40.340 
plenty of clearance with the radiator on
there

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
there

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.020 
there
oh<00:02:40.380> gosh<00:02:41.010> yeah<00:02:41.250> we<00:02:41.370> got<00:02:41.520> enough<00:02:41.730> there's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
oh gosh yeah we got enough there's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.400 
oh gosh yeah we got enough there's
enough<00:02:42.270> clearance<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:42.959> one<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.140> our<00:02:43.230> big

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
enough clearance here for one of our big

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.880 
enough clearance here for one of our big
blowin<00:02:43.739> waters<00:02:44.959> even<00:02:45.959> with<00:02:46.140> big<00:02:46.320> pulleys<00:02:46.739> on

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
blowin waters even with big pulleys on

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.430 
blowin waters even with big pulleys on
the<00:02:47.010> front<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.430> I'm<00:02:48.269> going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.570> guess<00:02:49.200> that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
the front of it I'm going to guess that

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.640 
the front of it I'm going to guess that
this<00:02:49.650> will<00:02:49.830> easily<00:02:50.040> handle<00:02:50.850> even<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.150> 1471<00:02:52.019> big

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
this will easily handle even a 1471 big

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650 
this will easily handle even a 1471 big
blower<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.100> front<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.519> thing<00:02:53.790> Chris<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
blower in front of that thing Chris you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.820 
blower in front of that thing Chris you
a<00:02:54.690> chance<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.080> could<00:02:55.200> fire<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.410> thing<00:02:55.650> up

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
a chance you could fire that thing up

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.430 
a chance you could fire that thing up
for<00:02:56.010> us<00:02:56.070> one<00:02:56.280> more<00:02:56.400> time<00:02:58.790> I<00:03:00.260> could<00:03:01.260> believe

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
for us one more time I could believe

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.880 
for us one more time I could believe
started<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.100> Stan<00:03:03.500> yeah<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> easier

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
started on that Stan yeah the easier

00:03:04.890 --> 00:04:05.220 
started on that Stan yeah the easier
understand<00:03:05.250> does<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> good<00:03:05.670> job

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.149 

I<00:04:06.659> have<00:04:07.659> more<00:04:07.870> vibration<00:04:08.470> in<00:04:08.560> my<00:04:08.590> toilet

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.410 

how<00:04:12.159> about<00:04:12.310> temperature<00:04:12.790> crisper<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.269> have

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
how about temperature crisper you have

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.910 
how about temperature crisper you have
any<00:04:13.599> cooling<00:04:13.840> problems<00:04:14.319> or<00:04:14.440> issues<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.799> worry

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
any cooling problems or issues to worry

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.550 
any cooling problems or issues to worry
about

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.780 

so<00:04:17.799> everything's<00:04:18.160> running<00:04:18.340> cool<00:04:18.579> then

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
so everything's running cool then

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.830 
so everything's running cool then
actually<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:21.639> first<00:04:21.790> time<00:04:22.030> we<00:04:22.090> fired<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.660> at

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
actually the first time we fired it at

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.570 
actually the first time we fired it at
the<00:04:22.990> engine<00:04:23.260> shop<00:04:23.440> we're<00:04:24.250> sitting<00:04:24.550> there

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
the engine shop we're sitting there

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.010 
the engine shop we're sitting there
running<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.270> know<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.690> getting<00:04:25.870> a

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
running and you know this is getting a

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.780 
running and you know this is getting a
little<00:04:26.139> warmer<00:04:26.680> there's<00:04:27.370> something<00:04:27.669> wrong

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
little warmer there's something wrong

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.790 
little warmer there's something wrong
with<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.090> temperature<00:04:28.690> gauge<00:04:28.870> but<00:04:29.139> we<00:04:29.680> got

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
with this temperature gauge but we got

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.050 
with this temperature gauge but we got
out<00:04:29.949> of<00:04:30.070> heat<00:04:30.220> gun<00:04:30.460> there's<00:04:30.669> nothing<00:04:30.910> wrong

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
out of heat gun there's nothing wrong

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.409 
out of heat gun there's nothing wrong
with<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.300> temperature<00:04:31.690> gauge<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:32.340> just

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
with the temperature gauge it just

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.610 
with the temperature gauge it just
because<00:04:34.419> when<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.720> turn<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.050> fan<00:04:35.260> on<00:04:35.290> right

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
because when you turn the fan on right

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.560 
because when you turn the fan on right
away<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.130> this<00:04:36.820> electric<00:04:37.270> water<00:04:37.449> pump

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
away and this electric water pump

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.029 
away and this electric water pump
there's<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.110> much<00:04:38.229> cooling<00:04:38.710> going<00:04:38.919> on

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
there's so much cooling going on

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.610 
there's so much cooling going on
instantly<00:04:39.820> but<00:04:40.419> it<00:04:40.660> takes<00:04:40.870> forever<00:04:41.050> for<00:04:41.289> an

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
instantly but it takes forever for an

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.670 
instantly but it takes forever for an
engine<00:04:41.949> to<00:04:41.979> get<00:04:42.160> up<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.430> heat<00:04:42.610> sounds<00:04:43.150> good

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
engine to get up to heat sounds good

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.930
