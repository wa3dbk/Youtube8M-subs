00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.029
 dmx originated around forty years ago in america 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.320
 then, but also the costs were very popular 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.779
 also with children 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.059
 she liked people so much in a simulator 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.469
 by bike 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.410
 you usually stop playing children's games when you get older, but some 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 adult friends and me through 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.730
 in the eighties it became a huge devastation and in 2008 I even became one 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.310
 olympic sport 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.300
 let's see if the bike itself 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.939
 also the development has gone through 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.880
 what if the first one stands out 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.390
 paris the bike yet so small additionally a lot smaller because this is the first one 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.719
 half must be strong 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.719
 how big their bikes will be more often there are much more flexible 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.210
 twenty a traffic jam originated from America 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.930
 keeps track of the wheels that occur from certain children's bikes 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.170
 that is for growing and there is a bike with a big will that there is 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.530
 a separate classes the cruise class 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.810
 but the twenty requirement is for big and small to always win 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.650
 the difference itself is not in the wheels but in the cattle market 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.420
 that is never possible about the height of the veteran over the length of the bike 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 especially also send stephen purposes 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.480
 And the bandwidth there are actually the most important factors with age 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.960
 back on 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.870
 the eighties competition you are not really weird when you 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.870
 what did the first bikes look like when you compare it with now 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.480
 a lot different, a lot heavier 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.600
 send the ratio much shorter much higher on license plates 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.280
 well where the jobs rose a lot of reason that i like rider in a lot 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.070
 other countries 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.770
 m all minimums they can hardly do anything so I completely different 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.770
 what is the first thing that breaks them a bike 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.790
 4 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.790
 we have very good questions, it is of course also due to maintenance 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.100
 if your bike is well maintained 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.230
 then you do have a lock up if you can take the brake pads from properties chain 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.270
 handles 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.999
 but on a job with epse 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.099
 a crash over the wrong track 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.269
 then the wheels are most vulnerable 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.269
 japan the abdominal cramps still vulnerable 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
 it the least thing in the holes 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.239
 only came after a little bmx bike 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.289
 it is also very varied 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.759
 then the kids who can start then a bike from four to five hundred 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.109
 euros 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.939
 But if we have this material or he the riders who are there at the elite 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.589
 Junior class all ride piece by piece that will have bicycles true 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.589
 on average around fifteen hundred euros or more 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.839
 and if my name is professional, I have a little too long he goes then you are 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.669
 about 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.269
 these riders who drive 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.949
 three years with a bike yourself 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.519
 and if you are a professional driver 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.909
 to be the sponsor you have to purchase everything yourself 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.790
 then that rider will not always buy a complete new bike, but that one 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.409
 would mount a new peat on a new site about a new set 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.439
 wheels 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.579
 a piece of Harry Redknapp pie 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.449
 what is really not with such definitions and 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.369
 we see 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.369
 I think you can see it displaying bright colors 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:38.299
 but just when good neighbors of the anodizing were already in place, all the minute parts 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.249
 has also come again so 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:42.649
 it all got back to this 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.290
 made a good bike also a better ride 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 better than the rest 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.629
 there is every reason not to make it better 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.810
 tis duel the boss just to start a good bike and for the bike still 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:57.130
 say he is resigning 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.389
 an overview set the gear 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.389
 that is the basis for you to be able to perform well then you can come 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.489
 take the weight off to the more expensive material 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.489
 that tells the story about the bridge coming 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.059
 the debate 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.359
 also
