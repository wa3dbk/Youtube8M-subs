00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
crate on material and that was really a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.720 
crate on material and that was really a
good<00:00:31.410> idea<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.189> flattened<00:00:32.610> out

good idea you can see it's flattened out
there<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.360> protruding<00:00:34.079> quite<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> bit<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
there it was protruding quite a bit that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.530 
there it was protruding quite a bit that
little<00:00:35.070> dimple<00:00:35.430> there<00:00:35.579> was<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> dimple<00:00:36.480> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
little dimple there was just a dimple in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.600 
little dimple there was just a dimple in
the<00:00:36.660> crate<00:00:36.870> Tom<00:00:37.110> material<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the crate Tom material it's just a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.190 
the crate Tom material it's just a
shallow<00:00:38.879> dimple<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> doesn't<00:00:40.020> really<00:00:40.110> affect

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
shallow dimple it doesn't really affect

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.650 
shallow dimple it doesn't really affect
anything<00:00:40.850> but<00:00:41.850> anyways<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.899> cut<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
anything but anyways I cut that off and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.440 
anything but anyways I cut that off and
it<00:00:45.660> makes<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.020> nice<00:00:46.170> little<00:00:46.440> thumb<00:00:46.770> rest<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.450> it
