00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:02.370
 Hey guys 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.880
 I just did a good occasion to go back to doing some kind of theft 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.440
 in the new action the ministry explained will choose 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:11.240
 bad 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.240
 you can see political highlights with a bazooka 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.200
 still little bit 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.439
 has a current park 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.320
 what do you get in photo files with songs 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.430
 through the accident has not given orders for a motorcycle type and can be 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.070
 another weber 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.310
 for people like him 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.600
 good why not give contrast is a technology that his situation 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.680
 the film that is silent when monica contract is new 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.370
 speaker 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.610
 The more business you produce that you can visualize predicts that any 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.220
 one that you have done even though you are 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.630
 is a color at the bottom of the screen has been losing 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.800
 I'll always be a kind of darker than when you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.370
 but it is low and bar television 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.510
 this is how you are hired the more unusual there the darker ones 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.850
 then in the part with this technology accounts gets decision from any with 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.140
 sister 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.020
 technology has or does not 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.120
 if you for example if you are playing doing some kind of having 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.580
 got to appeal 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.480
 here you will have to fight us at the same time 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.380
 the senator collor who does every year is correct door to door with much more 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.200
 clear and clean 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 valmor pawlack 37 years yet 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.570
 some however was not very much darling very small even with many promises 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.990
 to compare 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.970
 very small indeed 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.360
 because the bet is that the Copenhagen conference 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.680
 the psd seems to be and in the competition what is missing for you that is twitter fan 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.850
 what I've always wanted to identify 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.299
 this academic component specific component of the box 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.650
 I'd like to see if it's 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.980
 I think the cup 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.119
 He showed up 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.489
 and please 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.789
 is that there was an extremely dangerous vote 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.929
 other 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.549
 the keirrison 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.499
 let's take a button 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.189
 they are all for the art 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.159
 here this partnership is my right he commented with me that matters 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.319
 the burglar 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.670
 I can now take refuge even in the distance 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.829
 which is similar to 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.829
 I promised you did not go up front 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.139
 who's going to play a lot earlier in the day? 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.059
 as you know, I can not give you 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.549
 - it's really hot the inter does indeed 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.809
 we lack access 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.059
 whereas the convictions 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.389
 in gesture of his convictions efe bp said 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.369
 our politicians 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.369
