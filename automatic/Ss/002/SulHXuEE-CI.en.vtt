Mike Bradley from Vox and I'm standing
here<00:00:18.180> with<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.449> new<00:00:18.660> saturator<00:00:19.410> distortion

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
here with a new saturator distortion

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.890 
here with a new saturator distortion
pedal<00:00:20.369> I'm<00:00:20.910> really<00:00:21.270> excited<00:00:21.510> about<00:00:21.689> this

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
pedal I'm really excited about this

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.689 
pedal I'm really excited about this
distortion<00:00:22.470> pedal<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:22.859> not<00:00:23.160> only<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
distortion pedal because not only is the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
distortion pedal because not only is the
coolest<00:00:24.090> distortion<00:00:24.630> I've<00:00:24.750> ever<00:00:24.930> heard<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.590> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
coolest distortion I've ever heard but I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.900 
coolest distortion I've ever heard but I
had<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> pleasure<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.250> working<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.699> Joe

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
had the pleasure of working with Joe

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.000 
had the pleasure of working with Joe
Satriani<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.720> developing<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> year<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
Satriani on developing it for a year and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.640 
Satriani on developing it for a year and
a<00:00:29.070> half<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.090> let's<00:00:30.570> let's<00:00:31.140> break<00:00:31.260> into<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
a half so let's let's break into the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.520 
a half so let's let's break into the
display<00:00:32.009> case<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.489> take<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> look<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.530> this

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
display case and take a look at it this

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.600 
display case and take a look at it this
is<00:00:34.590> only<00:00:34.920> four<00:00:35.309> gear<00:00:35.489> wire<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
is only four gear wire so here it is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.180 
is only four gear wire so here it is
this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> Joe's<00:00:39.750> sound<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> actually

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
this is Joe's sound and this is actually

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.790 
this is Joe's sound and this is actually
how<00:00:41.309> Joe<00:00:41.579> sets<00:00:41.879> his<00:00:42.000> pedal<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:43.230> spent<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
how Joe sets his pedal we spent like I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.319 
how Joe sets his pedal we spent like I
said<00:00:43.980> about<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.219> year<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> half<00:00:44.760> developing

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
said about a year and a half developing

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
said about a year and a half developing
this<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.350> twenty<00:00:46.739> four<00:00:46.950> prototypes

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
this and it was twenty four prototypes

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.479 
this and it was twenty four prototypes
before<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.149> perfected<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.719> pedal<00:00:49.190> Joe<00:00:50.190> tends

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
before we perfected this pedal Joe tends

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.610 
before we perfected this pedal Joe tends
to<00:00:50.640> set<00:00:50.820> his<00:00:50.969> amps<00:00:51.210> clean<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.289> uses<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
to set his amps clean and then uses a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.709 
to set his amps clean and then uses a
pedal<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.160> his<00:00:53.280> overdrive<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.570> where

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
pedal for his overdrive so this is where

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
pedal for his overdrive so this is where
it<00:00:54.809> comes<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.680> thing<00:00:55.860> he<00:00:55.980> uses

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it comes from and this thing he uses

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.849 
it comes from and this thing he uses
this<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.699> night<00:00:57.030> long<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.660> he<00:00:57.710> used<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
this all night long and he used it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.770 
this all night long and he used it
throughout<00:00:59.160> his<00:00:59.520> new<00:00:59.670> record<00:01:00.059> professor

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.380 
features of this pedal this pedal really
rediscovers<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> great<00:01:10.530> vintage

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
rediscovers a lot of the great vintage

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.880 
rediscovers a lot of the great vintage
distortion<00:01:12.390> sounds<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.560> been<00:01:13.650> lost

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
distortion sounds that have been lost

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.649 
distortion sounds that have been lost
over<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> years<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.670> components<00:01:15.210> become<00:01:15.420> ops

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
over the years as components become ops

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.899 
over the years as components become ops
lead<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.770> forth<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
lead and so on and so forth so this is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.600 
lead and so on and so forth so this is
an<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.180> analog<00:01:18.540> unit<00:01:19.110> you've<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> on/off

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
an all analog unit you've got a on/off

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.570 
an all analog unit you've got a on/off
switch<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.540> pretty<00:01:21.840> self-explanatory

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
switch which is pretty self-explanatory

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.219 
switch which is pretty self-explanatory
lots<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.820> game<00:01:24.030> more<00:01:24.450> gain<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> lot<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
lots of game more gain that a lot of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.499 
lots of game more gain that a lot of
distortion<00:01:25.680> pedals<00:01:25.979> today<00:01:26.250> lots<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.210> volume

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
distortion pedals today lots of volume

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.090 
distortion pedals today lots of volume
because<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.170> lot<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> great<00:01:28.740> vintage

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
because a lot of the great vintage

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
because a lot of the great vintage
distortion<00:01:29.700> pedals<00:01:29.970> didn't<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.329> enough

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
distortion pedals didn't have enough

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.719 
distortion pedals didn't have enough
output<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.439> guess<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.829> even<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> more

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
output but guess what even with the more

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.219 
output but guess what even with the more
gain<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.360> volume<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> still

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
gain and the more volume it still

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.140 
gain and the more volume it still
operates<00:01:34.350> quieter<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> lot<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.030> those

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
operates quieter than a lot of those

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
operates quieter than a lot of those
other<00:01:36.180> pedals<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> key<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:37.560> Joe

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
other pedals so that was a key thing Joe

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
other pedals so that was a key thing Joe
felt<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.700> important<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.659> addition

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
felt was really important in addition

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.749 
felt was really important in addition
you've<00:01:40.290> got<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.829> cool<00:01:41.070> switch<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
you've got this really cool switch that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.539 
you've got this really cool switch that
we<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.390> decided<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> call<00:01:43.110> more<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.369> need

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
we just decided to call more if you need

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.270 
we just decided to call more if you need
a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.820> more<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.659> hit<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.990> switch<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
a little more you hit this switch and it

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.770 
a little more you hit this switch and it
works<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.030> cool<00:01:48.210> way<00:01:48.390> where<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.659> your

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
works in a really cool way where if your

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.840 
works in a really cool way where if your
games<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.320> ten<00:01:49.619> it'll<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.430> kind<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.640> boost

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
games on ten it'll just kind of boost

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.270 
games on ten it'll just kind of boost
you<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.390> well<00:01:51.600> eleven<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.470> it'll<00:01:53.100> give<00:01:53.220> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you up to well eleven and it'll give you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
you up to well eleven and it'll give you
just<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.850> cut<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.329> solo<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:55.110> your

the<00:02:43.379> gain<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.590> time

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:03.780 

that<00:02:53.700> was<00:02:53.790> good

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.819 

you<00:03:03.969> know<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.810> Morse<00:03:05.049> which<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.469> get<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> little

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
you know the Morse which I get a little

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:28.380 
you know the Morse which I get a little
bit<00:03:06.010> more<00:03:06.310> power<00:03:07.180> game

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.690 

now<00:03:28.990> if<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.230> set<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.680> games<00:03:29.890> back<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.130> little<00:03:30.460> bit

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
now if I set the games back a little bit

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.670 
now if I set the games back a little bit
for<00:03:31.450> more<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.690> some<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:31.990> Blues<00:03:32.230> tones<00:03:32.530> I

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
for more of some of the Blues tones I

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.050 
for more of some of the Blues tones I
like<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.980> play<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.220> could<00:03:33.459> really<00:03:33.700> roll<00:03:33.880> off

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
like the play I could really roll off

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:45.510 
like the play I could really roll off
the<00:03:34.090> bottom<00:03:34.720> clean<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.650> up

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.910 

think<00:03:46.090> about<00:03:46.270> this<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:47.050> this<00:03:47.350> position

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
think about this is in this position

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.380 
think about this is in this position
when<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.100> hit<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> more<00:03:48.610> switch<00:03:48.910> at<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.090> gain

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
when I hit the more switch at the gain

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.200 
when I hit the more switch at the gain
12<00:03:49.960> o'clock<00:03:50.320> or<00:03:50.530> under<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.010> reacts<00:03:51.760> as<00:03:51.970> if<00:03:52.000> I

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
12 o'clock or under it reacts as if I

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.850 
12 o'clock or under it reacts as if I
put<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> gain<00:03:52.720> on<00:03:52.750> 12<00:03:53.200> without<00:03:53.530> having<00:03:53.770> to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
put the gain on 12 without having to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.020 
put the gain on 12 without having to
bend<00:03:53.980> down<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.160> turn<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.520> pot<00:03:54.670> turn<00:03:54.910> the
