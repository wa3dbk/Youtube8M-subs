I<00:00:08.150> acquired<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.389> plan<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:10.049> five<00:00:10.290> years

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
I acquired this plan about five years

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.810 
I acquired this plan about five years
ago<00:00:10.680> on<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.369> gallon<00:00:11.760> container<00:00:12.650> it<00:00:13.650> was<00:00:13.860> not

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
ago on the gallon container it was not

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.600 
ago on the gallon container it was not
doing<00:00:15.000> too<00:00:15.270> well<00:00:16.460> so<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> put<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:19.610> giant

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
doing too well so I put it in this giant

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.260 
doing too well so I put it in this giant
pot<00:00:21.170> to<00:00:22.170> make<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.500> more<00:00:22.620> healthier<00:00:23.220> let<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
pot to make it more healthier let it

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.660 
pot to make it more healthier let it
grow<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.450> little<00:00:24.660> bit<00:00:24.840> more<00:00:25.050> before<00:00:25.320> working<00:00:26.250> on

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
grow a little bit more before working on

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.590 
grow a little bit more before working on
it<00:00:26.940> as<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.120> bonsai<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.550> plan<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.789> probably<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
it as a bonsai the plan was probably a

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.260 
it as a bonsai the plan was probably a
thick<00:00:31.530> as<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.710> pencil<00:00:32.039> when<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> first<00:00:32.879> acquire

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
thick as a pencil when I first acquire

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.420 
thick as a pencil when I first acquire
it<00:00:33.480> now<00:00:34.379> it's<00:00:34.560> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.770> bit<00:00:34.890> thicker

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it now it's a little bit thicker

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.920 
it now it's a little bit thicker
not<00:00:35.970> too<00:00:36.210> much<00:00:36.360> thicker<00:00:36.720> but<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.470> is<00:00:37.650> and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
not too much thicker but it is and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
not too much thicker but it is and
actually<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.560> old<00:00:40.739> green<00:00:41.190> bark<00:00:41.550> when

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
actually you had the old green bark when

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.810 
actually you had the old green bark when
I<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.200> similar<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:44.160> green<00:00:44.579> color

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I got it similar to this all green color

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.069 
I got it similar to this all green color
and<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.380> got<00:00:46.500> older<00:00:47.660> becoming<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.840> this

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and now as it got older becoming on this

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.900 
and now as it got older becoming on this
kind<00:00:49.290> of<00:00:49.350> woody<00:00:50.070> brown<00:00:50.670> color<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.489> it's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
kind of woody brown color so now it's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.049 
kind of woody brown color so now it's
actually<00:00:54.180> early<00:00:54.510> March<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.969> know

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
actually early March this is you know

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.780 
actually early March this is you know
perfect<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.719> early<00:00:58.559> spring<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.550> just

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
perfect of early spring and this is just

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.049 
perfect of early spring and this is just
perfect<00:01:00.000> time<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.629> repot<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.890> plant<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
perfect time to repot this plant do a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.020 
perfect time to repot this plant do a
heavy<00:01:03.329> root<00:01:03.660> trimming<00:01:04.309> top<00:01:05.309> pruning<00:01:05.790> heavy

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
heavy root trimming top pruning heavy

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.989 
heavy root trimming top pruning heavy
top<00:01:06.299> pruning<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.869> trying<00:01:07.499> to<00:01:07.679> style<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.369> for

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:08.999 
top pruning and trying to style it for

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:11.840 
top pruning and trying to style it for
the<00:01:09.090> first<00:01:09.329> time<00:01:09.569> as<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.490> how<00:01:11.670> where

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the first time as I don't know how where

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.929 
the first time as I don't know how where
you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.389> by<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> bird<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.380> buds<00:01:13.939> have

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you can see by the bird the buds have

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.749 
you can see by the bird the buds have
started<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.539> swell<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.259> grow<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
started to swell and grow this is the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
started to swell and grow this is the
perfect<00:01:17.969> time<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.539> do<00:01:18.749> this<00:01:18.899> you<00:01:19.139> want<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
perfect time to do this you want do this

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.940 
perfect time to do this you want do this
now<00:01:20.340> or<00:01:20.969> even<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.539> little<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.810> before<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.829> know

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
now or even a little bit before you know

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.249 
now or even a little bit before you know
but<00:01:23.159> never<00:01:23.700> too<00:01:24.029> late<00:01:24.270> once<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.869> bus-stop

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
but never too late once the bus-stop

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.349 
but never too late once the bus-stop
opening<00:01:25.709> now<00:01:26.219> all<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> tender<00:01:26.789> shoots<00:01:26.999> coming

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
opening now all the tender shoots coming

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.910 
opening now all the tender shoots coming
out<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.990> wouldn't<00:01:28.289> be<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> good<00:01:28.469> time<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
out that wouldn't be a good time to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.389 
out that wouldn't be a good time to
repot<00:01:30.139> my<00:01:31.139> plan<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.469> attack<00:01:31.679> will<00:01:32.039> be<00:01:32.069> quite

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
repot my plan of attack will be quite

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.809 
repot my plan of attack will be quite
simple<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:33.599> reduce<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:35.219> height<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
simple is to reduce the height of the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.949 
simple is to reduce the height of the
plant<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:37.340> find<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.429> new<00:01:38.579> apex<00:01:39.029> and<00:01:39.299> on

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
plant you know find a new apex and on

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:40.999 
plant you know find a new apex and on
the<00:01:40.109> stuff<00:01:40.319> of<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.529> sides

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the stuff of the sides

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.010 
the stuff of the sides
I<00:01:41.099> had<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.459> drastically<00:01:42.149> reduce<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.569> width

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
I had to drastically reduce the width

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.010 
I had to drastically reduce the width
now<00:01:43.709> maybe<00:01:44.039> make<00:01:44.219> it<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.639> very<00:01:44.700> close<00:01:45.630> very

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
now maybe make it all very close very

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.580 
now maybe make it all very close very
short<00:01:46.529> so<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.219> have<00:01:47.429> a<00:01:47.459> kind<00:01:48.029> of<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.469> more<00:01:49.469> or<00:01:49.560> less

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
short so I have a kind of a more or less

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.819 
short so I have a kind of a more or less
straight<00:01:50.219> trunk<00:01:50.689> with<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.709> bit<00:01:52.799> of

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
straight trunk with a little bit of

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.629 
straight trunk with a little bit of
branches<00:01:53.459> coming<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.119> each<00:01:54.149> side<00:01:55.639> okay

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
branches coming out on each side okay

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.920 
branches coming out on each side okay
for<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:56.909> new<00:01:57.029> apex<00:01:57.539> I<00:01:57.840> found<00:01:58.169> this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
for the new apex I found this

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.710 
for the new apex I found this
well<00:01:59.500> that's<00:01:59.680> about<00:01:59.890> 1/3<00:02:03.150> maybe<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:04.540> still

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
well that's about 1/3 maybe it is still

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.640 
well that's about 1/3 maybe it is still
too<00:02:04.990> tall<00:02:05.260> I<00:02:05.620> think

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.210 

I<00:02:11.709> don't<00:02:12.370> know<00:02:12.689> let's<00:02:13.689> cut<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.019> first<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.560> if

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
I don't know let's cut this first and if

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
I don't know let's cut this first and if
I<00:02:15.340> change<00:02:15.549> my<00:02:15.640> mind<00:02:15.790> we<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.269> always<00:02:16.540> go<00:02:17.140> lower

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.940 

hmm<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.390> know<00:02:24.510> even<00:02:24.990> after<00:02:25.110> cutting<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.650> top

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
hmm you know even after cutting that top

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.880 
hmm you know even after cutting that top
off<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.580> feel<00:02:27.540> still<00:02:27.900> too<00:02:28.170> tall<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:30.620> mean<00:02:31.620> looks

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
off I feel still too tall I mean looks

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.650 
off I feel still too tall I mean looks
nice<00:02:33.830> but<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.310> think<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.670> need<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.060> cut<00:02:36.300> further

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
nice but I think I need to cut further

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.310 
nice but I think I need to cut further
down<00:02:38.120> yeah<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.420> was<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:39.750> actually<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:40.110> very

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
down yeah this was this actually a very

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.110 
down yeah this was this actually a very
nice<00:02:40.500> cut<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> perfect<00:02:41.790> angle

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
nice cut and this is the perfect angle

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.690 
nice cut and this is the perfect angle
for<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.690> branch<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.320> grow<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.430> new

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
for this branch to grow to be the new

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.120 
for this branch to grow to be the new
apex<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.600> just<00:02:45.750> too<00:02:45.960> tall<00:02:46.200> thumbi

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
apex but it's just too tall thumbi

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.730 
apex but it's just too tall thumbi
reduce<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.700> further<00:02:47.880> more<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.630> after<00:02:49.260> careful

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
reduce it further more and after careful

00:02:49.740 --> 00:03:00.400 
reduce it further more and after careful
examination<00:02:55.520> make<00:02:56.520> this<00:02:56.670> cut<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.900> here<00:02:58.200> first

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
examination make this cut up here first

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.070 
examination make this cut up here first
that's<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.590> little<00:03:02.040> tiny<00:03:02.370> branch<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.510> my<00:03:03.720> you

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
that's a little tiny branch in my you

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.590 
that's a little tiny branch in my you
might<00:03:04.320> take<00:03:04.590> over<00:03:04.770> for<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.790> new<00:03:05.970> way<00:03:06.360> there

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
might take over for the new way there

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.900 
might take over for the new way there
okay<00:03:07.020> once<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.530> apex<00:03:07.860> has<00:03:08.010> been<00:03:08.280> decided<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
okay once the apex has been decided the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
okay once the apex has been decided the
rest<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.240> fairly<00:03:09.480> easy<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:10.020> mean<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.530> plan<00:03:10.800> and

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
rest is fairly easy I mean this plan and

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.340 
rest is fairly easy I mean this plan and
it's<00:03:11.670> been<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.090> training<00:03:12.510> part<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.080> did

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
it's been this training part I did

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.070 
it's been this training part I did
annual<00:03:14.100> maintenance<00:03:14.340> pruning<00:03:14.910> every<00:03:15.360> every

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
annual maintenance pruning every every

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.890 
annual maintenance pruning every every
year<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.710> it<00:03:17.280> doesn't<00:03:17.640> have<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:18.540> know<00:03:18.660> any

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
year so it doesn't have you know any

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.800 
year so it doesn't have you know any
major<00:03:19.440> crossing<00:03:20.100> branches<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.060> stuff<00:03:21.660> like

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
major crossing branches and stuff like

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.200 
major crossing branches and stuff like
that<00:03:22.020> so<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:23.010> less<00:03:23.340> work<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.640> do<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.090> just

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
that so I have less work to do I just

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.530 
that so I have less work to do I just
need<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.920> reduce<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.760> width<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.270> plant

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
need to reduce the width of the plant

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.800 
need to reduce the width of the plant
and<00:03:27.959> try<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.200> find<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.500> place<00:03:29.480> where<00:03:30.480> there's

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
and try to find a place where there's

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.290 
and try to find a place where there's
some<00:03:30.959> kind<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.200> new<00:03:31.350> buck<00:03:31.560> coming<00:03:31.830> out<00:03:32.300> for

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
some kind of new buck coming out for

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.830 
some kind of new buck coming out for
that<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.570> be<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.930> new<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.980> new<00:03:35.570> point<00:03:36.570> for

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
that to be the new the new point for

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.050 
that to be the new the new point for
each<00:03:36.989> branch<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:38.220> know

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.960 

for<00:03:41.450> example<00:03:41.750> over<00:03:41.900> here<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:46.670> know<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:46.790> have

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
for example over here you know I have

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.390 
for example over here you know I have
this<00:03:47.090> nice<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.420> long<00:03:48.140> branch<00:03:48.500> over<00:03:48.890> here<00:03:49.040> but

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
this nice and long branch over here but

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.910 
this nice and long branch over here but
I<00:03:49.610> don't<00:03:50.120> need<00:03:50.390> all<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:50.750> for<00:03:51.080> my<00:03:51.470> new<00:03:51.590> design

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
I don't need all this for my new design

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.650 
I don't need all this for my new design
it's<00:03:52.190> going<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.400> be<00:03:52.519> fairly<00:03:53.060> close<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.569> the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
it's going to be fairly close to the

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.350 
it's going to be fairly close to the
trend<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.140> for<00:03:54.319> now<00:03:54.550> you<00:03:55.550> know<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.700> just<00:03:56.030> cut<00:03:56.239> it

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
trend so for now you know I just cut it

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.780 
trend so for now you know I just cut it
out<00:03:56.540> cut<00:03:56.810> it<00:03:56.870> somewhere<00:03:57.440> here<00:04:00.670> for<00:04:01.670> this

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
out cut it somewhere here for this

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.210 
out cut it somewhere here for this
branch<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.480> couldn't<00:04:02.989> find<00:04:03.230> any<00:04:03.470> any<00:04:03.739> good<00:04:04.010> but

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
branch I couldn't find any any good but

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.949 
branch I couldn't find any any good but
so<00:04:04.670> I'm<00:04:04.849> going<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.120> let<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.269> extend<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.810> little

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
so I'm going to let it extend a little

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.350 
so I'm going to let it extend a little
bit<00:04:06.170> more<00:04:06.530> little<00:04:07.430> bit<00:04:07.549> longer<00:04:07.760> than<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.120> want

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
bit more little bit longer than I want

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.820 
bit more little bit longer than I want
it<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.750> just<00:04:09.019> cut<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:09.260> here<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.989> then<00:04:15.739> you

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
it and just cut it here and then you

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.640 
it and just cut it here and then you
just<00:04:16.010> trim<00:04:16.250> trim<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.850> tips<00:04:17.269> off<00:04:17.540> here<00:04:17.989> all<00:04:18.440> of

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
just trim trim the tips off here all of

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.550 
just trim trim the tips off here all of
this<00:04:18.799> minor<00:04:19.040> branches<00:04:20.049> same<00:04:21.049> thing<00:04:21.290> here<00:04:21.530> for

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
this minor branches same thing here for

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.580 
this minor branches same thing here for
this<00:04:21.829> big<00:04:22.400> branch<00:04:22.729> which<00:04:23.660> extend<00:04:24.080> very<00:04:24.260> long

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
this big branch which extend very long

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.680 
this big branch which extend very long
just<00:04:25.490> find<00:04:25.729> this<00:04:25.910> okay<00:04:26.150> this<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.419> going<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.630> be

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
just find this okay this is going to be

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.710 
just find this okay this is going to be
the<00:04:26.810> new<00:04:27.520> new<00:04:28.520> tip<00:04:29.360> for<00:04:29.630> this<00:04:29.810> branch<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:30.800> oh<00:04:31.720> I

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
the new new tip for this branch so oh I

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:41.760 
the new new tip for this branch so oh I
need<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:32.960> heavier<00:04:33.350> cutter

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.400 

so<00:04:42.280> by<00:04:42.520> applying<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.330> same<00:04:43.509> principle<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.199> go

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
so by applying the same principle I go

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.200 
so by applying the same principle I go
through<00:04:44.650> every<00:04:44.919> single<00:04:45.069> branch<00:04:45.460> every<00:04:46.030> sub

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
through every single branch every sub

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.860 
through every single branch every sub
branch<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.900> make<00:04:47.889> a<00:04:47.919> cut<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:49.449> key

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
branch and make a cut the the the key

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.749 
branch and make a cut the the the key
here<00:04:50.139> is<00:04:50.169> you<00:04:50.530> have<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.830> give<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:51.250> plant<00:04:51.490> some

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
here is you have to give the plant some

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.640 
here is you have to give the plant some
hope<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.539> know<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:52.720> want<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:52.900> cut<00:04:53.139> where<00:04:53.410> a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
hope you know you want to cut where a

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.370 
hope you know you want to cut where a
new<00:04:53.860> growth<00:04:54.160> is<00:04:54.400> coming<00:04:54.550> out<00:04:54.819> right<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.380> right

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
new growth is coming out right and right

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.790 
new growth is coming out right and right
you<00:04:56.979> know<00:04:57.569> after<00:04:58.569> a<00:04:58.720> new<00:04:58.960> growth<00:04:59.259> is<00:04:59.440> coming

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
you know after a new growth is coming

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.279 
you know after a new growth is coming
out<00:04:59.949> so<00:05:00.699> that<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.240> plant<00:05:01.509> has<00:05:01.660> hope<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.169> it

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
out so that the plant has hope and it

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.680 
out so that the plant has hope and it
has<00:05:02.650> some<00:05:02.830> kind<00:05:02.949> of<00:05:03.069> life<00:05:03.280> but<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:03.940> you

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
has some kind of life but and you

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.290 
has some kind of life but and you
continue<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.229> grow<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:06.550> if<00:05:06.849> you<00:05:06.940> just<00:05:07.120> got

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
continue to grow so if you just got

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.089 
continue to grow so if you just got
right<00:05:07.479> right<00:05:07.840> in<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:07.990> middle<00:05:08.199> you<00:05:08.440> know<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
right right in the middle you know the

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.589 
right right in the middle you know the
plant<00:05:09.370> had<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.639> work<00:05:09.789> extra<00:05:10.090> hard<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.419> come<00:05:10.569> up

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
plant had to work extra hard to come up

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.020 
plant had to work extra hard to come up
with<00:05:10.750> new<00:05:10.930> buds<00:05:11.229> so<00:05:11.830> easier<00:05:12.250> if<00:05:12.430> you<00:05:12.610> just<00:05:12.819> find

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
with new buds so easier if you just find

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.960 
with new buds so easier if you just find
a<00:05:13.180> place<00:05:13.360> for<00:05:13.840> this<00:05:13.990> about<00:05:14.289> coming<00:05:14.650> out<00:05:14.770> and

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
a place for this about coming out and

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.249 
a place for this about coming out and
just<00:05:15.970> you<00:05:16.479> know<00:05:17.490> cut<00:05:18.490> after<00:05:18.669> that<00:05:19.000> so<00:05:19.419> and

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
just you know cut after that so and

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.240 
just you know cut after that so and
there<00:05:21.009> after<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.759> initial<00:05:22.270> pruning<00:05:23.130> you<00:05:24.130> know

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
there after the initial pruning you know

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.939 
there after the initial pruning you know
I<00:05:24.280> think<00:05:24.460> this<00:05:24.669> is<00:05:24.849> as<00:05:25.060> much<00:05:25.330> as<00:05:25.569> I<00:05:25.690> want<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:25.960> do

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.580 

of<00:05:29.949> course<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.490> doesn't<00:05:30.849> look<00:05:31.150> very<00:05:31.449> nice<00:05:32.199> as<00:05:32.560> a

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
of course I doesn't look very nice as a

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.230 
of course I doesn't look very nice as a
bonsai<00:05:33.009> shape<00:05:33.310> yet<00:05:33.550> this<00:05:33.669> is<00:05:33.819> just<00:05:33.849> the<00:05:34.090> first

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
bonsai shape yet this is just the first

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.570 
bonsai shape yet this is just the first
tiling<00:05:34.840> so<00:05:35.020> I<00:05:35.050> don't<00:05:35.259> want<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.470> overwork<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.490> I

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
tiling so I don't want to overwork it I

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.540 
tiling so I don't want to overwork it I
just<00:05:36.639> at<00:05:36.940> least<00:05:37.440> give<00:05:38.440> it<00:05:38.470> a<00:05:38.710> basic<00:05:39.130> initial

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
just at least give it a basic initial

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.899 
just at least give it a basic initial
shape<00:05:40.030> first<00:05:43.500> you<00:05:44.500> can<00:05:44.680> always<00:05:44.800> make<00:05:45.639> it<00:05:45.699> more

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909 
shape first you can always make it more

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.589 
shape first you can always make it more
perfect<00:05:46.180> in<00:05:46.630> subsequent<00:05:47.139> years<00:05:48.330> never<00:05:49.330> in<00:05:49.539> a

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
perfect in subsequent years never in a

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.780 
perfect in subsequent years never in a
hurry
