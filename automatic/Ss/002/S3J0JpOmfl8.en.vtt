00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.740
 so hello to all but always with 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.870
 his mother yahoo from sony mobile 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.330
 community suffering and we're going to 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.430
 talk about the line up of sony this year 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.869
 for the year 2012 and so we will 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.480
 start immediately by the question on 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.050
 the number of terminals since since 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.560
 January and the Danes have to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.720
 experience 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 sony announced many terminals I 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.750
 believe that now we are at 9 6 me 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.699
 remember are good so do you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 can tell us a little more about 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.640
 nine terminals and in particular on the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 differentiation between each product 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.790
 for consumers we start on 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.170
 finds besides anyway on 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 consumers and tools 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 do not think it's a joke disturbs 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.120
 still so a lot of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.820
 questions in a single question in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.730
 white so I'll try to answer them 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 synthetic way our products offer 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 this year revolves around three 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.760
 products that are key to us in everything 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.850
 case for the first semester 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.309
 so these products there are the xperia s 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.050
 the xperia play xperia useful are the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.409
 three products that marks the arrival of 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.369
 sony in the smartphone market 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.320
 then we have a number of 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.619
 products that come to address 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.200
 needs like like the xperia mini rolls 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.670
 experia typo is also the experience 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.880
 go that are products that wants the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.899
 tradition the for to complete a 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.140
 range actually 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:31.140
 two products that are emblematic 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 for sony so we have it with experience 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 is hoping to hope amirouche laÃ¯di where we 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.990
 is more about products 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.560
 we will say that they have targeted me and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.720
 earlier targets first-time buyers and then 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 for us in terms of communication 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.159
 in terms of brands in terms 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.079
 investments xperia products 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.899
 leaves xperia play xperia husson 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.250
 fundamental products and so if you tell me 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.899
 files is a little the product that goes 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.799
 to what consumer would it give 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.429
 what for the s 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.880
 no actually the xperia ray it's a 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.610
 product with big screen 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.860
 dual-core processor enormously 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.569
 memory so here we see more this 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.030
 product was addressing I produced by 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.290
 the geeks but we will say his needs 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.340
 Personal upscale by that is a 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.959
 high-end phone this is a 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.849
 phone that targets a target who 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.110
 is comfortable with the technology that is 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.540
 comfortable with the world of smartphones 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.920
 and so 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.660
 so here is the experience there the target 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.099
 is pretty clear then on the xperia pc 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.690
 a product that is who and while 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.140
 aluminum we're going to be on a target 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.480
 little more we'll say larch big 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.330
 public since if we produce with a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.349
 4-inch dual-core screen also 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.030
 but who say they have a 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.640
 8 megapixel sensor a little bit less 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.540
 of data but it's a product with 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.799
 its design and the aluminum that will come 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.420
 targeted people who are going to be more 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.000
 sensitive to design is more sensitive 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.299
 together we will say the statutory 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.880
 mobile finally the xperia huet a product 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.260
 with a smaller screen we are on a 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.190
 3 inches a tale also on him two 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.319
 blockers and a number of 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.569
 specifications that are we will say 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.799
 hygienic 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.870
 for these smartphones but here we 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.390
 is on one on one on a smartphone that 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.140
 going that will target people who 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.900
 will be more sensitive to the sides we are going 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.920
 say design since this product is going 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.870
 to personalize it 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.030
 you have the bar the famous bar 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.980
 transparent to close this barcamp during 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.550
 that to be able to change color we have 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.720
 it's more an accessory we'll say 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.630
 we will be able to customize all 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.480
 days that a simple so an agreement is so 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.950
 now are at the software part 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.090
 so android by sony what's that 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.790
 give or go buy yourself some 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.340
 software 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.690
 so since forever memories 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.540
 exxon memories once sony mobile 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.490
 since the beginning of the year has enormously 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.990
 invested in all these small 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.280
 applications and data all and its 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.300
 small interface that will allow 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.930
 to improve we will say the experience 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.760
 user whether it's integration of 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.420
 facebook in android whether it's 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.590
 the album app 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.239
 the movie app and the app 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.549
 walkman whose who is new reader of 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.410
 music that I introduced you all to 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.850
 time on the xperia lyon this is it 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.410
 a number of small 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.330
 applications continue to develop 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.600
 bodies now let's go to the updates 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.220
 day 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.240
 so you have some of your gain 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.020
 which starts now and this to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.639
 registrations of 8 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.440
 there is djelic has been announced you have some 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.980
 ideas about the square countess for the 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.180
 updates and if it comes to a 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.030
 moment I can nothing you communicated 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.169
 specifies that what I know is 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.310
 that we have the best of a press release 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.979
 pretty precise things because she's 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.030
 actually your readers and all 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.470
 smartphone users in general 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.479
 are very sensitive to this point of detail 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.669
 who is not one who is not one 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.130
 since actually with all 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.350
 these updates to have new 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.020
 features so 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.840
 in the same way as between 2011 and 2012 we 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.230
 has invested a lot to have the 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.060
 latest version of android possible on 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.400
 many determining number we will invest 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.080
 we are trying to recover 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.930
 so working on the 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.480
 jelly bean version will communicate you soon 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.700
 more accurate dates and products 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.540
 of a fault of two points of his art to 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.800
 the go in that return they will have 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.470
 many screens that are growing 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.330
 large number in plexi s3 which culminates in 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.800
 Someone they all have the same 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.970
 galaxy note who is two who has announced 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.830
 with the holy tables or three layers 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.600
 you take in morals you you 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.060
 stayed at some 2.6 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.960
 inches and I believe well with Spain 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.150
 arrival you presented 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.220
 you have plans to go yet 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.230
 more in greatness is what you 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.700
 think it's justified or what is 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.200
 your position as it is on 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.290
 the screens size more and more 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.360
 great so I can answer you from 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.470
 several Indian men the first of 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.520
 things would you say that today the 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.630
 best-selling smartphone 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.690
 maybe on the French market is 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.300
 maybe a 3.5 inch screen so I 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.449
 begin there and I would say 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.159
 also that we have 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.659
 goals and plans for 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.939
 improve the user experience for 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.159
 have screens that they are who 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:16.330
 allow to restore at best 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.379
 especially the internet pages and 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.439
 especially to the video experience 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:22.349
 now at heart at sony's so 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:26.169
 for the moment we are at 4 inches 6 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:28.620
 actually sure safe sure this year 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.699
 on this second half 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.529
 I can not reveal anything to you for the 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.689
 moment but we study in any case one 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.699
 of them one of their priority is 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:40.210
 really trying to have a screen that 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:42.339
 be adapted in terms of use and 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.629
 who is best able to have a 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:46.150
 user experience that is the 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.969
 more comfortable but in any case thank you 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.289

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.419
 information about that in the months to 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.680
 come in and we find ourselves very quickly 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.060
 for other videos on accessories 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.060
 and associated software
