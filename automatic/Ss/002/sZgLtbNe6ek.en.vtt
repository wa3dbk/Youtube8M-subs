00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
sure that you change the location back

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.010 
sure that you change the location back
to<00:01:34.290> about<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> other<00:01:35.250> canine<00:01:35.729> area<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.299> then

to about the other canine area and then
continue<00:01:37.650> posteriorly<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.549> reach<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.480 

this<00:01:45.600> technique<00:01:46.820> means<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.659> more

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
this technique means that there is more

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.550 
this technique means that there is more
manipulation<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.149> area<00:01:51.600> where<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.320> bony

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
manipulation in this area where the bony

manipulation in this area where the bony
contact<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.369> reached<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> main

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
contact is reached but the main

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170 
contact is reached but the main
advantage<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:56.100> indirect<00:01:56.729> technique

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
advantage of the indirect technique

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.950 
advantage of the indirect technique
which<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.869> called<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
which this is called is that the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.569 
which this is called is that the
anatomical<00:02:00.960> location<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:02.130> secure

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
anatomical location is more secure

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.359 
anatomical location is more secure
because<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.750> contour<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> bone<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
because the contour of the bone is

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
because the contour of the bone is
followed<00:02:05.939> more<00:02:06.119> closely<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.960> this

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
followed more closely with this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.249 
followed more closely with this
technique<00:02:07.729> when<00:02:08.729> using<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.300> ref'<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
technique when using the ref' a is the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.910 
technique when using the ref' a is the
only<00:02:10.470> anatomical<00:02:11.280> landmark

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
only anatomical landmark

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.550 
only anatomical landmark
and<00:02:12.010> this<00:02:13.000> anatomical<00:02:13.450> landmark<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.260> missed

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and this anatomical landmark is missed

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.640 
and this anatomical landmark is missed
then<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:16.000> location<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> anesthetic<00:02:17.380> is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
then the location of the anesthetic is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.420 
then the location of the anesthetic is
much<00:02:17.950> more<00:02:18.220> uncertain<00:02:19.200> sometime<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.860> certain
