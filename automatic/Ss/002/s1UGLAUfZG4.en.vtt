00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.509 
performer 37 36 thousand Lux at 1 meter
and<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.460> shadow<00:00:26.760> SL<00:00:27.269> 3<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.140> triple<00:00:28.680> XML

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and the shadow SL 3 is the triple XML

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.749 
and the shadow SL 3 is the triple XML
this<00:00:30.150> thing<00:00:30.390> puts<00:00:30.689> out<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.320> massive<00:00:32.309> amount<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
this thing puts out a massive amount of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.580 
this thing puts out a massive amount of
light<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> fifteen<00:00:34.530> hundred

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
light I think it's a fifteen hundred

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.660 
light I think it's a fifteen hundred
lumens<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.190> made<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> wrong

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
lumens so this one is made for the wrong

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.040 
lumens so this one is made for the wrong
one<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.090> made<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.390> flooding<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:39.840> really

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
one is made for flooding I'm really

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
one is made for flooding I'm really
liking<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> SL<00:00:40.680> three<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.430> great

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
liking the SL three because it's a great

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
liking the SL three because it's a great
overall<00:00:42.090> light<00:00:42.620> it's<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> first<00:00:43.920> time<00:00:44.010> I'm

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
overall light it's the first time I'm

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
overall light it's the first time I'm
gonna<00:00:44.280> show<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.730> s<00:00:45.120> are<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.930> JM<00:00:46.200> 26<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
gonna show the s are the JM 26 which is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:01:01.139 
gonna show the s are the JM 26 which is
the<00:00:47.070> thrower<00:00:48.770> here<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> is

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.240 

so<00:01:01.960> again<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.289> bucket<00:01:02.620> out<00:01:02.680> there<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.039> 200

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
so again that bucket out there is 200

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.979 
so again that bucket out there is 200
feet<00:01:03.520> and<00:01:03.760> then<00:01:04.119> there's<00:01:04.299> a<00:01:04.360> tree<00:01:04.540> line<00:01:04.720> above

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
feet and then there's a tree line above

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.899 
feet and then there's a tree line above
it<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:06.010> 430<00:01:06.850> feet<00:01:07.390> away<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.790> is<00:01:09.850> a

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
it that is 430 feet away so this is a

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.039 
it that is 430 feet away so this is a
very<00:01:10.119> good<00:01:10.270> thrower<00:01:10.770> nice<00:01:12.810> wide<00:01:13.810> diameter

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
very good thrower nice wide diameter

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.590 
very good thrower nice wide diameter
deep<00:01:14.799> reflector<00:01:15.400> so<00:01:15.759> it's<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.299> pretty<00:01:16.509> good

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
deep reflector so it's a pretty good

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.910 
deep reflector so it's a pretty good
performer<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.540> up<00:01:19.869> next<00:01:20.290> I'm<00:01:20.680> gonna<00:01:20.830> be

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
performer and up next I'm gonna be

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.520 
performer and up next I'm gonna be
showing<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.369> shadow<00:01:21.850> SL<00:01:22.810> 3<00:01:23.050> again<00:01:23.290> this<00:01:23.409> is

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
showing the shadow SL 3 again this is

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.380 
showing the shadow SL 3 again this is
the<00:01:23.619> triple<00:01:23.860> xml<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:24.790> gonna<00:01:25.030> probably

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
the triple xml so it's gonna probably

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.990 
the triple xml so it's gonna probably
flood<00:01:25.869> everything<00:01:26.680> from<00:01:26.950> here<00:01:27.250> down<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.520> 200

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
flood everything from here down to 200

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.249 
flood everything from here down to 200
feet<00:01:28.119> and<00:01:28.180> maybe<00:01:28.450> not<00:01:28.659> reach<00:01:28.780> farther<00:01:29.050> than

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
feet and maybe not reach farther than

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.260 
feet and maybe not reach farther than
that<00:01:29.470> but<00:01:29.710> it's<00:01:29.860> 50<00:01:30.610> hundred<00:01:30.880> lumens<00:01:31.149> at<00:01:31.240> a

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
that but it's 50 hundred lumens at a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.510 
that but it's 50 hundred lumens at a
very<00:01:31.509> compact<00:01:31.990> package<00:01:32.290> so<00:01:33.130> here's<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
very compact package so here's the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.600 
very compact package so here's the
shadow<00:01:33.880> SL<00:01:34.270> 3<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:40.030> expected<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.039> very<00:01:42.310> good

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
shadow SL 3 as expected it's a very good

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.600 
shadow SL 3 as expected it's a very good
area<00:01:42.880> light<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.830> does<00:01:45.039> have<00:01:45.250> some<00:01:45.280> throw

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
area light and it does have some throw

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.219 
area light and it does have some throw
to<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.909> so<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.390> can't<00:01:46.630> see<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.869> bucket<00:01:47.140> out

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
to it so I can't see the bucket out

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.249 
to it so I can't see the bucket out
there<00:01:47.409> very<00:01:47.649> well<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.899> basically<00:01:49.899> everything

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
there very well and basically everything

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.840 
there very well and basically everything
in<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.619> viewfinder<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.159> I'm<00:01:51.369> seeing<00:01:51.580> here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
in the viewfinder that I'm seeing here

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.440 
in the viewfinder that I'm seeing here
is<00:01:52.110> well<00:01:53.110> lit<00:01:53.319> up<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.819> same<00:01:55.030> as<00:01:55.210> what<00:01:55.330> I'm
