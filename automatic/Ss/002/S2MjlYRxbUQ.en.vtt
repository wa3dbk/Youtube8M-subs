 very 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.909
 Considerable Knaup measurements is very small camouflage relatively 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:17.560
 Compact cut one would say many connections at the back around 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.730
 At the bottom there is a new standard thread for a tripod 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.249
 Foot around this is also urgently needed to keep the projector flexible 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.480
 to be able to put up the little Schüßler a what is built around 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.480
 does not cause a good positioning 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.370
 Another criticism of the power supply that must always be included when 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.100
 you want to take the projector of the otherwise very portable is around 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.450
 at the back we see the hdmi input minibus br despite percent 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.810
 to insert a usb-stick example the money MVG connection and also 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.250
 Sound can spend the percent more intimate 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.580
 I'm here at a tripod Ostermann situated in a small 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580
 Netbook operated 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.240
 Rainer Blum brings the Bima up very well 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.720
 Daylight operates 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.770
 Fr 2, you can slowly see the room and that is the natural light stronger 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.930
 At last it becomes more and more contrasting in spite of which one feels well 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.910
 office life 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.360
 in daylight he is in normal office space at normal 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.630
 Use lighting conditions 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.560
 There are still different configurations around the picture percentage too 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.630
 optimize 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.110
 The positioning of course plays a big role in placing the device 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.530
 far away from a band on which you want to project the image to a parent 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.350
 larger screen diagonal loses of course luminosity 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.320
 The same goes for the fact that the incubation times of devices ten rock very noticeably 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.679
 Seconds around 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.059
 are percent excellent values ​​you press the off switch again that is 

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:55.500
 Device down in two seconds 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.980
 by the percent the fans would have been good to still the device stays 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.350
 silent with percent 30% DB Latif 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.360
 the whole application is done via an enclosed remote control that is 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.830
 very helpful if you go back to the Busby Port history 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.230
