00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.400
 hello friends how are my name is 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.200
 joanne and from today I want 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.000
 share with you a series of 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.000
 messages about topics that are in the 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.119
 bible the theme that I want to share today 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.190
 is the next can god forgive 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.859
 any sin even if it's a sin 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.090
 we consider great good Bible 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.370
 yes tells us that God can forgive 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.310
 but there is something we have to do 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.890
 first and it is to repent of the heart 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.980
 that is , recognize that what we did 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.050
 it was wrong and that offends God and if 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.050
 we have not done it yet 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.410
 ask Jesus to be our savior 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.290
 and that enter our lives these 3 19 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.360
 He says so that he repented and 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.910
 converted to be deleted 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.559
 your sins so that they come from the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.710
 presence of the Lord times of 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.940
 refreshment then we see as the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.299
 repentance 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.130
 it's like saying a requirement for us 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.799
 excuse me because if we are not 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.310
 repentant then how God is going to 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.979
 forgive that it is repentance or 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.350
 repentance is a change of mind is 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.869
 a change of direction is to be of 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.950
 agreement with God that what we did 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.940
 it is bad 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 u2 bad 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.920
 and well, I have often listened to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.050
 people who say good I do not think that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.730
 God can forgive a murderer or a 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:38.780
 rapist or abortion or many times 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.560
 we do something so bad that we think that 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.750
 we are worthy of God forgive us 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.910
 but still god can forgive the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.030
 God's mercy is very great and he 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.600
 can you give us that to give us from 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.909
 sorry 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.930
 I have always believed that it is wrong 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.930
 categorize sin because sometimes 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.280
 we create categories we say good to kill 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.070
 stealing rape is like the worst because it's 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.700
 as above not more more more badly 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.610
 instead lie and be envious and be 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.010
 proud no no I do not think it's that bad 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.340
 and that's wrong because in the eyes of 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 God, all sins are unpleasant 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.670
 God creates us categories does not say good 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.790
 the bully changed he lied then no 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.640
 for God is sin is equal to 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.560
 unpleasant 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.540
 and good thing we have to take in 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.690
 account is that if we really are 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.540
 sorry we must leave that sin 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.750
 do not return it or try a nobel see it 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.120
 rush because it is very easy to sin 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.130
 ask forgiveness to god sin again in 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.959
 the same and ask God for forgiveness after 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.170
 that shows that there is not really 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.690
 a repentance then we have to 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.920
 as I said him forcing not to return to 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.319
 fall into that same sin 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.450
 and there is a story in the bible that we 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.090
 teaches that how you do not have to go back to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.530
 same sin when Jesus was brought to him 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.140
 a woman who had been captured in the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.230
 adultery Jesus told him I do not condemn you 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.930
 but he also said go and do not sin 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.230
 more that means that God expects 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.200
 we do not continue in this same 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.940
 sin if he forgives us but tells us 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.940
 please father tell us in the same 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.180
 and well I say this also because I do not 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.630
 we can ignore that there are consequences 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.990
 for the sins we have committed that 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.720
 maybe we will never be able to a 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.760
 erase then many times we have to 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.230
 live with the consequences of sin 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.230
 what does this mean for example 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.590
 someone rapes a person to a 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.590
 person 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.360
 I can forgive him if he really 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.370
 regrets but it's going to have to do with 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.060
 the consequences that maybe will be 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.620
 in jail and it affected a lot 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.890
 person 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.220
 that of smell to a family also to its 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.380
 own family then 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.110
 God forgives yes but they have to 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.239
 live with these consequences of the 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.150
 sins that are committed is why is that 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.690
 better not to sin and so we avoid many 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.690
 problems 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.830
 but to show that god can 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.259
 forgive even people who have 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.279
 I've done very bad things, I want to give you a 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:39.949
 example that there is in the bible but the 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:42.830
 people who did terrible things but 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.860
 then it was used by God very much 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.889
 good his name was saulo de tarso who 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.830
 then he goes by the name of Pablo and earns him a 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.139
 Pharisee and he followed the whole bible to 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.440
 This letter did not fail according to him 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.570
 it did not fail at all 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.250
 and he believed that matter will command 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.530
 Christian was being served god 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.820
 I was doing something good but in 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.820
 not obviously 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.219
 Pablo agreed that they kill 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.789
 were that one is considered to be 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:19.370
 first Christian martyr this was not a 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:23.599
 Very full person of very spiritual god 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:27.080
 and the 'play with a series of people and 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.120
 they were shown to be sinners and 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.800
 they needed jesus but those that 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.259
 people got so angry both with the 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.909
 message that the self that started it 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.390
 stoned and they started throwing stones 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.260
 until unfortunately they were dead 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.340
 and good 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.050
 each one Pablo agreed with the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.450
 steam death 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.780
 but one day Pablo had an encounter with 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.750
 Jesus 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.880
 and there he was transformed and then he 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.380
 became a great preacher in the 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.740
 Apostle Paul and great things processes 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.750
 for God God can do the same for 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.360
 each one of us but we have to 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:14.860
 take a step that is repentant then 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:19.210
 I want to invite you today so that from 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.400
 this step of faith of repentance 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.569
 doing the following prayer if the 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:29.060
 you want to be able to repeat with me 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:32.419
 God, I recognize that I am a sinner 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.790
 I know that sin against you I ask you 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:37.790

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.730
 my badness that you change my life that I 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.610
 make a new person forgive me for 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.550
 this so bad that I've done I think it's 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.400
 he died on the cross for me and he resurrected 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.740
 On the third day, Jesus, I ask you to 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.210
 please enter in my heart I receive you 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.940

 in the name of Jesus Amen 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.920
 well then from this sentence of 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:07.960
 heart 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.430
 the bible says that you are a new 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.260

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.480
