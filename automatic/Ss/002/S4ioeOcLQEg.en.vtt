going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> begin<00:00:56.789> by<00:00:56.969> creating<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.660> cap<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
going to begin by creating the cap and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.689 
going to begin by creating the cap and
to<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.770> we'll<00:00:58.949> take<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> red

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
to do that we'll take one of the red

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.180 
to do that we'll take one of the red
unassembled<00:01:00.329> balls<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.050> measure<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> midway

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
unassembled balls and measure the midway

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.670 
unassembled balls and measure the midway
point<00:01:02.489> along<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> straight<00:01:03.300> edge<00:01:03.600> we'll<00:01:04.500> then

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
point along the straight edge we'll then

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070 
point along the straight edge we'll then
use<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.949> mark<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.640> draw<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> line<00:01:06.210> dividing<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
use that mark to draw a line dividing it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.450 
use that mark to draw a line dividing it
into<00:01:07.229> two<00:01:07.530> equal<00:01:07.950> parts

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
into two equal parts

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.899 
into two equal parts
on<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:10.080> cutting<00:01:10.470> mat<00:01:10.710> using<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.369> straight<00:01:11.670> edge

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
on a cutting mat using a straight edge

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.850 
on a cutting mat using a straight edge
and<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.299> utility<00:01:12.810> knife<00:01:12.840> we're<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> cut

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and a utility knife we're going to cut

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.940 
and a utility knife we're going to cut
along<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.430> line<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.470> find<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.799> usually

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
along that line I find that it's usually

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
along that line I find that it's usually
best<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> take<00:01:17.700> several<00:01:18.000> light<00:01:18.330> passes<00:01:18.840> with

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
best to take several light passes with

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.050 
best to take several light passes with
the<00:01:19.020> utility<00:01:19.500> knife<00:01:19.680> versus<00:01:20.430> pressing<00:01:20.850> really

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the utility knife versus pressing really

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.760 
the utility knife versus pressing really
hard<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.570> trying<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> cut<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.590> one

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
hard and trying to cut it all in one

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.609 
hard and trying to cut it all in one
pass<00:01:23.540> once<00:01:24.540> you've<00:01:24.720> divided<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> into<00:01:25.500> two

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
pass once you've divided it into two

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.649 
pass once you've divided it into two
pieces<00:01:26.009> we're<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> slightly<00:01:27.180> change

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
pieces we're going to slightly change

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.830 
pieces we're going to slightly change
the<00:01:27.720> angle<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> underside<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.220> tabs

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
the angle on the underside of the tabs

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
the angle on the underside of the tabs
take<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:31.020> straight<00:01:31.290> edge<00:01:31.320> taper<00:01:31.979> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
take your straight edge taper it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.130 
take your straight edge taper it
slightly<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.850> towards<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> center<00:01:33.780> creating

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
slightly up towards the center creating

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.069 
slightly up towards the center creating
an<00:01:34.409> elongated<00:01:34.950> PI<00:01:35.310> piece<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:36.390> ahead<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> cut

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
an elongated PI piece go ahead and cut

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.179 
an elongated PI piece go ahead and cut
that<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.670> both<00:01:38.909> pieces<00:01:40.130> now<00:01:41.130> we

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that out do this with both pieces now we

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.639 
that out do this with both pieces now we
can<00:01:41.490> assemble<00:01:41.759> our<00:01:42.030> caps<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.720> open<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.229> expand

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
can assemble our caps so open and expand

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
can assemble our caps so open and expand
them<00:01:43.799> around<00:01:44.070> securing<00:01:45.000> them<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.240> place<00:01:45.450> with

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
them around securing them in place with
