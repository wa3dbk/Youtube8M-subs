a really complication you can have

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.760 
a really complication you can have
shortcuts<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.500> your<00:01:05.010> home<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.640> applications

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
shortcuts as your home your applications

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.350 
shortcuts as your home your applications
you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.799> even<00:01:08.130> turn<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> application<00:01:09.150> names

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you can even turn the application names

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.070 
you can even turn the application names
on<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.350> go<00:01:10.560> ahead<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.310> as<00:01:12.080> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
on so if we go ahead and do that as you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
on so if we go ahead and do that as you
can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> automatically<00:01:13.950> renames<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.000> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
can see it automatically renames it so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.399 
can see it automatically renames it so
you<00:01:15.390> don't<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.960> go<00:01:16.110> through<00:01:16.350> each

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you don't have to go through each

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
you don't have to go through each
different<00:01:16.890> folder<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.640> stuff<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
different folder and stuff like that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570 
different folder and stuff like that
those<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.500> couple<00:01:19.530> features<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.430> I

like<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.640> definitely<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.090> cool

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
like that so it's definitely really cool

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.440 
like that so it's definitely really cool
tweak<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.899> cydia<00:01:58.649> i<00:01:58.950> believe<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.520> 199<00:01:59.969> go

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
tweak in cydia i believe it's 199 go

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.539 
tweak in cydia i believe it's 199 go
ahead<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.689> check<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.049> up<00:02:01.369> okay<00:02:02.369> our<00:02:02.520> next

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
ahead and check that up okay our next

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.319 
ahead and check that up okay our next
application<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.479> activator<00:02:04.399> activator<00:02:05.399> alone

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
application is activator activator alone

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.359 
application is activator activator alone
is<00:02:06.659> still<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.439> complication<00:02:08.069> although

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
is still a really complication although

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
is still a really complication although
it's<00:02:08.550> used<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.509> lot<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.959> other

it's used for a lot of other

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.160 
it's used for a lot of other
applications<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.550> let's<00:02:11.700> go<00:02:11.819> ahead<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.209> make

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
applications so let's go ahead and make

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.880 
applications so let's go ahead and make
some<00:02:13.440> out

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
some out

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.930 
some out

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
open up sbsettings so definitely check

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.670 
open up sbsettings so definitely check
out<00:03:14.730> activator<00:03:15.239> really<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.470> cool

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
out activator really really cool

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.670 
out activator really really cool
application<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.760> tweak<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:19.380> let's<00:03:19.500> go<00:03:19.650> ahead

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
application and tweak so let's go ahead

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.740 
application and tweak so let's go ahead
and<00:03:19.890> go<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.130> number<00:03:20.610> four<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.420> G

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
and go to number four and that is G

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.050 
and go to number four and that is G
power<00:03:21.930> pro<00:03:22.350> basically<00:03:23.310> what<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.459> does<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.940> if

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
power pro basically what it does is if

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.699 
power pro basically what it does is if
you<00:03:24.180> hold<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> power<00:03:24.690> button<00:03:24.810> right<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.320> and

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
you hold the power button right here and

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.340 
you hold the power button right here and
you<00:03:26.030> have<00:03:27.030> your<00:03:27.180> lock<00:03:27.390> thing<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.049> slide

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
you have your lock thing you have slide

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.440 
you have your lock thing you have slide
to<00:03:28.470> power<00:03:28.500> off<00:03:28.769> slide<00:03:29.370> your<00:03:29.400> reboot<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.030> slide

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
to power off slide your reboot and slide

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.870 
to power off slide your reboot and slide
to<00:03:30.480> restring<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:31.890> could<00:03:32.070> power<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> off<00:03:32.549> or

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
to restring so we could power it off or

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.030 
to restring so we could power it off or
we<00:03:33.510> could<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.750> respring<00:03:34.440> which<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.890> what

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
we could just respring which is what

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.270 
we could just respring which is what
we're<00:03:35.220> going<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.640> right<00:03:36.030> now<00:03:37.070> just<00:03:38.070> go<00:03:38.190> and
