from DLX skateboard shop in San

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.539 
from DLX skateboard shop in San
Francisco<00:03:38.109> I<00:03:38.320> think<00:03:38.980> they're<00:03:39.070> called<00:03:39.160> deluxe

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.849 
Francisco I think they're called deluxe
but<00:03:39.790> they<00:03:39.880> call<00:03:40.030> themselves<00:03:40.180> DLX<00:03:40.810> they<00:03:41.620> came

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
but they call themselves DLX they came

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.250 
but they call themselves DLX they came
to<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.459> believe<00:03:42.790> ninety<00:03:43.299> seven<00:03:43.750> dollars<00:03:43.780> with

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
to I believe ninety seven dollars with

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.780 
to I believe ninety seven dollars with
tax<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.650> everything<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:45.549> it's<00:03:45.670> pretty

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
tax and everything so it's pretty

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.090 
tax and everything so it's pretty
expensive<00:03:46.090> these<00:03:46.600> were<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.079> lot<00:03:47.470> cheaper<00:03:47.890> but<00:03:48.070> I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
expensive these were a lot cheaper but I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.140 
expensive these were a lot cheaper but I
believe<00:03:48.370> these<00:03:48.549> are<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.760> little<00:03:48.880> bit<00:03:49.030> more

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
believe these are a little bit more

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.979 
believe these are a little bit more
hyped<00:03:49.450> than<00:03:50.170> they<00:03:50.620> were<00:03:50.680> previously<00:03:51.220> so

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
hyped than they were previously so

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.090 
hyped than they were previously so
ninety<00:03:52.989> seven<00:03:53.230> dollars<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.680> all<00:03:53.799> about<00:03:54.070> a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
ninety seven dollars and all about a

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.470 
ninety seven dollars and all about a
hundred<00:03:54.310> dollars<00:03:54.730> if<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.000> pick<00:03:55.209> them<00:03:55.299> up<00:03:55.420> from

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
hundred dollars if you pick them up from

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.870
