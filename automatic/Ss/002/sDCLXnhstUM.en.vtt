the<00:02:22.670> balancer<00:02:23.269> was<00:02:24.400> was<00:02:25.400> off<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.560> i<00:02:27.590> had<00:02:28.189> to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
the balancer was was off so i had to

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.149 
the balancer was was off so i had to
find<00:02:28.400> out<00:02:28.819> where<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.329> was<00:02:29.989> it's<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.799> timing

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
find out where it was it's the timing

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.369 
find out where it was it's the timing
mark<00:02:31.489> was<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.120> we<00:02:32.329> timed<00:02:32.629> it<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.019> everything

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
mark was and we timed it and everything

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.990 
mark was and we timed it and everything
and<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.620> runs<00:02:33.939> runs<00:02:34.939> like<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> top<00:02:35.180> now<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:37.000> let's

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and it runs runs like a top now so let's

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.399 
and it runs runs like a top now so let's
start<00:02:38.209> this<00:02:38.450> thing<00:02:38.629> up<00:02:40.599> of<00:02:41.599> course<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.049> has<00:02:42.169> the

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
start this thing up of course it has the

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:56.290 
start this thing up of course it has the
ugly<00:02:42.769> crap<00:02:43.099> Mexican<00:02:43.639> interior

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.200 

I<00:02:56.420> cut<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.050> exhaust<00:02:57.500> because<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.400> was<00:02:58.640> all

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210

I cut the exhaust because it was all
hanging<00:02:59.660> down<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.230> rusted<00:03:00.770> about<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.280> fall

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
hanging down and rusted about to fall

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.230 
hanging down and rusted about to fall
off<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.420> cut<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.410> off

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
off so I cut that off

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:19.330 
off so I cut that off
is<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.170> little<00:03:06.290> more<00:03:06.820> deeper<00:03:07.820> v8<00:03:08.180> sounds

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.930 

so<00:03:19.849> there<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.560> chief<00:03:21.560> old<00:03:21.800> Chevy<00:03:22.099> truck<00:03:22.459> get
