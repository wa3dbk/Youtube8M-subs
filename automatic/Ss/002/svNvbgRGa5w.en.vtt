started out life as an a-line helicopter

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.710 
started out life as an a-line helicopter
but<00:00:32.480> I<00:00:32.570> changed<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.170> bunch<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.410> parts<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.720> it's

now<00:00:47.450> what<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.750> did<00:00:47.990> back<00:00:48.170> in<00:00:48.200> 2005<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.190> batteries

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
now what I did back in 2005 is batteries

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.360 
now what I did back in 2005 is batteries
batteries<00:00:50.840> batteries<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.830> motor<00:00:52.130> huh

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
batteries batteries a motor huh

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.890 
batteries batteries a motor huh
batteries<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.060> motor<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.300> other<00:00:53.420> thing<00:00:53.600> idea

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
batteries and motor the other thing idea

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.510 
batteries and motor the other thing idea
is<00:00:54.020> I<00:00:54.110> finally<00:00:54.710> broke<00:00:54.920> down<00:00:54.950> and<00:00:55.130> bought<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.340> set

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
is I finally broke down and bought a set

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.980 
is I finally broke down and bought a set
of<00:00:55.610> good<00:00:55.730> servos<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:56.330> didn't<00:00:56.540> realize<00:00:56.810> what

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
of good servos and I didn't realize what

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.110 
of good servos and I didn't realize what
good<00:00:57.140> sorrows<00:00:57.530> meant<00:00:57.800> good<00:00:58.520> servos<00:00:58.880> make<00:00:59.090> a

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
good sorrows meant good servos make a

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.040 
good sorrows meant good servos make a
difference<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.750> these<00:00:59.810> are<00:00:59.990> the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
difference and these are the

10 cells on it 87 17 yeah 10 cells I
think<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.180> maybe<00:01:05.330> 160<00:01:05.960> in<00:01:06.320> it

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.460 
think is maybe 160 in it
yep<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:08.030> we're<00:01:08.600> gonna<00:01:08.690> try<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:08.990> set<00:01:09.230> the<00:01:09.320> world

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
yep and we're gonna try to set the world

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.180 
yep and we're gonna try to set the world
