00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.389
 Video 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.960
 Today I go to the development of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.460
 about 2 4-stroke model so a first time 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.210
 I go to the cde throttle 1 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.039
 that's the way most matters then 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.699
 you have to remove this cover so 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.250
 would have done it off then we have 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.149
 backup car battery yes actually 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.149
 already working 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.559
 this is the cdu likes about himself 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.110
 you do not have to chop up new ones 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.120
 buy that is a bit silly though 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.829
 instead of the title that you can not 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.600
 Just like the old one was the Roland 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 Still, that was way too early 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.129
 just pull out the cable and you're done 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.530
 Now you have to buy nunmal cd 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.980
 you do not want to go outside you want 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.980
 wants to drive faster 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 Here you can see the original cdu and is 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.689
 the best also takes second battery 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.100
 Roll the cd it is easier and when 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.880
 you're done reversing 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.070
 Order everything ready again 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.180
 back on it and I advise you first 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.710
 the cd to indian for the sake of 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.229
 wari matic started when you do that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.210
 that brings you only so 2 km h that is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.880
 So hardly anything but if you cd and 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.630
 rattles and variomatik then brings that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.280
 bring you to 20 km / h and cd alone 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.900
 not much is so synonymous 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 both agree with it 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.380
 Somehow like that and I wanted to say something else 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.700
 that mountain down starts with me at times to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.960
 rattle if you know why you can 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.420
 you write me the comments 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 think he was over the top but if 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.840
 you want to write more then criticism 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.570
 then next comes the varia 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.100
 Mattick shows you in spite of a long row 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.869
 how is you then the ten 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:02.070
 screw here here here 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.149
 here here, I think so too 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.920
 I have yet to show or 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.229
 at least 110 pieces you have to open 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.560
 do with one after the nut tree 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.849
 to know 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.500
 now a little ten screws be 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.500
 one probably with one 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.510
 hose attachment then you have to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.280
 here can lift the lid up 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.020
 usually a bit hard sometimes 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.280
 fold in a bit and then 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.209
 Take off lid is now off here 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.670
 a seal on 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.120
 but I do not know how the vultures 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.000
 variomatik brings where you are doing the deed 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.430
 then the vario matic here is the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.970
 clutch and here should between the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.010
 his ring 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.160
 who looks so plastic ring and on 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.510
 best so far with the impact wrench 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.540
 and do not try with a piston 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.650
 stopper variomatik on a four-stroke 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.959
 to help scooters because the fourth 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.430
 class valves there and if you have the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.650
 piston stop stop checkout not exactly 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.840
 explain but if the body in 1 linda 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.459
 Put your head in and then hit the 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.590
 valves has stopper against the piston and 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.930
 difficult to explain then reverse 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.790
 order everything back to the next one 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.799
 phase outside but I would advise against 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.910
 because with me she has over at the 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.280
 performance did not bring anything at all though 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.140
 she is just there and I can show you 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.359
 you as you know what I did 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.590
 then it is times this cover 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.359
 I would have to open the alleys right away 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.859
 Helmet not just the whole easy 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.150
 unscrew it is enough if you 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.769
 just open the lid and then 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.569
 you have to screw the carburetor here 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.970
 and open the letter 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.370
 But now I have an old substitute 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.850
 followers stuff more so say 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.290
 I suppose and only so you have to 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.989
 carburetor under no circumstances removal nothing 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.220
 Girl would have to remove the lid before 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.600
 here is the jump fell down 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.829
 because not with pressure which has no 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.079
 really has to print what that too 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.010
 Cover is not off otherwise jumps casually 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.850
 cover on the ground and then will 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.820
 Dirty do not happen though 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.920
 and here is the throttle you have to 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.840
 best nut, and then try to 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.550
 as far as possible when pressing so on 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.540
 best at the height here is the height of 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.680
 and then the lid is on it again 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.290
 actually would have finished in borstel 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.870
 from the scooter and if you still have tips and 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.220
 I have what I can do if 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.390
 you know even more what you want at the 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.550
 can improve scooter faster 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.910
 will or want to see something of me here 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.340
 always write from the comments 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.340
 I say thanks again for watching and 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340
 bye
