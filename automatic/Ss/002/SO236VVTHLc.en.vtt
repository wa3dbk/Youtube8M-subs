00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.600
 okay people today i not only 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.930
 a look for you but actually 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.130
 a new guard and a few left 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.720
 within the scale but I'm fine 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.640
 that's why it's about national thinking 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.500
 expand and I demonstrate today 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.450
 the jan hammer scale ok as 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:03.980
 Starting point we take our beloved 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:06.110
 a minor fifth pentatonic fifth and we 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.350
 continue to expand this not at all 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.650
 change a tone and that's the goal 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.240
 will be on foot or at intervals 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.100
 spoken the little terz becomes 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.100
 big heart that is 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.359
 who in this finger set so on the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.090
 side attacks her city ​​in the eighth bunch 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:30.579
 with the little finger in the ninth if 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.869
 we on the thick e string the two 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.359
 Of course we have sounds on the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 one side the same shape because we 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.560
 we have the same sounds 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.770
 so now we do not have a location to 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.579
 Ton 5 of the Bund G string becomes the sixth 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.579
 and g string 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:55.450
 that means we have a scale 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:58.479
 that sounds wonderful about the fits 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.209
 dominant sept chord because it actually 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.959
 contains all sounds from the dominant chord 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:07.209
 the scala plus the quarta for you 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.890
 harmony freaks if you are not 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.030
 Know what I'm talking about then do that 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.899
 not that could skype anyway 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.899
 wonderfully apply 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.019
 first of all no longer left 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.700
 league but only the idea because they are with 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.140
 the scala can make it sound 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.569
 wonderful if you have the scala in it 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.260
 sequences simply by playing so 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.260
 such a thing 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.840
 I just play three pages 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:54.209
 down the push through the whole 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:55.620
 scale a bit slower now 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:07.440
 just a few nice installs and 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:10.650
 your idea then gets the modified 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.040
 heaps of heaps on the old one 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.540
 jack black jack plates stops because 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.599
 jeff beck had known jan hammer 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.560
 played after this was clearly named 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.440
 Jeff Beck had his game too 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.760
 So it does not just belong on the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.160
 keyboard and then listen to the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.900
 guitar very cool scale 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.030
 another sound is always the mall 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.940
 pentatonic with only a single tone 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.820
 changed is okay but now a new one 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.260
 Idea I find the finger sentence we 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.090
 have just checked out 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.130
 for that is sometimes quite difficult 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.570
 this can be played and i have mine 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.050
 The so arranged that I one 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:54.000
 small shape up so she can do one 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.280
 course of movement in the fingers and the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.190
 Jeep I just let through the octaves 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.590
 show you what I mean 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.680
 I start this time in the third bunch 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.570
 the side plays with it 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.150
 finger grundton our fifth bund her 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.760
 are now I go to a page 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.570
 game food fifth seventh bunch with 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:20.209
 the index and small finger 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:22.009
 the 3 wanted the five tones 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.770
 and now it just starts 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.509
 octave higher that is 5 and on the 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.069
 b side and play exactly the same 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:34.870
 finger again octave higher you start 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:39.160
 in the tenth bunch on the hair side 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.160
 still repeats the same shape 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:51.069
 is very easy to play and now 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.659
 you can also form sequences 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:57.360
 So creatively around and try 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:57.360
 different things very cool sound 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.180
 We still have a little idea 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.229
 tip so if you the scala under the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.810
 have fingering and a little something 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.159
 I then tell you one 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.460
 small trick t mobile boss Beck always 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.460
 hears 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.500
 if you are in one place in the 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.500
 scala namely 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:26.210
 the penultimate minute is the quote 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:30.040
 the plays you then goes to the deep of 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.040
 tone and ends the immediately again 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.600
 try twice the same sound 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:45.710
 play once with rehearsed once 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:47.090
 with bandic this effect and that 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.500
 practical is when I return to the 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.890
 assumption goes out as shape 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.420
 rescheduled by the octaves then have 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.420
 you always in the same place 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.460
 the people have fun with it 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.410
 hopefully in the future of you 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.280
 to hear the little jeff wikileaks 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.280
 install in your game
