00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
or would have worked now you also notice

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.770 
or would have worked now you also notice
me<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.160> occasion<00:03:00.430> jumping<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:01.300> air<00:03:01.330> and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
me on occasion jumping in the air and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.200 
me on occasion jumping in the air and
crouching<00:03:02.440> like<00:03:02.800> crazy<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.700> find<00:03:04.000> this

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
crouching like crazy and I find this

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.570 
crouching like crazy and I find this
moves<00:03:04.870> your<00:03:05.170> head<00:03:05.410> up<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.860> down<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.310> really

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
moves your head up and down it's really

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.340 
moves your head up and down it's really
difficult<00:03:06.790> for<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.450> enemy<00:03:07.720> team<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.020> get<00:03:08.200> a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
difficult for the enemy team to get a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.410 
difficult for the enemy team to get a
one<00:03:08.590> shot<00:03:08.830> on<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.760> that's<00:03:10.120> what<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:10.360> do

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
one shot on you so that's what I do

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.090 
one shot on you so that's what I do
whenever<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:10.959> in<00:03:11.050> sketchy<00:03:11.350> situations

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
whenever I'm in sketchy situations

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.010 
whenever I'm in sketchy situations
you'll<00:03:12.310> see<00:03:12.489> me<00:03:12.610> jump<00:03:12.850> in<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.090> air<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.630> you

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
you'll see me jump in the air and you

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.830 
you'll see me jump in the air and you
know<00:03:14.140> duck<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.560> lot<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:16.209> don't<00:03:16.480> know<00:03:16.570> if<00:03:16.690> that

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
know duck a lot and I don't know if that

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.720 
know duck a lot and I don't know if that
works<00:03:17.020> or<00:03:17.230> not<00:03:17.320> it<00:03:17.620> just<00:03:17.800> seems<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.130> work<00:03:18.550> out

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
works or not it just seems to work out

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.820 
works or not it just seems to work out
sometimes<00:03:19.180> in<00:03:19.720> my<00:03:19.870> favor<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.470> that's<00:03:20.650> why<00:03:20.800> I

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
sometimes in my favor so that's why I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.710 
sometimes in my favor so that's why I
occasionally<00:03:21.250> do<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.820> you<00:03:22.209> know<00:03:22.300> just<00:03:22.540> little

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
occasionally do it you know just little

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.199 
occasionally do it you know just little
things<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.170> may<00:03:23.560> or<00:03:23.860> may<00:03:23.890> not<00:03:24.040> help<00:03:24.459> that

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
things that may or may not help that

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.080 
things that may or may not help that
I've<00:03:25.360> kind<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.660> just<00:03:25.720> honed<00:03:26.200> into<00:03:26.470> my<00:03:26.560> gameplay

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
I've kind of just honed into my gameplay

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.060 
I've kind of just honed into my gameplay
so<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.420> know<00:03:28.510> who<00:03:28.900> knows<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.440> may<00:03:29.560> help<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:29.950> may

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
so you know who knows it may help it may

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.090 
so you know who knows it may help it may
not<00:03:30.250> just<00:03:30.550> might<00:03:31.030> be<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> thing<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.600> do

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
not just might be a thing that I do

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.470 
not just might be a thing that I do
you'll<00:03:33.100> also<00:03:33.250> notice<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.700> I'm<00:03:33.910> occasionally

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
you'll also notice that I'm occasionally

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.150 
you'll also notice that I'm occasionally
going<00:03:34.750> for<00:03:34.900> those<00:03:35.020> snapshots<00:03:35.380> instead<00:03:36.070> of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
going for those snapshots instead of

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.100 
going for those snapshots instead of
actually<00:03:36.520> scoping<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.510> that's<00:03:37.780> because

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
actually scoping in and that's because

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.199 
actually scoping in and that's because
i'm<00:03:38.230> practicing<00:03:38.890> i<00:03:39.010> want<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.610> get<00:03:39.880> better<00:03:40.090> at

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
i'm practicing i want to get better at

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.910 
i'm practicing i want to get better at
snap<00:03:40.570> shots<00:03:40.870> because<00:03:41.110> i<00:03:41.320> find<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.709> would<00:03:41.830> be

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
snap shots because i find that would be

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.560 
snap shots because i find that would be
a<00:03:41.950> really<00:03:42.160> useful<00:03:42.280> skill<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.090> have<00:03:43.300> in<00:03:43.330> the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
a really useful skill to have in the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.020 
a really useful skill to have in the
sniper<00:03:43.900> hopper<00:03:44.350> because<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.489> know<00:03:45.550> scoping

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
sniper hopper because you know scoping

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.030 
sniper hopper because you know scoping
in<00:03:46.150> takes<00:03:46.390> time<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:46.989> know<00:03:47.260> time<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.920> you

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
in takes time you know time that you

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.090 
in takes time you know time that you
don't<00:03:48.489> have<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.150> know<00:03:49.239> spend<00:03:50.080> scoping<00:03:50.950> in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
don't have to you know spend scoping in

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.979 
don't have to you know spend scoping in
and<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.730> know<00:03:51.820> trying<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.180> find<00:03:52.420> your<00:03:52.540> target

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
and you know trying to find your target

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.530 
and you know trying to find your target
it's<00:03:53.500> also<00:03:53.680> situational<00:03:54.640> awareness<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:55.450> know

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
it's also situational awareness you know

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.600 
it's also situational awareness you know
whenever<00:03:55.750> you're<00:03:55.989> scoped<00:03:56.410> in<00:03:56.560> your<00:03:57.160> radar

of the map

and you're relatively blind and that's

why i choose to try to get the snapshot

more than more than i actually scope in
it's<00:04:22.389> just<00:04:22.570> simply<00:04:22.870> because<00:04:23.229> you<00:04:24.190> know<00:04:24.310> it's<00:04:24.460> a

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
it's just simply because you know it's a

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.040 
it's just simply because you know it's a
little<00:04:24.610> bit<00:04:24.820> more<00:04:24.970> reliable<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:25.750> i<00:04:25.840> feel<00:04:26.020> a

little bit more reliable and i feel a

little bit more reliable and i feel a

little safe because i can always search
