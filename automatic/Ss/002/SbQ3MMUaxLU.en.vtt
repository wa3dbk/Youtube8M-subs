hi<00:00:00.450> my<00:00:00.690> name<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:00.960> Chris<00:00:01.170> Monson<00:00:01.620> and<00:00:02.010> I'm<00:00:02.340> just

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
hi my name is Chris Monson and I'm just

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.380 
hi my name is Chris Monson and I'm just
gonna<00:00:02.610> quickly<00:00:02.879> walk<00:00:03.300> through<00:00:03.560> how<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.589> create

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
gonna quickly walk through how to create

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.270 
gonna quickly walk through how to create
a<00:00:06.390> particle<00:00:07.109> system<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.560> will<00:00:07.680> morph<00:00:07.919> from

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
a particle system that will morph from

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.360 
a particle system that will morph from
one<00:00:08.580> object<00:00:08.760> into<00:00:09.389> another<00:00:09.630> object<00:00:10.280> so<00:00:11.280> I'm

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
one object into another object so I'm

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.240 
one object into another object so I'm
just<00:00:11.490> gonna<00:00:11.639> dive<00:00:11.910> right<00:00:12.150> into<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.509> here

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
just gonna dive right into this here

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.680 
just gonna dive right into this here
first<00:00:14.250> thing<00:00:14.370> I'm<00:00:14.460> gonna<00:00:14.610> do<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.820> delete<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
first thing I'm gonna do is delete the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.189 
first thing I'm gonna do is delete the
default<00:00:16.199> cube<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.070> add<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.510> text<00:00:19.080> object

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
default cube and add in a text object

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.310 
default cube and add in a text object
because<00:00:20.010> we're<00:00:20.130> gonna<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:21.359> word<00:00:21.660> morph

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
because we're gonna have one word morph

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.630 
because we're gonna have one word morph
into<00:00:22.529> another<00:00:22.920> word<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:24.289> we'll<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.410> do

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
into another word so we'll just do

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.810 
into another word so we'll just do
blender<00:00:27.199> and<00:00:28.199> then<00:00:28.349> duplicate<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.840> and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
blender and then duplicate this and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.990 
blender and then duplicate this and
artists<00:00:32.820> okay<00:00:33.890> next<00:00:34.890> thing<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.250> need<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.670> is

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
artists okay next thing we need to do is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.350 
artists okay next thing we need to do is
convert<00:00:36.870> these<00:00:37.140> both<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.829> two<00:00:38.280> meshes<00:00:38.790> because

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
convert these both in two meshes because

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.530 
convert these both in two meshes because
we<00:00:39.540> can't<00:00:39.750> add<00:00:39.960> particle<00:00:40.440> systems<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.579> text

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
we can't add particle systems on to text

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.850 
we can't add particle systems on to text
objects<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.570> we'll<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.690> ahead<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.989> convert

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
objects so we'll go ahead and convert

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.069 
objects so we'll go ahead and convert
that<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> mesh<00:00:47.640> convert<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> mesh

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that to a mesh convert that to a mesh

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
that to a mesh convert that to a mesh
and<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.129> we're<00:00:50.280> good<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> go

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and now we're good to go

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.650 
and now we're good to go
so<00:00:52.199> we're<00:00:52.289> gonna<00:00:52.410> select<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> first<00:00:53.699> object

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
so we're gonna select the first object

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.250 
so we're gonna select the first object
here<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.730> go<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.059> particles<00:00:57.629> panel<00:00:57.960> we're

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
here and go to the particles panel we're

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.970 
here and go to the particles panel we're
going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> add<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> particle<00:00:59.070> system<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.980> we

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
going to add in a particle system and we

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.789 
going to add in a particle system and we
want<00:01:02.219> all<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.640> particles<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:04.080> in

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
want all the particles in this to be in

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.219 
want all the particles in this to be in
the<00:01:04.979> scene<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.970> very<00:01:06.000> first<00:01:06.420> frame<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the scene at the very first frame so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.399 
the scene at the very first frame so
we'll<00:01:07.799> go<00:01:07.920> ahead<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.189> set<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> one

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
we'll go ahead and set that to one

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.090 
we'll go ahead and set that to one
lifetime<00:01:10.409> doesn't<00:01:11.130> matter<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> we'll

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
lifetime doesn't matter on this so we'll

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.990 
lifetime doesn't matter on this so we'll
just<00:01:14.250> leave<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.729> alone<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.900> we'll<00:01:16.049> set

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
just leave that alone and then we'll set

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.109 
just leave that alone and then we'll set
the<00:01:18.000> distribution<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.840> random<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> initial

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the distribution to be random so initial

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.359 
the distribution to be random so initial
placement<00:01:21.330> looks<00:01:21.600> good<00:01:21.890> next<00:01:22.890> thing<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.220> need

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
placement looks good next thing we need

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.109 
placement looks good next thing we need
to<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:24.740> make<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to do is make it so that the the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.819 
to do is make it so that the the
particles<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.689> static<00:01:28.140> I'm<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.500> actually

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
particles are static I'm not actually

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.249 
particles are static I'm not actually
moving<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.000> doing<00:01:30.329> anything<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.840> we'll<00:01:30.960> set

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
moving or doing anything so we'll set

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.590 
moving or doing anything so we'll set
the<00:01:31.470> velocity<00:01:31.979> would<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.189> zero<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.880> we'll

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the velocity would be zero here we'll

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.660 
the velocity would be zero here we'll
set<00:01:33.780> physics<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.040> none<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:37.340> under<00:01:38.340> field

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
set physics to be none and under field

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
set physics to be none and under field
weights<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:40.020> will<00:01:40.229> set<00:01:40.700> all<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
weights here we will set all of the the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.700 
weights here we will set all of the the
forces<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:43.860> off<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.409> we'll<00:01:46.530> just

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
forces to be off and then we'll just

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.670 
forces to be off and then we'll just
come<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> same<00:01:47.430> thing<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.680> this

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
come in and do the same thing for this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.760 
come in and do the same thing for this
second<00:01:50.430> particle<00:01:50.790> system<00:01:51.119> here<00:01:51.590> on<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
second particle system here on the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
second particle system here on the
second<00:01:53.009> object<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.869> everything's<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
second object so everything's in the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.899 
second object so everything's in the
first<00:01:55.350> frame<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:56.189> randomized<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:58.909> velocity

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
first frame we randomized that velocity

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.380 
first frame we randomized that velocity
is<00:02:00.030> zero<00:02:00.380> no<00:02:01.380> physics<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
is zero no physics and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.710 
is zero no physics and
I'm<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.409> turn<00:02:04.620> off<00:02:06.320> all<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> forces

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
I'm going to turn off all the forces

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.390 
I'm going to turn off all the forces
okay<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:10.380> basically<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:11.069> we<00:02:11.190> need<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
okay so that's basically what we need to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.910 
okay so that's basically what we need to
do<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.790> those<00:02:11.910> two<00:02:12.240> objects<00:02:12.870> next<00:02:13.590> thing<00:02:13.830> we

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
do for those two objects next thing we

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.199 
do for those two objects next thing we
have<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.160> do<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.520> we<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.880> add<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
have to do is we have to add in a

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.600 
have to do is we have to add in a
control<00:02:15.600> object<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.490> add

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
control object so I'm just going to add

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.540 
control object so I'm just going to add
in<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.850> cube<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:19.020> really<00:02:19.500> doesn't<00:02:19.800> matter<00:02:19.920> what

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
in a cube it really doesn't matter what

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.510 
in a cube it really doesn't matter what
you<00:02:20.610> add<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.830> long<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:23.310> something

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
you add in as long as it's something

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.160 
you add in as long as it's something
that<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> particle<00:02:24.420> system<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.990> it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that can have a particle system on it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.470 
that can have a particle system on it
you<00:02:26.040> could<00:02:26.190> probably<00:02:26.580> make<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.150> work<00:02:27.300> by

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
you could probably make it work by

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.970 
you could probably make it work by
putting<00:02:27.720> another<00:02:27.900> particle<00:02:28.230> system<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.800> top

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
putting another particle system on top

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.120 
putting another particle system on top
of<00:02:29.160> one<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.340> these<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.980> ease<00:02:32.100> of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
of one of these it just for ease of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.940 
of one of these it just for ease of
access<00:02:32.430> later<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.360> works<00:02:34.170> better<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:34.590> me<00:02:34.770> to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
access later it works better for me to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.180 
access later it works better for me to
have<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> separate<00:02:35.520> object<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.860> however

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
have a separate object so do it however

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.650 
have a separate object so do it however
you<00:02:38.280> want<00:02:38.750> it'll<00:02:39.750> probably<00:02:40.050> work<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.480> what<00:02:42.600> I'm

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
you want it'll probably work so what I'm

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.810 
you want it'll probably work so what I'm
going<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.810> do<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:44.070> cube<00:02:44.430> I'm<00:02:44.670> gonna

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
going to do is on this cube I'm gonna

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.070 
going to do is on this cube I'm gonna
add<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.239> another<00:02:46.050> particle<00:02:46.440> system<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:48.080> once

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
add in another particle system and once

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.680 
add in another particle system and once
again<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.590> want<00:02:49.800> all<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.070> our<00:02:50.510> particles<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.660> be

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
again we want all of our particles to be

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.080 
again we want all of our particles to be
in<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> first<00:02:52.620> frame<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.880> lifetime

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
in at the first frame and the lifetime

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.820 
in at the first frame and the lifetime
on<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.630> actually<00:02:55.110> does<00:02:55.290> matter<00:02:55.530> what<00:02:55.739> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
on this actually does matter what the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.979 
on this actually does matter what the
lifetime<00:02:56.220> does<00:02:56.459> here<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:56.910> controls<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
lifetime does here is it controls the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.140 
lifetime does here is it controls the
overall<00:02:58.950> length<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.750> simulation<00:03:01.290> so

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
overall length of the the simulation so

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.110 
overall length of the the simulation so
it<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.959> length<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.230> takes<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:05.120> more

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it is the length that takes it to more

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.020 
it is the length that takes it to more
from<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:07.140> object<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:09.090> final<00:03:09.390> object

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
from one object to the the final object

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.140 
from one object to the the final object
so<00:03:12.470> what<00:03:13.470> we'll<00:03:13.680> do<00:03:13.890> next<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.640> we'll<00:03:14.820> come<00:03:14.850> down

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
so what we'll do next is we'll come down

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.000 
so what we'll do next is we'll come down
to<00:03:15.299> physics<00:03:15.630> here<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.049> select<00:03:16.350> keed

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
to physics here and select keed

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.569 
to physics here and select keed
and<00:03:17.459> what<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.269> does<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.900> lets<00:03:19.019> us<00:03:19.260> specify

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
and what this does is it lets us specify

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.410 
and what this does is it lets us specify
the<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:22.200> objects<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.709> we<00:03:23.010> want<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.610> move

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the the objects that we want to move

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.680 
the the objects that we want to move
between<00:03:24.720> or<00:03:25.519> more<00:03:26.519> accurately<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.239> particle

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
between or more accurately the particle

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.210 
between or more accurately the particle
systems<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.380> want<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.799> move<00:03:28.950> between

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
systems that we want it to move between

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.550 
systems that we want it to move between
because<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.120> taking<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.720> particle<00:03:31.200> system

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
because it's taking one particle system

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.410 
because it's taking one particle system
and<00:03:31.970> then<00:03:33.140> using<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.170> as<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:35.579> basically<00:03:36.329> a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
and then using that as a basically a

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.930 
and then using that as a basically a
keyframe<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.200> interpolating<00:03:38.190> between<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.730> to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
keyframe and interpolating between it to

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.770 
keyframe and interpolating between it to
another<00:03:39.769> particle<00:03:40.769> system<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:42.150> we'll<00:03:42.690> go

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
another particle system so we'll go

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.560 
another particle system so we'll go
ahead<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.049> add<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:45.030> first<00:03:45.239> particle

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
ahead and add in the first particle

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.050 
ahead and add in the first particle
system<00:03:46.049> we<00:03:46.140> want<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.410> do<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.890> we'll<00:03:47.880> select

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
system we want to do and we'll select

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.000 
system we want to do and we'll select
the<00:03:48.299> text<00:03:48.600> object<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.320> we<00:03:49.590> added<00:03:49.769> in

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
the text object that we added in

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.610 
the text object that we added in
first-year<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.760> it's<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:52.049> using<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.410> first

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
first-year and it's just using the first

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.350 
first-year and it's just using the first
particle<00:03:52.920> system<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.430> finds<00:03:53.640> on<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.209> can

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
particle system it finds on that you can

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.880 
particle system it finds on that you can
specify<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.900> here<00:03:55.320> if<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.500> have<00:03:55.590> more<00:03:55.799> than

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
specify this here if you have more than

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.229 
specify this here if you have more than
one<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:57.049> we'll<00:03:58.049> add<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:59.730> second<00:04:00.120> one

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
one and we'll add in the second one

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.750 
one and we'll add in the second one
right<00:04:00.570> here<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:03.440> there<00:04:04.440> we<00:04:04.560> go<00:04:04.650> we<00:04:04.980> got<00:04:05.010> text

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
right here and there we go we got text

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.420 
right here and there we go we got text
error<00:04:05.940> particles<00:04:06.329> moving<00:04:06.510> between<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.109> two

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
error particles moving between the two

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.339 
error particles moving between the two
pieces<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.640> text<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:10.819> what<00:04:11.819> we'll<00:04:11.970> do<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:13.200> make

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
pieces of text so what we'll do to make

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.420 
pieces of text so what we'll do to make
this<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.980> little<00:04:14.310> bit<00:04:14.810> nicer<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:15.989> we'll<00:04:16.200> just

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
this a little bit nicer is we'll just

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.529 
this a little bit nicer is we'll just
go<00:04:16.459> ahead<00:04:16.639> and<00:04:18.280> gonna<00:04:19.280> sit<00:04:19.910> this<00:04:20.060> over<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:20.359> top

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
go ahead and gonna sit this over the top

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.439 
go ahead and gonna sit this over the top
here<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:20.989> then<00:04:21.340> I'm<00:04:22.340> gonna<00:04:22.490> come<00:04:22.759> up<00:04:23.090> into<00:04:23.330> the

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
here and then I'm gonna come up into the

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.490 
here and then I'm gonna come up into the
outliner<00:04:23.780> here<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:25.090> just<00:04:26.090> turn<00:04:26.300> off<00:04:26.630> these

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
outliner here and just turn off these

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.200 
outliner here and just turn off these
two<00:04:27.949> objects<00:04:28.570> turn<00:04:29.570> off<00:04:29.720> their<00:04:29.870> visibility<00:04:30.199> so

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
two objects turn off their visibility so

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.790 
two objects turn off their visibility so
now<00:04:32.210> we<00:04:32.270> no<00:04:32.509> longer<00:04:32.539> see<00:04:32.990> them<00:04:33.229> we<00:04:33.410> no<00:04:33.530> longer

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
now we no longer see them we no longer

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.260 
now we no longer see them we no longer
see<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.009> particles<00:04:34.669> that<00:04:34.759> were<00:04:34.970> associated

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
see the particles that were associated

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.050 
see the particles that were associated
with<00:04:35.660> them<00:04:35.930> we<00:04:36.199> just<00:04:36.440> see<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:37.430> effect<00:04:37.759> that<00:04:37.850> we

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
with them we just see the effect that we

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.490 
with them we just see the effect that we
have<00:04:38.090> going<00:04:38.479> here<00:04:38.600> with<00:04:38.930> it<00:04:39.050> morphing<00:04:39.470> from

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
have going here with it morphing from

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.360 
have going here with it morphing from
one<00:04:40.190> object<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.789> other<00:04:41.289> and<00:04:42.289> now<00:04:42.370> with

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
one object to the other and now with

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.100 
one object to the other and now with
this<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.729> can<00:04:43.910> also<00:04:44.199> use<00:04:45.250> forces<00:04:46.250> on<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.550> to

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
this you can also use forces on it to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.330 
this you can also use forces on it to
throw<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.229> particles<00:04:48.620> out<00:04:49.270> in<00:04:51.340> Midway

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
throw the particles out in Midway

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.700 
throw the particles out in Midway
between<00:04:52.699> the<00:04:53.680> two<00:04:54.680> keyframes<00:04:55.070> there<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:57.110> then

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
between the two keyframes there and then

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.650 
between the two keyframes there and then
have<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.009> end<00:04:58.220> on<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.490> certain<00:04:58.789> point<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.479> can

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
have it end on a certain point you can

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.320 
have it end on a certain point you can
stack<00:05:00.500> up<00:05:00.979> a<00:05:01.460> whole<00:05:01.849> bunch<00:05:02.090> of<00:05:02.210> different

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
stack up a whole bunch of different

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.379 
stack up a whole bunch of different
particle<00:05:02.900> systems<00:05:03.259> in<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.470> row<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:04.270> have<00:05:05.270> it

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
particle systems in a row and have it

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.400 
particle systems in a row and have it
moved<00:05:05.599> between<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.050> whole<00:05:06.289> bunch<00:05:06.590> of<00:05:07.090> shapes

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
moved between a whole bunch of shapes

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.290 
moved between a whole bunch of shapes
you<00:05:09.410> could<00:05:10.210> use<00:05:11.210> this<00:05:11.449> as<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.940> particle

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
you could use this as the the particle

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.480 
you could use this as the the particle
system<00:05:14.449> to<00:05:14.720> drive<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:14.990> smoke<00:05:15.349> simulation<00:05:15.979> and

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
system to drive a smoke simulation and

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.800 
system to drive a smoke simulation and
there's<00:05:16.610> there's<00:05:16.940> tons<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.300> stuff<00:05:17.449> you<00:05:17.570> can<00:05:17.690> do

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
there's there's tons of stuff you can do

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.050 
there's there's tons of stuff you can do
with<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.320> it's<00:05:18.680> really<00:05:19.099> really<00:05:19.220> easy<00:05:19.490> and

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
with it and it's really really easy and

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.110 
with it and it's really really easy and
create<00:05:20.389> some<00:05:20.599> really<00:05:20.720> cool<00:05:20.960> looks<00:05:21.260> so<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.639> hope

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
create some really cool looks so I hope

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.040 
create some really cool looks so I hope
