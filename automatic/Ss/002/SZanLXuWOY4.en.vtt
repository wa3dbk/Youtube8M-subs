00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.980 

okay<00:00:05.850> here<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.300> my<00:00:06.330> maze<00:00:06.890> solving<00:00:08.990> simulation

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
okay here is my maze solving simulation

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.369 
okay here is my maze solving simulation
and<00:00:11.300> basically<00:00:12.300> what<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:12.930> here<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
and basically what you have here is a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.260 
and basically what you have here is a
grid<00:00:16.379> where<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> user<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.789> draw<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.800> maze<00:00:20.270> then

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
grid where a user can draw a maze then

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.520 
grid where a user can draw a maze then
down<00:00:21.480> here<00:00:23.060> is<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> bar<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:24.869> will<00:00:25.050> display

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
down here is a bar which will display

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
down here is a bar which will display
the<00:00:25.800> path<00:00:26.789> as<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:28.110> robot<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.920> virtual<00:00:29.250> robot

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the path as the robot the virtual robot

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.420 
the path as the robot the virtual robot
is<00:00:29.670> running<00:00:30.080> and<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.470> path<00:00:31.680> is<00:00:31.920> constantly

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
is running and that path is constantly

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.099 
is running and that path is constantly
being<00:00:32.669> optimized<00:00:34.760> down<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:36.269> is<00:00:36.479> a<00:00:36.510> soft

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:37.109 
being optimized down here is a soft

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.989 
being optimized down here is a soft
button<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.679> when<00:00:37.769> you're<00:00:37.920> done<00:00:38.100> filling<00:00:38.760> your

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:38.999 
button so when you're done filling your

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.239 
button so when you're done filling your
maze<00:00:39.179> you<00:00:39.390> hit<00:00:39.569> that<00:00:39.749> to<00:00:40.079> actually<00:00:40.530> run<00:00:41.069> the

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249 
maze you hit that to actually run the

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.259 
maze you hit that to actually run the
virtual<00:00:41.370> robot<00:00:41.850> through<00:00:42.089> it<00:00:43.969> then<00:00:44.969> there's<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
virtual robot through it then there's a

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.809 
virtual robot through it then there's a
display<00:00:45.659> optimized<00:00:46.229> path<00:00:46.559> button<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.579> click

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:47.819 
display optimized path button you click

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:50.450 
display optimized path button you click
that<00:00:48.059> after<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:49.079> robot<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.530> done<00:00:49.769> running

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that after the robot is done running

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
that after the robot is done running
through<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> maze<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.239> first<00:00:51.479> time<00:00:51.719> using

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
through the maze the first time using

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.319 
through the maze the first time using
the<00:00:52.859> left<00:00:53.039> hand<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> wall<00:00:53.579> technique<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the left hand on the wall technique and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
the left hand on the wall technique and
when<00:00:55.229> you<00:00:55.350> click<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.739> button<00:00:55.799> the<00:00:56.760> robot

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
when you click this button the robot

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.479 
when you click this button the robot
will<00:00:57.329> virtual<00:00:58.170> robot<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.589> one<00:00:58.769> run<00:00:59.190> through

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
will virtual robot will one run through

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.649 
will virtual robot will one run through
it<00:01:00.499> but<00:01:01.499> it<00:01:01.949> won't<00:01:02.159> go<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.639> dead<00:01:03.119> end<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
it but it won't go down a dead end so it

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.770 
it but it won't go down a dead end so it
will<00:01:03.749> just<00:01:03.899> run<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> optimized<00:01:04.710> path<00:01:05.780> then

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
will just run the optimized path then

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.600 
will just run the optimized path then
you<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.290> reset<00:01:07.680> button<00:01:07.980> to<00:01:08.070> reset<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
you have the reset button to reset it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.940 
you have the reset button to reset it
all<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.410> you<00:01:10.410> can<00:01:10.530> play<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.040> again<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
all and you can play with it again and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
all and you can play with it again and
then<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> robot<00:01:14.640> speed<00:01:15.120> and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
then you have the robot speed and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
then you have the robot speed and
squares<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.830> second<00:01:17.190> so<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:17.850> many

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
squares a second so this is how many

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060 
squares a second so this is how many
squares<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> second<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> virtual<00:01:19.560> robot<00:01:19.890> watch

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
squares a second the virtual robot watch

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
squares a second the virtual robot watch
should<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.430> traveling<00:01:20.940> I'm<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> go

click the solve button and you will see

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.000 
click the solve button and you will see
it<00:03:07.780> solve<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.959> maze<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.560> see<00:03:12.769> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
it solve the maze so you can see the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.160 
it solve the maze so you can see the
virtual<00:03:13.580> robots<00:03:14.030> driving<00:03:14.330> around<00:03:14.510> using<00:03:14.840> left

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170

hand<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.680> wall<00:03:15.920> technique<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:17.660> solve<00:03:18.019> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
hand on the wall technique to solve the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.530 
hand on the wall technique to solve the
maze<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.040> at<00:03:19.370> least<00:03:19.580> behind<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.060> blue<00:03:20.239> path

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
maze and at least behind the blue path

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.140 
maze and at least behind the blue path
the<00:03:20.930> show<00:03:21.170> where<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.530> has<00:03:21.680> gone<00:03:24.579> okay<00:03:25.579> so<00:03:26.030> it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
the show where it has gone okay so it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.220 
the show where it has gone okay so it
solved<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:27.260> maze<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:29.390> down<00:03:29.570> here<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.079> can

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
solved the maze and down here you can

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.680 
solved the maze and down here you can
see<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:31.700> can<00:03:31.820> see<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:31.970> click<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.360> solve<00:03:32.600> button

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
see you can see I click the solve button

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.229 
see you can see I click the solve button
so<00:03:33.200> it's<00:03:33.320> red<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:34.430> can<00:03:34.549> see<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.790> optimized

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
so it's red you can see the optimized

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.420 
so it's red you can see the optimized
path<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:35.959> that's<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.260> number<00:03:36.560> that's<00:03:37.250> the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
path so that's the number that's the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.180 
path so that's the number that's the
sequence<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.850> turns<00:03:38.150> or<00:03:38.709> straights<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:40.010> needs

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
sequence of turns or straights it needs

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.670 
sequence of turns or straights it needs
to<00:03:40.370> take<00:03:40.579> in<00:03:41.290> order<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:44.170> get<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.500> end

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
to take in order to get to the end

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.890 
to take in order to get to the end
without<00:03:46.160> going<00:03:46.430> down<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:46.760> dead<00:03:46.880> ends<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.480> have

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
without going down and dead ends I have

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.199 
without going down and dead ends I have
a<00:03:47.959> tutorial<00:03:48.530> based<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.549> this<00:03:49.730> if<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.090> don't

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
a tutorial based on this if you don't

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.990 
a tutorial based on this if you don't
understand<00:03:50.720> how<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.200> optimization<00:03:51.860> works<00:03:52.670> or

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
understand how the optimization works or

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.060 
understand how the optimization works or
what<00:03:53.269> these<00:03:53.420> letters<00:03:53.780> mean<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.680> can<00:03:54.890> read

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
what these letters mean you can read

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.440 
what these letters mean you can read
that<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:57.019> now<00:03:57.320> I<00:03:57.709> click<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.970> display

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
that so now I click the display

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.190 
that so now I click the display
optimized<00:03:59.959> path<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.560> you'll<00:04:00.650> see<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.790> robot

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
optimized path and you'll see the robot

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.740 
optimized path and you'll see the robot
run<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:04.100> optimized<00:04:04.640> path<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.510> I'm<00:04:05.570> going

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
run just the optimized path so I'm going

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.740 
run just the optimized path so I'm going
to<00:04:05.780> click<00:04:05.989> that<00:04:06.019> now<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:09.610> as<00:04:10.610> you<00:04:10.850> see<00:04:11.090> the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
to click that now and as you see the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.830 
to click that now and as you see the
green<00:04:12.110> is<00:04:12.440> now<00:04:13.100> just<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.790> optimized<00:04:14.360> path<00:04:14.600> so

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
green is now just the optimized path so

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.590 
green is now just the optimized path so
we<00:04:14.870> went<00:04:15.140> from<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.470> blue<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.669> green<00:04:18.519> and

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
we went from the blue to the green and

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.190 
we went from the blue to the green and
that's<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:21.109> basic<00:04:21.440> operation<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.900> hope<00:04:23.900> this

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
that's the basic operation I hope this

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.380 
that's the basic operation I hope this
is<00:04:25.190> fun<00:04:25.520> or<00:04:25.850> is<00:04:27.099> educational<00:04:28.099> you<00:04:28.849> can<00:04:29.030> hit<00:04:29.150> the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
is fun or is educational you can hit the

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.310 
is fun or is educational you can hit the
reset<00:04:29.870> button

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
reset button

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.890 
reset button
everything<00:04:32.320> gets<00:04:32.410> reset<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.130> mace<00:04:33.310> goes<00:04:33.550> away

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
everything gets reset the mace goes away

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.250 
everything gets reset the mace goes away
this<00:04:34.900> beam<00:04:35.140> still<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.620> same<00:04:35.830> though<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:37.260> you

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
this beam still the same though and you

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.090 
this beam still the same though and you
can<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.590> again<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:40.140> let<00:04:41.140> me<00:04:41.290> tell<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:41.980> a<00:04:42.010> few

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
can do it again so let me tell you a few

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.500 
can do it again so let me tell you a few
things<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:43.630> can't<00:04:44.110> do<00:04:45.210> like<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.330> said

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
things that you can't do like I said

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.820 
things that you can't do like I said
before<00:04:47.550> no<00:04:48.550> boxed<00:04:48.940> in<00:04:49.060> areas<00:04:49.480> like<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:49.830> it's

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
before no boxed in areas like that it's

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.320 
before no boxed in areas like that it's
pretty<00:04:51.040> obvious

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.820 

don't<00:04:55.330> put<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.470> end<00:04:57.930> right<00:04:58.930> off<00:04:59.170> of<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.560> turn

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
don't put the end right off of a turn

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.230 
don't put the end right off of a turn
like<00:05:00.160> that<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:01.150> needs<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.510> be<00:05:01.690> on<00:05:02.760> at<00:05:03.760> least<00:05:04.060> the

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
like that it needs to be on at least the

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:12.510 
like that it needs to be on at least the
end<00:05:04.270> of<00:05:04.750> one<00:05:04.990> black<00:05:05.260> square<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
end of one black square and and the

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.560 
end of one black square and and the
outside<00:05:13.860> doesn't<00:05:14.860> work<00:05:15.010> right<00:05:15.220> now<00:05:15.370> so<00:05:15.640> don't

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
outside doesn't work right now so don't

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.230 
outside doesn't work right now so don't
build<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.200> maze<00:05:17.410> on<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:18.010> outside<00:05:18.430> edges<00:05:18.730> as

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
build the maze on the outside edges as

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.950 
build the maze on the outside edges as
you<00:05:19.270> can<00:05:19.600> see<00:05:20.580> don't<00:05:21.580> put<00:05:21.790> anything<00:05:22.090> like<00:05:22.780> I

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
you can see don't put anything like I

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.050 
you can see don't put anything like I
just<00:05:23.230> did<00:05:23.700> here<00:05:24.700> or<00:05:25.540> there<00:05:25.870> on<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.620> bottom

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
just did here or there on the bottom

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.730 
just did here or there on the bottom
just<00:05:28.060> stay<00:05:28.210> away<00:05:28.360> from<00:05:28.390> the<00:05:28.660> outside<00:05:29.020> rows<00:05:29.500> and

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
just stay away from the outside rows and

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.180 
just stay away from the outside rows and
columns<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:34.240> should<00:05:34.420> be<00:05:34.510> good<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:35.190> there

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
columns and you should be good so there

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.860 
columns and you should be good so there
might<00:05:36.310> be<00:05:36.340> other<00:05:36.550> things<00:05:36.640> I<00:05:37.180> mean<00:05:37.510> if<00:05:37.600> you<00:05:37.720> find

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
might be other things I mean if you find

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.570 
might be other things I mean if you find
anything<00:05:38.050> wrong<00:05:38.290> with<00:05:38.350> it<00:05:38.500> email<00:05:39.100> me<00:05:39.280> or
