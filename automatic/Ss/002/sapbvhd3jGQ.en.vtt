00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
particularly sure why but 250 inches

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.970 
particularly sure why but 250 inches
away<00:01:25.340> my<00:01:26.340> brain<00:01:26.610> doesn't<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:27.120> how<00:01:27.270> far<00:01:27.980> it's

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
away my brain doesn't know how far it's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.740 
away my brain doesn't know how far it's
slightly<00:01:29.550> less<00:01:29.940> than<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> distance<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.660> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
slightly less than the distance of a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.220 
slightly less than the distance of a
football<00:01:30.960> field<00:01:32.090> just<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.900> populace

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
football field just think the populace

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.070 
football field just think the populace
300<00:01:34.950> feet<00:01:35.160> so<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:38.360> not<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.420> far<00:01:39.720> let's<00:01:39.930> go

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
300 feet so it's not that far let's go

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.000 
300 feet so it's not that far let's go
not<00:01:40.320> very<00:01:40.500> far<00:01:42.440> well<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.560> guess<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:43.800> always

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010

they're<00:02:49.700> going<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.150> right<00:02:50.300> way<00:02:51.850> you're

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
they're going the right way you're

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.980 
they're going the right way you're
picking<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.360> hard<00:02:53.600> way<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.840> go<00:02:55.570> I'm<00:02:56.570> gonna<00:02:56.840> go

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
picking the hard way to go I'm gonna go

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.310 
picking the hard way to go I'm gonna go
this<00:02:57.140> way<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.350> see<00:02:57.590> what<00:02:57.680> happens<00:03:02.320> that

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
this way and see what happens that

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.920 
this way and see what happens that
really<00:03:03.440> isn't<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.860> way<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.100> go<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.660> guess

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
really isn't that way to go but I guess

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.120 
really isn't that way to go but I guess
you<00:03:05.960> wouldn't<00:03:06.260> always<00:03:06.560> know<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:06.920> I'm

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
you wouldn't always know that I'm

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.620 
you wouldn't always know that I'm
footing<00:03:07.310> been<00:03:07.460> here<00:03:07.550> before<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:14.270> look<00:03:14.450> you

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
footing been here before and look you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.780 
footing been here before and look you
can<00:03:14.810> see<00:03:14.840> them<00:03:15.140> they're<00:03:16.130> going<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.460> hard<00:03:16.640> way

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
can see them they're going the hard way

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.370 
can see them they're going the hard way
there's<00:03:17.030> actually<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.390> second<00:03:17.810> trail<00:03:18.110> that

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
there's actually a second trail that

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.520 
there's actually a second trail that
we're<00:03:18.560> going<00:03:18.710> to<00:03:18.800> go<00:03:18.890> down<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:19.970> easier

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
we're going to go down and it's easier

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.330 
we're going to go down and it's easier
this<00:03:21.530> out<00:03:21.950> here<00:03:23.620> sort<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.770> more<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.130> its

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
this out here sort of more of its

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.440 
this out here sort of more of its
opening<00:03:25.790> in<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.060> trees<00:03:26.770> rain<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:29.000> usually<00:03:29.420> I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
opening in the trees rain and usually I

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.170 
opening in the trees rain and usually I
really<00:03:30.040> wouldn't<00:03:31.040> recommend<00:03:31.100> is<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.730> bit<00:03:31.970> flip

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
really wouldn't recommend is a bit flip

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:43.180 
really wouldn't recommend is a bit flip
flops<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:34.160> general<00:03:34.310> note
