00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.640 
that if I'm more versatile with dance
and<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.540> know<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.660> did<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.050> blue<00:05:28.169> crew<00:05:28.410> and

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
and you know I did the blue crew and

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.170 
and you know I did the blue crew and
they<00:05:28.740> they<00:05:29.370> needed<00:05:29.640> like<00:05:29.760> someone<00:05:30.000> who<00:05:30.090> was

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
they they needed like someone who was

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.810 
they they needed like someone who was
really<00:05:30.479> outgoing<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.930> bubbly<00:05:31.410> I<00:05:32.250> believe<00:05:32.729> this

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
really outgoing a bubbly I believe this

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.130 
really outgoing a bubbly I believe this
would<00:05:33.060> be<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.240> really<00:05:33.479> good<00:05:33.600> change<00:05:33.810> for<00:05:33.990> that

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
would be a really good change for that

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.469 
would be a really good change for that
so<00:05:34.530> the<00:05:35.190> interview<00:05:35.460> process<00:05:35.580> actually<00:05:36.060> went

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
so the interview process actually went

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.570 
so the interview process actually went
pretty<00:05:36.570> well<00:05:36.870> too<00:05:37.229> because<00:05:37.650> I've<00:05:38.070> worked<00:05:38.460> with

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
pretty well too because I've worked with

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.810 
pretty well too because I've worked with
Shelly<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.539> Carly<00:05:40.200> and<00:05:40.470> I

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
Shelly and Carly and I

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.880 
Shelly and Carly and I
met<00:05:40.910> Jeanine<00:05:41.150> before<00:05:41.540> so<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:42.020> wasn't<00:05:42.380> like<00:05:42.530> I'm

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
met Jeanine before so it wasn't like I'm
