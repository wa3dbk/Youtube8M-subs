the tank at the moment so what I'll do
is<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.180> unscrew<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> time<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.380> show<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
is I just unscrew the time can show you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.640 
is I just unscrew the time can show you
how<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.100> fits<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
how that fits on there so this is the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.679

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
tank itself with a mouthpiece on top if

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
tank itself with a mouthpiece on top if
I<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.960> take<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> silicon<00:01:22.710> cover<00:01:23.310> off<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
I just take the silicon cover off the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.210 
I just take the silicon cover off the
end<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:24.090> pop<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.220> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
end there pop that in there this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.980 
end there pop that in there this
mouthpiece<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.180> obviously<00:01:27.450> standard

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990

hole so an email any drip tip will fit

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.230 
hole so an email any drip tip will fit
in<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.030> comes

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
in there but that's the one that comes

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.010 
in there but that's the one that comes
with<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.079> black<00:01:37.680> plastic<00:01:38.070> generic

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
with it just to a black plastic generic

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
with it just to a black plastic generic
mouthpiece<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:41.250> each<00:01:41.430> end<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.880> tube

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
mouthpiece so on each end of the tube

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.100 
mouthpiece so on each end of the tube
there<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.810> threads<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
there are threads and as you can see so

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.289 
there are threads and as you can see so
you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.530> obviously<00:01:46.799> screw<00:01:47.700> either<00:01:47.909> end<00:01:48.119> off

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
you can obviously screw either end off

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.139 
you can obviously screw either end off
for<00:01:48.810> ease<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.259> access<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.820> I'm<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.030> going

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
for ease of it access so I'm just going

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.370 
for ease of it access so I'm just going
to<00:01:51.210> screw<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> bottom<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.350> that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
to screw the bottom off because that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
to screw the bottom off because that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
actually contains the post which holds

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.700 
actually contains the post which holds
the<00:01:55.350> atomizer<00:01:55.890> itself<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the atomizer itself so there we are the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
the atomizer itself so there we are the
atomizer<00:01:59.250> portion<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.090> bit<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:00.329> with

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
atomizer portion is this bit here with

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.530 
atomizer portion is this bit here with
the<00:02:00.689> silicon<00:02:01.140> cap<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.530> again<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.299> also

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the silicon cap on again and it's also

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.380 
the silicon cap on again and it's also
got<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.960> shore<00:02:04.200> twix<00:02:04.500> either<00:02:05.009> side<00:02:05.399> which<00:02:05.939> feed

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
got to shore twix either side which feed

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
got to shore twix either side which feed
juice<00:02:06.659> into<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.079> coil<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:08.069> replace<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
juice into the coil to replace the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.119 
juice into the coil to replace the
atomizer<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.259> simply<00:02:10.440> hold<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
atomizer you just simply hold on to the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.640 
atomizer you just simply hold on to the
atomizer<00:02:11.550> head

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
atomizer head

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.289 
atomizer head
and<00:02:12.769> give<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.700> quick<00:02:13.909> twist<00:02:14.569> like<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.299> you

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
and give it a quick twist like so you

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.069 
and give it a quick twist like so you
see<00:02:17.569> that<00:02:17.599> thread<00:02:18.319> there<00:02:19.659> it's<00:02:20.659> a<00:02:20.750> sealed

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
see that thread there it's a sealed

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.259 
see that thread there it's a sealed
thread<00:02:21.530> with<00:02:21.769> silicon<00:02:22.310> buns<00:02:22.579> so<00:02:22.939> there's<00:02:23.120> no

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
thread with silicon buns so there's no

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.819 
thread with silicon buns so there's no
juice<00:02:23.480> going<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.780> go<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:24.019> there<00:02:24.260> so

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
juice going to go in there so

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.280 
juice going to go in there so
essentially<00:02:25.189> when<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.909> is<00:02:26.150> when<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.019> wears

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
essentially when this is when this wears

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.740 
essentially when this is when this wears
out<00:02:27.590> or<00:02:27.829> if<00:02:28.129> you<00:02:28.370> decide<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.420> change<00:02:29.569> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
out or if you decide to change the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.069 
out or if you decide to change the
resistance<00:02:30.049> of<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.030> actual<00:02:32.030> atomizer<00:02:32.659> at<00:02:32.959> any

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
resistance of the actual atomizer at any

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.750 
resistance of the actual atomizer at any
point<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:33.620> just<00:02:33.829> a<00:02:33.920> case<00:02:34.099> of<00:02:34.129> unscrewing<00:02:34.670> it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
point it's just a case of unscrewing it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.030 
point it's just a case of unscrewing it
like<00:02:34.939> that<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:36.079> can<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.409> it's<00:02:36.859> quite

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
like that so if I can just it's quite

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.649 
like that so if I can just it's quite
difficult<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.459> do<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.909> this<00:02:38.030> end<00:02:38.269> at<00:02:38.510> this

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
difficult to do with this end at this

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.000 
difficult to do with this end at this
angle<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.109> filming<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:40.430> start<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:41.090> off

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
angle and filming I just start that off

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.039 
angle and filming I just start that off
screw<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.099> back<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.489> right<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.659> we've<00:02:44.840> got<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
screw it back on right so we've got the

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.410 
screw it back on right so we've got the
atomizer<00:02:45.440> head<00:02:45.709> stuck<00:02:46.069> in<00:02:46.099> there<00:02:46.430> now<00:02:46.609> right

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
atomizer head stuck in there now right

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.050 
atomizer head stuck in there now right
but<00:02:47.569> just<00:02:47.720> push<00:02:48.049> this<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.709> silicon<00:02:49.220> cap<00:02:49.790> moves

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
but just push this the silicon cap moves

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.809 
but just push this the silicon cap moves
up<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.389> down<00:02:50.530> obviously<00:02:51.530> just<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.340> allow<00:02:52.549> more

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
up and down obviously just to allow more

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.780 
up and down obviously just to allow more
juice<00:02:53.120> through<00:02:53.510> those<00:02:54.319> wicks<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.430> into<00:02:55.670> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
juice through those wicks and into the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.660 
juice through those wicks and into the
coil<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.049> vapor<00:02:57.920> obviously<00:02:58.280> comes<00:02:58.519> up

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
coil and the vapor obviously comes up

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.849 
coil and the vapor obviously comes up
through<00:02:58.849> this<00:02:58.970> hole<00:02:59.030> here<00:02:59.209> so<00:02:59.959> let's<00:03:00.200> screw

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
through this hole here so let's screw

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.220 
through this hole here so let's screw
that<00:03:00.980> back<00:03:01.189> in<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:03.049> tank<00:03:03.260> holds<00:03:03.620> 3.5<00:03:04.280> mil<00:03:04.609> of

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
that back in this tank holds 3.5 mil of

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.629 
that back in this tank holds 3.5 mil of
e-liquid<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:08.620> replaceable<00:03:09.620> atomisers<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
e-liquid and replaceable atomisers the

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.309 
e-liquid and replaceable atomisers the
atomizers<00:03:11.180> this<00:03:11.420> comes<00:03:11.689> with<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.019> comes<00:03:12.170> with

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
atomizers this comes with it comes with

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.410 
atomizers this comes with it comes with
the<00:03:12.349> three<00:03:12.739> but<00:03:13.459> if<00:03:13.639> you<00:03:13.849> want<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.239> purchase

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
the three but if you want to purchase

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.650 
the three but if you want to purchase
more<00:03:14.930> all<00:03:15.430> their<00:03:16.430> available<00:03:17.120> separately<00:03:17.359> at

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
more all their available separately at

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.189 
more all their available separately at
299<00:03:18.199> each<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.970> fill<00:03:20.150> up<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:21.019> the

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
299 each so to fill up the this the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.920 
299 each so to fill up the this the
easiest<00:03:21.410> way<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.620> found<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.129> fill<00:03:22.310> up<00:03:22.549> is

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
easiest way I found to fill up is

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.900 
easiest way I found to fill up is
basically<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:23.959> unscrew<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.799> top<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.310> the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
basically just unscrew the top of the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.689 
basically just unscrew the top of the
tank<00:03:26.510> itself<00:03:26.709> making<00:03:27.709> sure<00:03:27.949> this<00:03:28.129> is<00:03:28.280> all<00:03:28.430> the

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
tank itself making sure this is all the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.259 
tank itself making sure this is all the
tight<00:03:29.419> and<00:03:30.129> interesting<00:03:31.129> the<00:03:31.370> 510<00:03:31.879> connection

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
tight and interesting the 510 connection

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.979 
tight and interesting the 510 connection
is<00:03:32.599> actually<00:03:33.699> part<00:03:34.699> of<00:03:34.879> the<00:03:35.090> base<00:03:35.389> plate<00:03:35.629> here

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
is actually part of the base plate here

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.780 
is actually part of the base plate here
so<00:03:36.230> this<00:03:36.379> is<00:03:36.530> very<00:03:36.859> strong<00:03:37.310> here<00:03:37.579> that<00:03:37.730> you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
so this is very strong here that you

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.759 
so this is very strong here that you
won't<00:03:37.970> get<00:03:38.150> any<00:03:38.419> leaks<00:03:39.049> coming<00:03:39.349> through<00:03:39.650> here

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
won't get any leaks coming through here

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.939 
won't get any leaks coming through here
because<00:03:39.919> this<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.099> all<00:03:40.310> one<00:03:40.579> piece<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:42.260> that's

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
because this is all one piece so that's

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.159 
because this is all one piece so that's
very<00:03:43.069> good<00:03:43.519> right<00:03:44.180> i<00:03:44.209> just<00:03:44.299> grabbed<00:03:44.659> me<00:03:44.720> liquid

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
very good right i just grabbed me liquid

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.839 
very good right i just grabbed me liquid
and<00:03:45.349> pour<00:03:45.500> some<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:48.250> off-camera<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.639> then

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
and pour some in off-camera and then

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.559 
and pour some in off-camera and then
move<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.359> so<00:03:51.699> to<00:03:52.699> try<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:53.030> do<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.299> without

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
move it in so to try and do this without

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.509 
move it in so to try and do this without
dropping<00:03:53.989> it<00:03:54.169> everywhere<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:54.799> anyway<00:03:55.129> let's

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
dropping it everywhere so anyway let's

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.629 
dropping it everywhere so anyway let's
turn<00:03:55.729> it<00:03:55.879> around<00:03:55.909> so<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.209> can<00:03:56.329> see<00:03:56.449> the<00:03:57.639> either

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
turn it around so you can see the either

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.789 
turn it around so you can see the either
if<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.090> can<00:03:59.239> make<00:03:59.419> that<00:03:59.449> out<00:03:59.840> it<00:04:00.620> actually

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
if you can make that out it actually

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.699 
if you can make that out it actually
says<00:04:01.549> us<00:04:01.819> a<00:04:01.970> look<00:04:02.150> says<00:04:02.599> two<00:04:03.260> point<00:04:03.560> eight

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
says us a look says two point eight

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.259 
says us a look says two point eight
milliliters<00:04:04.099> but<00:04:04.699> it<00:04:04.940> 3.5<00:04:05.840> mil<00:04:06.229> is<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:07.280> actual

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
milliliters but it 3.5 mil is the actual

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.699 
milliliters but it 3.5 mil is the actual
amount<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.709> so<00:04:10.190> let's<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:10.609> squeeze<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:12.440> in

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
amount of so let's just squeeze that in

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.960 
amount of so let's just squeeze that in
just<00:04:13.159> down<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.609> side

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
just down the side

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.690 
just down the side
and<00:04:15.630> then<00:04:15.870> fill<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.470> up<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.860> first<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.670> the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
and then fill it up to the first to the

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.979 
and then fill it up to the first to the
top<00:04:18.000> line<00:04:18.239> there<00:04:18.450> just<00:04:18.780> underneath<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.260> wicks

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
top line there just underneath the wicks

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.050 
top line there just underneath the wicks
and<00:04:21.989> pop<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.800> top<00:04:22.980> back<00:04:23.160> on<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:25.700> stick<00:04:26.700> the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
and pop the top back on and stick the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.610 
and pop the top back on and stick the
mouthpiece<00:04:27.660> back<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:29.390> just<00:04:30.390> turn<00:04:31.260> upside

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
mouthpiece back in and just turn upside

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.030 
mouthpiece back in and just turn upside
down<00:04:31.650> just<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.190> whet<00:04:32.400> those<00:04:32.610> wicks<00:04:32.910> place<00:04:34.040> they

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
down just to whet those wicks place they

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.730 
down just to whet those wicks place they
should<00:04:35.280> soak<00:04:36.030> through<00:04:36.300> quite<00:04:36.540> quickly<00:04:36.900> anyway

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
should soak through quite quickly anyway

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.130 
should soak through quite quickly anyway
so<00:04:37.800> that's<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.340> all<00:04:38.460> assembled<00:04:39.260> with<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:42.140> 2.4

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
so that's it all assembled with a 2.4

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.480 
so that's it all assembled with a 2.4
own<00:04:43.640> atomizer<00:04:44.640> so<00:04:45.060> medium<00:04:46.310> medium<00:04:47.310> resistance

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
own atomizer so medium medium resistance

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.540 
own atomizer so medium medium resistance
there<00:04:48.180> let's<00:04:49.170> stick<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.500> on<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.710> device<00:04:50.040> and<00:04:50.400> see

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
there let's stick it on a device and see

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.060 
there let's stick it on a device and see
how<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.790> vapes<00:04:51.200> right<00:04:52.200> so<00:04:52.470> we<00:04:52.650> got<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.890> Viva

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
how it vapes right so we got the Viva

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.940 
how it vapes right so we got the Viva
nova<00:04:53.430> tank<00:04:53.670> here<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.150> attached<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:55.140> the

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
nova tank here and attached to the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.700

what the vapor throw it in the flavor
come<00:05:28.530> across<00:05:28.800> as<00:05:29.010> I'm<00:05:29.310> using<00:05:29.490> just<00:05:29.970> a<00:05:30.060> standard

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
come across as I'm using just a standard

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.250 
come across as I'm using just a standard
ry4<00:05:31.669> liquid<00:05:32.669> which<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:33.000> vape<00:05:33.210> so<00:05:33.540> I'm<00:05:33.870> quite<00:05:34.140> I

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
ry4 liquid which I vape so I'm quite I

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.870 
ry4 liquid which I vape so I'm quite I
know<00:05:34.380> what<00:05:34.590> its<00:05:34.740> taste<00:05:34.979> like<00:05:35.160> so<00:05:35.430> let's<00:05:35.729> see

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
know what its taste like so let's see

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:44.309 
know what its taste like so let's see
what<00:05:36.060> this<00:05:36.210> does<00:05:36.479> hailey<00:05:37.260> here<00:05:37.350> we<00:05:37.410> go

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.809 

so<00:05:45.319> quite<00:05:45.530> a<00:05:45.560> lot<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:45.830> nice<00:05:45.979> paper<00:05:46.310> there<00:05:46.610> let's

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:46.819 
so quite a lot of nice paper there let's

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.040 
so quite a lot of nice paper there let's
just<00:05:46.969> try<00:05:47.150> that<00:05:47.180> again<00:05:47.449> because<00:05:47.749> now<00:05:47.990> the

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
just try that again because now the

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.659 
just try that again because now the
wicks<00:05:48.319> are<00:05:48.530> nice<00:05:48.650> and<00:05:48.860> wet<00:05:49.009> and<00:05:49.039> might<00:05:49.460> produce

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
wicks are nice and wet and might produce

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:59.640 
wicks are nice and wet and might produce
a<00:05:49.849> little<00:05:50.120> bit<00:05:50.210> more

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.100 

some<00:06:00.280> poxy<00:06:00.639> little<00:06:00.970> smoke<00:06:01.449> rings<00:06:01.690> there<00:06:01.900> for

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
some poxy little smoke rings there for

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.670 
some poxy little smoke rings there for
you<00:06:02.229> anyway<00:06:03.360> real<00:06:04.360> nice<00:06:04.540> throat<00:06:04.870> hit<00:06:05.080> real

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
you anyway real nice throat hit real

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.580 
you anyway real nice throat hit real
nice<00:06:05.919> draw<00:06:06.280> not<00:06:07.210> too<00:06:07.419> loose<00:06:07.630> and<00:06:07.900> definitely

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
nice draw not too loose and definitely

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.760 
nice draw not too loose and definitely
not<00:06:08.770> tight<00:06:09.039> at<00:06:09.070> all<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:10.840> flavor<00:06:11.139> is<00:06:11.289> quite

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
not tight at all the flavor is quite

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.189 
not tight at all the flavor is quite
punchy<00:06:12.070> it<00:06:12.669> the<00:06:13.120> flavor<00:06:13.330> comes<00:06:13.479> through<00:06:13.780> quite

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
punchy it the flavor comes through quite

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.590 
punchy it the flavor comes through quite
strong<00:06:14.620> because<00:06:15.370> obviously<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:15.910> liquids

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
strong because obviously the liquids

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.909 
strong because obviously the liquids
only<00:06:16.690> got<00:06:16.900> to<00:06:16.990> travel<00:06:17.259> at<00:06:17.350> that<00:06:17.500> tiny<00:06:17.770> little

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
only got to travel at that tiny little

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.950 
only got to travel at that tiny little
short<00:06:18.340> wake<00:06:18.550> on<00:06:18.789> to<00:06:18.940> the<00:06:19.060> actual<00:06:19.240> call<00:06:19.600> itself

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
short wake on to the actual call itself

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.980 
short wake on to the actual call itself
for<00:06:20.229> it<00:06:20.320> to<00:06:20.440> actually<00:06:21.330> get<00:06:22.330> heated<00:06:22.539> up<00:06:22.780> and

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
for it to actually get heated up and

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.710 
for it to actually get heated up and
turned<00:06:23.139> into<00:06:23.320> vapor<00:06:23.880> so<00:06:24.880> the<00:06:25.150> vapors<00:06:25.539> good

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
turned into vapor so the vapors good

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.080 
turned into vapor so the vapors good
throat<00:06:26.110> it's<00:06:26.289> good<00:06:26.530> and<00:06:26.770> the<00:06:27.580> flavor<00:06:27.940> comes

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
throat it's good and the flavor comes

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.240 
throat it's good and the flavor comes
through<00:06:28.389> really<00:06:28.720> good<00:06:29.080> is<00:06:29.350> really<00:06:29.949> strongly

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
through really good is really strongly

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.830

as well again perfect on a lower voltage
device<00:06:35.380> also<00:06:35.650> because<00:06:36.039> you<00:06:36.160> can<00:06:36.310> change<00:06:36.580> the

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
device also because you can change the

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.000 
device also because you can change the
resistance<00:06:37.090> of<00:06:37.539> the<00:06:37.750> atomizers<00:06:38.350> and<00:06:38.560> perfect

resistance of the atomizers and perfect

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.100 
resistance of the atomizers and perfect

higher resisted atomisers 3.5 mil use is

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.550 
higher resisted atomisers 3.5 mil use is
