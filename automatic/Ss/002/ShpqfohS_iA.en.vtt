let<00:00:52.440> me<00:00:52.530> demonstrate<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.430> show<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> how<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
let me demonstrate and show you how that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
let me demonstrate and show you how that
gyro<00:00:54.449> works<00:00:54.840> when<00:00:55.500> you're<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.770> flight<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
gyro works when you're in flight and you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
gyro works when you're in flight and you
get<00:00:56.640> inputs<00:00:57.120> into<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> airplane<00:00:58.109> such<00:00:58.379> as

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
get inputs into the airplane such as

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
get inputs into the airplane such as
wind<00:00:58.739> turbulence<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.399> stuff<00:00:59.670> what's<00:01:00.270> going

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
wind turbulence and stuff what's going

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.880 
wind turbulence and stuff what's going
to<00:01:00.480> happen<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.020> play<00:01:01.199> controls<00:01:01.620> because

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to happen is your play controls because

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.200 
to happen is your play controls because
you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.280> see<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.609> inner<00:01:02.760> own<00:01:03.000> you're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
you can see see your inner own you're

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.609 
you can see see your inner own you're
going<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> move<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:04.019> rudder<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
going to move your rudder is going to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
going to move your rudder is going to
move<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.479> gonna

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
move so what it's going to do it's gonna

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320 
move so what it's going to do it's gonna
keep<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> airplane<00:01:07.470> stable<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.159> flight<00:01:08.330> when

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
keep the airplane stable in flight when

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.320 
keep the airplane stable in flight when
you<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.630> inputs<00:01:10.619> such<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.460> turbulence<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
you have inputs such as turbulence and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.130 
you have inputs such as turbulence and
gusts<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.750> wind<00:01:13.700> RC<00:01:14.700> airplane<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:16.080> how

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
gusts of wind RC airplane up and see how

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.460 
gusts of wind RC airplane up and see how
it<00:01:16.259> does

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it does

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.380 
it does
alright<00:01:17.250> everyone<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.180> we

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
alright everyone is as you can see we

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.840 
alright everyone is as you can see we
have<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> cowling<00:01:19.200> off<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.310> held<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.580> by

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
have the cowling off and it's held on by

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.550 
have the cowling off and it's held on by
real<00:01:21.090> strong<00:01:21.330> magnets<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> show

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
real strong magnets I just want to show

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130 
real strong magnets I just want to show
you<00:01:22.619> how<00:01:23.189> what<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.670> motor<00:01:23.850> looks<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
you how what your motor looks like and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
you how what your motor looks like and
where<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.590> battery<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.009> installed<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.610> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
where your battery is installed at so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
where your battery is installed at so
let's<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.119> ahead<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.540> put<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> cowling<00:01:28.770> back

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
let's go ahead and put the cowling back

00:01:28.920 --> 00:02:50.040 
let's go ahead and put the cowling back
on<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> take<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.490> up

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.420 

one<00:02:51.050> as<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.410> can<00:02:51.440> see<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.890> was<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.130> maiden

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
one as you can see that was the maiden

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.360 
one as you can see that was the maiden
flight<00:02:52.580> on<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.570> E<00:02:53.600> flat<00:02:53.960> G<00:02:54.020> B<00:02:54.290> she<00:02:54.860> flies<00:02:55.100> great

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
flight on the E flat G B she flies great

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.300 
flight on the E flat G B she flies great
and<00:02:56.030> then<00:02:56.240> three<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:57.140> gyro<00:02:57.680> really<00:02:58.010> helped

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
and then three that gyro really helped

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.950 
and then three that gyro really helped
it<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.580> wind<00:02:58.790> as<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.180> see<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.630> it's<00:02:59.870> a

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
it in the wind as you can see and it's a

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.900 
it in the wind as you can see and it's a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
really great flying model I gotta tell

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.300 
really great flying model I gotta tell
you<00:03:02.030> take<00:03:02.840> care<00:03:03.080> out<00:03:03.230> there<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.710> happy<00:03:04.070> flying
