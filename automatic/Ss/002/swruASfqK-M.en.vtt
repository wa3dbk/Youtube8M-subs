00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:11.450
 youtube show for example how 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.790
 We get to our pipe animes 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.640
 tube hd at him is pleasing many 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.779
 editors today showed which way 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.580
 do it for the pages in torrance 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.080
 on the cologne in categories easy 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.840
 anime anime virtual anime search 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.840
 we according to any anime say 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.480
 then we will see the whole here 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.399
 follow by ford online episode 15 15 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.070
 2014 and secondly those are then 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:59.329
 also all raster that means without substance 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:03.600
 and also mostly ag ag 7280 27 yes 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.880
 and then you just get everything 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 because the link practically only the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.200
 description and still count one 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.740
 thing and that then if you do not at 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.430
 Zapf free animes done come in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.430
 I also have and indeed out 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:55.210
 agree with me you yourself in it 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.210
 at least the first two follow it 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.180
 4c it just busy but no matter 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.320
 Here we come to where it is 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.260
 i have seen here we have the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.360
 quality on preview on car because that 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.120
 otherwise I would lick more 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.410
 now what car to complete 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.920
 optimal case one then we already see 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.360
 that something already lasts so not mine 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.260
 laptop is up for the latest 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.670
 In any case, the shops would be here 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.560
 and first of all we will do it of course 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.100
 We make this wide by opening up 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.090
 press properties and then on 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.610
 I maintain that aspect ratio 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.680
 make him go away then we'll see below too 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.100
 yet another field like sampling 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.720
 deactivate that put there or 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.250
 circle rhine and there it makes such tms 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.350
 wanted or with other effects 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 he looks a little clearer without big 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:12.670
 frames then we are now 16 9 format 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.930
 now have to card out 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.910
 then we see a braid then we go 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:24.130
 here on video walls panorama and 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.130
 Always cropping them up in the field 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:33.500
 this way will you what consumer and possible 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:40.340
 Little to get away from the anime 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:44.010
 then you can just move here like this 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.840
 and then you've stretched that up around 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.290
 the time 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.389
 the dimensions that you have made here 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.599
 yes it is synonymous if I am here on strangers 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:58.639
 size matters easier here no says 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.500
 or can you just pull that 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.989
 You can do teams made session like that 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.169
 stretch this year into the theater 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:17.880
 video though not me very much with 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:19.889
 black bars are not there yet 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.229
 something else, for example, is now 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.270
 we see here is a jogger of 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.220
 Union was not following him 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.830
 hd or you are stinging the part 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.539
 Dangers are partly the color 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.750
 not explicitly us on and so forth 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:39.539
 Just count under video way here 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.780
 and just correct the effect studio 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.000
 rbg in computer heritage is easy 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.419
 click on it already you can see that the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.360
 colors clearly stand out here 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.810
 Of course, this is also possible with many 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:01.270
 Many other effects use them for this 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.620
 You can also use the magic bullet with that 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.480
 already in things with the video make 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.200
 or calories is also with others 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.640
 effects 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.320
 but that was the point now 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.030
 not for that I will be different later 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.590
 again make a more detailed tutorial 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:19.620
 yes and it finally happened 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.620
 fallen and then yes
