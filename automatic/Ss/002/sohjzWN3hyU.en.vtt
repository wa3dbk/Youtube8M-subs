00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
it warranted a live stream because it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.290 
it warranted a live stream because it
wasn't<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.280> enthralling<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.610> an<00:02:18.730> episode

great<00:02:31.470> Amy's<00:02:32.470> choice<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.280> thought<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.850> was<00:02:34.060> a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
great Amy's choice I thought this was a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.090 
great Amy's choice I thought this was a
pretty<00:02:34.330> cool<00:02:34.450> filler<00:02:34.959> episode<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.890> dream

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
pretty cool filler episode the dream

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.070 
pretty cool filler episode the dream
Lord<00:02:36.310> was<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.640> creep<00:02:36.940> like<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.450> creep<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> half

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
Lord was a creep like a creep and a half

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.540 
Lord was a creep like a creep and a half
and<00:02:38.350> obviously<00:02:38.770> this<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.190> first<00:02:39.400> episode

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
and obviously this is the first episode

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.120 
and obviously this is the first episode
that<00:02:39.850> we<00:02:39.910> see<00:02:40.060> Rory<00:02:40.300> die<00:02:40.770> even<00:02:41.770> though<00:02:41.800> he<00:02:41.980> dies

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
that we see Rory die even though he dies

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.800 
that we see Rory die even though he dies
again<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.730> two<00:02:42.850> episodes<00:02:42.940> later<00:02:43.360> but<00:02:43.720> this

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
again like two episodes later but this

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.660 
again like two episodes later but this
is<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.110> first<00:02:44.290> time<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.680> he<00:02:44.770> dies<00:02:44.920> it's

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
is like the first time that he dies it's

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.580 
is like the first time that he dies it's
really<00:02:45.850> sad<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.360> was<00:02:46.570> really<00:02:47.110> really<00:02:47.290> sad

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590
