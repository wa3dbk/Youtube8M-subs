see I'm using four of them and that's
among<00:01:59.250> two<00:01:59.700> computers<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> between<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.189> four

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
among two computers so between the four

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.100 
among two computers so between the four
computer<00:02:02.790> between<00:02:03.240> these<00:02:03.360> two<00:02:03.570> computers<00:02:03.990> and

want to you go to data exchange the
drag-and-drop<00:02:39.460> file<00:02:40.030> system<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.570> super<00:02:41.020> fast

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
drag-and-drop file system is super fast

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.530 
drag-and-drop file system is super fast
you<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:41.500> drag<00:02:41.920> drop<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.670> really<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.180> you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
you just drag drop you really have you

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.690 
you just drag drop you really have you
rarely<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:44.020> problems<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.580> have

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
rarely have problems and then you have

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.190 
rarely have problems and then you have
network<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:46.240> you're<00:02:46.390> if<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.810> have<00:02:46.900> more<00:02:47.080> than

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
network if you're if you have more than

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.780 
network if you're if you have more than
one<00:02:47.380> person<00:02:47.710> on<00:02:47.800> your<00:02:47.890> network<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.400> can<00:02:48.580> put<00:02:48.760> a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
one person on your network you can put a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.090 
one person on your network you can put a
password<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.390> protect<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.500> check<00:02:50.800> out<00:02:50.920> one

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
password to protect it you check out one

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.310 
password to protect it you check out one
for<00:02:51.280> updates<00:02:51.580> it's<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.940> pretty<00:02:52.150> basic<00:02:52.420> setup

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
for updates it's a pretty basic setup

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.760 
for updates it's a pretty basic setup
for<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.860> for<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.450> options<00:02:55.450> menu<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.810> now

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
for the for the options menu and now

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.600 
for the for the options menu and now
here's<00:02:57.070> where<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.220> can<00:02:57.340> turn<00:02:57.430> off<00:02:57.580> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
here's where you can turn off the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.010 
here's where you can turn off the
dimming<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.270> that<00:02:58.390> we<00:02:58.480> don't<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.810> worry

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
dimming so that we don't have to worry

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.700 
dimming so that we don't have to worry
about<00:02:59.260> that

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
about that

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.250 
about that
so<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.490> once<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.630> just<00:03:01.840> uncheck<00:03:02.020> that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
so you just once you just uncheck that

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.050 
so you just once you just uncheck that
box<00:03:02.560> I'll<00:03:02.830> say<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.040> stay<00:03:03.400> light<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.910> then
