00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.560
 health then I wanted you to see how 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.240
 I see the extensions with criticism 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.390
 those with clips and I'm in here 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.740
 anyway soon in fact on this side 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.050
 in a little while you will see them let me see e 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 are the station boards bo in the video for 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.250
 then dominatrix halloween where 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
 held the role of the dominatrix 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.080
 just for halloween first though 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.720
 show it and go to the tutorial 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.420
 the real ones where I show you 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.370
 as an element I wanted to wear 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.949
 make a small introduction to his 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.229
 sincere I am completely sincere 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.089
 I don't wear extensions in mine 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.460
 everyday life practically not 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.129
 I never wear I know there are many 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.750
 girls interested precisely in the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.339
 extension shields for a head of hair 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.019
 however long flowing volume e 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.120
 so I thought he could 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.850
 be interested in this video and then 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.840
 just to prove the ex is just joly 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.930
 that I have I am made to who then how 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.579
 see above there are all these 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.759
 clips that just open and close 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.259
 so basically we have to thread 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.090
 the clips in the hair 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.180
 however in the tutorial I will show you 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.549
 well and it's also a unique thing 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.579
 which I really like because it's true that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.109
 now I don't wear extensions anymore 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.780
 my everyday life though 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.670
 past you wear them too much done 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.060
 right across the board in xensource hair 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.399
 braids of all colors 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.189
 so really here I can say that 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.500
 however I have experience nodes effect also 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.479
 if now he no longer wears it 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.550
 this is what I said is a band 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.920
 unique and it is a very thing 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.470
 will say why I hate that clip extensa 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.870
 that are divided by different bands therefore 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.020
 they put themselves under the four back bands 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.369
 another 23 laterally and is truly a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.670
 casino apart from that of no head 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.890
 precisely because they create volume 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.110
 they are not different layers and therefore not me 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.700
 like this i have brand 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.280
 that in of extensions of here I put them 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.460
 interpol training below and this one 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.980
 band if I remember correctly it is 150 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.100
 euro and in my opinion it is a good relationship 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.740
 quality price because apart from that it goes well 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.600
 I am real hair I must say that then there is 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.430
 there are so many and therefore its own 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.210
 surely here is a beautiful thing 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.860
 effect because the hair will be much more 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.050
 voluminous thick as well as obviously 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.970
 long then to the long many understand 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.730
 now I don't remember excuse the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.500
 precisely of this length 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.300
 piece here I should go and check 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.170
 case but half a written in 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.120
 overlay 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.210
 so this in my opinion and with a good one 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.220
 value nothing so 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.620
 all this now I leave you with the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.420
 tutorial where he shows me exactly how 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.150
 I apply that really easy for 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.560
 Scanzi many of you had already been to 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.930
 the note I hope the same as the video 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.620
 of useful tones and fully demonstrate 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.620
 that the result 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.340
 first make sure you have the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.250
 combed your hair so that 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.470
 there are no knots in your hair 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:29.930
 ok and then go to separate them and note 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.240
 second is a unique band like it has 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.220
 shown in the beginning of the video is enough 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.130
 precisely that he read only one parent 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.300
 once with the comb cone make a beautiful one 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.360
 line 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.850
 I would say a little above the ear then 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.960
 let's say where the temples are then 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:58.850
 here is fine as the comb from 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:04:02.750
 poles and then put aside 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:07.850
 with a clothespin this hair over 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.530
 so ok so we have those 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.410
 here our line to the right I do not 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.239
 living but I hope it is a distance 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.880
 straight and take my band of 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.230
 extension and I go of course as you will have 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.330
 intuition to attack all these clips 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.300
 along the line we say that it is therefore 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.180
 since they are five in the middle 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.790
 obviously I'm going to position it right 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.260
 in the middle for the head and it would be 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.000
 preferring to comb your hair 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.920
 but to apply it is governed to apply 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.110
 and the clips I don't do it because 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.300
 anyway after the huge with the I hold on 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.040
 mot however if you want them to resist 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.500
 at the sole for many hours it would be better 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.410
 preferable at the very least then cotton 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.560
 hair so I'm going to attack mine 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:01.400
 click 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:06.320
 ok and then there's one here at the bottom that goes 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.180
 obviously a little more laterally then 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.830
 as you really see the game from 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.830
 very simple guys 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:23.180
 the last so open here and now 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.000
 I can go and remove the signs 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:31.130
 you suffer and your skill is up to you 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.320
 try to mix well in 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.440
 so that it looks like we say a body 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.590
 only node I know if I explained myself 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.270
 in the other themes so hair then the 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.720
 mind with an even more natural effect 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.510
 style extension and wavy ones cha 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.760
 cha changes that you then to adapt them e 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.560
 make the hair wishful yet it says with 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.900
 the research as precisely the form of the 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.510
 f so they are the most 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.810
 natural as possible and therefore nothing 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:03.729
 this then resulted from behind me 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:07.089
 I don't hope they happened 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.550
 as you can see they are just two minutes now 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:11.249
 so here is how you see I am 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.689
 transforms are transformed then 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.999
 suddenly long hair 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.710
 I think I never had them in mine 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:21.430
 life so long hair even 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.860
 right up almost to the sides 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.949
 therefore in any case sonorously 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:30.159
 I think it's good quality there are 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:32.469
 just different brands of you have to see 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:34.719
 a little you depending on the relationship 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:38.020
 Price quality is and I hope to have you 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:38.770
 given some useful advice about the 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.569
 extension 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.159
 I hope you enjoyed the video and 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.599
 nothing then we see ourselves in 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.680
 next video obviously with hair 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.680
 shorter
