scag on my 40 horse Johnson had been
torn<00:00:07.740> up<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.519> mean<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.150> was<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.719> third<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.679> was

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
torn up I mean it was a third of it was

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.060 
torn up I mean it was a third of it was
missing<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.809> it<00:00:12.809> didn't<00:00:13.530> even<00:00:13.620> go<00:00:13.740> down<00:00:13.860> as

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
missing and it didn't even go down as

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.609 
missing and it didn't even go down as
far<00:00:14.099> as<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.519> was<00:00:14.610> supposed<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:15.059> go<00:00:15.619> causing

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
far as it was supposed to go causing

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.700 
far as it was supposed to go causing

the<00:00:29.250> skate<00:00:29.519> guard<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.420> gag<00:00:30.660> guard<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.920> a

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the skate guard this gag guard is it's a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.209 
the skate guard this gag guard is it's a
little<00:00:32.250> over<00:00:32.430> $100<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.210> believe<00:00:33.480> which<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
little over $100 I believe which for a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.639 
little over $100 I believe which for a
small<00:00:35.700> piece<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.030> metal<00:00:36.270> scenes<00:00:36.570> may<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
small piece of metal scenes may be a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.889 
small piece of metal scenes may be a
little<00:00:37.890> pricey<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.760> extremely<00:00:39.030> well

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
little pricey but it is extremely well

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.690 
little pricey but it is extremely well
manufactured<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.190> take<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> look<00:00:41.640> at

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
manufactured when you take a look at

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.209 
manufactured when you take a look at
this<00:00:41.790> thing<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.149> close<00:00:42.590> you'll<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this thing up close you'll see that it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.150 
this thing up close you'll see that it
it's<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.910> quality<00:00:45.390> built<00:00:45.800> piece<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.950> stainless

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
it's a quality built piece of stainless

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.950 
it's a quality built piece of stainless
steel<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.940> after<00:00:48.860> using<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
steel and after using it for I want to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.029 
steel and after using it for I want to
say<00:00:52.020> six<00:00:52.350> months<00:00:52.410> now

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
say six months now

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.209 
say six months now
the<00:00:53.250> sky<00:00:53.460> guards<00:00:53.760> done<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.180> good<00:00:54.420> job<00:00:55.219> so

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the sky guards done a really good job so

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.680 
the sky guards done a really good job so
here<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:57.739> stainless<00:00:58.739> steel<00:01:00.320> and

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
here it is stainless steel and

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.179 
here it is stainless steel and
essentially<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:05.720> closes<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.040> old

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
essentially it closes the the the old

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.700 
essentially it closes the the the old
scag<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.790> long<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.060> you've<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:10.619> know

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
scag and as long as you've got you know

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.539 
scag and as long as you've got you know
this<00:01:11.189> portion<00:01:11.760> maybe<00:01:12.119> from<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:14.340> can

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
this portion maybe from here up you can

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
this portion maybe from here up you can
install<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:17.780> just<00:01:18.780> took<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
install it I think but just took a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.929 
install it I think but just took a
couple<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.470> drilling<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.220> couple<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> holes<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
couple of drilling a couple of holes I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.109 
couple of drilling a couple of holes I
had<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> drill<00:01:21.450> right<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.119> through

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
had to drill right here and here through

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.249 
had to drill right here and here through
the<00:01:24.439> through<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> scag<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:27.630> did<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the through the scag and I did that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.749 
the through the scag and I did that
really<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> did<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.159> hammered<00:01:29.579> this

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
really all I did was I hammered this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
really all I did was I hammered this
piece<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> sleeve<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
piece on and it's just a sleeve that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.100 
piece on and it's just a sleeve that
goes<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.540> drill<00:01:33.750> two

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
goes up to here and then you drill two

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.039 
goes up to here and then you drill two
holes<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.540> comes<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
holes in it and it comes with this

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.319 
holes in it and it comes with this
hardware<00:01:37.290> these<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.770> meant<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.759> break<00:01:39.030> loose

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
hardware these are meant to break loose

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.090 
hardware these are meant to break loose
in<00:01:39.600> case<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.900> ever<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.560> hit<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.829> gig

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
in case you ever really hit this gig

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.700 
in case you ever really hit this gig
hard<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.729> rip<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.180> whole<00:01:42.329> thing

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
hard so you don't rip the whole thing

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.080 
hard so you don't rip the whole thing
rip<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> rest<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.310> guy<00:01:44.520> off<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> boat

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
rip the rest of this guy off the boat

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.639 
rip the rest of this guy off the boat
they're<00:01:45.299> intended<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> break<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
they're intended to break so that's I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
they're intended to break so that's I
guess<00:01:49.920> great<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.170> it's<00:01:52.170> also<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.119> it's<00:01:54.119> hard

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
guess great and it's also this it's hard

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.580 
guess great and it's also this it's hard
to<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> pictures<00:01:55.020> online<00:01:55.200> when<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
to see in the pictures online when I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.310 
to see in the pictures online when I
purchased<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> good

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
purchased it see if I can get a good

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.890 
purchased it see if I can get a good
picture<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> there<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.130> go

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.390 

so<00:02:03.900> that's<00:02:04.080> welded<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.770> bottom<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.220> it

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
so that's welded on to the bottom of it

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.540
