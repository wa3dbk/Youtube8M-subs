 left text primal robby madison with 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.630
 young years was fond of moto races and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 surfing in his new tricks he 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.210
 miraculously combined these two 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.210
 sport 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.830
 australian motocross king 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.660
 went to the island of tahiti where is she 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.759
 slightly modernized tales became 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.650
 surf the sea motorcycle 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.870
 maximum protected from water and wheels 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.790
 attached not big wings turned 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.530
 that at a speed of over 80 kilometers in 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.460
 hour the car does not sink and slides on 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.199
 water surface 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.910
 however, this approach only works on 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.650
 calm sea to conquer the wave 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.930
 Robbie had to slow down and 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.489
 show real skill 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.860
 surfer not all attempts were successful 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.519
 one of the big waves nearly killed 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.519
 extremal 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.920
 again before the Jew was test up 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.900
 counter wave picked me up and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.910
 turned over a bike hit in the back 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.430
 a few minutes I was under water only 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.320
 a couple of times could take a breath of air then me 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.380
 still managed to surface and 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.120
 I was saved 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.560
 Robbie Maddison not only successfully performed 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.150
 in motocross competitions and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.860
 Mototrial y but often amazed 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 imagination fans are insane 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.460
 tricks for example he made the jump with 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.920
 olympic ski jump 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.350
 flying 114 meters and the height of the jump 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.800
 amounted to 56 meters probably normal 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.630
 the road 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.490
 for Australians too boring and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.440
 so he travels easily 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.479
 bobsleigh track and course 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.729
 fans are excited about the staged 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.470
 the hooks of the rabbi be it a jump over avar 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.960
 bridge or somersault through triumphal 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.610
 Madisonâ€™s arch craftsmanship can be seen and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.259
 to the cinema as a stuntman he was 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.130
 involved in one of the last parts 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.130
 bondiana 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.880
 Robbie Maddison's gorgeous tricks and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.709
 other extreme shows that 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.300
 motorcycle is really universal 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.920
 vehicles after due 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.200
 bike training you can ride 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.209
 on almost any surface on 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.060
 motocross and moto trial 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.340
 riders with visible ease rides on 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.170
 mud stones and trees as well 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.120
 conquer city tracks for racing 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.610
 deep sand requires only special 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.100
 tires are important not to overheat so as not to 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.230
 bury the car dune ice or snow also 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.600
 not a barrier to motorcycle racer 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.390
 this zeos you even make thorns for 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.489
 road bikes to plow ice 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.799
 tracks 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.140
 we can only guess what else 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.180
 come up with desperate moto extreme fans and 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 quite reasonably to think about the conquest 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.980
 cosmos but why not actually
