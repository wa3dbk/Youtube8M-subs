00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.940 
like i said i'll take you through it
step<00:01:49.720> by<00:01:49.930> step<00:01:50.050> so<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.470> really<00:01:50.680> don't<00:01:50.740> have<00:01:50.890> to

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
step by step so you really don't have to

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.530 
step by step so you really don't have to
worry<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.700> only<00:01:51.850> thing<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.060> need<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.270> keep<00:01:52.390> in

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
worry the only thing you need to keep in

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.940 
worry the only thing you need to keep in
mind<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.900> that<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.170> should<00:01:53.320> use<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:53.560> as<00:01:53.800> i
