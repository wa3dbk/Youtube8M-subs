00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.480
 Romstedt is still searching for his own on the internet 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 generally should get 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 slightly improved shape 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.450
 reclined 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.270

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.920
 Kelheim 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.710
 the pope asked 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.710
 Let me guess the researchers in their industry 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.860

 There are 80 text passages kept safely hidden in the year 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.879
 but it should be even more 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.549
 to 13 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.549
 by percent 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.869

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.059
 the positive 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.649
 as a celebrity 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:51.919
 Therefore, be careful 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.349
 Raphael Thelen 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.349
 that does not do him justice 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.629
 and here is 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.259
 this also has some reason to start going off 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.999
 that demanded Roth 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.509
 put there 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.249

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.409
 that is it 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.909
 Truth noisy I understand this is the last pass 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.699
 Oh, now it's still chic Schick contains 2 but the student did not care 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.229

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.379
 there is the door 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.229
 more the two doors are open 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.180

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.039
 now we can do that 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.559

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.270
 visually and sometimes 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.889
 I'm not feeling well 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.889
 I'm not going crazy on Iran now I'm not crazy 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.270
