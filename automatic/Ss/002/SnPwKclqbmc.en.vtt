00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.979
 Paris 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.289
 delays that accumulate users who no longer hesitate to complain 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.200
 is seen to strike the presentation of the tickets 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.360
 sncf at the beginning of 2011 is in turmoil she decided to 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.610
 react by presenting a plan for 12 lines deemed sick to talk about on 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.410
 this plateau the number one sncf guillaume pÃ©py signs are being 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.200
 so you have you said defined of twelve nomadic sick lines who we 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.340
 interested in the region and the coral line and back by relaying paris and the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.080
 line tgv tours-paris% and the content of the plan is even more crazy a little crazy in 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.060
 any case regarding the mining investments ads that 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.140
 have been made to know about better information of travelers or 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.310
 the reliability of the rolling stock will these ads be sufficient a 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.830
 percent and improve service on its lines 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.370
 she really does not know to announce work me I'm for 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.630
 from those who think that 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.810
 the users have reasons to declare themselves dissatisfied with this or that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.320
 lineage at a particular moment 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.720
 binds him to a strike 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.450
 it's hard for me november and then there was the snowy episode 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.550
 first of all i was railway workers who worked like crazy during the period 97% 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.030
 trains went around nobody slept on the ground in the train stations have 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.010
 routed from the world 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.290
 unfortunately with delays stretching from external to 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.420
 the Montreal company internally 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.409
 for the cgt what will decide what the himalaya even purchase of% hardware 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.380
 during that time 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.460
 we heard about better information for travelers of a 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.460
 survey satisfaction near the reliefs of the country 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.500
 if today there are problems you had quoted him back on the air in 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.260
 Paris or on the TGV Paris-Tours it's because we have problems 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.490
 laws we have hardware problems 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.560
 we have problems in the stations we have a lot of things that are 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.299
 accumulated it's a bit of a growth crisis so how do we solve the 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.330
 problem so we take a good diagnosis 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.300
 in fact a serious action plan with everyone including associations 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.040
 consumers and the elected officials and we made a financial tour de table and 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.940
 has been announced, that is to say, a very concrete step I take a 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.659
 example 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.480
 there are places in which we can certainly 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.629
 y locomotives to other places on which the rail network of france which 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.349
 is network owner can do some work to have a signage 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.629
 or a more reliable power supply and then we're in charge of 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.319
 better inform customers and better take care of them in train stations and 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.290
 all out of cash does not have an organizational problem - lack of staff sncf 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.919
 as it says if it unions 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.229
 It could happen 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.299
 that it is necessary to reinforce the manpower me I have no taboo the tuque 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.409
 strengthen the workforce it seems to me zone only the technical problems 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.740
 so this is an overall plan 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.069
 p the important point you quoted it 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.399
 is that I think it takes to regain some of the heart of 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.739
 travelers and have confidence and for that 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.489
 we will put all this plan 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.879
 under the control of travelers what will have a satisfaction barometer all 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.519
 the months and we see named in the next few days it's their sign the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.559
 regional director who will do it 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.069
 a manager 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.069
 consumers on each of its lines 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:14.840
 the representative decided to gm are not satisfied by these ads 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.780
 % will sncf make progress on the compensation file users 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.400
 allow me this is the reverse in the press conference that took place there 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.489
 a few hours ago 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.260
 the representatives of the associations found the meeting constructive 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.010
 say that we made two announcements the expectations of compensation two 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.989
 ads that are very clear 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.440
 for subscribers 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.699
 fixed price 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:40.189
 paris tours so who use the train at very high speed the meeting which 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.260
 held this afternoon allowed 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.489
 to decide a compensation 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.290
 2 206 euros for each traveler and then second decision that was 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.509
 taken and who explain the associations 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.629
 think it's rather constructive 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.779
 there will be no rate increase for package subscribers in 2011 and 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:01.010
 is determined to meet again with the associations in a few months to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.059
 continue the dialogue and see if we have actually been able to bring 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:07.669
 improvements after the 26 percent increase for blood and urinating the 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.659
 price of the subscription since 2002 anyway on the line while putting in 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:11.829
 before 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:12.769
 highlighting 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.230
 this is not the very important thing is that the confessions of the subscribers we 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.079
 request to go 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.689
 we look 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:18.829
 the rules 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.249
 compensation 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:23.949
 The subscriber suffered several delays in succession and on this 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.439
 barbare dalibard the boss of the tgv is committed to working with the 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.839
 associations is good news so when we are in a plane 

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:34.809
 who die while it cost several million euros wanted that 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.060
 associated with the holiday and the regions 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.810
 regions that already reads exemption invests heavily in nests in the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.270
 new hardware ter 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.289
 Does it begin as a contribution to encourage investment in this plan? 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.610
 regions already invest them in danger not for ambition of their 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.599
 ask for money in that I thought that here in the central region 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.909
 he had a huge effort to develop such acts and I want 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.610
 greet because all the elected officials support him and then 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.139
 but very concrete decisions have been taken 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.779
 here in the region 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.389
 the trains 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.659
 chartres le mans who are old train 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.539
 you will be replaced by new works in 2013 and that will be the new 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.229
 rare to this two-story coral man 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.089
 who will know them in seven regions that will be a pioneer region so I 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:18.410
 welcomes the commitment of the elected 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.680
 but today we have to go back to flat 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.330
 to reduce the rail system in the region on these two lines 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.289
 and we will do this of course with the users and with the elected officials who are 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.300
 the organizing authority can say that 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.289
 the stops 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.740
 frequencies how the train is operated it is she who the 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.309
 decided 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.919
 so for 100 euros you talk about the new 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.790
 the astana milf what it's like 5,700 dead 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.520
 we come back we'll see this man 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.590
 after for example the decision of eurostar percent a company 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.440
 maritime and sncf is the majority to quickly take 10'39 donors from 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.620
 lessons and to give you a precise figure the sncf we have 530 oars of 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.740
 tGV 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.620
 how many are there in the stoma years to 530 but in the very things 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.909
 important today it's true that I'm a fighter either for example 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.409
 for 135 new jobs to be purchased 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.759
 we are here 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.139
 esker percent remaining but well placed 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.389
 Moscow thinks earlier in the year 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.449
 the decisions have for regional trains are always made by the 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.780
 elected but it is the opportunity it is necessary at all costs for the tgv the new tgv 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.289
 relieved but did the scene have bought friends we bought the 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.199
 gv since we are today partner in italy of a company 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.190
 new and we have been with this company alsace news stolen 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.749
 I'm sure I would have 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:34.449
 we could attend in front of you it's also the opportunity is given because 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:35.169
 I am in turn 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.900
 we talk a lot about trains that do not arrive on time it's normal 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.940
 but we must also insist on everything that happens in this region of 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.779
 positive 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.169
 electrification bourges-saincaize 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.680
 it's something we've been waiting for for a few decades and the closure of 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.879
 little stations pass winamp all that will be discussed we are in the process 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.919
 install displays that allow you to have the right schedules of 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:54.460
 train 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.930
 in 77 stations in the area so we made an extra effort and then 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.659
 I was hit today 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:01.990
 the train station 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.330
 and in the midst of the work that will last a few years we will fully 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.069
 renovate 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.490
 we get the tram with elected officials along the Garonne is a 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.389
 new train station which after keeping the years we are in the process of 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.560
 be born so I talked about women without stars I also like 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.000
 by the stage before the hour thank you very much and guillaume Pepy came back on this 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 plateau all types of programs on territory very good evening 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:25.409
 Why
