00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.890
 they are simply going to give 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.290
 right and in the option that says execute 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.240

 installing the application is totally 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.960

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.670
 good problem once installed them 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.830

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.030
