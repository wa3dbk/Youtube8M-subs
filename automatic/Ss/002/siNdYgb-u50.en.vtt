00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870

fireballs<00:03:22.320> on<00:03:22.440> them<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.890> then<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.459> backtrack

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
fireballs on them and then I backtrack

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.610 
fireballs on them and then I backtrack
back<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.390> bonfire<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.870> got<00:03:25.110> my<00:03:25.260> shit<00:03:25.440> back

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
back to the bonfire I got my shit back

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.810 
back to the bonfire I got my shit back
and<00:03:25.830> then<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:25.950> went<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.310> know<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.489> different

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
and then I went you know a different

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.400 
and then I went you know a different
direction<00:03:27.090> kind<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.750> thing<00:03:27.900> they're<00:03:28.200> fully

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
direction kind of thing they're fully

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.590 
direction kind of thing they're fully
restored<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.400> guess<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.150> easier<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.510> that

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
restored so I guess it's easier in that

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.520 
restored so I guess it's easier in that
sense<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.440> must<00:03:31.620> be<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.769> lot<00:03:32.130> easier<00:03:32.459> just<00:03:33.530> you

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
sense it must be a lot easier just you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.110 
sense it must be a lot easier just you
know<00:03:34.650> with<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.190> effect<00:03:35.489> because<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:36.000> I

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
know with that in effect because like I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.640 
know with that in effect because like I
