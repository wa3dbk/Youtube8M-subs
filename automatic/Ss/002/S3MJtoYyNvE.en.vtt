00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 succeed his life three words that hold 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.009
 our attention 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.990
 but what success are we talking about 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.940
 much succeeding his life boils down to 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.559
 have a job to place well paid 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.980
 with a big house and a beautiful 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.320
 car 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 however, this would be more likely to succeed 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.690
 in life 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.609
 although I hope that those who have seen 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
 my package on money and happiness 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.689
 will be that this is by no means this 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.789
 but then let's get on with it 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.720
 she knows what to do with her life 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.849
 believe for now 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.619
 let's start with a simple exercise to 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.539
 do I ask you to estimate your 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 degree of satisfaction of your life 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.320
 current on 10 then following that you 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.649
 you will ask the question I miss 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.050
 he 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.610
 I need to get there at 10:10 which 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.170
 are my needs what are my desires 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.910
 what are my desires for this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 figure increases and then you have to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.420
 ask the question how to do 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.129
 to solve at the cement that I just 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.170
 find because if you stay on the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.149
 why why 7 out of 10 for example 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.890
 because I do not have that because I 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.989
 do not stay focused on your 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 problems in your brain if you do not 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.859
 give him no direction to take 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 turn around and this will entail 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.670
 a lot of frustration those who have 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.199
 does this exercise seriously about 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.760
 that it makes a lot of sense to understand 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.229
 really what we miss 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 because unfortunately nowadays 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.010
 the human do not stop even for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 reflect on one's own life the person 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.650
 that you are today is the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 result of the choices you made 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.040
 in the past unconsciously or not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.049
 I propose a metaphor that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.729
 could help you when you decide 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.830
 to build a wall you do not start 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.540
 not to build a wall it does not take 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.520
 not to say to myself I will create the most beautiful 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.320
 and the most magnificent wall that has ever 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 been built so do not start 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.560
 by that we must rather say to ourselves 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 today I'm going to ask is the price 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.369
 in the best way possible and make 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 this every day we all lived 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 in the past more situations or 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.439
 less painful we all wanted 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.180
 at one time or another she 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.680
 never happened and we are 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.660
 always happy 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.400
 reality is not like that the reality 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.140
 is that these situations did indeed 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.120
 existed and can not change anything 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.010
 on the other hand what we can change is 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.660
 our way of seeing this situation and 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.310
 to ask yourself the right questions 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.050
 our quality of life will depend on 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.210
 questions we will ask ourselves as 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.380
 what lessons can we draw from it 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.960
 not enough to be smart or 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.729
 graduates to succeed it takes above all 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.740
 find his place understand what he is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.789
 important to enrich and enrich us 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.740
 the world around us 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.240
 generally those who succeed 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.630
 do not necessarily have something in 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.220
 more 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.020
 they especially found what was 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.820
 important to them they invested with 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.410
 passion and were not afraid of failure 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.150
 when I examine people around me 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.860
 who have succeeded are those who have 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.780
 clarified their needs that dared 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.940
 think outside the box without fear 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.489
 setbacks and who used a lot 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.680
 of energy having a high qi is not enough 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.780
 not to succeed you need a good quotient 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.190
 intellectual certainly but also a good 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.590
 social and emotional intelligence 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.030
 with a high intelligence quotient but 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.310
 the impossibility of forming relationships 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.140
 to understand others and the world that 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.540
 surrounds us or the lack of motivation 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.010
 and of passion you will not succeed us 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.570
 have all a list of banned from 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.950
 brake that must be overcome 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.290
 we have a small inner voice 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.000
 which tends to belittle us I did not 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.470
 not competence I do not come from the 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.150
 nice middle I got less intelligent 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.610
 that my colleague etc 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.959
 add to that a certain pessimism that 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.519
 freezes people in the situation 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.989
 in which she is 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.459
 there is a lot of talent 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.049
 do not result in people who are not 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.060
 not in their place all because they do not 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.959
 are not optimistic enough about 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.549
 chances of success 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.260
 Successful people have seized 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.640
 opportunities when they get 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.590
 had to be in a state 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.480
 of mind to provoke the opportunities and 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.430
 do not be afraid to grab them when 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.910
 they show themselves not to fear the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.590
 chess 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.760
 I will add that the odds are not 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.260
 always those that we believe and 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.950
 can hide in events 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.290
 negative 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.850
 for example a dismissal or a refusal 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.920
 for after they will bring people to 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.900
 rethink their existence changed lives 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.730
 and again you have to know how to grasp 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.019
 opportunities is very attentive to 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.940
 chances that they pass by know the 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.100
 detect and sometimes grab them 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.600
 immediately on the moment we say 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.340
 often it is necessary to live the present day 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.019
 as if tomorrow was the last 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.550
 it's true that it helps to have a 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.470
 beautiful life 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.240
 but it's also selfishness when we have 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.860
 children for example we are obliged to 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.880
 think about their future to put them on 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.920
 a favorable slope 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.510
 I advise you to live the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.640
 present day as an opportunity to create 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.170
 memories that will remain engraved 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.730
 will be able to create memories with 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.500
 your children who will thank you more 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.630
 late do not forget that the present is 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.490
 ephemeral and that the past and lasting and 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.140
 will be there until you die 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.690
 never happy that in happiness we 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.430
 give given is to receive food it is 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.870
 to learn to love yesterday you must not 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.010
 wait to be perfect to start 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.410
 something good 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.670
 a perfect life is impossible one does not 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.590
 can not lend himself what he is 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.780
 unthinkable to do everything in a day 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 to do nothing at all the role of all being 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.870
 human is to prove that the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.400
 world is not without reasons 1 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.320
 we all have so many reasons to 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.790
 live that enough to live a lot of 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.860
 retirees today are rushing to the 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.570
 travel associations one deals army 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.100
 the activity filling the agents 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.540
 thanh minister because they understood that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.400
 long-term inactivity is 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.300
 deadly boring destructive and 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.250
 without any charm 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.050
 the true flavor of rest can be appreciated 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.550
 who after a period of intense activity 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.650
 that's why you need to know 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.180
 forget your age when you're young 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.470
 is still too young and when one is 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.000
 old we are still too old 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.560
 do not forget we are all children 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.140
 in the soul whatever our age 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.000
 and then hope of course the clean of 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.590
 man one must need to dream and 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.480
 that tomorrow will be better than today 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.370
 always have hope 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.320
 go out and feel the pulse of society 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.390
 is rather than leaving this one in 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.220
 shoot your dreams by his influence 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.620
 you never discourage discipline and 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.410
 you avoid scattering yourself insisted 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.300
 Be Steady persevering be proud 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.830
 of your successes and accept chess 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.080
 because they are often informative 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.550
 do not complain but act on them 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.100
 verbs that come to my mind are 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.110
 reflect observed is realized at and 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.730
 reasoned to want to act 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.260
 do not be afraid to go from 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.000
 the front the only thing we need 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.800
 to be afraid is fear itself 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.110
 we must not have regrets we must 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.880
 dare to be yourself follow his reason 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.510
 to be doing what we like to be 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.640
 satisfied with our life 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.260
 no tea and do not stress the 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.730
 no one you will be in the future 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.650
 depends on the choices you will make in 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.840
 from now on we all live in 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.610
 our inner world in priority and we 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.020
 interpreter we do not see the world such 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.310
 that he is and whoever surrounds us but 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.380
 send the world as we have 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.570
 learned to see it through adults 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.490
 of our childhood we must give up being 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.590
 not redo what I ask you for 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.900
 to finish is to think your life do the 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.310
 point and then you will see thank you to those 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.310
 who listened to me until the end 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.280
 we 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.060
 Oh
