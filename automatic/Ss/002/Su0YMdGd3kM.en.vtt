00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.170 

so<00:02:09.650> I<00:02:09.680> guess<00:02:10.100> when<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.310> get<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.610> here<00:02:10.880> I'm<00:02:11.030> gonna

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
so I guess when I get to here I'm gonna

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.900 
so I guess when I get to here I'm gonna
do<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.420> vertically<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.260> don't<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.650> that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
do it vertically so I don't have that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.860 
do it vertically so I don't have that
straight<00:02:13.910> line<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:17.000> we<00:02:17.180> feel<00:02:17.390> taste<00:02:17.630> from

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
straight line and we feel taste from

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:31.870 
straight line and we feel taste from
these<00:02:18.290> pieces

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.380 

so<00:02:32.420> I'm<00:02:32.720> around<00:02:33.500> 15<00:02:34.040> minutes<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.580> 15-20

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so I'm around 15 minutes in 15-20

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.310 
so I'm around 15 minutes in 15-20
minutes<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.080> look<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.870> can<00:02:39.020> see<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
minutes in and look you can see it

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.360 
minutes in and look you can see it
already<00:02:39.560> getting<00:02:40.130> lighter<00:02:40.460> I<00:02:40.730> think<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.420> I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
already getting lighter I think that I

00:02:42.370 --> 00:03:05.230 
already getting lighter I think that I
might<00:02:43.370> leave<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.670> on<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:43.790> 30<00:02:44.120> minutes<00:03:04.240> 25

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
might leave it on for 30 minutes 25

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.200 
might leave it on for 30 minutes 25
minutes<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.840> up<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.370> lot<00:03:07.550> lighter<00:03:07.790> I'm

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
minutes is up and it's a lot lighter I'm

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.180 
minutes is up and it's a lot lighter I'm
going<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.540> keep<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.410> in<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.620> match<00:03:09.890> I'm<00:03:10.070> gonna

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
going to keep it in a match I'm gonna
