actually going to introduce you to the
very<00:00:58.320> first<00:00:58.710> level<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> game<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> believe

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
very first level of the game I believe

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.549 
very first level of the game I believe
it<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.180> called<00:01:00.420> blind<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> says

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it is called blind and then it says

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.830 
it is called blind and then it says
press<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> holds<00:01:02.850> anywhere<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.510> move<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
press and holds anywhere to move in that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.630 
press and holds anywhere to move in that
direction<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.890> tap<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> right

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
direction so I'm gonna tap on the right

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.580 
direction so I'm gonna tap on the right
and<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and you can see that when I do that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
and you can see that when I do that
these<00:01:07.950> little<00:01:08.100> echoes<00:01:08.640> shoot<00:01:08.939> out<00:01:09.090> from<00:01:09.270> me

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
these little echoes shoot out from me

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.109 
these little echoes shoot out from me
and<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.900> back<00:01:09.930> left<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.740> again<00:01:11.119> this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and I can go back left to again this

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
and I can go back left to again this
game<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.750> super<00:01:13.260> cool<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.560> I've<00:01:13.830> never

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
game is super cool because I've never

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.580 
game is super cool because I've never
seen<00:01:14.250> anything<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.119> basically<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.320> move

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
seen anything like it basically you move

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.469 
seen anything like it basically you move
around<00:01:16.770> by<00:01:17.340> shooting<00:01:17.759> these<00:01:17.880> echoes<00:01:18.330> you're

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
around by shooting these echoes you're

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.090 
around by shooting these echoes you're
kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> bat<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.409> shoot<00:01:19.979> these

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
kind of like a bat you shoot these

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.010 
kind of like a bat you shoot these
echoes<00:01:20.490> around<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.000> walls<00:01:21.270> around<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
echoes around the walls around you to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
echoes around the walls around you to
see<00:01:22.320> where<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.590> want<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> go<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:23.970> when

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
see where you want to go and then when

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.850 
see where you want to go and then when
there's<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.360> huge<00:01:24.810> concentration<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.710> them

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
there's a huge concentration of them

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.410 
there's a huge concentration of them
like<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.310> where<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.060> bolder

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
like that where they get a lot bolder

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
like that where they get a lot bolder

there's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> few<00:01:40.140> more<00:01:40.320> tips<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.799> you'll

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there's a few more tips that you'll

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.190 
there's a few more tips that you'll
learn<00:01:41.100> along<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.460> way<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.479> example<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.960> level

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
learn along the way for example in level

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
learn along the way for example in level
2<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.530> learn<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.100> hold<00:01:44.369> down<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
2 you learn that when you hold down and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 
2 you learn that when you hold down and
press<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.329> hold<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.780> little<00:01:46.170> guy<00:01:46.290> it'll

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
press and hold on your little guy it'll

press and hold on your little guy it'll
actually<00:01:47.280> shoot<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> huge<00:01:48.420> wave<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> echo

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
actually shoot out a huge wave of echo

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.929 
actually shoot out a huge wave of echo
so<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.950> where<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> paths<00:01:50.549> lead

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
so you can see where the paths lead

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.389 
so you can see where the paths lead
before<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.170> start<00:01:52.680> moving<00:01:52.920> into
