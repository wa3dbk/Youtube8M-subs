lipo<00:04:12.920> or<00:04:13.340> there's<00:04:13.850> there's<00:04:14.180> two<00:04:14.390> connectors

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
lipo or there's there's two connectors

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.539 
lipo or there's there's two connectors
you'll<00:04:15.049> notice<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.440> use<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.769> robotis<00:04:16.190> battery

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
you'll notice to use the robotis battery

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.550 
you'll notice to use the robotis battery
system<00:04:16.880> if<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.299> choose<00:04:17.540> let's<00:04:18.320> take<00:04:18.530> a

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
system if you so choose let's take a

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.140 
system if you so choose let's take a
look<00:04:18.859> at<00:04:18.979> what<00:04:19.130> else<00:04:19.250> comes<00:04:19.609> in<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.880> kit<00:04:20.120> that

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
look at what else comes in the kit that

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.010 
look at what else comes in the kit that
we<00:04:20.419> can<00:04:20.630> plug<00:04:21.169> into<00:04:21.410> this<00:04:21.620> board<00:04:22.840> alright<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
we can plug into this board alright the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.390 
we can plug into this board alright the
first<00:04:24.200> thing<00:04:24.440> you'll<00:04:24.590> notice<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:25.099> they've

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
first thing you'll notice is they've

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.860 
first thing you'll notice is they've
given<00:04:25.669> us<00:04:26.000> a

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
given us a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.400 
given us a
a<00:04:26.930> battery<00:04:27.350> lead<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.580> we<00:04:28.729> can<00:04:29.030> solder<00:04:30.020> our

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
a battery lead so that we can solder our

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.879 
a battery lead so that we can solder our
lipo<00:04:30.979> battery<00:04:31.419> directly<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.840> this<00:04:33.050> lead<00:04:33.320> we

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
lipo battery directly to this lead we

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.010 
lipo battery directly to this lead we
don't<00:04:34.100> want<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.370> run<00:04:34.550> our<00:04:34.699> servos<00:04:35.150> off<00:04:35.479> of<00:04:35.810> the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
don't want to run our servos off of the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.170 
don't want to run our servos off of the
the<00:04:36.410> USB<00:04:36.860> directly<00:04:37.550> because<00:04:37.699> it<00:04:37.910> only<00:04:38.000> will

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
the USB directly because it only will

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.030 
the USB directly because it only will
provide<00:04:38.389> 500<00:04:38.660> milliamps<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.470> our<00:04:39.560> servos<00:04:39.860> may

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
provide 500 milliamps and our servos may

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.830 
provide 500 milliamps and our servos may
need<00:04:40.220> considerably<00:04:40.940> more<00:04:41.150> current<00:04:41.479> than<00:04:41.600> that

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
need considerably more current than that

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.659 
need considerably more current than that
so<00:04:42.290> we'll<00:04:42.530> we'll<00:04:42.949> want<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.190> run<00:04:43.340> an<00:04:43.430> external

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
so we'll we'll want to run an external

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.580 
so we'll we'll want to run an external
battery<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.240> run<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.479> dynamic<00:04:44.840> so<00:04:44.960> servos<00:04:45.290> we

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
battery to run the dynamic so servos we

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.960 
battery to run the dynamic so servos we
also<00:04:45.740> want<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.100> run<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.340> maybe<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.580> little<00:04:46.790> bit

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
also want to run the maybe a little bit

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.280 
also want to run the maybe a little bit
higher<00:04:47.120> voltage<00:04:47.540> than<00:04:47.570> 5<00:04:47.900> volts<00:04:48.139> they're

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
higher voltage than 5 volts they're

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.350 
higher voltage than 5 volts they're
they're<00:04:48.620> typically<00:04:49.040> tolerant<00:04:49.520> up<00:04:49.669> to<00:04:49.850> 14<00:04:50.210> 15

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
they're typically tolerant up to 14 15

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.270 
they're typically tolerant up to 14 15
volts<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.020> they<00:04:51.110> twelve<00:04:51.560> volts<00:04:51.860> is<00:04:51.979> what<00:04:52.010> is

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
volts and they twelve volts is what is

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.000 
volts and they twelve volts is what is
nominally<00:04:52.699> expect<00:04:53.380> let's<00:04:54.380> take<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.590> look<00:04:54.889> at

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
nominally expect let's take a look at

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.060 
nominally expect let's take a look at
what<00:04:55.160> else<00:04:55.280> comes<00:04:55.639> in<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.880> package<00:04:56.740> we've<00:04:57.740> got

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
what else comes in the package we've got

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.930 
what else comes in the package we've got
a<00:04:58.340> bag<00:04:59.030> of<00:04:59.360> connectors<00:05:00.229> and<00:05:00.620> this<00:05:01.460> bag<00:05:01.699> of

a bag of connectors and this bag of
connectors<00:05:02.510> contains<00:05:03.639> let's<00:05:04.639> take<00:05:05.090> a<00:05:05.120> quick

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
connectors contains let's take a quick

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.230 
connectors contains let's take a quick
look<00:05:05.930> at<00:05:06.139> what's<00:05:06.380> in<00:05:06.620> here<00:05:07.010> all<00:05:07.910> right<00:05:08.060> we've

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
look at what's in here all right we've

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.740 
look at what's in here all right we've
got<00:05:08.300> 2<00:05:08.930> point<00:05:09.650> 1<00:05:09.740> inch<00:05:10.100> male<00:05:10.490> headers<00:05:10.850> that<00:05:11.600> we

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
got 2 point 1 inch male headers that we

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.260 
got 2 point 1 inch male headers that we
can<00:05:11.960> use<00:05:12.229> for<00:05:12.620> those<00:05:12.800> unsoldered<00:05:13.580> pins<00:05:13.940> that

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
can use for those unsoldered pins that

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.100 
can use for those unsoldered pins that
we<00:05:14.419> showed<00:05:14.630> earlier<00:05:15.220> here<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.490> here<00:05:17.110> we've

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
we showed earlier here and here we've

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.890 
we showed earlier here and here we've
got<00:05:18.380> two<00:05:18.710> sets<00:05:19.490> of<00:05:19.699> 0.1<00:05:20.240> inch<00:05:20.449> female

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
got two sets of 0.1 inch female

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.200 
got two sets of 0.1 inch female
connectors<00:05:21.650> which<00:05:22.280> again<00:05:22.610> we<00:05:22.760> could<00:05:22.940> use<00:05:23.060> in

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
connectors which again we could use in

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.939 
connectors which again we could use in
the<00:05:23.270> same<00:05:23.419> place<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.260> think<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.590> lot<00:05:24.770> of<00:05:24.800> us

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
the same place and I think a lot of us

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.620 
the same place and I think a lot of us
have<00:05:25.130> gotten<00:05:25.340> used<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.699> prototyping<00:05:26.419> with

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
have gotten used to prototyping with

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.659 
have gotten used to prototyping with
these<00:05:26.810> point<00:05:27.139> 1<00:05:27.350> inch<00:05:27.560> female<00:05:28.100> connectors

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
these point 1 inch female connectors

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.310 
these point 1 inch female connectors
it's<00:05:28.880> very<00:05:29.090> easy<00:05:29.389> to<00:05:29.510> stick<00:05:29.780> wires<00:05:30.080> and

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
it's very easy to stick wires and

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.659 
it's very easy to stick wires and
components<00:05:30.800> directly<00:05:30.919> into<00:05:31.340> these<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.580> it

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
components directly into these and it

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.180 
components directly into these and it
makes<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.940> very<00:05:32.060> simple<00:05:32.180> for<00:05:32.479> prototyping

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
makes it very simple for prototyping

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.240 
makes it very simple for prototyping
we've<00:05:34.190> also<00:05:34.400> got<00:05:34.880> three<00:05:35.479> of<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:36.260> Dyna<00:05:37.070> Mixel

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
we've also got three of the Dyna Mixel

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.610 
we've also got three of the Dyna Mixel
TTL<00:05:40.250> level<00:05:40.550> connectors<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:41.270> we've<00:05:42.050> got<00:05:42.289> three

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
TTL level connectors and we've got three

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.650 
TTL level connectors and we've got three
small<00:05:42.680> connectors<00:05:43.550> which<00:05:43.789> which<00:05:44.030> may<00:05:44.570> not

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
small connectors which which may not

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.659 
small connectors which which may not
have<00:05:44.810> seen<00:05:45.020> very<00:05:45.260> much<00:05:45.500> but<00:05:46.070> these<00:05:46.250> are<00:05:46.460> for

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
have seen very much but these are for

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.510 
have seen very much but these are for
the<00:05:46.820> new<00:05:47.000> micro<00:05:47.539> servo<00:05:47.960> that<00:05:48.340> robotis<00:05:49.340> is

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
the new micro servo that robotis is

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.490 
the new micro servo that robotis is
putting<00:05:49.910> out<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.930> uses<00:05:51.080> a<00:05:51.260> slightly

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
putting out and it uses a slightly

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.339 
putting out and it uses a slightly
smaller<00:05:51.860> connection<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.729> save<00:05:53.000> weight

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
smaller connection to save weight

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.659 
smaller connection to save weight
alright<00:05:54.349> and<00:05:54.530> finally<00:05:54.770> we've<00:05:55.099> got<00:05:55.310> a<00:05:55.340> power

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
alright and finally we've got a power

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.700 
alright and finally we've got a power
switch<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:56.449> oh<00:05:56.599> boy<00:05:56.810> I<00:05:56.840> really<00:05:57.110> like<00:05:57.410> to<00:05:57.560> get<00:05:57.680> a

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
switch and oh boy I really like to get a

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.890 
switch and oh boy I really like to get a
real<00:05:58.070> solid<00:05:58.639> power<00:05:58.849> switch<00:05:59.210> on<00:05:59.330> my<00:05:59.539> controller

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
real solid power switch on my controller

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.300 
real solid power switch on my controller
board<00:06:00.020> that<00:06:00.229> sure<00:06:00.680> makes<00:06:00.830> things<00:06:01.099> a<00:06:01.160> lot

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
board that sure makes things a lot

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.040 
board that sure makes things a lot
easier<00:06:01.340> let's<00:06:02.150> see<00:06:02.330> how<00:06:02.479> these<00:06:02.630> things<00:06:02.930> fit

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
easier let's see how these things fit

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.820 
easier let's see how these things fit
onto<00:06:03.410> the<00:06:03.530> board<00:06:04.449> alright<00:06:05.449> our<00:06:06.080> power<00:06:06.410> switch

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
onto the board alright our power switch

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.909 
onto the board alright our power switch
will<00:06:07.250> plug<00:06:07.610> directly<00:06:08.510> into<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.380> back<00:06:09.650> of<00:06:09.680> the

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
will plug directly into the back of the

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.100 
will plug directly into the back of the
board<00:06:10.190> here<00:06:10.669> we're<00:06:10.789> going<00:06:10.880> to<00:06:10.970> have<00:06:11.180> to<00:06:11.389> solder

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
board here we're going to have to solder

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.529 
board here we're going to have to solder
that<00:06:12.410> on<00:06:12.590> in<00:06:12.710> a<00:06:12.770> little<00:06:12.979> bit<00:06:13.160> we<00:06:13.849> can<00:06:14.060> install

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
that on in a little bit we can install

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.040 
that on in a little bit we can install
our<00:06:14.900> 0.1<00:06:15.590> inch<00:06:15.830> female<00:06:16.250> connector<00:06:17.060> just<00:06:17.840> like

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
our 0.1 inch female connector just like

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.230 
our 0.1 inch female connector just like
that<00:06:18.320> I'm<00:06:19.039> going<00:06:19.280> to<00:06:19.340> go<00:06:19.520> ahead<00:06:19.639> and<00:06:19.970> populate

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
that I'm going to go ahead and populate

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.939 
that I'm going to go ahead and populate
in<00:06:20.630> they've<00:06:20.930> done<00:06:21.050> a<00:06:21.080> nice<00:06:21.260> job<00:06:21.320> of<00:06:21.650> providing

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
in they've done a nice job of providing

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.439 
in they've done a nice job of providing
a<00:06:22.160> silkscreen<00:06:22.460> so<00:06:22.820> these<00:06:22.940> just<00:06:23.240> slide<00:06:23.330> right

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
a silkscreen so these just slide right

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.570 
a silkscreen so these just slide right
in<00:06:23.660> another<00:06:24.560> thing<00:06:24.740> you<00:06:24.860> want<00:06:24.949> to<00:06:25.070> notice<00:06:25.400> is

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
in another thing you want to notice is

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.120 
in another thing you want to notice is
that<00:06:25.639> they've<00:06:26.060> made<00:06:26.780> the<00:06:27.050> pins<00:06:27.500> they've<00:06:28.010> done

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
that they've made the pins they've done

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.040 
that they've made the pins they've done
something<00:06:28.340> very<00:06:28.460> clever<00:06:28.910> here<00:06:29.300> they've<00:06:29.780> made

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
something very clever here they've made

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.540 
something very clever here they've made
the<00:06:30.199> pins<00:06:30.470> wide<00:06:30.740> enough<00:06:31.010> so<00:06:31.070> you<00:06:31.250> can<00:06:31.400> either

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
the pins wide enough so you can either

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.610 
the pins wide enough so you can either
install<00:06:31.849> standard<00:06:32.419> point<00:06:32.720> 1-inch<00:06:33.110> pins<00:06:33.410> or

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
install standard point 1-inch pins or

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.640 
install standard point 1-inch pins or
the<00:06:34.520> slightly<00:06:34.820> smaller<00:06:35.270> 2<00:06:35.840> millimeter<00:06:36.320> pins

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
the slightly smaller 2 millimeter pins

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.260 
the slightly smaller 2 millimeter pins
that<00:06:37.099> seem<00:06:37.310> to<00:06:37.460> be<00:06:37.490> used<00:06:37.760> by<00:06:37.940> the<00:06:38.000> smaller

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
that seem to be used by the smaller

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.120 
that seem to be used by the smaller
connector<00:06:38.630> so<00:06:39.349> we're<00:06:39.500> going<00:06:39.590> to<00:06:39.650> go<00:06:39.860> ahead

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
connector so we're going to go ahead

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.750 
connector so we're going to go ahead
we'll<00:06:40.310> just

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
we'll just

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.700 
we'll just
sawed<00:06:41.270> those<00:06:41.480> into<00:06:41.810> give<00:06:41.960> you<00:06:42.050> an<00:06:42.170> idea<00:06:42.320> of<00:06:42.530> how

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
sawed those into give you an idea of how

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.920 
sawed those into give you an idea of how
everything<00:06:43.100> fits<00:06:43.310> together<00:06:43.550> well<00:06:44.360> put<00:06:44.570> two<00:06:44.780> of

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
everything fits together well put two of

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.350 
everything fits together well put two of
the<00:06:45.020> slightly<00:06:45.260> smaller<00:06:45.970> connectors<00:06:46.970> in<00:06:47.150> here

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
the slightly smaller connectors in here

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.600 
the slightly smaller connectors in here
so<00:06:47.540> you<00:06:47.630> can<00:06:47.810> see<00:06:48.020> how<00:06:48.200> those<00:06:48.410> fit<00:06:49.160> in<00:06:49.340> and

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
so you can see how those fit in and

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.720 
so you can see how those fit in and
again<00:06:50.110> very<00:06:51.110> cleverly<00:06:51.680> they've<00:06:52.070> let<00:06:52.340> us<00:06:52.490> use

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
again very cleverly they've let us use

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.280 
again very cleverly they've let us use
either<00:06:53.000> connector<00:06:53.810> in<00:06:54.140> the<00:06:55.600> in<00:06:56.600> these<00:06:56.840> in<00:06:57.110> this

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
either connector in the in these in this

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.400 
either connector in the in these in this
board<00:06:57.820> right<00:06:58.820> there<00:06:58.880> we<00:06:59.240> have<00:06:59.480> that<00:06:59.750> and<00:07:00.170> we

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
board right there we have that and we

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.340 
board right there we have that and we
have<00:07:00.590> that<00:07:00.830> alright<00:07:01.730> now<00:07:02.660> you're<00:07:02.960> going<00:07:03.200> to

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
have that alright now you're going to

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.770 
have that alright now you're going to
have<00:07:03.530> to<00:07:03.710> go<00:07:03.890> ahead<00:07:04.250> and<00:07:04.520> obviously<00:07:05.420> solder

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
have to go ahead and obviously solder

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.350 
have to go ahead and obviously solder
this<00:07:05.990> yourself<00:07:06.470> and<00:07:06.770> we'll<00:07:07.550> take<00:07:07.790> a<00:07:07.820> look<00:07:08.180> and

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
this yourself and we'll take a look and

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.000 
this yourself and we'll take a look and
see<00:07:08.600> what<00:07:08.900> whether<00:07:09.170> they<00:07:09.410> hot-air<00:07:09.800> solder

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010 
see what whether they hot-air solder

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.280 
see what whether they hot-air solder
leveled<00:07:10.490> the<00:07:10.610> board<00:07:10.850> by<00:07:11.480> just<00:07:11.750> doing<00:07:12.020> a<00:07:12.110> quick

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
leveled the board by just doing a quick

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.640 
leveled the board by just doing a quick
flip<00:07:12.770> here<00:07:13.160> and<00:07:13.550> I'm<00:07:14.540> looking<00:07:14.990> at<00:07:15.170> it<00:07:15.320> I<00:07:15.410> don't

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
flip here and I'm looking at it I don't

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.470 
flip here and I'm looking at it I don't
I<00:07:15.740> it's<00:07:16.100> really<00:07:16.160> quite<00:07:16.700> hard<00:07:16.910> to<00:07:17.000> tell<00:07:17.180> I<00:07:17.210> can

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.480 
I it's really quite hard to tell I can

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.420 
I it's really quite hard to tell I can
see<00:07:17.630> that<00:07:17.750> the<00:07:17.930> the<00:07:18.410> pads<00:07:18.710> are<00:07:18.950> reasonably

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
see that the the pads are reasonably

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.530 
see that the the pads are reasonably
spaced<00:07:19.790> it<00:07:19.970> should<00:07:20.180> be<00:07:20.300> fairly

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.540 
spaced it should be fairly

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.000 
spaced it should be fairly
straightforward<00:07:20.720> to<00:07:21.260> solder<00:07:21.500> or<00:07:21.680> two<00:07:21.800> but

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010 
straightforward to solder or two but

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.210 
straightforward to solder or two but
we'll<00:07:22.190> we'll<00:07:22.610> save<00:07:22.850> that<00:07:23.090> for<00:07:23.300> a<00:07:23.360> later<00:07:23.480> time

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.220 
we'll we'll save that for a later time

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.130 
we'll we'll save that for a later time
what<00:07:25.220> I'm<00:07:25.310> going<00:07:25.460> to<00:07:25.490> do<00:07:25.610> now<00:07:25.790> I<00:07:25.820> think<00:07:25.940> is<00:07:26.330> just

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.140 
what I'm going to do now I think is just

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.830 
what I'm going to do now I think is just
do<00:07:27.770> a<00:07:27.800> quick<00:07:28.100> power<00:07:28.430> on<00:07:28.670> test<00:07:29.030> I'm<00:07:29.420> going<00:07:29.750> to

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 
do a quick power on test I'm going to

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.200 
do a quick power on test I'm going to
bring<00:07:30.020> my<00:07:30.080> laptop<00:07:30.380> over<00:07:31.040> here<00:07:31.400> and<00:07:31.760> we're

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210 
bring my laptop over here and we're

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.550 
bring my laptop over here and we're
going<00:07:32.420> to<00:07:32.540> plug<00:07:32.930> the<00:07:33.380> USB<00:07:34.190> connection<00:07:35.560> into

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 
going to plug the USB connection into

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.350 
going to plug the USB connection into
the<00:07:36.650> board<00:07:36.890> and<00:07:37.220> take<00:07:37.730> a<00:07:37.760> look<00:07:38.090> at<00:07:38.240> what

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 
the board and take a look at what

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.160 
the board and take a look at what
happens<00:07:38.750> and<00:07:40.000> with<00:07:41.000> any<00:07:41.270> luck<00:07:41.360> we'll<00:07:41.600> see<00:07:41.960> some

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.170 
happens and with any luck we'll see some

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.920 
happens and with any luck we'll see some
lights<00:07:42.380> flash<00:07:42.710> let's<00:07:43.190> see<00:07:43.490> what<00:07:43.700> we<00:07:43.820> see<00:07:44.090> all

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:44.930 
lights flash let's see what we see all

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.170 
lights flash let's see what we see all
right<00:07:45.140> we<00:07:45.380> saw<00:07:45.590> the<00:07:45.680> power<00:07:45.920> indicator<00:07:46.280> and<00:07:46.760> we

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180 
right we saw the power indicator and we
