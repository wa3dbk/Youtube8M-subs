short films that you get I have to say
this<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.040> I<00:00:50.159> think<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.489> above<00:00:50.790> average<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this one I think is above average so the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.770 
this one I think is above average so the
story<00:00:52.589> really<00:00:52.769> focuses<00:00:53.519> on<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.760> young<00:00:54.510> girl

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
who's not really a party girl as such

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.579 
who's not really a party girl as such
but<00:00:56.670> she's<00:00:56.879> kind<00:00:57.150> of<00:00:57.269> gets<00:00:57.900> talked<00:00:58.140> into<00:00:58.290> going

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
a couple of not quite performances but

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.300 
a couple of not quite performances but
generally<00:03:49.199> speaking<00:03:49.259> i<00:03:49.709> was<00:03:50.129> actually

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310

killing<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.330> lot<00:05:27.480> of<00:05:27.600> people<00:05:27.930> in<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.110> water<00:05:28.400> and

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
killing a lot of people in the water and

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.070 
killing a lot of people in the water and
then<00:05:29.550> they'll<00:05:29.700> have<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.270> idea<00:05:30.600> these<00:05:30.750> people

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
then they'll have the idea these people

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.780 
then they'll have the idea these people
to<00:05:31.140> sort<00:05:31.290> of<00:05:31.410> to<00:05:31.620> try<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:31.980> lure<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.250> Sharks

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
to sort of to try and lure the Sharks

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.090 
to sort of to try and lure the Sharks
away<00:05:32.970> by<00:05:33.720> sort<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:34.020> chumming<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.470> waters<00:05:34.980> and

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
away by sort of chumming the waters and

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.500 
away by sort of chumming the waters and
I<00:05:35.160> thought<00:05:35.280> well<00:05:35.430> to<00:05:36.000> be<00:05:36.120> honest<00:05:36.360> through

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
I thought well to be honest through

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.270 
I thought well to be honest through
there's<00:05:36.930> already<00:05:37.170> lots<00:05:37.500> of<00:05:37.740> blood<00:05:37.920> in<00:05:37.980> the

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
sort of the idea the lot of these films

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.630 
sort of the idea the lot of these films
of<00:06:40.200> the<00:06:40.230> guy<00:06:40.410> who<00:06:40.470> got<00:06:40.740> a<00:06:40.800> only<00:06:41.040> responsible

in<00:06:44.010> this<00:06:44.130> film<00:06:44.400> which<00:06:44.490> is<00:06:44.610> which<00:06:44.820> was<00:06:45.000> quite

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
in this film which is which was quite

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.540 
in this film which is which was quite
good<00:06:45.240> so<00:06:45.660> I<00:06:46.290> actually<00:06:46.800> quite<00:06:47.130> enjoyed<00:06:47.460> this

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
good so I actually quite enjoyed this

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.950 
good so I actually quite enjoyed this
from<00:06:47.700> a<00:06:47.760> lot<00:06:48.030> lot<00:06:48.210> better<00:06:48.450> than<00:06:48.630> I<00:06:48.690> thought<00:06:48.720> it

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
from a lot lot better than I thought it

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.720 
from a lot lot better than I thought it
was<00:06:49.200> I<00:06:49.380> thought<00:06:49.740> I<00:06:49.920> would<00:06:50.190> have<00:06:50.370> been<00:06:50.490> just<00:06:50.520> a

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
was I thought I would have been just a

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.990 
was I thought I would have been just a
name

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
name

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.710 
name
so<00:06:51.240> it<00:06:51.600> kind<00:06:51.990> of<00:06:52.080> put<00:06:52.260> me<00:06:52.380> off<00:06:52.530> and<00:06:52.920> you<00:06:53.520> know

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
so it kind of put me off and you know

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.670 
so it kind of put me off and you know
fair<00:06:54.720> enough<00:06:54.930> I<00:06:55.020> shouldn't<00:06:55.290> judge<00:06:55.500> by<00:06:55.620> the

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
fair enough I shouldn't judge by the

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.010 
fair enough I shouldn't judge by the
book<00:06:55.920> by<00:06:56.160> it's<00:06:56.280> cover<00:06:56.340> but<00:06:57.300> you<00:06:57.690> know<00:06:57.780> it<00:06:57.840> does

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
book by it's cover but you know it does

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.540 
book by it's cover but you know it does
have<00:06:58.170> its<00:06:58.320> problems<00:06:58.500> it<00:06:58.890> is<00:06:58.920> you<00:06:59.250> know<00:06:59.370> that
