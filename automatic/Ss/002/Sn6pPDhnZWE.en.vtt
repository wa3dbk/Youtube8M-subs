hello this is Steve at green fuel eight
stroke<00:00:03.030> on<00:00:03.740> today<00:00:04.740> we're<00:00:04.920> going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.160> do<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
stroke on today we're going to do a

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.870 
stroke on today we're going to do a
mileage<00:00:06.150> test<00:00:06.529> with<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.680> system<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
mileage test with the system in the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:18.439 
mileage test with the system in the
Dodge<00:00:09.059> Ram<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:12.200> live<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.440> Utah<00:00:15.170> and<00:00:17.449> they

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
Dodge Ram I live here in Utah and they

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.960 
Dodge Ram I live here in Utah and they
have<00:00:18.660> our<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.039> freeway<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.730> runs

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
have our we have one freeway that runs

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.779 
have our we have one freeway that runs
north<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.630> south<00:00:21.720> through<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> state<00:00:22.789> and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
north and south through the state and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.910 
north and south through the state and
it's<00:00:24.029> been<00:00:24.960> under<00:00:25.260> construction<00:00:25.529> for

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
it's been under construction for

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.519 
it's been under construction for
probably<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> last<00:00:26.699> two<00:00:26.970> years<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:28.349> it's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
probably the last two years so it's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
probably the last two years so it's
probably<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> good<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
probably not going to be a good way to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.900 
probably not going to be a good way to
get<00:00:30.660> mileage<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.579> is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
get mileage so what I'm going to do is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.750 
get mileage so what I'm going to do is
there's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> little<00:00:33.930> Canyon<00:00:34.460> highway<00:00:35.460> here

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
there's a little Canyon highway here

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.340 
there's a little Canyon highway here
that<00:00:36.030> goes<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.360> through<00:00:36.570> these<00:00:36.719> two<00:00:36.960> mountains

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that goes up through these two mountains

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
that goes up through these two mountains
and<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.820> through<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> canyon

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and when I go up through the canyon

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
and when I go up through the canyon
about<00:00:39.750> thirty<00:00:40.110> miles<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.520> come<00:00:41.730> back

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
about thirty miles and then come back

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.160 
about thirty miles and then come back
and<00:00:42.719> we'll<00:00:43.170> take<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.550> baseline<00:00:44.550> measurement

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
and we'll take a baseline measurement

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
and we'll take a baseline measurement
there<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:46.739> we'll<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> same<00:00:47.700> run

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
there and then we'll do the same run

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.160 
there and then we'll do the same run
again<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> 88<00:00:49.649> show<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> right<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
again with the 88 show on so right now I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.459 
again with the 88 show on so right now I
want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.750> gas<00:00:54.750> station<00:00:54.780> we're

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
want to go to the gas station we're

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.920 
want to go to the gas station we're
going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> fill<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:57.030> we're<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.719> do

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
going to fill up and we're going to do

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:17.039 
going to fill up and we're going to do
the<00:00:58.170> baseline<00:00:58.710> test

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.480 

we'll<00:01:18.049> make<00:01:18.170> sure<00:01:18.229> we<00:01:18.590> fill<00:01:18.829> up<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.219> sound

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
we'll make sure we fill up the sound

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:29.830 
we'll make sure we fill up the sound
pump<00:01:19.759> every<00:01:20.090> time<00:01:20.270> we<00:01:20.390> do<00:01:20.509> this

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.450 

at<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.619> same<00:01:30.829> gas<00:01:31.159> station<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.860> technique<00:01:34.280> I

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
at the same gas station the technique I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.819 
at the same gas station the technique I
used<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.820> fill<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.149> tank<00:01:35.450> as<00:01:35.659> I<00:01:35.840> put<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
used to fill the tank as I put the

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.670 
used to fill the tank as I put the
nozzle<00:01:37.009> in<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:38.780> put<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.049> on<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.320> lowest

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
nozzle in and I put it on the lowest

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.819 
nozzle in and I put it on the lowest
setting<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.189> let<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.549> click<00:01:40.759> off<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:42.590> pull

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
setting and let it click off and I pull

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.270 
setting and let it click off and I pull
the<00:01:43.009> nozzle<00:01:43.189> out<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:44.810> almost<00:01:45.280> to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
the nozzle out so that it's almost to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.039 
the nozzle out so that it's almost to
the<00:01:46.429> rim<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:48.909> fill<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.090> gas<00:01:50.299> until<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.869> comes

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
the rim and fill the gas until it comes

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.889 
the rim and fill the gas until it comes
up<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.250> edge<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.610> nozzle<00:01:53.000> and

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
up to that to the edge of the nozzle and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.899 
up to that to the edge of the nozzle and
we'll<00:01:54.079> do<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.380> same<00:01:54.590> way<00:01:54.619> every<00:01:54.979> time<00:01:55.009> it's

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
we'll do it the same way every time it's

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.029 
we'll do it the same way every time it's
not<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.090> high<00:01:56.240> percent<00:01:56.600> scientific<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:57.439> it's

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
not a high percent scientific but it's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.749 
not a high percent scientific but it's
all<00:01:58.220> we've<00:01:58.399> got<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:59.299> get<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.570> pretty<00:02:00.140> decent

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
all we've got to get a pretty decent

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.960 
all we've got to get a pretty decent
reading<00:02:02.409> using<00:02:03.409> this<00:02:03.530> method<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.280> we're<00:02:04.880> going

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
reading using this method so we're going

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.929 
reading using this method so we're going
to<00:02:05.030> start<00:02:05.270> up<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.569> canyon<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.280> first<00:02:07.640> leg

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
to start up the canyon on the first leg

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.920 
to start up the canyon on the first leg
to<00:02:08.869> get<00:02:09.080> our<00:02:09.580> baseline<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.630> we'll<00:02:11.780> come<00:02:11.900> right

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
to get our baseline and we'll come right

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.800 
to get our baseline and we'll come right
back<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:14.030> pump<00:02:14.299> right<00:02:14.420> here<00:02:14.540> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
back to this this pump right here and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.880 
back to this this pump right here and
fill<00:02:14.989> up

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.550 

there's<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.520> lot<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.700> terms<00:02:20.060> and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
there's a lot of terms and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.100 
there's a lot of terms and
winding<00:02:22.340> roads<00:02:22.610> going<00:02:22.910> up<00:02:23.120> here<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:23.630> I'm

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
winding roads going up here but I'm

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.270 
winding roads going up here but I'm
going<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.319> set<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> truck<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.160> cruise<00:02:26.120> control

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
going to set the truck on cruise control

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.080 
going to set the truck on cruise control
so<00:02:28.280> that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
so that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.030 
so that
it<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.900> take<00:02:31.080> care<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.590> ups<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.950> downs

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it can take care of the ups and downs

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.479 
it can take care of the ups and downs
and<00:02:32.489> curves<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.569> I'll<00:02:34.050> make<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.590> test<00:02:35.220> more

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
and curves and I'll make the test more

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.870 
and curves and I'll make the test more
accurate<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:37.440> also

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
accurate it's also

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.940 
accurate it's also
92<00:02:39.630> degrees<00:02:39.660> today<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.710> am<00:02:40.860> running<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.460> AC

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
92 degrees today so I am running the AC
