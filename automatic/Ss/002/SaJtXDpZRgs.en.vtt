00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
more on the blue tone avi because it's a

liner<00:02:46.600> all<00:02:46.930> over<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.560> then<00:02:47.770> I'll<00:02:47.920> put<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.280> on

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
liner all over and then I'll put this on

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.920 
liner all over and then I'll put this on
top<00:02:48.670> which<00:02:48.940> makes<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.390> little<00:02:49.600> bit<00:02:49.780> more

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
top which makes it a little bit more

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.590 
top which makes it a little bit more
comfortable<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.770> then<00:02:51.400> probably<00:02:52.030> an<00:02:52.300> hour

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
comfortable and then probably an hour

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.840 
comfortable and then probably an hour
into<00:02:53.050> wearing<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.830> I'll<00:02:54.070> top<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.430> with<00:02:54.820> a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
into wearing this I'll top it with a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.330 
into wearing this I'll top it with a
gloss<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.470> makes<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.830> easier<00:02:57.280> to

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
gloss and that just makes it easier to

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.280 
gloss and that just makes it easier to
wear<00:02:57.580> for<00:02:57.850> me<00:02:57.970> I'm<00:02:58.210> really<00:02:58.570> not<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.960> matte

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
wear for me I'm really not a matte

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.460 
wear for me I'm really not a matte
lipstick<00:02:59.920> person<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:01.420> if<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.900> top<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.200> with

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
lipstick person but if you top it with

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.530 
lipstick person but if you top it with
the<00:03:02.560> gloss<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:02.800> gloss<00:03:03.430> kind<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.970> wears<00:03:04.270> away

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
the gloss that gloss kind of wears away

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.780 
the gloss that gloss kind of wears away
nicely<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.560> then<00:03:05.710> you<00:03:05.860> have<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.520> staying

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790

still find it if they have it at the CCO

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.540 
still find it if they have it at the CCO
again<00:03:33.640> this<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.300> a<00:03:34.510> sheer<00:03:35.070> like<00:03:36.070> this

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
again this is just a sheer like this

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.490 
again this is just a sheer like this
almost<00:03:36.820> has<00:03:37.240> pink<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.260> almost

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
almost has pink to it and it almost

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.760 
almost has pink to it and it almost
which<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.550> probably<00:03:39.760> why<00:03:39.940> i<00:03:40.060> love<00:03:40.330> it<00:03:40.510> i

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.950 
which is probably why i love it i
definitely<00:03:41.770> think<00:03:42.070> this<00:03:42.490> one<00:03:42.760> leans<00:03:43.180> more<00:03:43.690> on

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
definitely think this one leans more on

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.790 
definitely think this one leans more on
the<00:03:44.290> pink<00:03:44.620> side<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.660> definitely<00:03:47.200> still

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
the pink side but it definitely still

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.150 
the pink side but it definitely still
has<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.280> purple<00:03:48.850> tint<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.990> it's<00:03:50.890> like

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
has a purple tint to it and it's like

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.700 
has a purple tint to it and it's like
the<00:03:51.370> pink<00:03:51.670> version<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.570> Nick's<00:03:52.840> eras<00:03:53.290> Nick's

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
the pink version of Nick's eras Nick's

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.640 
the pink version of Nick's eras Nick's
era<00:03:53.980> still<00:03:54.400> has<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.910> purple<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.660> there<00:03:55.870> where

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
era still has that purple in there where

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.830 
era still has that purple in there where
this<00:03:56.920> one<00:03:57.190> has<00:03:57.460> a<00:03:57.490> pink<00:03:57.910> but<00:03:58.210> I<00:03:58.240> still<00:03:58.570> consider
