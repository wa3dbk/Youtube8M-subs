00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:10.121
How many times did you see master Hong since you came back to China in 1991?

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:20.227
And I heard that sometimes you would chat with him all night?  

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:22.227
Yes, since 1991 to 1994 I went back to China every year. 

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:24.227
At least once and sometimes several times. At that time I was a high school teacher.  

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:26.227
Only during the summer and winter I had holidays. 

00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:28.227
As long as I had a chance I went back. 

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:30.227
The last time I visited was in 1994. 

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:32.227
I took a group of 65 people from Canada to visit. 

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:34.227
We were staying at a Minghua Hotel, a new hotel in Jinan. 

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.227
It was built by a farmer. 

00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:38.227
The travel agency thought it would be a good idea to stay there. 

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:40.227
It was just opened. We were the first group of people staying there. 

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:42.227
It was till after 8:30 pm I took care of everyone in the group and then took a taxi to see Hong. 

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:44.227
It was very late at night. 

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.227
I did not get to his place till 11:30 pm. 

00:00:46.227 --> 00:00:48.227
After knocking, my master's wife was deaf and mute so she could not hear. It was my master Hong himself that answered the door. 

00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:50.227
There was an unpleasant look on his face but as soon as he saw it was me, he said, 

00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:52.227
"Since you came from so far away, what can I say!"

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:54.227
Come in!

00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.227
I stayed till in the morning when my master's wife made noodles for us. 

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:58.227
I had to leave for Tai An with my group at 8:00 am so 

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:00.227
I had to leave early. 

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.227
That was a sleepless night. 

00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:04.227
We talked all night. 

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:06.227
What did you talk about?

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:08.227
The most important impression was that he was telling me what he could not do. 

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:10.227
Since then I knew how to practice. 

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:12.227
What was he lacking?

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:14.227
It is that doing practice, we follow a set of theoretical rules. 

00:01:14.227 --> 00:01:16.227
But in doing so, we cannot do anything. 

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:18.227
Therefore, you make a compromise. 

00:01:18.227 --> 00:01:20.227
But when you make a compromise, your movements are wrong. 

00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:22.227
When this happens, we are not aware of the mistake. 

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:24.227
If he does not tell you, you will never know that you are wrong. 

00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:26.227
So when making moves, he would explain to me how to do it. I would say, 

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:28.227
But we move like this, it is not the same. 

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:30.227
Of course that is what you are doing. It is the wrong way!

00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:32.227
I then said, "I think you did it like that too!" 

00:01:32.227 --> 00:01:34.227
He replied, 

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.227
"Do you follow me or the principles?"

00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:38.227
I said that I believed that everything he did was the same as the principles. 

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:40.227
He replied that he was like me, he was also human. 

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:42.227
All humans will have the same problems. We cannot do it right. Then we compromise and therefore, make mistakes. 

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.227
After that, my own form started to look slightly different from everybody's form and also slightly different from his form. 

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:46.227
This is the point. 

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:48.227
It is also to say that master Hong himself, 

00:01:48.227 --> 00:01:50.227
eh, 

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.227
also made mistakes. 

00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:54.227
It depends on your own enlightenment. 

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:56.227
It is not enlightenment. It was what he said. 

00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:58.227
I don't think he made any mistakes. I think he was using that method to demonstrate a point in learning. 

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.227
A learning method, a principle. 

00:02:00.227 --> 00:02:02.227
No matter whether it is something said by a fellow disciple, 

00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:04.227
your own thinking, or something the master said, 

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:06.227
The guideline must be the taiji principles. 

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.227
It was not a case of evaluating him. 

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.227
It is a case that whenever we ran into difficulties or conflicts we must reply on principles, not anything else. 

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:12.227
We must apply the principles to the entire form. 

00:02:12.227 --> 00:02:14.227
And see that many adjustment must be made.
