00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.330
 from windows 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.850

 once we are located in the folder of 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.580
 flowers 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.910

 a new value or a new attribute to the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.240

 access to the control panel and being zero 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.300
 the value to activate then as 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.959
 we need to restrict access to 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.890
 control panel we visit the value 1 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.770
