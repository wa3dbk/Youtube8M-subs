think<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:23.680> was<00:04:23.770> intentional<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:24.550> we<00:04:24.639> did

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
think it was intentional that we did

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.610 
think it was intentional that we did
this<00:04:25.000> because<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.450> was<00:04:25.600> not<00:04:25.840> but<00:04:26.230> I<00:04:26.260> was<00:04:26.410> able

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
to pull out the win on them so this is a

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.600
