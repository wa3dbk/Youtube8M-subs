00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.279
 deputy commissioner leonardo vallarino in charge 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.930

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.250
 transferred as many endowments 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.590
 they worked their commissary in the place 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.759
 good in the place intervened four 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.299
 units of the federal deputy 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.160
 firefighters of the Argentine federal police 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.439
 quarter unit of the quarter recoleta in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 central barracks of fer horse and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.560
 cistern of the quarter of three barracks the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.539
 fire was developed on the fifth floor 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.250
 of this apart hotel in a room 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.820
 that was occupied by a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.100
 Hindu nationality person together with his 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 18 month old baby which they achieved 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.930
 leave in principle by its means the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 woman with burns on her face and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.390
 hands and the baby with intoxication in the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.100
 woman affecting approximately 30 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.480
 percent of your body is what we 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.730
 report this information I am providing 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 I'm the one who gave me the staff 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.449
 same thing we did because just the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.070
 Hotel manager was telling us not to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.809
 that he had practically no 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.949
 type of wound but that confirms the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.480
 information that we had of 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.129
 those injuries on the woman's part 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.809
 retransmits the information you gave me 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.440
 the same as that to the burns of the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.210
 30 per cent 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.890
 that there is evidence that it could 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.510
 have caused the fire or is very 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.480
 premature is very premature yet 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.950
 We are in the middle of the investigative stage 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.680
 more still we do not finish with the tasks of 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.300
 extinction so I'm going to take some 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.280
 how many more hours try to determine 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.230
 the causes of the fire more people 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.080
 but not hurt but with the principle of 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.240
 suffocation speaks of at least one 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.610
 employee of this hotel we also saw 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.650
 as to the same or the same personnel 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.270

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.430

 from the seventh floor fire department staff to 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.920
 through the use of elevator book 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.080
 I remove a person that would be the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.390

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.250
 carbon monoxide poisoning and 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.170
 He was also transferred to another person 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.650

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.479
 He skated with the water on the sidewalk and suffered 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.530
 a blow to his knee and they were also 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.440

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.720
 we will wait just just be 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.030
 a few moments that you have to cool 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.319
 still the area but since we talk about 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.760
 cool I want to ask you 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.220
 you are there in the middle of this heat 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.740
 unbearable how the sun feels and what 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.200
 porteño on a day like today 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.480
 if you know that it was also marked 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.190
 earlier to now beyond that 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.960
 one and well all the technical team is 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.470
 accustomed to what are the 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.660
 very hot coverages typical of 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.280
 these times of the year what one feels 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.880
 now for example unlike other 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.610
 times is that when practically walking the 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.340
 fire what one feels with the footwear 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.050
 with the shoes that you burn 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.700
 practically the footwear and that that one 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.650
 usually do not feel it and more in this 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.170
 microcenter area not such a street 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.210
 narrow that which you practically touch 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.000
 It seems that he was exposed as 20 hours 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.550
 in the sun that also the wind is like a 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.740
 a certain breeze that is very hot when 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.930
 It is usually hot, for example, it does not run 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.630
 a drop of wind as they say 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.850
 but here you feel that wind of the 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.900
 stations beyond this place where 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.550
 we see that there is a movement with the 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.950
 fire but you imagine that all the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.249
 that I could avoid and today the microcenter to 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.469
 Laughter 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.419
 the movement of the microcentro of a day 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.119
 skillful for nothing I do not know is not 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.309
 practically movement of the avenues 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:12.949
 well but car you see is automobile 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.539
 with the videos uploaded or that the 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.109
 that has air conditioning what was 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.549
 using blue and very little movement if 

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:21.979
 for example in shopping centers 

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:24.559
 when we went through some of them with 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.359
 destination to this place one sees as 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:29.119
 they practically launch themselves into the air 

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:32.139
 commercial that have those places but to 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:33.879
 at the most some tourists one of the 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.560
 you realize how these people are 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.289
 example by the cameras that 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.719
 They are wearing walking hats but very 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.199
 little habitual movement nothing to do 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.849
 with a Monday at the microcenter and more more 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.099
 beyond being a national holiday with these 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.050
 high temperatures which may be 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.400
 stay because you feel and a lot so 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.499
 less in the center of the city good 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.509
