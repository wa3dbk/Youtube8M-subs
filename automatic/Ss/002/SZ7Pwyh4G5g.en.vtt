tissue paper circles each one needs to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.530 
tissue paper circles each one needs to
be<00:01:02.550> separated<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.860> then<00:01:05.000> we'll<00:01:06.000> attach<00:01:06.119> them

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
be separated and then we'll attach them

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.880 
be separated and then we'll attach them
together<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> find<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> center<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> paper

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890

pinch it and this is crusing it up and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.590 
pinch it and this is crusing it up and
pinching<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.979> as<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.520> pinch<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> middle

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
pinching it as a pinch in the middle

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.910 
pinching it as a pinch in the middle
I've<00:01:15.990> pull<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> sides<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:18.920> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I've pull out at the sides as one and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
I've pull out at the sides as one and
you<00:01:20.070> need<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> few<00:01:20.520> more<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.509> find

you need a few more like that to find

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.940 
you need a few more like that to find
the<00:01:21.840> center<00:01:22.820> pinch<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> center<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.830> fluff<00:01:25.830> up

the center pinch the center and fluff up
the<00:01:26.009> sides<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:28.770> doesn't<00:01:29.130> matter<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.430> they

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the sides it doesn't matter if they

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.249 
the sides it doesn't matter if they
don't<00:01:29.729> come<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:30.000> exactly<00:01:30.509> evenly<00:01:30.990> I've<00:01:31.110> got

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

it longer at that side and shorter it
not<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.329> makes<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.689> look<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.140> a

gather<00:02:13.730> together<00:02:14.140> your<00:02:15.140> pieces<00:02:15.379> of<00:02:15.790> tissue

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
gather together your pieces of tissue

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.910 
gather together your pieces of tissue
that<00:02:17.180> you've<00:02:17.329> already<00:02:17.510> fluffed<00:02:20.620> that's<00:02:21.620> going

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
that you've already fluffed that's going

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.199 
that you've already fluffed that's going
to<00:02:22.010> look<00:02:22.099> very<00:02:22.159> pretty<00:02:22.549> a<00:02:22.849> bit<00:02:23.030> like<00:02:23.180> a

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
to look very pretty a bit like a

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.860 
to look very pretty a bit like a
carnation<00:02:23.719> I<00:02:24.049> think<00:02:25.269> one<00:02:26.269> at<00:02:26.389> the<00:02:26.480> other<00:02:26.599> side

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
carnation I think one at the other side

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.970 
carnation I think one at the other side
of<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.109> deep<00:02:27.260> red<00:02:29.260> all<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.439> little<00:02:30.560> pinches

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
of the deep red all the little pinches

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.879 
of the deep red all the little pinches
at<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.189> bottom<00:02:31.989> catch<00:02:32.989> them<00:02:33.260> together<00:02:33.590> with

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
at the bottom catch them together with

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.459 
at the bottom catch them together with
your<00:02:34.010> sticky<00:02:34.280> tape<00:02:34.719> fiddly<00:02:35.719> job<00:02:35.750> but<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.260> think

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
your sticky tape fiddly job but I think

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.410 
your sticky tape fiddly job but I think
you<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.769> do<00:02:36.889> it<00:02:37.010> how<00:02:37.159> they<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.670> enjoy<00:02:38.209> making

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
you can do it how they you enjoy making

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.140 
you can do it how they you enjoy making
things<00:02:38.659> and<00:02:39.230> then<00:02:40.189> the<00:02:40.400> last<00:02:40.519> bit<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.819> sticky

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
things and then the last bit of sticky

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.750 
things and then the last bit of sticky
tape<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.480> going<00:02:41.659> to<00:02:41.780> wrap<00:02:41.959> round<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:43.459> straw

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
tape is going to wrap round the straw

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.509 
tape is going to wrap round the straw
then<00:02:44.750> look<00:02:44.989> again<00:02:45.139> at<00:02:45.290> your<00:02:45.409> flour<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.400> make

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
then look again at your flour and make

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.629 
then look again at your flour and make
sure<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.849> says<00:02:47.000> fluffed<00:02:47.329> up<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.629> it<00:02:47.750> can<00:02:47.930> be

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
sure it says fluffed up as it can be

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.819 
sure it says fluffed up as it can be
that's<00:02:49.639> ready<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.180> leave<00:02:50.389> down<00:02:50.629> there<00:02:50.959> take

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
that's ready to leave down there take

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.420 
that's ready to leave down there take
your<00:02:52.129> piece<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.939> green<00:02:53.150> paper<00:02:54.159> fold<00:02:55.159> it<00:02:55.280> in

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
your piece of green paper fold it in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.420 
your piece of green paper fold it in
half<00:02:55.459> fold<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.389> in<00:02:56.540> quarters<00:02:57.169> and<00:02:57.919> with<00:02:58.340> this

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
half fold it in quarters and with this

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.449 
half fold it in quarters and with this
one<00:02:58.639> I<00:02:58.669> think<00:02:59.000> we<00:02:59.090> can<00:02:59.239> fold<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.599> in<00:02:59.780> eight<00:03:00.459> so

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
one I think we can fold it in eight so

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.409 
one I think we can fold it in eight so
we<00:03:01.609> should<00:03:01.639> get<00:03:02.000> eight<00:03:03.159> leaves<00:03:04.159> from<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.579> now

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419 
we should get eight leaves from that now

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.940 
we should get eight leaves from that now
leave<00:03:05.780> shapes<00:03:07.209> start<00:03:08.209> from<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.629> center<00:03:08.950> and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
leave shapes start from the center and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.860 
leave shapes start from the center and
curve<00:03:10.280> out<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.849> edge<00:03:10.969> and<00:03:11.269> back<00:03:11.599> to<00:03:11.750> the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
curve out to the edge and back to the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.879 
curve out to the edge and back to the
center<00:03:12.099> Center<00:03:13.720> out<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.229> edge<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:15.680> back

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
center Center out to the edge and back

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.240 
center Center out to the edge and back
to<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.190> center<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:17.470> cut<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.590> out<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.129> then

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
to the center and cut that out and then

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.899 
to the center and cut that out and then
although<00:03:19.579> we<00:03:19.940> only<00:03:19.970> actually<00:03:20.299> cut<00:03:20.690> out<00:03:20.870> or<00:03:21.290> and

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
although we only actually cut out or and

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.449 
although we only actually cut out or and
leave<00:03:22.909> when<00:03:23.720> we<00:03:23.900> open<00:03:24.169> it<00:03:24.260> out<00:03:24.440> we<00:03:24.650> should<00:03:24.680> find

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
leave when we open it out we should find

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.899 
leave when we open it out we should find
we've<00:03:25.819> got<00:03:26.169> eight<00:03:27.169> which<00:03:28.159> will<00:03:28.400> save<00:03:28.609> us<00:03:28.669> a<00:03:28.879> lot

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
we've got eight which will save us a lot

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.300 
we've got eight which will save us a lot
of<00:03:29.030> time<00:03:29.419> there<00:03:29.810> we<00:03:29.930> go<00:03:30.079> long<00:03:30.650> sleeves<00:03:31.040> ready

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
of time there we go long sleeves ready

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.449 
of time there we go long sleeves ready
and<00:03:31.609> they<00:03:32.479> all<00:03:32.599> need<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.840> be<00:03:32.989> fixed<00:03:33.260> on<00:03:33.560> which

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
and they all need to be fixed on which

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.809 
and they all need to be fixed on which
is<00:03:34.609> a<00:03:34.790> small<00:03:35.060> about<00:03:35.479> amount<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.079> sticky<00:03:36.349> tape

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
is a small about amount of sticky tape

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.089 
is a small about amount of sticky tape
so<00:03:37.819> with<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.180> sticky<00:03:38.479> tape<00:03:38.739> wrap<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:39.919> round

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
so with the sticky tape wrap it round

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.729 
so with the sticky tape wrap it round
the<00:03:40.459> petals<00:03:40.909> down<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.959> length<00:03:42.139> of<00:03:42.259> the<00:03:42.470> straw

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
the petals down the length of the straw

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.039 
the petals down the length of the straw
and<00:03:43.780> then<00:03:44.780> if<00:03:45.259> you<00:03:45.859> just<00:03:46.459> fold<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.419> petal<00:03:47.569> the

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
and then if you just fold the petal the

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.640 
and then if you just fold the petal the
leaves<00:03:48.620> in<00:03:48.979> half<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.849> makes<00:03:50.090> them<00:03:50.269> look<00:03:50.470> as<00:03:51.470> if

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
leaves in half it makes them look as if

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.890 
leaves in half it makes them look as if
they're<00:03:51.829> growing<00:03:52.479> there's<00:03:53.479> another<00:03:53.810> one

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
they're growing there's another one

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.259 
they're growing there's another one
fixed<00:03:54.409> on<00:03:54.560> then<00:03:55.519> you've<00:03:55.669> made<00:03:55.849> your<00:03:55.970> very<00:03:56.180> own

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
fixed on then you've made your very own

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.920 
fixed on then you've made your very own
carnation<00:03:57.139> and<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.849> could<00:03:59.030> do<00:03:59.150> all<00:03:59.180> sorts<00:03:59.870> of

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
carnation and you could do all sorts of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.610 
carnation and you could do all sorts of
different<00:03:59.989> colors<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:02.229> make<00:04:03.229> a<00:04:03.259> bunch<00:04:03.530> of

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
different colors and make a bunch of

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.640 
different colors and make a bunch of
them<00:04:03.799> and<00:04:04.280> maybe<00:04:04.459> put<00:04:04.669> them<00:04:04.819> in<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:04.939> fast<00:04:05.650> there

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
them and maybe put them in a fast there

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.780 
them and maybe put them in a fast there
we<00:04:06.829> go<00:04:06.979> one<00:04:07.400> tissue<00:04:07.879> paper<00:04:08.319> flower<00:04:09.319> and<00:04:09.790> that's

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
we go one tissue paper flower and that's

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.530 
we go one tissue paper flower and that's
how<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.060> make<00:04:11.359> a<00:04:11.540> tissue<00:04:11.780> paper<00:04:12.169> flower
