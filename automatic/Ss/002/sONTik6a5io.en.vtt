sitting inside the tent you can get a
pretty<00:02:03.420> good<00:02:03.540> feel<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:03.899> what<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> space<00:02:04.560> is

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
pretty good feel for what the space is

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.010 
pretty good feel for what the space is
like<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.659> Grand<00:02:06.840> Mesa

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
like in here I know it's the Grand Mesa

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.090 
like in here I know it's the Grand Mesa
four<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:07.799> is

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
four and there is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.240 
four and there is
room<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.580> fit<00:02:08.850> for<00:02:09.720> 20-inch<00:02:10.380> wide<00:02:10.620> standard

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
room to fit for 20-inch wide standard

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.550 
room to fit for 20-inch wide standard
sleeping<00:02:11.610> pads<00:02:11.850> side<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.690> side<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.140> here<00:02:13.380> but

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
sleeping pads side to side in here but

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
sleeping pads side to side in here but
it<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> very<00:02:14.190> tight<00:02:14.460> fit<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.720> think<00:02:15.990> if

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
it is a very tight fit and I think if

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.160 
it is a very tight fit and I think if
you<00:02:16.410> were<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:17.130> people<00:02:17.430> using<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.820> tent<00:02:18.170> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
you were for people using this tent you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.870 
you were for people using this tent you
probably<00:02:19.590> be<00:02:19.680> probably<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> little<00:02:20.550> bit<00:02:20.700> too

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
probably be probably a little bit too

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.130 
probably be probably a little bit too
tight<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.330> would<00:02:21.480> consider<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.020> be

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
tight and I would consider this to be

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.540 
tight and I would consider this to be
more<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:22.560> maybe<00:02:22.740> three<00:02:23.010> people<00:02:23.160> or<00:02:23.370> two

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
more for maybe three people or two

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.640 
more for maybe three people or two
people<00:02:23.880> who<00:02:24.780> wanted<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.020> bring<00:02:25.260> their<00:02:25.440> gear
