00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.189
 so dear kariya friends of the 108 run 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.230
 our aston martin kaps and the aston 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.400
 martin the company fleischhut started 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.119
 equal to mike p may the dare the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.850
 company plan to drive tobias the three and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:27.539
 Lille will be traveling the 4 and Mike 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.960
 and Peter stem from positions one and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.329
 two 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.590
 nils 103 and tobias from the 4th 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.790
 and the startampel is already too 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.160
 see and here it goes already 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.129
 and Peter pulls here only once on the same 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.670
 mike over and sits down here for the first time 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.980
 At the top of the indoor track here has the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.550
 means here is probably equal to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:00.149
 leading one and that is too 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:02.609
 so closely followed by nils unfortunately 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.260
 already in the lead in the German 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.530
 Career championships in the beginning of december 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.240
 flew out is a pleasing 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.979
 There was an outcome for Axel that is 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.659
 always a fourth so my 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.250
 congratulations to axel so that 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.909
 training here on this 44 meter long 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.350
 Bahn has paid off for Axel and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.759
 we just saw him that 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:39.450
 Michael Rhein drove to refuel 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.420
 because if you drive afterwards and can 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.790
 at the moment not really the connection 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.260
 It's actually cleverer to get that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.740
 You then put your tank stop forward a bit 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.180
 yes one or the other youtube user 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.160
 but had the wish to me 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.880
 I want something more 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:07.790
 the train or to the cars say and also 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.520
 race to the series what we drive the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.140
 Railway has a total length of 44 meters 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.110
 and is connected to a pc and 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 the race software we use 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.620
 It's called cockpit xp and was developed by Peter 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.180
 hild developed yes are launched the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.330
 then vehicles on the start line 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.020
 logically and what you are right 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.670
 You can see next to it as you see 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.840
 four tank places and then of course 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.100
 the boxes pass where then 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.920
 can be driven accordingly 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.690
 first, to drive to the team places 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.330
 but there are also two diodes installed 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:00.200
 so there's a pit lane 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.560
 then be completed 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.330
 can 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.750
 Here we see mails on tank 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:12.970
 place one of the now up here at 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:17.750
 the drivers and what happened there 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.180
 So nils was driven out of the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.120
 refueling and in front of him has the number 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.920
 Two so peter it must go in there 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.019
 to explain briefly peter also wanted 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.640
 to refuel and nils has them 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.560
 so he studied peter then 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.350
 about the tank over the place only 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.480
 has postponed and then means 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.549
 that virtually no longer peter 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.049
 can refuel 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.640
 so now there is a little discussion 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.010
 how does she spread that a bit? 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.560
 because he does not realize that he is here 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.540
 has committed a driving error the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.290
 race management so i can do that now 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.470
 but just now has a boxing 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.880
 imposed by fine and the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.680
 graduated right here now 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.930
 now here must be three seconds between 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.250
 two diodes 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.010
 exist and that must also comply 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.420
 because then the software says 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.659
 okay now his punishment has ended 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.900
 and now here flows back into the 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:19.840
 we will intervene here 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:25.930
 Mike Losch see here too 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:30.130
 Refuel There is a total of here 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:33.630
 two larger screens a screen 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.940
 the drivers can look up 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.880
 watch the other race screen 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.389
 then the bets or who just time 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.190
 and lust has to watch and you 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.310
 consumed approximately depending on driving style 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.110
 as well as nine to ten percent fuel per 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.539
 round 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.789
 it really depends on you but you 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.840
 is fast or slow and slow 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.680
 then you have to see that one 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.990
 in time for refueling drives if 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.340
 to start with an empty tank over the start 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:09.699
 goal line drives yes then counts so the 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.110
 last round of the race not and that can yes 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.510
 also very good so the driver must 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.470
 here already remember when I must return 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.090
 purely for refueling or 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.810
 because there are six cars on the track 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.479
 you also a bit like that 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.330
 keep an eye on competitors with 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.570
 we can see here there are only four 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.759
 Tank places so not that one to 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.490
 has to go refueling and has not the 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.820
 Possibility to head for a bank 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.270
 that would be a pity yes 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.520
 here comes nils again to refuel 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.940
 that was the one with the driving error and 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.000
 yes, he almost had my kramp that is 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.099
 Much counts then the next punishment 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.680
 have to compete but he has again 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.090
 braked in time and there will now 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.509
 try again here to the top 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:05.020
 to fight because nils would like to too 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:08.440
 here among the top eight drivers come yes 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.440
 again just to the cars so the 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.950
 We use cars as well as in the state out 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.660
 of the box so as carrera delivered 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.570
 the only thing we do that for then 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.140
 take out the hack magnets so it is 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.240
 So a bit more difficult to drive 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.670
 but exercise is known to be the master 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:32.790
 and you get used to it 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.890
 try the car in the curves here 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.810
 to let it go a bit slower 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.910
 you have one or the other times 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.450
 seen here at mike today though 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:45.980
 you're traveling too fast then flies 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:49.800
 you come here from the train 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:54.120
 yes we are a people of about 20 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.550
 drivers and the person as I said the 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:01.950
 then at the race evening there will be 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:04.710
 entered into the pc and the pc los then 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.890
 the cars to or then the 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.830
 Drivers are coming and the race is here 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:15.390
 also already to the end and nils has here 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:22.380
 despite punishment won and the 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:26.040
 second place goes to mike and the third 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:28.440
 place goes to tobias fourth will be here 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.810
 Peter yes and with a few small ones 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.030
 Finally , I say goodbye to racing scenes 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.250
 me from you and i wanted this 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.540
 small video filmed here we hear 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.250
 soon again from each other 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.250
 until then and byebye
