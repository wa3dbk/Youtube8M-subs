00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
that came and that it was kind of just a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.999 
that came and that it was kind of just a
better<00:00:30.060> multiplayer<00:00:30.599> experience<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.679> reach

has<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.669> growing<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.030> me<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
has really growing on me and that is

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.049 
has really growing on me and that is
really<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.170> good<00:00:34.440> game<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.520> feel<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
really a good game like I feel like I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
have more control over my weapons and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.740 
have more control over my weapons and
reach<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.489> there's<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.149> different<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
reach like there's this different the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
reach like there's this different the
halo<00:00:40.110> reach<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> halo<00:00:40.739> 3<00:00:41.129> definitely<00:00:41.460> have

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
halo reach and halo 3 definitely have

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
halo reach and halo 3 definitely have
two<00:00:41.760> completely<00:00:42.180> different<00:00:42.719> fields<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.590> for

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
two completely different fields but for

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.170 
two completely different fields but for
some<00:00:43.950> reason<00:00:44.280> when<00:00:44.399> i<00:00:44.430> played<00:00:44.640> halo<00:00:44.879> reach<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
some reason when i played halo reach it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.760 
some reason when i played halo reach it
feels<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.480> i<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.809> more<00:00:45.989> power<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.620> my

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
feels like i have more power at my

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.950 
feels like i have more power at my
fingertips<00:00:47.160> then<00:00:47.850> why<00:00:48.000> i<00:00:48.030> played<00:00:48.270> halo<00:00:48.510> 3<00:00:48.750> but

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
fingertips then why i played halo 3 but

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.900 
fingertips then why i played halo 3 but
halo<00:00:49.170> 3<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.710> awesome<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.309> still<00:00:50.550> kind<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
halo 3 is so awesome and I still kind of
preferred<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.570> mean<00:00:51.809> Halo<00:00:52.289> Reach<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
preferred but I mean Halo Reach is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
preferred but I mean Halo Reach is
definitely<00:00:53.100> something<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.430> its<00:00:53.550> own<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
definitely something of its own but I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.970

if I like the plasma repeater and this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.060 
if I like the plasma repeater and this
is<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> really<00:01:07.170> interesting<00:01:07.470> question<00:01:07.740> because

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
is a really interesting question because

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.580 
is a really interesting question because
if<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.549> walked<00:01:09.000> across<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.810> map<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.470> was

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
if I walked across the map and there was

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
if I walked across the map and there was
a<00:01:10.619> plasma<00:01:11.070> rifle<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> plasma<00:01:11.729> torpedo<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
a plasma rifle and a plasma torpedo and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.420 
a plasma rifle and a plasma torpedo and
I<00:01:12.840> had<00:01:13.020> no<00:01:13.290> ammo<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> had<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> choose<00:01:14.310> one

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
I had no ammo and I had to choose one

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.980 
I had no ammo and I had to choose one
other<00:01:14.610> two<00:01:14.760> i'll<00:01:15.330> probably<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.720> walk<00:01:15.960> past

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
other two i'll probably just walk past

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.420 
other two i'll probably just walk past
on<00:01:16.500> i<00:01:16.530> try<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> find<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> different<00:01:17.189> weapon

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
on i try to find a different weapon

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
on i try to find a different weapon
because<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.060> bad<00:01:18.299> these<00:01:18.570> two<00:01:18.780> guns

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
because that's how bad these two guns

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.649 
because that's how bad these two guns
are<00:01:19.290> i<00:01:19.320> would<00:01:19.680> prefer<00:01:19.890> neither<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.420> my

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
are i would prefer neither to be in my

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.140 
are i would prefer neither to be in my
arsenal<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.229> weapons<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.430> don't

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
arsenal of weapons because I just don't

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
arsenal of weapons because I just don't
like<00:01:24.450> either<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.500> plasma<00:01:25.920> rifles<00:01:26.280> like

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
like either them the plasma rifles like

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.890 
like either them the plasma rifles like
and<00:01:26.580> possibly<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.090> kills<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and possibly get kills with and so is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.780 
and possibly get kills with and so is
the<00:01:27.990> repeater<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.829> mean<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.430> would<00:01:29.460> choose

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the repeater so I mean I would choose

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
neither i would just walk past them but

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.289 
neither i would just walk past them but
if<00:01:31.650> some<00:01:31.890> person<00:01:32.070> had<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> gun<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> my<00:01:33.000> head<00:01:33.240> and

repeater<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.900> because<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> looks<00:01:40.530> cooler

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
when overheats that's pretty much the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.550 
when overheats that's pretty much the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
grenade launcher in the end because if

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.590

brood shot in my opinion next topic i

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.289 
brood shot in my opinion next topic i
got<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.130> what<00:03:17.580> about<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.940> target

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
got here is what about the target

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.449 
got here is what about the target
locator<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:19.079> matchmaking<00:03:19.410> do<00:03:20.010> i<00:03:20.040> think<00:03:20.310> that

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
locator in matchmaking do i think that

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.590 
locator in matchmaking do i think that
it<00:03:20.549> should<00:03:20.640> be<00:03:20.700> implemented<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.360> matchmaking

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
it should be implemented in matchmaking

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.080 
it should be implemented in matchmaking
and<00:03:22.200> when<00:03:22.769> i<00:03:22.799> first<00:03:23.160> bought<00:03:23.370> reach<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.880> honestly

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
and when i first bought reach I honestly

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.819 
and when i first bought reach I honestly
thought<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.870> target<00:03:25.200> located<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:25.650> be

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
thought that the target located would be

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.650 
thought that the target located would be
in<00:03:25.950> matchmaking<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.730> custom<00:03:27.120> games<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.570> when

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
in matchmaking and custom games and when

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.120 
in matchmaking and custom games and when
it<00:03:27.750> wasn't<00:03:27.959> honestly<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.680> was<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.890> little

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
it wasn't honestly I was a little

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.069 
it wasn't honestly I was a little
disappointed<00:03:29.190> because<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.850> was<00:03:30.090> excited<00:03:30.600> to

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
disappointed because I was excited to

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.660 
disappointed because I was excited to
kind<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.290> like<00:03:31.410> use<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:31.829> people<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.280> custom

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
kind of like use on people and custom

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.770 
kind of like use on people and custom
games<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.120> stuff<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.540> thought<00:03:33.720> it

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
games and stuff like that I thought it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.360 
games and stuff like that I thought it
would<00:03:33.900> be<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.049> really<00:03:34.260> cool<00:03:34.560> element<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.070> custom

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
would be a really cool element to custom

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.250 
would be a really cool element to custom
game<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.180> turned<00:03:36.420> out<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.630> is<00:03:36.930> only<00:03:37.079> in

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
game but it turned out that is only in

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.199 
game but it turned out that is only in
the<00:03:37.350> campaign<00:03:37.709> stuff<00:03:38.100> like<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.760> that's

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
the campaign stuff like that and that's

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.759 
the campaign stuff like that and that's
really<00:03:39.360> understandable<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.200> because<00:03:40.530> there's

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
really understandable to because there's

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.590 
really understandable to because there's
really<00:03:40.950> cheap<00:03:41.340> obviously<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.000> obviously<00:03:42.090> it

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
really cheap obviously and obviously it

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.810 
really cheap obviously and obviously it
takes<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:43.049> lot<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.530> kind<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.010> like<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.280> lags<00:03:44.610> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
takes a lot of kind of like it lags the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.920 
takes a lot of kind of like it lags the
game<00:03:45.060> because<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.480> takes<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.750> lot<00:03:45.900> of

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
game because it takes a lot of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.170 
game because it takes a lot of
processing<00:03:46.560> power<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:47.400> process<00:03:47.940> something

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
processing power to process something

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.210 
processing power to process something
like<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.140> implement<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.860> know<00:03:49.920> it

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
like that so to implement I know it

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.160 
like that so to implement I know it
won't<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.459> implemented<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.180> matchmaking<00:03:51.480> now

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
won't be implemented in matchmaking now

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.990 
won't be implemented in matchmaking now
because<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.799> code<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.340> too<00:03:53.519> different<00:03:53.910> from

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
because the code is too different from

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.120 
because the code is too different from
the<00:03:54.150> campaign<00:03:54.570> in<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> multiplayer<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.620> wish

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the campaign in the multiplayer I wish

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.560 
the campaign in the multiplayer I wish
it<00:03:56.310> was<00:03:56.430> kind<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:56.910> there<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> part<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.420> me

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
it was kind of in there a part of me

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.729 
it was kind of in there a part of me
wishes<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.930> would<00:03:58.200> be<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.440> there<00:03:58.590> even

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
wishes that would be in there even

00:03:58.739 --> 00:03:59.509 
wishes that would be in there even
though<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:58.920> know<00:03:59.010> it's<00:03:59.280> impossible

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
though I know it's impossible

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.690 
though I know it's impossible

grown up on a console and I've kind of

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.409 
grown up on a console and I've kind of
gotten<00:04:19.859> used<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.519> console<00:04:20.970> more<00:04:21.120> than<00:04:21.269> any

that is different than

controller into a PC but it's just not
the<00:04:35.190> same<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.850> mean<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.480> console<00:04:36.960> has<00:04:37.110> this

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
the same I mean the console has this

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.520 
the same I mean the console has this
feel<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.250> graphically<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.530> gameplay

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
feel to it the graphically a gameplay

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.050 
feel to it the graphically a gameplay
wise<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.130> has<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.280> certain<00:04:41.520> feel<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.850> it

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
wise it just has a certain feel to it

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.460 
wise it just has a certain feel to it
that<00:04:42.240> just<00:04:42.360> can't<00:04:42.630> shake<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:42.930> makes<00:04:43.320> me

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
that just can't shake that makes me

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.700 
that just can't shake that makes me
prefer<00:04:43.740> more<00:04:44.040> than<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.250> pc<00:04:45.200> next<00:04:46.200> topic<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.530> got

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
prefer more than the pc next topic I got

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.160 
prefer more than the pc next topic I got
here<00:04:46.950> is<00:04:47.070> what<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.310> think<00:04:47.610> about<00:04:47.670> a<00:04:47.820> halo<00:04:48.300> 4<00:04:48.660> beta

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
here is what I think about a halo 4 beta

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.290 
here is what I think about a halo 4 beta
now<00:04:49.890> this<00:04:50.040> might<00:04:50.220> be<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.460> little<00:04:50.640> too<00:04:50.730> early<00:04:50.940> to

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
now this might be a little too early to

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.940 
now this might be a little too early to
think<00:04:51.330> about<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:52.020> think<00:04:52.290> that<00:04:52.350> halo<00:04:52.740> 4

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
think about this I think that halo 4

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.860 
think about this I think that halo 4
beta<00:04:53.100> might<00:04:53.490> come<00:04:53.760> in<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:53.970> next<00:04:54.090> like<00:04:54.420> year<00:04:54.750> it

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
beta might come in the next like year it

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.240 
beta might come in the next like year it
might<00:04:54.990> be<00:04:55.170> in<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.350> next<00:04:55.470> year<00:04:55.770> because<00:04:55.920> it<00:04:56.160> is

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
might be in the next year because it is

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.190 
might be in the next year because it is
coming<00:04:56.550> out<00:04:56.640> in<00:04:56.730> 2012<00:04:57.000> but<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:57.720> definitely

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
coming out in 2012 but I definitely

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.110 
coming out in 2012 but I definitely
think<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.590> there<00:04:58.830> will<00:04:59.010> be<00:04:59.040> abated<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.760> don't

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
think that there will be abated I don't

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.510 
think that there will be abated I don't
see<00:05:00.360> why<00:05:00.390> 343<00:05:01.230> wouldn't<00:05:01.650> because<00:05:02.190> there<00:05:02.400> was<00:05:02.490> a

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
see why 343 wouldn't because there was a

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.340 
see why 343 wouldn't because there was a
halo<00:05:02.760> 3<00:05:03.060> beta<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.540> there<00:05:03.630> was<00:05:03.750> also<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:04.050> halo

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
halo 3 beta and there was also a halo

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.840 
halo 3 beta and there was also a halo
reach<00:05:04.560> beta<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:05.040> I<00:05:05.100> definitely<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:05.700> there's

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
reach beta so I definitely that there's

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.240 
reach beta so I definitely that there's
going<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.030> be<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.150> halo<00:05:06.360> 4<00:05:06.690> beta<00:05:06.900> as<00:05:07.140> far<00:05:07.800> as<00:05:07.980> what

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
going to be a halo 4 beta as far as what

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.470 
going to be a halo 4 beta as far as what
it's<00:05:08.400> going<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.580> come<00:05:08.760> in<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:09.030> definitely<00:05:09.090> think

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
it's going to come in I definitely think

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.430 
it's going to come in I definitely think
it's<00:05:09.630> going<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.810> come<00:05:09.900> it's<00:05:10.140> going<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.290> be

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
it's going to come it's going to be

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.080 
it's going to come it's going to be

beta<00:05:19.919> is<00:05:20.100> what<00:05:20.250> i'm<00:05:20.370> guessing<00:05:20.730> i<00:05:20.880> don't<00:05:21.330> think

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
beta is what i'm guessing i don't think

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.450 
beta is what i'm guessing i don't think
it<00:05:21.630> would<00:05:21.720> come<00:05:21.810> with<00:05:21.960> halo<00:05:22.110> anniversary<00:05:22.460> but

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.620 
powerful in hilly reach and honestly I
don't<00:05:41.400> think<00:05:41.669> that<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:42.000> problems<00:05:42.360> with<00:05:42.540> the

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
don't think that the problems with the

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.719 
don't think that the problems with the
grenade<00:05:42.870> spawns<00:05:43.320> I<00:05:43.650> think<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.280> problem<00:05:44.610> is

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
grenade spawns I think the problem is

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.280 
grenade spawns I think the problem is
that<00:05:44.940> when<00:05:45.060> people<00:05:45.360> die<00:05:45.540> they<00:05:45.570> drop<00:05:46.080> their

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
that when people die they drop their

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.260 
that when people die they drop their
grenades<00:05:46.470> and<00:05:46.890> then<00:05:47.010> that<00:05:47.220> leaves<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.940> person

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
grenades and then that leaves the person

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.580 
grenades and then that leaves the person
who<00:05:48.360> kills<00:05:48.600> going<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.870> pick<00:05:49.020> up<00:05:49.140> the<00:05:49.260> grenades

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
who kills going to pick up the grenades

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.170 
who kills going to pick up the grenades
and<00:05:49.740> just<00:05:49.890> spam<00:05:50.100> even<00:05:50.460> more<00:05:50.640> grenades<00:05:50.880> on<00:05:51.090> the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
and just spam even more grenades on the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.090 
and just spam even more grenades on the
map<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.600> think<00:05:52.080> that<00:05:52.200> there's<00:05:52.350> enough<00:05:52.590> plasma

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
map I think that there's enough plasma

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.469 
map I think that there's enough plasma
grenade<00:05:53.370> spawns<00:05:53.669> there's<00:05:53.970> always<00:05:54.270> enough

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
grenade spawns there's always enough

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.300 
grenade spawns there's always enough
plasma<00:05:54.840> grenade<00:05:55.110> spawns<00:05:55.440> because<00:05:55.800> i<00:05:56.040> think

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
plasma grenade spawns because i think

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.650 
plasma grenade spawns because i think
that<00:05:56.580> there's<00:05:56.729> the<00:05:56.850> same<00:05:57.000> amount<00:05:57.060> as<00:05:57.450> my

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
that there's the same amount as my

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.570 
that there's the same amount as my
grenade<00:05:57.960> spawns<00:05:58.320> in<00:05:58.590> halo<00:05:58.979> 3<00:05:59.250> is<00:05:59.280> there<00:05:59.490> in

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
grenade spawns in halo 3 is there in

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.790 
grenade spawns in halo 3 is there in
halo<00:05:59.820> reach<00:06:00.060> as<00:06:00.510> far<00:06:00.630> as<00:06:00.930> frag<00:06:01.200> grenade<00:06:01.500> spawns

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
halo reach as far as frag grenade spawns

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.860 
halo reach as far as frag grenade spawns
