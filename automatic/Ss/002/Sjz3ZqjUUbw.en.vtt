have all three platforms on one device

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.330 
have all three platforms on one device
so<00:00:49.160> I<00:00:50.120> wanted<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.050> introduce<00:00:51.230> this<00:00:51.770> system<00:00:52.190> to

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
so I wanted to introduce this system to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.190 
so I wanted to introduce this system to
you<00:00:52.460> show<00:00:52.700> you<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.910> little<00:00:53.239> bit<00:00:53.390> about<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:54.020> and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
you show you a little bit about it and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.160 
you show you a little bit about it and
how<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.710> integrates<00:00:54.980> into<00:00:55.550> our<00:00:55.879> existing

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
how it integrates into our existing

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.700 
how it integrates into our existing
system<00:00:57.170> as<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:58.370> know<00:00:58.520> vipro<00:00:59.180> is<00:00:59.450> a<00:00:59.840> route

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
system as you know vipro is a route

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.830 
system as you know vipro is a route
based<00:01:01.280> maintenance<00:01:02.000> system<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:02.570> it's<00:01:02.719> not

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
based maintenance system so it's not

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.079 
based maintenance system so it's not
just<00:01:02.899> about<00:01:03.440> vibration<00:01:04.280> analysis<00:01:04.729> it's<00:01:04.850> about

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
just about vibration analysis it's about

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.779 
just about vibration analysis it's about
trending<00:01:05.630> assets<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:06.320> as<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:07.070> trend<00:01:07.369> assets

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
trending assets and as we trend assets

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.279 
trending assets and as we trend assets
we<00:01:07.969> come<00:01:08.179> across<00:01:08.299> assets<00:01:09.049> that<00:01:09.229> need

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
we come across assets that need

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.249 
we come across assets that need
balancing<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.249> need<00:01:10.850> alignment<00:01:11.149> well<00:01:11.869> here's

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
balancing and need alignment well here's

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.719 
balancing and need alignment well here's
our<00:01:12.409> alignment<00:01:12.740> system<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.429> the<00:01:13.549> same

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
our alignment system on the same

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.510 
our alignment system on the same
platform<00:01:14.389> so<00:01:15.139> what<00:01:15.350> we've<00:01:15.529> done<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:15.979> vipro

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
platform so what we've done in vipro

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.340 
platform so what we've done in vipro
behind<00:01:17.060> me<00:01:17.179> you<00:01:17.299> can<00:01:17.329> see<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:17.749> have<00:01:17.929> a<00:01:18.049> hierarchy

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
behind me you can see I have a hierarchy

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.849 
behind me you can see I have a hierarchy
here<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.249> a<00:01:19.520> route<00:01:19.939> that<00:01:20.149> I've<00:01:20.299> done<00:01:20.539> and<00:01:20.859> we've

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
here of a route that I've done and we've

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.069 
here of a route that I've done and we've
got<00:01:22.069> to<00:01:22.340> maintenance<00:01:22.819> events<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.630> show<00:01:23.869> up

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
got to maintenance events that show up

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.919 
got to maintenance events that show up
where<00:01:24.409> I've<00:01:24.529> conducted<00:01:24.979> alignment<00:01:25.759> if<00:01:26.630> it

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
where I've conducted alignment if it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.660 
where I've conducted alignment if it
were<00:01:27.049> balanced<00:01:27.499> you<00:01:27.649> would<00:01:27.799> see<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.009> balance<00:01:28.520> a

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
were balanced you would see a balance a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.999 
were balanced you would see a balance a
cig<00:01:28.909> Nia<00:01:29.119> there<00:01:29.389> but<00:01:30.020> since<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.529> is<00:01:30.649> alignment

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
cig Nia there but since it is alignment

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.819 
cig Nia there but since it is alignment
as<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.340> click<00:01:31.969> on<00:01:32.179> to<00:01:32.419> that<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.869> can<00:01:33.499> actually

as I click on to that I can actually

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.499 
as I click on to that I can actually
look<00:01:34.009> at<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.249> maintenance<00:01:34.639> event<00:01:34.969> and<00:01:35.149> see

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
look at the maintenance event and see

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.849 
look at the maintenance event and see
the<00:01:35.719> report<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.859> Ali<00:01:37.249> sensor<00:01:37.909> has<00:01:38.859> provided

the report that Ali sensor has provided
as<00:01:40.249> part<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.669> their<00:01:40.819> app<00:01:41.060> they<00:01:41.869> produce<00:01:42.169> a<00:01:42.469> nice

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
as part of their app they produce a nice

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.069 
as part of their app they produce a nice
report<00:01:43.459> that<00:01:43.700> tells<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.179> before<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.959> after

beforehand what the alignment system

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.469 
beforehand what the alignment system
looked<00:01:51.979> at<00:01:52.159> before<00:01:52.520> hand<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.179> what<00:01:53.359> the

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
looked at before hand and what the

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.330 
looked at before hand and what the
corrections<00:01:54.020> were<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.499> then<00:01:54.950> you'll<00:01:55.099> be<00:01:55.249> able

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
corrections were and then you'll be able

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.010 
corrections were and then you'll be able

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
you're doing them so you can when I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.140 
you're doing them so you can when I
refer<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:42.550> iPad<00:02:43.450> actually<00:02:43.959> working<00:02:44.380> live

communicating back and forth with these

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.009 
communicating back and forth with these
devices<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:48.010> as<00:02:48.790> you're<00:02:49.180> moving<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.720> making

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
devices is as you're moving and making

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.259 
devices is as you're moving and making
and<00:02:50.170> adjustments<00:02:50.830> on<00:02:51.070> your<00:02:51.100> alignment<00:02:51.850> you

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
and adjustments on your alignment you

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.600 
and adjustments on your alignment you
can<00:02:52.450> actually<00:02:52.630> see<00:02:52.900> those<00:02:53.350> moving<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.280> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
can actually see those moving on the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.120 
can actually see those moving on the
iPad<00:02:55.030> live<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:56.739> make<00:02:56.950> it

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
iPad live so that you can just make it

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.880 
iPad live so that you can just make it
much<00:02:57.459> more<00:02:57.820> easier<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.959> dial<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.440> an<00:02:59.590> alignment

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
much more easier to dial in an alignment

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.420 
much more easier to dial in an alignment
process<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.900> one<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.680> other<00:03:02.830> neat<00:03:03.100> things

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
process so one of the other neat things

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.030 
process so one of the other neat things
I<00:03:03.670> spend<00:03:04.420> my<00:03:04.569> finger<00:03:04.930> around<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.380> screen<00:03:05.470> and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
I spend my finger around the screen and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.240 
I spend my finger around the screen and
you<00:03:06.489> see<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.450> three-dimensional<00:03:08.410> drawing<00:03:08.650> of

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
you see the three-dimensional drawing of

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.229 
you see the three-dimensional drawing of
this<00:03:10.440> motor<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.769> whatever<00:03:12.459> I'm<00:03:12.640> aligning<00:03:13.120> on

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
this motor and whatever I'm aligning on

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.690 
this motor and whatever I'm aligning on
the<00:03:13.390> other<00:03:13.510> side<00:03:13.870> actually<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.950> can<00:03:15.160> look<00:03:15.430> from

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
the other side actually I can look from

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.550 
the other side actually I can look from
every<00:03:16.090> angle<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.930> job<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.440> I'm

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
every angle of the job that I'm

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.710 
every angle of the job that I'm
conducting<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.340> can<00:03:18.550> look<00:03:18.700> at<00:03:18.880> any<00:03:18.910> angle<00:03:19.360> I

want on the screen of the iPad just
makes<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.750> four<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.049> it's<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.560> step-by-step

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
makes it four and it's a step-by-step

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.340 
makes it four and it's a step-by-step
procedure<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.970> saw<00:03:25.239> when<00:03:25.450> i<00:03:25.480> turned<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.019> unit

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
procedure you saw when i turned the unit

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.250 
procedure you saw when i turned the unit
before<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:27.430> know<00:03:27.549> each<00:03:27.820> turn<00:03:28.209> i<00:03:28.239> made<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.930> a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
before you know each turn i made is a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.920 
before you know each turn i made is a
correction<00:03:29.950> point<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:31.000> arrow<00:03:31.180> tells<00:03:31.570> me

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
correction point and the arrow tells me

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.319 
correction point and the arrow tells me
in<00:03:32.170> which<00:03:32.500> direction<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:33.070> turn<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.549> unit<00:03:33.579> when

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
in which direction to turn the unit when

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.720 
in which direction to turn the unit when
to<00:03:34.510> press<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.170> then<00:03:35.500> you'll<00:03:36.070> see<00:03:36.340> behind

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
to press it and then you'll see behind

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.240 
to press it and then you'll see behind
me<00:03:36.850> after<00:03:37.660> i<00:03:37.690> make<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.019> correction<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.980> say

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
me after i make a correction and say

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.580 
me after i make a correction and say
okay<00:03:39.670> next<00:03:39.910> step<00:03:40.299> it's<00:03:40.870> going<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.170> tell<00:03:41.380> me

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
okay next step it's going to tell me

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.830 
okay next step it's going to tell me
what<00:03:41.829> shims<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.370> put<00:03:42.700> under<00:03:42.970> what<00:03:43.180> points<00:03:43.660> at

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
what shims to put under what points at

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.190 
what shims to put under what points at
one<00:03:44.380> angle<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.090> actually<00:03:46.090> shows<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.600> bolts

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
one angle and actually shows the bolts

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.440 
one angle and actually shows the bolts
loosening<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:47.890> tightening<00:03:47.980> back<00:03:48.549> up<00:03:48.820> so

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
loosening and tightening back up so

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.729 
loosening and tightening back up so
again<00:03:49.959> using<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.739> is<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.519> thrill<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.239> use

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
again using this is just a thrill to use

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.949 
again using this is just a thrill to use
as<00:03:53.739> we<00:03:54.579> get<00:03:54.820> more<00:03:54.850> experience<00:03:55.450> with<00:03:55.720> the

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
as we get more experience with the

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.099 
as we get more experience with the
system<00:03:56.380> will<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:57.209> training<00:03:58.209> classes<00:03:58.480> much

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
system will have training classes much

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.539 
system will have training classes much
like<00:03:59.320> we<00:03:59.500> do<00:03:59.620> with<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.859> vibration<00:04:00.370> and

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
like we do with the vibration and

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.360 
like we do with the vibration and
