00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
gonna be real happy you know so i'm not

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.350 
gonna be real happy you know so i'm not
sure<00:03:59.410> his<00:04:00.340> first<00:04:00.700> time<00:04:00.910> we've<00:04:01.030> really<00:04:01.240> got

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
sure his first time we've really got

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.480 
sure his first time we've really got
blown<00:04:01.600> out<00:04:01.750> like<00:04:01.990> this<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.500> i<00:04:02.680> think<00:04:03.250> we've<00:04:03.370> got

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
blown out like this so i think we've got

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.770 
blown out like this so i think we've got
to<00:04:03.580> learn<00:04:03.730> from<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.240> and<00:04:04.270> then<00:04:04.450> i<00:04:04.540> think<00:04:04.600> we

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
to learn from it and then i think we

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.910 
to learn from it and then i think we
gotta<00:04:04.930> move<00:04:05.110> on<00:04:05.290> play<00:04:05.620> very<00:04:05.860> good

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
gotta move on play very good

gotta move on play very good

themselves<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.140> know<00:04:11.320> we've<00:04:11.530> always

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
themselves so you know we've always

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.930 
themselves so you know we've always
talked<00:04:11.980> about<00:04:12.070> don't<00:04:12.400> get<00:04:12.520> too<00:04:12.670> high<00:04:12.880> don't

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
talked about don't get too high don't

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.949 
talked about don't get too high don't
get<00:04:13.330> too<00:04:13.450> low<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:14.650> mean<00:04:15.580> they<00:04:16.090> really<00:04:16.660> kicked

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
get too low I mean they really kicked

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.780 
get too low I mean they really kicked
our<00:04:17.110> body<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.440> give<00:04:17.620> them<00:04:17.739> credit<00:04:17.890> what<00:04:18.609> makes

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
our body to give them credit what makes

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.220 
our body to give them credit what makes
it<00:04:18.970> difficult<00:04:19.120> guarding<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.660> team<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:20.020> so

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
it difficult guarding a team that so

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.830 
it difficult guarding a team that so
small<00:04:21.120> well<00:04:22.120> they<00:04:22.180> have<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:22.330> many<00:04:22.390> shooters

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
small well they have so many shooters

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.560 
small well they have so many shooters
and<00:04:23.410> so<00:04:24.130> we<00:04:24.730> don't<00:04:24.910> have<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.120> whole<00:04:25.210> lot<00:04:25.360> of

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
and so we don't have a whole lot of

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.870 
and so we don't have a whole lot of
depth<00:04:25.780> at<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:25.930> guard<00:04:26.230> spot<00:04:26.530> so<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.520> answer

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
depth at the guard spot so the answer

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.060 
depth at the guard spot so the answer
would<00:04:28.060> maybe<00:04:28.300> be<00:04:28.720> matching<00:04:29.260> up<00:04:29.410> with<00:04:29.440> them<00:04:29.830> and

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
would maybe be matching up with them and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.700 
would maybe be matching up with them and
playing<00:04:30.700> for<00:04:31.060> guards<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.690> don't<00:04:32.500> even<00:04:32.590> have

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
playing for guards I don't even have

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.270 
playing for guards I don't even have
four<00:04:33.100> guards<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:34.650> really<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:35.800> can<00:04:36.010> play

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
four guards and really that I can play

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.090 
four guards and really that I can play
cuz<00:04:36.550> I'd<00:04:36.700> have<00:04:36.850> those<00:04:37.000> subs<00:04:37.360> well<00:04:37.990> then<00:04:38.230> if<00:04:39.010> you

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
cuz I'd have those subs well then if you

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.100 
cuz I'd have those subs well then if you
want<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.340> try<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.520> play<00:04:39.760> them<00:04:40.030> zone<00:04:40.420> and<00:04:40.720> then

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
want to try to play them zone and then

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.440 
want to try to play them zone and then
try<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.320> pound<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.800> inside<00:04:42.210> well<00:04:43.210> then<00:04:43.330> they

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
try to pound it inside well then they

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.320 
try to pound it inside well then they
shoot<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:45.100> there's<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.340> put<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:45.880> in<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.120> lot
