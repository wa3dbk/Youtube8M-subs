now<00:00:06.279> question<00:00:06.750> 147<00:00:07.750> the<00:00:08.040> initial<00:00:09.040> step<00:00:09.370> in<00:00:09.639> the

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
now question 147 the initial step in the

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.230 
now question 147 the initial step in the
digestion<00:00:10.269> of<00:00:10.540> milk<00:00:11.050> in<00:00:11.410> humans<00:00:12.340> is<00:00:12.580> carried

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
digestion of milk in humans is carried

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.050 
digestion of milk in humans is carried
out<00:00:13.389> by<00:00:13.710> now<00:00:14.710> these<00:00:14.889> are<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:15.160> four<00:00:15.460> enzymes

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.060 
out by now these are the four enzymes

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.810 
out by now these are the four enzymes
mentioned<00:00:16.780> now<00:00:17.530> in<00:00:17.740> case<00:00:17.980> of<00:00:18.010> milk

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
mentioned now in case of milk

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.360 
mentioned now in case of milk
we<00:00:18.910> know<00:00:19.120> that<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:20.050> milk<00:00:20.320> protein<00:00:20.590> that<00:00:21.160> is

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.370 
we know that the milk protein that is

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.720 
we know that the milk protein that is
cast<00:00:21.790> seen<00:00:22.110> this<00:00:23.110> casein<00:00:23.680> is<00:00:23.890> first<00:00:24.340> of<00:00:24.550> all

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
cast seen this casein is first of all

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.180 
cast seen this casein is first of all
converted<00:00:25.510> to<00:00:26.160> para<00:00:27.160> casi<00:00:28.770> where<00:00:29.770> it<00:00:29.920> gets

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
converted to para casi where it gets

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.430 
converted to para casi where it gets
curdled<00:00:30.760> and<00:00:31.860> this<00:00:32.860> step<00:00:33.280> is<00:00:35.790> catalyzed<00:00:36.790> by

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
curdled and this step is catalyzed by

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.580 
curdled and this step is catalyzed by
renin<00:00:38.440> which<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.370> secreted<00:00:39.970> by<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.780> gastric

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
renin which is secreted by the gastric

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.700 
renin which is secreted by the gastric
mucosa<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.820> in<00:00:43.000> this<00:00:43.150> case<00:00:43.450> our<00:00:43.750> answer<00:00:44.500> would

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
mucosa so in this case our answer would

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.140 
mucosa so in this case our answer would
be<00:00:45.420> option<00:00:46.420> 3<00:00:46.990> which<00:00:47.320> is<00:00:47.350> renin<00:00:48.150> specifically

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
be option 3 which is renin specifically

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.450

through mucosal cells of intestine by

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
through mucosal cells of intestine by
the<00:01:12.310> process<00:01:12.909> called<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.830> active<00:01:15.400> transport

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the process called now active transport

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.570 
the process called now active transport
facilitated<00:01:17.170> transport<00:01:17.440> simple<00:01:18.400> diffusion

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
facilitated transport simple diffusion

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.560 
facilitated transport simple diffusion
or<00:01:19.210> core<00:01:20.020> transport<00:01:20.650> mechanism<00:01:21.340> now<00:01:22.000> fructose

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
or core transport mechanism now fructose

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.289 
or core transport mechanism now fructose
is<00:01:22.840> transported<00:01:23.650> along<00:01:24.159> with<00:01:24.460> na<00:01:24.850> through

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
is transported along with na through

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.170 
is transported along with na through
special<00:01:25.900> membrane<00:01:26.320> proteins<00:01:26.920> called<00:01:27.310> /<00:01:27.610> mises

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
special membrane proteins called / mises

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.780 
special membrane proteins called / mises
so<00:01:28.810> since<00:01:29.140> there<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.680> a<00:01:29.950> requirement<00:01:30.400> of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
so since there is a requirement of

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.960 
so since there is a requirement of
membrane<00:01:31.240> proteins<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.760> method<00:01:33.760> of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
membrane proteins the method of

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.320 
membrane proteins the method of
transport<00:01:34.659> is<00:01:35.250> facilitated<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:36.790> our<00:01:36.970> choice

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
transport is facilitated so our choice

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.960 
transport is facilitated so our choice
of<00:01:37.570> answer<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.260> option<00:01:38.830> 2<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.790> is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
of answer is option 2 that is

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.719 
of answer is option 2 that is
facilitated<00:01:40.240> transport<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:42.100> we<00:01:42.220> can<00:01:42.369> move<00:01:42.520> on

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
facilitated transport so we can move on

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:50.350 
facilitated transport so we can move on
to<00:01:42.909> question<00:01:43.330> 149<00:01:48.930> question

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
49 approximately 70% of carbon dioxide

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.000 
49 approximately 70% of carbon dioxide
absorbed<00:01:56.420> by<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.660> blood<00:01:57.110> will<00:01:57.830> be

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
absorbed by the blood will be

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.150 
absorbed by the blood will be
transported<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.270> lungs<00:01:59.680> now<00:02:00.680> there<00:02:00.950> are

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
transported to the lungs now there are

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.030 
transported to the lungs now there are
three<00:02:01.880> ways<00:02:02.150> in<00:02:02.570> which<00:02:02.780> carbon<00:02:03.230> dioxide<00:02:03.800> is

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
three ways in which carbon dioxide is

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.420 
three ways in which carbon dioxide is
transported<00:02:04.910> that<00:02:05.870> is<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.920> form<00:02:07.220> of

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
transported that is in the form of

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.350 
transported that is in the form of
dissolved<00:02:08.119> gas<00:02:08.330> molecules<00:02:09.050> which<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:10.990> 7%<00:02:11.990> as

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
dissolved gas molecules which is 7% as

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.380 
dissolved gas molecules which is 7% as
cargo<00:02:14.360> amino<00:02:14.780> hemoglobin<00:02:15.140> which<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.070> around

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
cargo amino hemoglobin which is around

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.970 
cargo amino hemoglobin which is around
23<00:02:17.390> percent<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.490> as<00:02:20.140> bicarbonate<00:02:21.140> ions<00:02:21.620> which

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
23 percent and as bicarbonate ions which

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.230 
23 percent and as bicarbonate ions which
is<00:02:22.270> 70<00:02:23.270> percent<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.860> means<00:02:25.160> our<00:02:25.520> answer

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
is 70 percent so that means our answer

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.100 
is 70 percent so that means our answer
is<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.750> first<00:02:27.290> one<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.970> carbon<00:02:29.209> dioxide<00:02:29.840> is

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
is the first one so carbon dioxide is

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.400 
is the first one so carbon dioxide is
maximally<00:02:30.830> transported<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.880> form<00:02:32.239> of

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
maximally transported in the form of

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.770 
maximally transported in the form of
bicarbonate<00:02:33.410> ions<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.700> we<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.239> move<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.600> to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
bicarbonate ions so we can move on to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.199 
bicarbonate ions so we can move on to
next<00:02:36.020> question<00:02:36.500> 150

types<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.739> B<00:03:15.340> both<00:03:15.639> are<00:03:15.700> there<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.810> as<00:03:16.989> a

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
types a and B both are there so as a

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.490 
types a and B both are there so as a
result<00:03:17.879> their<00:03:18.879> immune<00:03:19.359> system<00:03:19.900> will

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
result their immune system will

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.819 
result their immune system will
recognize<00:03:20.680> both<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.879> and<00:03:21.939> B<00:03:22.480> antigens<00:03:22.510> as<00:03:23.379> their

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
recognize both a and B antigens as their

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.449 
recognize both a and B antigens as their
self<00:03:24.250> antigens<00:03:24.939> and<00:03:25.180> hence<00:03:26.079> there<00:03:26.829> will<00:03:26.980> be<00:03:27.040> no

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
self antigens and hence there will be no

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.030 
self antigens and hence there will be no
antibodies<00:03:28.150> produced<00:03:28.480> no<00:03:29.349> antibodies

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
antibodies produced no antibodies

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.119 
antibodies produced no antibodies
against<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:31.060> neither<00:03:31.810> antibodies<00:03:32.620> against

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
against a and neither antibodies against

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.780 
against a and neither antibodies against
B<00:03:33.549> so<00:03:34.299> now<00:03:34.569> if<00:03:34.780> we<00:03:34.930> see<00:03:35.139> the<00:03:35.290> options<00:03:35.829> both<00:03:36.459> a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
B so now if we see the options both a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.170 
B so now if we see the options both a
and<00:03:36.849> B<00:03:37.389> antigens<00:03:37.659> on<00:03:38.319> our<00:03:38.829> BC<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:39.879> no

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
and B antigens on our BC but no

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.500 
and B antigens on our BC but no
antibodies<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.500> plasma<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.790> this<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.209> our

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
antibodies in the plasma so this is our

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.439 
antibodies in the plasma so this is our
correct<00:03:44.079> choice<00:03:44.500> because<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.549> antigens<00:03:46.180> are

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
correct choice because the antigens are

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.140 
correct choice because the antigens are
present<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.109> RBC<00:03:47.769> membrane<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.519> if

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
present on the RBC membrane and if

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.149 
present on the RBC membrane and if
antibodies<00:03:49.959> would<00:03:50.199> have<00:03:50.439> been<00:03:50.650> there<00:03:50.919> they

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
antibodies would have been there they

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.819 
antibodies would have been there they
would<00:03:51.310> have<00:03:51.579> been<00:03:51.849> in<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.150> plasma<00:03:52.989> but<00:03:53.439> here

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
would have been in the plasma but here

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.080 
would have been in the plasma but here
neither<00:03:54.370> NPA

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
neither NPA

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.800 
neither NPA
nor<00:03:55.780> anti-b<00:03:56.709> antibodies<00:03:56.889> are<00:03:57.790> present<00:03:58.449> so

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
nor anti-b antibodies are present so

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.869 
nor anti-b antibodies are present so
this<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.139> of<00:03:59.259> our<00:03:59.409> best<00:03:59.650> choice<00:03:59.919> and<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.310> is

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
this is of our best choice and that is

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.089 
this is of our best choice and that is
why<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.239> person<00:04:01.659> who<00:04:02.079> is<00:04:02.199> belonging<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.889> a<00:04:02.919> B

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
why the person who is belonging to a B

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.509 
why the person who is belonging to a B
blood<00:04:03.699> group<00:04:04.000> can<00:04:04.569> take<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.650> blood<00:04:05.919> from<00:04:06.400> a

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
blood group can take the blood from a

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.469 
blood group can take the blood from a
donor<00:04:06.879> who<00:04:07.569> is<00:04:07.599> either<00:04:08.049> from<00:04:08.829> a<00:04:09.280> blood<00:04:10.209> group

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479 
donor who is either from a blood group

or B blood group or of course from Oh as

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.929 
or B blood group or of course from Oh as
well<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.829> why<00:04:14.979> they<00:04:15.159> are<00:04:15.189> universal

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
well so that is why they are universal

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.620 
well so that is why they are universal
recipients<00:04:16.870> we<00:04:17.380> can<00:04:17.560> move<00:04:17.709> on<00:04:17.949> to<00:04:18.099> question

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
recipients we can move on to question

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.510 
recipients we can move on to question
151

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.290 

1:51<00:04:27.650> how<00:04:28.650> do<00:04:28.710> parasympathetic<00:04:29.490> neural

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
1:51 how do parasympathetic neural

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.930 
1:51 how do parasympathetic neural
signals<00:04:30.840> affect<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.860> working<00:04:32.099> of<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.699> heart

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
signals affect the working of the heart

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.200 
signals affect the working of the heart
now<00:04:33.810> we<00:04:33.870> see<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.770> parasympathetic<00:04:35.400> neural

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
now we see that parasympathetic neural

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.969 
now we see that parasympathetic neural
signals<00:04:36.629> which<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:36.990> part<00:04:37.259> of<00:04:37.470> autonomic

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
signals which is part of autonomic

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.040 
signals which is part of autonomic
nervous<00:04:38.580> system<00:04:39.000> they<00:04:39.659> release

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
nervous system they release

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.050 
nervous system they release
acetylcholine<00:04:41.659> now<00:04:42.659> this<00:04:43.020> acetylcholine

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
acetylcholine now this acetylcholine

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.640 
acetylcholine now this acetylcholine
causes<00:04:45.349> decrease<00:04:46.349> in<00:04:46.650> heart<00:04:47.129> rate<00:04:50.870> also<00:04:51.870> there

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
causes decrease in heart rate also there

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.159 
causes decrease in heart rate also there
is<00:04:52.800> decrease<00:04:53.069> in<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:54.330> speed<00:04:54.659> of<00:04:54.900> conduction

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
is decrease in the speed of conduction

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:09.270 
is decrease in the speed of conduction
of<00:04:55.680> action<00:04:56.129> potential

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.670 

and<00:05:12.909> because<00:05:13.909> of<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.330> there<00:05:14.750> is<00:05:14.780> also

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
and because of this there is also

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:26.950 
and because of this there is also
decrease<00:05:16.189> in<00:05:17.199> cardiac<00:05:18.199> output<00:05:25.629> so<00:05:26.629> in<00:05:26.810> this

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
decrease in cardiac output so in this

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.649 
decrease in cardiac output so in this
light<00:05:27.229> if<00:05:27.469> we<00:05:27.620> see<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.009> options<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:29.360> first

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
light if we see the options the first

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.589 
light if we see the options the first
choices<00:05:29.930> reduce<00:05:30.830> both<00:05:31.310> heart<00:05:32.030> rate<00:05:32.300> and

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
choices reduce both heart rate and

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.140 
choices reduce both heart rate and
cardiac<00:05:33.169> output<00:05:33.680> decrease<00:05:34.490> in<00:05:34.669> heart<00:05:34.849> rate

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
cardiac output decrease in heart rate

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.869 
cardiac output decrease in heart rate
and<00:05:35.389> decrease<00:05:35.750> in<00:05:36.199> cardiac<00:05:36.680> output<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.729> this

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
and decrease in cardiac output so this

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.860 
and decrease in cardiac output so this
is<00:05:38.060> our<00:05:38.180> first<00:05:38.659> choice<00:05:38.990> which<00:05:39.409> is<00:05:39.439> the<00:05:39.680> answer

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
is our first choice which is the answer

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.749 
is our first choice which is the answer
increasing<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.710> heart<00:05:42.919> rate<00:05:43.129> and<00:05:43.190> cardiac

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
increasing of the heart rate and cardiac

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.990 
increasing of the heart rate and cardiac
output<00:05:44.240> would<00:05:44.449> be<00:05:44.659> a<00:05:44.690> feature<00:05:45.050> of<00:05:46.000> sympathetic

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
output would be a feature of sympathetic

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.209 
output would be a feature of sympathetic
nervous<00:05:47.300> system<00:05:47.690> which<00:05:48.020> would<00:05:48.620> be<00:05:48.800> releasing

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
nervous system which would be releasing

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.779 
nervous system which would be releasing
nor<00:05:49.759> adrenaline<00:05:50.509> but<00:05:51.319> here<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:51.979> is<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.490> effect

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
nor adrenaline but here it is the effect

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.999 
nor adrenaline but here it is the effect
of<00:05:52.969> acetylcholine<00:05:53.569> which<00:05:54.169> is<00:05:54.409> causing<00:05:54.650> a

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
of acetylcholine which is causing a
