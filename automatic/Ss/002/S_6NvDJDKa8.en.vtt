00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
when you're editing in Lightroom I can

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.490 
when you're editing in Lightroom I can
say<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.420> I've<00:00:24.600> been<00:00:24.779> using<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.170> dual<00:00:25.350> monitor

say that I've been using a dual monitor

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.519 
say that I've been using a dual monitor
setup<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> very<00:00:26.430> long<00:00:26.579> time<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:28.020> really

setup for a very long time and it really

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.280 
setup for a very long time and it really
really<00:00:28.950> helps<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.240> many<00:00:30.480> ways<00:00:30.779> it's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
cooler and the neat thing about that is
that<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.340> go<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.330> can<00:02:00.360> select<00:02:01.049> each

individual image and I can edit them in
my<00:02:05.460> main<00:02:05.760> window<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.990> how<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.320> relate

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
my main window and see how they relate

my main window and see how they relate
to<00:02:07.650> each<00:02:07.830> other<00:02:08.159> in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.939> survey<00:02:09.390> mode<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to each other in the survey mode so the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
to each other in the survey mode so the
really<00:02:10.439> cool<00:02:10.649> thing<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.519> example

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
really cool thing is like for example

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.300 
really cool thing is like for example
this<00:02:12.330> guy<00:02:12.599> right<00:02:12.870> here<00:02:13.170> he's<00:02:13.709> got<00:02:13.950> kind<00:02:14.189> of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
this guy right here he's got kind of

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.630 
this guy right here he's got kind of
like<00:02:14.489> maybe<00:02:14.939> a<00:02:15.090> magenta<00:02:16.049> hue<00:02:16.470> okay<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.580> I'm

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
like maybe a magenta hue okay so I'm

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.430 
like maybe a magenta hue okay so I'm
gonna<00:02:17.790> select<00:02:18.150> him<00:02:18.420> he's<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.319> my

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
gonna select him he's going to be in my

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.410 
gonna select him he's going to be in my
main<00:02:19.680> window<00:02:20.069> here<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.910> I'm<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.330> to

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
main window here and I'm just going to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
main window here and I'm just going to
bring<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.260> magenta<00:02:22.770> down

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
bring the magenta down

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.420 
bring the magenta down
and<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.240> see<00:02:24.569> as<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:25.170> doing<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and I can see as I'm doing this in the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.820 
and I can see as I'm doing this in the
survey<00:02:26.819> mode<00:02:27.060> how<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.050> relates<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
survey mode how that relates to the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.360 
survey mode how that relates to the
other<00:02:28.980> images<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> idea<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:32.099> try

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
other images so the idea here is to try

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.360 
other images so the idea here is to try
to<00:02:32.400> edit<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.780> image<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.380> look<00:02:34.590> more<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.069> line

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
to edit this image to look more in line

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.580 
to edit this image to look more in line
with<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:36.060> other<00:02:36.180> images<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.840> think<00:02:36.959> maybe<00:02:37.410> he

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
with the other images I think maybe he

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.380 
with the other images I think maybe he
needs<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.860> little<00:02:37.980> bit<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.190> fill<00:02:38.430> light<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.300> I'm

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
needs a little bit of fill light so I'm

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.550 
needs a little bit of fill light so I'm
gonna<00:02:39.510> add<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> little<00:02:39.900> bit<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.140> fill<00:02:40.380> light

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
gonna add a little bit of fill light

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.949 
gonna add a little bit of fill light
like<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.310> I'm<00:02:42.060> gonna<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.450> continue<00:02:42.930> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
like that and I'm gonna just continue to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.370 
like that and I'm gonna just continue to
edit<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:44.190> image<00:02:44.340> over<00:02:45.060> here<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.630> my<00:02:45.989> main

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
edit the image over here in my main

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.380 
edit the image over here in my main
window<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.489> I'm<00:02:47.580> gonna<00:02:47.730> look<00:02:47.940> at<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
window but I'm gonna look at it in the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.140 
window but I'm gonna look at it in the
survey<00:02:48.780> window<00:02:49.110> because<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.560> want<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.340> to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
survey window because I want the the to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.540 
survey window because I want the the to
to<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:52.019> match<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.530> want<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> images<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.250> match

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
to to match I want the images to match

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.059 
to to match I want the images to match
up<00:02:53.819> in<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.510> want<00:02:54.870> all<00:02:55.110> these<00:02:55.410> four<00:02:55.650> images

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
up in that I want all these four images

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.820 
up in that I want all these four images
to<00:02:56.580> be<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:56.940> closely<00:02:57.420> matched<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:58.050> as<00:02:58.230> possible

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
to be as closely matched up as possible

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.550 
to be as closely matched up as possible
so<00:02:59.480> essentially<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.690> guess<00:03:00.959> it's<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.410> a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
so essentially I guess it's it's a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.289 
so essentially I guess it's it's a
really<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.250> good<00:03:02.580> tool<00:03:02.819> for<00:03:02.850> doing

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
really you know good tool for doing

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.750 
really you know good tool for doing
color<00:03:03.540> correcting<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:04.200> well<00:03:04.549> because<00:03:05.549> that

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
color correcting as well because that

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.030 
color correcting as well because that
way<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.690> make<00:03:07.110> certain<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.709> all<00:03:07.890> of

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
way you can make certain that all of

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.340 
way you can make certain that all of
your<00:03:08.160> images<00:03:08.519> kind<00:03:08.819> of<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.480> similar<00:03:09.959> look

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
your images kind of have a similar look

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.650 
your images kind of have a similar look
in<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.980> similar<00:03:11.340> feel<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.209> cool<00:03:12.390> thing<00:03:12.630> is

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
in a similar feel and the cool thing is

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.780 
in a similar feel and the cool thing is
that<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.080> just<00:03:13.230> select<00:03:13.830> them<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.610> window

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
that I just select them in one window

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.509 
that I just select them in one window
this<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.720> my<00:03:15.870> edit<00:03:16.200> window<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:17.160> look<00:03:17.400> at

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
this is my edit window and I look at

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.100 
this is my edit window and I look at
them<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.819> survey<00:03:18.180> window<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.840> see

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
them in the survey window just to see

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.380 
them in the survey window just to see
how<00:03:19.380> they<00:03:19.590> relate<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:20.100> each<00:03:20.250> other<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.880> I'm

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
how they relate to each other and I'm

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.460 
how they relate to each other and I'm
just<00:03:21.510> gonna<00:03:21.600> have<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> little<00:03:22.080> bit<00:03:22.170> more<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.410> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
just gonna have a little bit more of a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.190 
just gonna have a little bit more of a
play<00:03:22.680> with<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.069> over<00:03:23.400> here<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.019> let's<00:03:25.019> see

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
play with this over here and let's see

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.900 
play with this over here and let's see
well<00:03:25.500> go<00:03:25.650> over<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.069> guy<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.340> guy<00:03:26.700> looks

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
well go over to this guy this guy looks

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.509 
well go over to this guy this guy looks

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
a little bit green let's see maybe we'll

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.099 
a little bit green let's see maybe we'll
just<00:03:29.700> add<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.940> little<00:03:30.090> bit<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.450> warmth<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> that

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
just add a little bit of warmth to that

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.970 
just add a little bit of warmth to that
so<00:03:32.040> these<00:03:32.549> images<00:03:33.060> are<00:03:33.209> fairly<00:03:33.870> edited<00:03:34.470> now<00:03:34.920> he

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
so these images are fairly edited now he

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.590 
so these images are fairly edited now he
looks<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.370> little<00:03:35.430> bit<00:03:35.670> cool<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.299> I'm<00:03:36.390> just

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
looks a little bit cool so I'm just

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.210 
looks a little bit cool so I'm just
gonna<00:03:36.720> bring<00:03:36.900> up<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.200> color<00:03:37.320> temperature<00:03:37.650> as

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
gonna bring up the color temperature as

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.360 
gonna bring up the color temperature as
much<00:03:39.090> as<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.390> would<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.720> liked<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.530> have<00:03:40.980> just

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
much as I would have liked to have just

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.759 
much as I would have liked to have just
copied<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:42.239> settings<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.019> synchronized<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
copied the settings and synchronized the

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.870 
copied the settings and synchronized the
settings<00:03:44.130> between<00:03:44.310> all<00:03:44.640> these<00:03:44.820> different

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
settings between all these different

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.690 
settings between all these different
images<00:03:45.630> because<00:03:46.560> they<00:03:46.769> they<00:03:47.130> have<00:03:47.160> slightly

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
images because they they have slightly

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.789 
images because they they have slightly
different<00:03:47.880> temperatures<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.630> have<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.530> go<00:03:49.680> in

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
different temperatures I have to go in

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.620 
different temperatures I have to go in

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
these images all in a succession so that

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.270 
these images all in a succession so that
I<00:03:59.670> can<00:04:00.030> tell<00:04:00.299> okay<00:04:00.840> are<00:04:01.320> they<00:04:01.500> closed<00:04:01.859> are<00:04:02.130> they

warmth which one is too cool etc etc so

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.849 
warmth which one is too cool etc etc so

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
know when you have two monitors you know

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.599 
know when you have two monitors you know
there's<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.680> lot<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:13.950> different<00:04:14.370> things<00:04:14.519> you

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
can do you can use your second monitor

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.640 
can do you can use your second monitor
for<00:04:17.519> grid<00:04:17.789> mode<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.169> see<00:04:19.380> the

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
for grid mode so that you can see the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.740 
for grid mode so that you can see the
entire<00:04:20.039> you<00:04:20.519> know<00:04:20.609> balance<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.150> your<00:04:21.239> images

entire you know balance of your images

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.110 
entire you know balance of your images
in<00:04:21.959> one<00:04:22.350> screen<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.039> then<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.550> can<00:04:23.700> just<00:04:23.910> use

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
in one screen and then you can just use

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.770 
in one screen and then you can just use
your<00:04:24.330> primary<00:04:24.570> monitor<00:04:25.050> for<00:04:25.710> editing<00:04:26.780> there's

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
your primary monitor for editing there's

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.180 
your primary monitor for editing there's
just<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.050> multitude<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.590> different<00:04:28.889> things<00:04:29.039> to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
just a multitude of different things to

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.340 
just a multitude of different things to
do<00:04:29.370> but<00:04:29.580> what<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:29.789> really<00:04:30.180> like<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.479> do<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:30.930> this

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
do but what I really like to do is this

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.250 
do but what I really like to do is this
survey<00:04:31.890> mode<00:04:32.130> where<00:04:32.849> you<00:04:33.390> basically<00:04:33.659> take

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
survey mode where you basically take

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.080 
survey mode where you basically take
your<00:04:34.530> selects<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.430> ones<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:35.789> are<00:04:35.880> all<00:04:35.970> going

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
your selects the ones that are all going

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.190 
your selects the ones that are all going
to<00:04:36.180> relate<00:04:36.450> in<00:04:36.659> a<00:04:36.750> set

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
to relate in a set

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.930 
to relate in a set
you<00:04:37.560> put<00:04:37.800> them<00:04:37.950> in<00:04:38.040> survey<00:04:38.400> mode<00:04:38.610> in<00:04:38.760> one

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
you put them in survey mode in one

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.940 
you put them in survey mode in one
monitor<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.600> then<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.170> other<00:04:40.290> monitor<00:04:40.770> is

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
monitor and then the other monitor is

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.290 
monitor and then the other monitor is
where<00:04:41.400> you're<00:04:41.550> going<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.760> be<00:04:41.880> doing<00:04:42.060> your

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
where you're going to be doing your

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.750 
where you're going to be doing your
editing<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:43.140> that<00:04:43.320> all<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.190> edits<00:04:44.520> that

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
editing so that all the the edits that

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.850 
editing so that all the the edits that
you're<00:04:44.940> doing<00:04:45.120> why<00:04:46.050> are<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.260> doing<00:04:46.500> them<00:04:46.620> live

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
you're doing why are you doing them live

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.820 
you're doing why are you doing them live
are<00:04:47.250> going<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.970> be<00:04:48.120> seen<00:04:48.450> in<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.230> adjacent

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
are going to be seen in the adjacent

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.070 
are going to be seen in the adjacent
monitor<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:51.030> succession<00:04:51.450> with<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.930> other
