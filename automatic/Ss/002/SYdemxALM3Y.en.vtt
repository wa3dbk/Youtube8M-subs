tanks<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.510> think<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> answer<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.170> quite

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
tanks I think the answer is quite

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.039 
tanks I think the answer is quite
resounding<00:00:11.280> no<00:00:11.759> right<00:00:12.210> there<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
resounding no right there so the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
to get it around but it looks like the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
to catch up economically it looks like

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
to catch up economically it looks like
ketchup<00:01:54.509> mac<00:01:54.840> or<00:01:54.990> wise<00:01:55.110> fairly<00:01:55.799> quickly<00:01:55.979> and

ketchup mac or wise fairly quickly and
I'm<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.369> seeing<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> lot<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> arbiters

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
I'm not seeing a lot of arbiters

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.789 
I'm not seeing a lot of arbiters
critically<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.840> seeing<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> lot<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.259> the

critically I'm not seeing a lot of the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
critically I'm not seeing a lot of the
higher<00:01:59.009> tech<00:01:59.310> units<00:01:59.640> just<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.390> arbiter

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
higher tech units just the one arbiter

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.149 
higher tech units just the one arbiter
out<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.960> field<00:02:01.140> right<00:02:01.290> now<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.979> haven't

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
out in the field right now and I haven't

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
out in the field right now and I haven't
seen<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> stasis<00:02:02.729> yeah<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> looks<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.360> just

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
seen a stasis yeah it looks like just

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.030 
seen a stasis yeah it looks like just
two<00:02:04.049> arbiters<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> field<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.890> deal

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
two arbiters on the field to deal

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.920 
two arbiters on the field to deal
against<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> very<00:02:06.090> large<00:02:06.329> medic<00:02:06.630> army<00:02:06.840> it's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
against a very large medic army it's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
against a very large medic army it's
going<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> come<00:02:07.200> down<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:07.680> nice<00:02:07.829> EMPs

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
going to come down to some nice EMPs

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.240 
going to come down to some nice EMPs
and<00:02:09.270> EMP<00:02:09.600> dodging<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.040> going<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and EMP dodging I think that's going to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.180 
and EMP dodging I think that's going to
be<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.730> note<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> map<00:02:12.240> right<00:02:12.450> now<00:02:12.600> but

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
be the the note of the map right now but

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.530 
be the the note of the map right now but
LD<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.340> great<00:02:14.520> position<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.910> start<00:02:15.150> pushing

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
LD in a great position to start pushing

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.950 
LD in a great position to start pushing
now<00:02:18.050> Lynn<00:02:19.160> has<00:02:20.160> had<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.940> decent<00:02:21.390> economic

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
now Lynn has had a decent economic

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.710 
now Lynn has had a decent economic
advantage<00:02:22.500> he's<00:02:23.130> got<00:02:23.340> we've<00:02:23.820> had<00:02:24.030> more<00:02:24.210> bases

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
advantage he's got we've had more bases

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.530 
advantage he's got we've had more bases
than<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.020> Terran<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:26.090> Tarin<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.150> caught<00:02:27.360> up

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.010 
he smashed up a big army I'm kind of
curious<00:02:29.550> while<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.120> doesn't<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> big<00:02:30.720> army

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
curious while in doesn't have a big army

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.740 
curious while in doesn't have a big army

current upgrades on his troops to 14 the
Terran<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.720> understand<00:02:37.200> nice<00:02:37.440> stasis

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
Terran and I understand nice stasis

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.980 
Terran and I understand nice stasis
though<00:02:37.980> getting<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.430> Science<00:02:38.880> Vessel<00:02:39.240> but<00:02:39.780> I

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
though getting that Science Vessel but I

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.010 
though getting that Science Vessel but I
know<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:41.220> upgrades<00:02:41.640> aren't<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.090> Jim<00:02:42.450> pvt

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
know that upgrades aren't you Jim pvt

know that upgrades aren't you Jim pvt
but<00:02:43.320> really<00:02:43.680> Lynn<00:02:43.950> right<00:02:44.220> now<00:02:44.400> does<00:02:44.790> not<00:02:45.000> need

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
but really Lynn right now does not need

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.790 
but really Lynn right now does not need
to<00:02:45.360> attack<00:02:45.630> into<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.050> terrance<00:02:46.440> pours<00:02:46.650> i

think<00:02:46.980> that's<00:02:47.100> going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> huge<00:02:47.610> mistake

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
think that's going to be a huge mistake

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.880 
think that's going to be a huge mistake
he's<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.750> use<00:02:48.960> those<00:02:49.110> stasis<00:02:49.380> fields<00:02:49.830> as

he's going to use those stasis fields as

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.540 
kind of a buffer and kind of you know
choke<00:02:51.780> off<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:51.990> protests<00:02:52.620> army<00:02:52.920> kind<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.460> a

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
choke off that protests army kind of a

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.400 
choke off that protests army kind of a
mistake<00:02:53.640> by<00:02:53.970> Lynn<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.900> push<00:02:55.080> into<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.380> I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
mistake by Lynn to push into that I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.990 
mistake by Lynn to push into that I
think<00:02:55.740> what<00:02:55.890> Lynn<00:02:56.070> need<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.460> right<00:02:56.640> now<00:02:56.670> is

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
think what Lynn need to do right now is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120 
think what Lynn need to do right now is
just<00:02:57.300> keep<00:02:57.750> mashing<00:02:57.960> up<00:02:58.230> forces<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.710> lot<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.010> his

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
just keep mashing up forces a lot of his

significant damage to that army coming

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.960 
significant damage to that army coming
back<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:40.980> it's<00:03:41.160> going<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.310> be<00:03:41.370> harassment<00:03:41.700> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
back so it's going to be harassment and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.699 
back so it's going to be harassment and
damage<00:03:42.270> on<00:03:42.420> both<00:03:42.690> ends<00:03:42.930> you're<00:03:43.170> able<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.530> empty

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
damage on both ends you're able to empty

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.780 
damage on both ends you're able to empty
it<00:03:43.800> but<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.070> almost<00:03:44.190> feel<00:03:44.430> like<00:03:44.459> this<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.760> a

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
it but it almost feel like this is a

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.740 
it but it almost feel like this is a
pirate<00:03:45.060> victory<00:03:45.360> he's<00:03:45.450> going<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.630> end<00:03:45.690> up

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
pirate victory he's going to end up

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.940 
pirate victory he's going to end up
losing<00:03:46.050> a<00:03:46.110> lot<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.260> his<00:03:46.410> tributes<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.739> lot<00:03:46.860> of

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
losing a lot of his tributes a lot of

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.070 
losing a lot of his tributes a lot of
his<00:03:47.040> scvs<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.940> looks<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.270> he's<00:03:48.420> having<00:03:48.900> to

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
his scvs it looks like he's having to

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.170 
his scvs it looks like he's having to
empty<00:03:49.230> out<00:03:49.500> his<00:03:49.530> top<00:03:49.950> right<00:03:50.190> base<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:51.060> the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
empty out his top right base in the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.790 
empty out his top right base in the
meantime<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:51.870> LD<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.350> easily<00:03:52.680> going

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
meantime so I think LD is easily going

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.870 
meantime so I think LD is easily going
to<00:03:52.860> be<00:03:52.920> able<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.100> replenish<00:03:53.310> from<00:03:53.580> this<00:03:53.730> he's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
to be able to replenish from this he's

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.040 
to be able to replenish from this he's
easily<00:03:54.090> gonna<00:03:54.390> be<00:03:54.450> able<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.660> turn<00:03:54.810> right<00:03:54.989> back

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
easily gonna be able to turn right back

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.080 
easily gonna be able to turn right back
around<00:03:55.200> with<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:55.680> army<00:03:55.980> he<00:03:56.580> didn't<00:03:56.790> lose<00:03:56.850> any

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
around with this army he didn't lose any

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.390 
around with this army he didn't lose any
factories<00:03:57.600> that's<00:03:57.810> not<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> base<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.400> was

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
factories that's not a base that was

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.710 
factories that's not a base that was
really<00:03:59.640> all<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.850> critical<00:04:00.239> form<00:04:00.420> right<00:04:00.570> at

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
really all that critical form right at

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.479 
really all that critical form right at
this<00:04:00.840> stage<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.200> match<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.070 
this stage of the match and in the
meantime<00:04:02.610> yeah<00:04:03.090> able<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.510> deny<00:04:03.690> won

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
meantime yeah able to deny won

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.820 
meantime yeah able to deny won
simultaneously<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.660> altogether<00:04:06.660> not<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> very

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
simultaneously so altogether not a very

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.960 
simultaneously so altogether not a very
good<00:04:07.890> exchange<00:04:08.130> here<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.520> think<00:04:08.760> he<00:04:08.820> would<00:04:08.910> have

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
good exchange here I think he would have

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.340 
good exchange here I think he would have
been<00:04:09.090> better<00:04:09.330> off<00:04:09.420> if<00:04:09.570> he<00:04:09.840> was<00:04:10.020> going<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.260> go

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
been better off if he was going to go

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.660 
been better off if he was going to go
for<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.590> recall<00:04:10.830> do<00:04:10.950> with<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.160> larger<00:04:11.459> force

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
for a recall do with the larger force

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.640 
for a recall do with the larger force
over<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.330> factory<00:04:12.630> line<00:04:15.320> another<00:04:16.320> thing<00:04:16.530> when

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
going in for a counter-attack

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.730 
going in for a counter-attack
unfortunately<00:05:06.479> going<00:05:06.660> out<00:05:06.780> across<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.380> small

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
unfortunately going out across a small

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.260 
unfortunately going out across a small
gap<00:05:07.919> reinforcements<00:05:08.850> should<00:05:08.970> be<00:05:09.060> able<00:05:09.150> to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
gap reinforcements should be able to

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.409 
gap reinforcements should be able to
crush<00:05:09.449> this<00:05:09.660> easily<00:05:10.139> so<00:05:10.880> basically<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.270> can

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
crush this easily so basically you can

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.600 
crush this easily so basically you can
just<00:05:12.570> continually<00:05:13.229> continue<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.280> press<00:05:14.460> in

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
just continually continue to press in

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
just continually continue to press in

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.760 
with the siege tanks unfortunately
chasing<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.110> little<00:05:16.229> bit<00:05:16.410> so<00:05:16.530> this<00:05:16.650> is

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
chasing it a little bit so this is

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.350 
chasing it a little bit so this is
actually<00:05:16.919> going<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.250> pay<00:05:17.370> off<00:05:17.490> for<00:05:17.699> him<00:05:17.759> even

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
actually going to pay off for him even

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.939 
actually going to pay off for him even
