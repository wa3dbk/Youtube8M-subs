00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.310
 hello I am tommy gunn terminals 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.049
 photography in our last three 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.570
 episodes we talked about the triangle 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.059
 exposure and two of its components 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.469
 the iso and the shutter 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.180
 today let's talk about 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.330
 third component the last 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.260
 opening your lens if you 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.060
 do not watch the episodes 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.970
 previous ones I strongly invite you to 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.220
 open your lens 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.740
 allows light to access the media 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.430
 whether film or sensor 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.399
 digital device while some 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.260
 goals have a fixed opening the 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.440
 majority of market objectives 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.050
 allow you to adapt this opening 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.039
 in photography the aperture is measured 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.499
 in figures f 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.769
 all the details about the same generation 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.179
 of the figure f can be found on my blog this 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.429
 which can be frustrating for young people 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.309
 photographers is that the bigger the figure 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.870
 is crazy and small bigger and 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.350
 opening up your goal and 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.360
 inversely larger and the figure f 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.570
 smaller and opening your 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.840
 goal but let's take a closer look at 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.549
 chains of openness what we 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.729
 generally considers to be a 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:22.009
 grand opening would be worth such 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:25.520
 that f 1.4 f 2.8 the interval between a 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.000
 point 42.8 is called a stop a little 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:35.600
 as for the iso and for the shutter 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:40.539
 after 2.8 we have f4 after katrina 5.6 m6 f 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 11 f-16 f-22 f32 etc 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.850
 the idea is that every time you 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.359
 increase your figure f you divide 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.229
 in fact the volume of light captured by 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:56.450
 the film or the sensor most 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.590
 Goals in the market offers you 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.280
 the possibility to have an opening 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.630
 as big as r4 is as small as 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.039
 ff12 etc 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.649
 with regard to f 1.4 and f 2.8 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.170
 these are usually reserved for 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.930
 so-called luxury objectives that listen 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.209
 much more 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.340
 ah because the very construction of 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.040
 the goal with an opening also 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 big is very expensive here it is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.599
 almost everything one could say about 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.739
 the opening on the role of the opening 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.569
 of the goal in an exhibition in 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.519
 other episodes next we 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.469
 get everything we've learned 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.530
 on the exhibition triangle and its 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.819
 components to answer a question 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.760
 how do you do to have a 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.590
 correct exposure while waiting for the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.299
 next time it's a butt that you 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.109
 says if you like what you see and 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.109
 capture them the
