00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
could charge it up I honestly don't

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
could charge it up I honestly don't
expect<00:01:26.460> much<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> audio<00:01:27.570> quality

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
got to think about its price point

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.920 
got to think about its price point
certainly<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.759> far<00:01:44.939> from<00:01:45.240> being<00:01:45.420> too<00:01:45.570> cream

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
certainly it's far from being too cream

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
certainly it's far from being too cream
in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> crop<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.670> can't

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
in the crop but you can really can't
