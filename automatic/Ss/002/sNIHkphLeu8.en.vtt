 [Music] 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.930
 the transformations of the elements e 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.119
 energy that keeps us alive 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.759
 they also produce waste products 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.860
 the removal of these products is the 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.090
 task of the organs of our system 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.580
 escritorio live involves production 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.460
 waste wherever people 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.920
 jobs or games or live accumulate gods 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.590
 waste to maintain these places of 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.449
 healthy play or work life is necessary 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.150
 develop a removal system of 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.879
 this waste and normally it happens 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.790
 we also accumulate gods in our body 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.650
 waste or waste is produced by 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.100
 cells while performing their functions 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.110
 vital 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.150
 using the food we ingest and water 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.860
 that we drink the blood circulation 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.990
 leads to nutrients from 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.420
 digestive system to these cells 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.670
 substances in the cells are broken down 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.250
 further produce materials 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.140
 raw and release these energy 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.210
 raw materials and this energy come 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.159
 used by cells to produce sugar 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.860
 other essential substances for them 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.479
 survival 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.130
 but in this process they are produced 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.840
 also hazardous materials for the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.200
 cells themselves and of which the cells 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.270
 they must get rid of these materials are 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.300
 the waste in every cell of the body 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.490
 helps to produce waste or 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.020
 residual substances are the product of 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.970
 all the chemical reactions that take place 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.920
 in cells and all transformations 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.350
 of energy that derive from these 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.110
 reactions many chemicals are 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.840
 compounds compounds of salts and nitro 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.330
 genes like carbon dioxide ib the water 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.940
 and heat despite our body 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.190
 it needs water and heat it produces 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.159
 more than you need these 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.290
 only exceed the waste in the single ones 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.820
 cells and organisms composed of 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.530
 more cells are able to 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.330
 survive for a long time by accumulating 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.010
 own slag without the possibility of 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.959
 eliminate them 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.610
 then these slag are transported 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.569
 from cells to liquids that 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.489
 surround and then blood 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.500
 the blood circulation leads these 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.950
 waste products to the excretory system 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.110
 that provides to eliminate them from the body 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.450
 bodies in charge of eliminating 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.440
 Residual substances from the body are three i 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.270
 kidneys and lungs 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.090
 the kidneys have the main function in the 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.800
 escritorio system eliminate about three 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.900
 quarters of residual substances and from 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.170
 blood and gather them in the urine that 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.440
 the kidneys will be expelled from the body 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.670
 reddish bean-shaped organs 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.550
 each the size of a fist 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.260
 slightly smaller than the heart yes 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.160
 found in the lower part of yours 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.870
 vertebral column 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.490
 on the sides of it two large arteries yes 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.920
 branch directly from the orta 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.530
 the main artery of our body e 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.170
 they carry blood to the kidneys, the kidneys 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.880
 they are filled with a lot of blood 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.580
 all our blood goes through 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.010
 the kidneys 20 times per hour 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.840
 let's see how the kidneys extract the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.230
 residual substances from the blood and how 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.110
 then they eliminate them from the body 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.210
 the process is the same for both kidneys 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.100
 the artery that carries blood to the kidneys yes 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.100
 divides into smaller and smaller vessels 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.750
 each vase develops into a structure 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.500
 macroscopic with a more complex shape 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.990
 called nefro nor are there about one 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.520
 million nefro ni in each renÃ©e 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.280
 each of them is made up of passages 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.930
 called the tubules the tubules extend 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.420
 for about 80 km 50 miles the tubules are 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.520
 very tight and twisted these 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.160
 small or frons are the operating units 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.860
 of the kidneys 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.060
 the process is more or less the following 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.010
 entering the kidneys the blood comes 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.310
 pumped into a network of capillaries 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.800
 called glow mere luz that are wrapped 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.420
 from a semicircular-shaped envelope e 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.230
 which is under heine froni la 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.940
 so-called bowman capsule more than 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.010
 half of our blood is formed by 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.620
 plasma plasma is mainly 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.390
 composed of water under the pressure of the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.610
 blood about one fifth of the plasma 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.680
 blood is compressed and induced to 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.110
 cross the walls of the capillaries e 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.510
 reaches the hollow center of the capsules 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.580
 adrenal small organs located on the 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.160
 upper part of the kidneys this process is 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.840
 also called filtering elements 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.490
 Chemicals dissolved in plasma are in 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.560
 able to pass through the walls 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.760
 of capillaries 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.410
 both produce elements 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.800
 chemicals in vital to the operation of the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.840
 body 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.000
 the water and the chemical elements that they are 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.980
 been filtered by blood now pass into 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.110
 this capsule is through the curves e 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.900
 the spirals of u-shaped tubes 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.520
 tubu leurini simultaneously wounded the 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.290
 blood filtered through the tissue 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.450
 of the capillaries that surrounds these 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.980
 small tubes gradually the elements 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.740
 chemicals and the liquid pass again 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.900
 from the glasses and capillaries and come together 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.210
 back to blood what's left 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.860
 del nef ron is the excess of water and 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.110
 chemical elements that are substances in 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.690
 residual cellular activity ie 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.090
 urine the blood that leaves the kidneys now 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.560
 it is infiltrated and cleaned from waste but 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.590
 still contains the right amount of 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.390
 water and chemical elements needed 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.650
 this reabsorption of fluids from 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.630
 part of the kidneys has a function 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.130
 fundamental as it maintains 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.130
 the balance of water in the body 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.420
 urine from the nef ron tubules flows into 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.520
 increasingly larger ducts and transports 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.940
 residual liquids in the central cavity of 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.250
 each kidney these cavities are 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.410
 connected to tubes called ureter 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:54.180
 that carry urine from the kidneys to the 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:56.070
 bladder the bladder is a muscular organ 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.250
 cable able to expand and 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.990
 filling up with this organ urine comes 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.050
 regularly eliminated from the body 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.970
 through the urethra in this way 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.370
 primary tasks of the elimination of 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:13.860
 residual substances from the body have been 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:16.080
 once the kidneys are completed they do the work 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.580
 greater in the escritorio system but also 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.370
 other organs have functions 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.540
 important while the blood circulates 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.700
 through our skin 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.060
 the waste is eliminated through the 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.220
 sweat glands perspiration is 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.010
 the elimination of residual substances 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.290
 through the pores of the skin the 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.180
 perspiration is composed for 99 per 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.010
 hundred of water in which I am 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.500
 dissolved residual substances similar to 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.720
 those we find in urine la 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.040
 function of the sweat glands is of 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.520
 collect water from the blood e 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.930
 compress it on the surface of the skin 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.480
 this inscription of waters and elements 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.070
 chemicals is part of the el 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.500
 in action of excess heat from 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.500
 body too
