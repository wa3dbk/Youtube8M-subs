00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
offshore and now it finally has an
opportunity<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.500> use<00:00:58.680> some<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
opportunity to use some of that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
opportunity to use some of that
now<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.789> say<00:00:59.940> sitting<00:01:00.270> offshore<00:01:00.570> what

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
is it that they didn't want to bring it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520

United States the all-star business you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
United States the all-star business you
mentioned<00:01:36.329> power<00:01:36.869> plants<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.710> talked<00:01:37.979> about

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
mentioned power plants I talked about

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340 
mentioned power plants I talked about
trains<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.119> mean<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.540> an<00:01:39.750> engineering

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
trains I mean is this an engineering

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.010 
trains I mean is this an engineering
conglomerate<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> more<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.450> Jeany

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
conglomerate is this more of what Jeany

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780 
conglomerate is this more of what Jeany
yeah<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.579> very

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
yeah this is this is you know it's very

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
yeah this is this is you know it's very
much<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> big<00:01:45.899> deal<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.439> GE<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> mean<00:01:47.130> jeez

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
much a big deal for GE there I mean jeez

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.639 
much a big deal for GE there I mean jeez
a<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> company<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.020> typically<00:01:49.500> they've

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
a make a company but typically they've

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.080 
a make a company but typically they've
been<00:01:49.770> doing<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> four<00:01:50.640> billion<00:01:50.820> dollar

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
been doing one to four billion dollar

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.749 
been doing one to four billion dollar
deals<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.899> three<00:01:52.530> times<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.399> size<00:01:53.579> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
deals so this is three times the size of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.190 
deals so this is three times the size of
what<00:01:53.820> she's<00:01:54.090> been<00:01:54.360> doing<00:01:54.390> later<00:01:54.750> they<00:01:54.930> didn't

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
know your gas deal I believe last year

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.399 
know your gas deal I believe last year
and<00:01:57.570> that's<00:01:57.689> what<00:01:57.840> you've<00:01:57.960> been<00:01:58.020> seeing<00:01:58.259> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
they'll do a small healthcare deal

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.490 
they'll do a small healthcare deal
they'll<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.360> oilfield<00:02:00.600> services<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.409> now

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
they'll do an oilfield services and now

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.630 
they'll do an oilfield services and now
here<00:02:01.770> they're<00:02:01.890> doing<00:02:02.070> something<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.460> as

here they're doing something that's as
you<00:02:02.759> said<00:02:02.939> more<00:02:03.090> engineering<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.930> also<00:02:04.200> power

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you said more engineering and also power

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560 
you said more engineering and also power
generation<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> mean<00:02:05.969> that's<00:02:06.060> been<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> GE

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
generation so I mean that's been the GE

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.869 
generation so I mean that's been the GE
model<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.170> continuing<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.580> biggest

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
model is continuing to be the biggest

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.140 
model is continuing to be the biggest
diversified<00:02:09.360> industrial<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:09.929> there
