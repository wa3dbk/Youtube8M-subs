00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.830
 locomotives device 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.940
 this is a railway 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.820
 like the ones that there are in all the day 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.200
 locomotives bid from top to bottom 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 taking the passengers where they want 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.590
 to go 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 this railroad has two types of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.689
 locomotive 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.689
 steam locomotives 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.190
 and diesel locomotives 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.220
 but how to know the difference between a 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.410
 diesel locomotive and a steam locomotive is 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.690
 very simple to differentiate them if you know that 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.329
 search for 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.640
 This is an equal steam locomotive 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.829
 that you can see that it's a 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.940
 steam locomotive by the steam that 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.940
 throws by the fireplace 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.570
 This is a diesel locomotive as 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.760
 what you see in software you know it's a 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.739
 diesel locomotive because it does not have 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.739
 chimney or spear steam clouds 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.330
 steam locomotives burn coal 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.930
 that heats the water in your tanks and 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.930
 makes more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.240
 the steam spins the wheels what 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.240
 drives the locomotive 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.340
 diesel locomotives are named 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 because they use diesel fuel to 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.719
 move along 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.729
 diesel locomotives do not need 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.700
 a lot of water or a boiler full of 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.200
 coal like steam locomotives 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.960
 they use a diesel fuel tank 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.330
 to spin their wheels 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.020
 steam locomotives and diesel locomotives 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.180
 They also make very different sounds the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.460
 steam locomotives that blow from this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.920
 shape 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.110
 and the diesel locomotives make a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.110
 grind very loud like this 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.539
 steam locomotives and diesel locomotives 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.430
 they also have very different sounds 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.380
 to notify people who are 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.660
 near 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.350
 steam locomotives have whistles 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.350
 that sound like this 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.170
 and diesel locomotives have a 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.170
 horn that sounds like this 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.830
 the whistle of a steam locomotive 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.020
 it sounds so different to the horn of a 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.190
 diesel locomotive could secure 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.340
 differentiate the inverses 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.040
 let's test what kind of locomotive is going to 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.750
 out of the curve a locomotive 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.750
 diesel or a steam locomotive 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.580
 it's a steam locomotive you guessed it 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.800
 let's try again what kind of 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.810
 locomotive you think a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.170
 steam locomotive or a locomotive 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.170
 He says 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.840
 it's a diesel locomotive you guessed 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.269
 this time 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.220
 now you know the difference between a 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.270
 diesel locomotive 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.270
 and a steam
