00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello, everyone, I am Vivian. 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.800
 What I want to share for you today is a 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.480
 Cold emulsified sauce 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.840
 Mayonnaise 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100
 In fact, mayon is a very versatile sauce. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.360
 It is a very sauce base sauce 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.860
 Like everyone knows 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.720
 Tata sauce 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.500
 Is to use the beauty of the taste 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.520
 Sauce as a base 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.880
 Vivian has shared it for everyone before. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.820
 How to make it 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.320
 More partial taste 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.140
 Sweet 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.760
 Beautiful and beautiful salad dressing 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.000
 Everyone can use 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.240
 The way of beauty and beauty salad dressing 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.760
 Emulsify sauce 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.200
 This way Vivian demonstrates today 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.400
 Using a hand-held food conditioner 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.860
 Hand-held food conditioner 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.240
 When making sauces 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.400
 It will be very, very fast 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.460
 In about 10-20 seconds 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.420
 You can quickly emulsifie the sauce. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.900
 Then let's take a look 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.060
 How to finish quickly 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.300
 Emulsified salad dressing? 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.400
 Then let's prepare the materials. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.260
 Prepared 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.640
 Two yolks 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.060
 1/4 of lemon 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 White wine vinegar 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.240
 Rice vinegar or apple vinegar 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.100
 One and 1/2 tablespoons 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.560
 Liquid grease 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.280
 300ml 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.580
 WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.600
 The so-called Merlin Spicy Soy Sauce 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.360
 Moderate amount 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.860
 About a few drops will be fine. 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.980
 TABASCO SAUCE 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 a few drops 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.320
 a spoonful of mustard sauce 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.520
 Usually used French timid mustard sauce 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.060
 1/2 tsp salt 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.920
 Above is all the materials 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.380
 I have shared it for you before. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460
 The process of emulsification of tabletop beauty and beauty salad dressing 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.480
 The previous film was a more traditional approach. 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.520
 Just slowly mix the oil in 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960
 Today I am going to use a faster method. 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.960
 That fast method today 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.200
 You can try some brands of juice machines. 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.920
 Because it is related to the cutter head 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 What I want to use today is 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.340
 Upright stir bar 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.900
 Stirring with such a cup 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.080
 Or you can buy 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.540
 Daily necessities 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.120
 Some are a little longer 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.060
 a taller mixing cup, you can also 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.280
 Vertical mixer 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.380
 I use this label today. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.500
 Yes 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.380
 Ok, don't advertise for him. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.160
 Everyone can see 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.340
 I use him. 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.920
 As long as it is any commercially available vertical mixer 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.280
 I think it should be fine. 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.440
 Have such a function 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.340
 Vertical mixer 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.140
 Will reduce a lot of time 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.140
 very fast 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.420
 I will know when you see me. 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.060
 Very fast 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
 First of all 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.680
 Put all things first 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.280
 Put in the seasoning cup 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900
 Put the two egg yolks first 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.300
 Everything is put in 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.920
 Salt is also put in 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.660
 vinegar 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.720
 Put in 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.720
 wasabi 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.040
 If you are afraid of friends with mustard sauce 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.600
 Can put a little less 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.300
 But today's recipe 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.500
 Yes 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.880
 Traditional Western recipe 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.320
 Some friends 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.320
 May not like this kind of comparison without sweetness 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.460
 Western style 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.900
 Or Japanese style salad dressing 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.300
 Is not sweet 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.320
 May be more suitable for everyone 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.560
 My beautiful and beautiful salad dressing formula 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.894
 At last 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.680
 Put 1/4 lemon in 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.800
 Pay a little attention 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.760
 Part of the seed 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820
 You can also filter it next to it. 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.700
 Have to pour in again 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.980
 TABASCO SAUCE 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.800
 Let's add some more. 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.140
 You will sprinkle two or three times 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.180
 Merlin Spicy Soy Sauce 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.600
 WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.200
 Carelessly added more 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.140
 It doesn't matter, maybe two or three drops will be added. 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.980
 The last addition is 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.180
 Our oil 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.440
 Part of the grease 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.600
 Pour on top 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.540
 There are a total of 300ml of oil 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.060
 Put it all up, it doesn't matter 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.300
 To be emulsified 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.840
 It moves very fast 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.120
 It is divided into two layers 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.920
 Underneath is the part of the egg yolk 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.200
 Above is grease 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.460
 We are all in one go 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.720
 Put the stir bar directly into the bottom layer 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.520
 To start 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.820
 Please see 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.480
 Already done 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.260
 Very fast 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.340
 Please remember 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.180
 Pull up the power cord 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.560
 Scratch it down again. 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.000
 Otherwise tragedy will occur 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.480
 I have not turned off the machine. 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.180
 So take my own finger 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.420
 When scraping 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.540
 I put the salad on the head with my hand. 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.720
 When scraping down 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.460
 I just hit my hand. 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.060
 At this time, I suggest you pull out the power quickly. 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.880
 Then we scrape it down 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.080
 This is what we are demonstrating for you today. 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.980
 Cold emulsified sauce 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.840
 Mayonnaise 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.040
 Dream kitchen in my home 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.280
 Cooking with audio and video 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.080
 Dream kitchen can also be in your home
