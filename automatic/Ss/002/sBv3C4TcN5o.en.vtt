00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.380 
suddenly the hammer doesn't seem so bad
so<00:04:01.440> what's<00:04:01.650> not<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:02.190> well<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:02.820> will<00:04:03.210> say

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
so what's not to like well I will say

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.930 
so what's not to like well I will say
this<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.960> focus<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.440> Clementine<00:04:04.830> does<00:04:05.670> come

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
this the focus on Clementine does come

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.700 
this the focus on Clementine does come
at<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.120> expense<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.600> other<00:04:06.750> characters<00:04:07.260> like

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
at the expense of other characters like

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.650 
at the expense of other characters like
like<00:04:07.980> season<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.520> had<00:04:08.790> more<00:04:09.060> interesting

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
like season one had more interesting

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.240 
like season one had more interesting
characters<00:04:10.050> in<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.620> one<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.920> seems<00:04:11.100> like

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
characters in this one it seems like

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.490 
characters in this one it seems like
anyone<00:04:11.520> who<00:04:11.790> isn't<00:04:11.970> Clementine<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:13.110> kind<00:04:13.410> of

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
anyone who isn't Clementine is kind of

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.380 
anyone who isn't Clementine is kind of
only<00:04:13.710> there<00:04:14.070> for<00:04:14.100> Clementine<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:15.210> know<00:04:15.330> to

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
only there for Clementine you know to

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.120 
only there for Clementine you know to
develop<00:04:15.840> her<00:04:15.990> character<00:04:16.440> one<00:04:16.770> way<00:04:16.950> or<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
develop her character one way or the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.430 
develop her character one way or the
other<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.880> actually<00:04:18.330> you<00:04:18.510> know<00:04:18.600> we're<00:04:19.170> two

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
other and actually you know we're two

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.590 
other and actually you know we're two
seasons<00:04:19.950> into<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.310> now<00:04:20.520> and<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:21.180> game<00:04:21.330> still

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
seasons into this now and the game still

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.270 
seasons into this now and the game still
has<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.900> same<00:04:21.930> technical<00:04:22.530> problems<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.250> just

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
has the same technical problems it just

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.610 
has the same technical problems it just
doesn't<00:04:24.030> run<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.450> way<00:04:24.630> which<00:04:25.080> sucks<00:04:25.410> because

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
doesn't run that way which sucks because

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.070 
doesn't run that way which sucks because
the<00:04:26.280> design<00:04:26.640> work<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.240> incredibly<00:04:27.810> good

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
the design work is so incredibly good

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.470 
the design work is so incredibly good
like<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.680> art<00:04:28.860> direction<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.760> graphics<00:04:30.300> and

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
like the art direction the graphics and

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.600 
like the art direction the graphics and
the<00:04:30.540> voice<00:04:30.780> work<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.410> writing<00:04:31.860> it's<00:04:32.550> just

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
the voice work and the writing it's just

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.040 
the voice work and the writing it's just
a<00:04:32.820> shame<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.450> doesn't<00:04:33.720> have<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.870> same

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
a shame that it doesn't have the same

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.460 
a shame that it doesn't have the same
quality<00:04:34.620> on<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.890> technical<00:04:35.370> side

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.290 

but<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.560> know<00:04:41.680> even<00:04:42.130> with<00:04:42.280> those<00:04:42.370> hiccups<00:04:42.640> you

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
but you know even with those hiccups you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.000 
but you know even with those hiccups you
guys<00:04:43.480> still<00:04:43.840> need<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.140> play<00:04:44.290> this<00:04:44.470> game<00:04:44.680> or

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
guys still need to play this game or

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.920 
guys still need to play this game or
actually<00:04:45.340> maybe<00:04:45.820> game<00:04:46.180> isn't<00:04:46.540> even<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.780> right

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
actually maybe game isn't even the right

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.420 
actually maybe game isn't even the right
word<00:04:47.140> for<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:47.530> it's<00:04:47.980> more<00:04:48.130> like<00:04:48.280> one<00:04:48.400> of

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
word for this it's more like one of

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.670 
word for this it's more like one of
those<00:04:48.610> choose<00:04:49.510> your<00:04:49.690> own<00:04:49.720> adventure<00:04:49.840> novels

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
only in video or maybe like it's like a

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.660 
only in video or maybe like it's like a
