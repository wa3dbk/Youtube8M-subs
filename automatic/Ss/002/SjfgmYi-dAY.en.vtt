00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
kind of draw in a deeper crease then the
smudging<00:01:29.820> begins<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.049> tricky<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
smudging begins this can be tricky and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
smudging begins this can be tricky and
it's<00:01:31.770> probably<00:01:32.130> better<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> softer

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it's probably better to use a softer

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580 
it's probably better to use a softer
pencil<00:01:33.600> liner<00:01:33.750> because<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.259> makes<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
pencil liner because that makes the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.890 
pencil liner because that makes the
smudging<00:01:34.979> easier<00:01:35.310> once<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.479> done<00:01:36.509> add

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
smudging easier once this is done add

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840 
smudging easier once this is done add
