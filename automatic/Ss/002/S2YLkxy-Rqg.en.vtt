don't<00:03:54.350> realize<00:03:54.889> if<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:55.160> actually<00:03:55.280> take<00:03:55.639> them

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
don't realize if you actually take them

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.849 
don't realize if you actually take them
in<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.510> they<00:03:56.690> are<00:03:56.720> needed<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.440> they<00:03:57.620> can

fantastic<00:04:25.290> but<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:26.190> know<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:27.300> this<00:04:27.449> is<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> very

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
fantastic but I know that this is a very

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.500 
fantastic but I know that this is a very
very<00:04:28.440> good<00:04:28.680> linen<00:04:29.100> I<00:04:29.310> mean<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:29.880> can<00:04:30.030> see<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.330> I

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
very good linen I mean I can see it I

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.780 
very good linen I mean I can see it I
can<00:04:30.540> feel<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:31.650> wide<00:04:31.979> that<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.520> could

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
can feel it it's so wide that you could

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.100 
can feel it it's so wide that you could
make<00:04:33.000> some<00:04:33.180> little<00:04:33.389> cushions<00:04:33.720> out<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:33.990> that

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
make some little cushions out of that

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.260 
make some little cushions out of that
very<00:04:34.350> easily<00:04:34.590> because<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.250> seams<00:04:35.580> are

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
very easily because the seams are

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.350 
very easily because the seams are
already<00:04:36.660> there<00:04:36.870> but<00:04:37.860> because<00:04:38.370> it's<00:04:38.520> so<00:04:38.760> good<00:04:39.030> I

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
already there but because it's so good I

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.390 
already there but because it's so good I
would<00:04:39.780> really<00:04:40.050> consider<00:04:40.290> giving<00:04:41.010> this<00:04:41.130> to

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
would really consider giving this to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.439 
would really consider giving this to
someone<00:04:41.580> who<00:04:41.729> actually<00:04:41.820> knows<00:04:42.120> what<00:04:42.330> they're

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
someone who actually knows what they're

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:42.860 
someone who actually knows what they're
doing

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
doing

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.020 
doing
like<00:04:43.350> junky<00:04:43.800> styling<00:04:44.310> who've<00:04:44.850> been

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
like junky styling who've been

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.180 
like junky styling who've been
refreshing<00:04:45.479> stuff<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.229> about<00:04:46.410> 15<00:04:46.830> years

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
refreshing stuff for about 15 years

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.719 
refreshing stuff for about 15 years
so<00:04:47.699> a<00:04:48.060> hem<00:04:48.479> becomes<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.990> sleeve<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.830> collar<00:04:50.400> used

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
so a hem becomes a sleeve a collar used

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.640 
so a hem becomes a sleeve a collar used
to<00:04:50.850> be<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:50.970> bit<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.240> skirt<00:04:51.600> it's<00:04:52.289> all<00:04:52.440> been

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
to be a bit of a skirt it's all been

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.590 
to be a bit of a skirt it's all been
really<00:04:52.979> nicely<00:04:53.610> put<00:04:53.789> together<00:04:53.970> like<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.360> kind

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
really nicely put together like a kind

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.779

there's panels in this which were from
another<00:04:58.260> old<00:04:58.650> skirt<00:04:59.039> that<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.340> had<00:04:59.690> which<00:05:00.690> is

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
another old skirt that I had which is

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.930
