00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.309
 nds explains what the iphone is and how 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.950
 it works 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:13.380
 that's lea and ben and her dog jack 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.170
 They are planning a new phase of life 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.730
 and want your dream of your own home 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.410
 to fulfill with garden 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.510
 But the times have changed in the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 changed in recent years and therefore also 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.980
 the requirements and conditions to the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.500
 fashion the dream of your own home 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 to fulfill 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.130
 especially in conurbations or in 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 attractive residential areas rising 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.170
 Property prices for years the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 Construction costs have increased 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.250
 conventional solid houses are not just 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.190
 very costly but also time consuming 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 and it takes a long time already 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 One to two years to be in one 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.309
 home can move 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.789
 In addition, they often have one 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.129
 had worse insulation on earlier 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.500
 one the time oneself or with relatives 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.969
 and friends in attendance fell on 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.520
 to create a home 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.040
 but this ability decreases rapidly 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.600
 In addition, many complain about the stress 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.390
 which in classic house building 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.729
 is inevitable and which is often one 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.000
 real test of the family 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.619
 thus, this represents time for many 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 a burden on the relationship 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.060
 or family and the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.100
 work-life-balance and restricts the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.950
 quality of life for the duration of two 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.450
 until three years old 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.189
 due to the shortage of fossil fuels 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.860
 fuels and the energy transition 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.670
 In addition, energy prices are always rising 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.060
 continue on 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.600
 lea and ben against this background 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.189
 for the iphone of mds decided that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.009
 two modules offers one 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.200
 single-storey construction 70 square meters 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.810
 living space and impresses among others 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 through floor to ceiling windows for bright and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.790
 friendly rooms a large living room 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.670
 and a kitchen with a cozy dining area 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.829
 just as lea and ben always are 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.460
 have dreamed and it always remains 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.750
 free space for individual wishes but 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.670
 not only the price and the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.940
 speed of construction play one 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.259
 but also the living health 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.599
 numerous studies prove that the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.730
 Indoor air quality crucially depends on the 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.700
 Targeted selection of construction and 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.220
 Furnishing products depends on lea and ben 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.349
 spend a lot of their time in 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.630
 closed rooms on every German 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.190
 an average of 20 hours 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.950
 day the quality of the used 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.020
 building materials is therefore crucial for that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.960
 well-being and the health of 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.360
 both quickly come over 400 individual 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.720
 Building materials in a building together 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.760
 lea and ben benefit from healthy living 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.470
 build mds because it will be 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.660
 exclusively tested or 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.970
 released building materials in the iphone 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.060
 used by sentinel house 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.980
 the institute in freiburg will be accompanied by the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.410
 compliance with the values ​​will eventually 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.410
 from an independent expert 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.720
 The album will be reviewed in close 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.880
 hegau almost made turnkey 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.920
 and directly to the land of mia and 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.500
 ben transported and in one day 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.540
 put together both feel 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.610
 really comfortable in her own dream house 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.030
 And luck will still be through 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.560
 approaching family growth crowned at 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.600
 a traditional house would have 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.770
 Both are now looking for a bigger house 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:27.720
 need or with great effort classic 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:30.540
 god but the iphone offers lea and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.820
 if a house grows with it anytime 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.300
 It can be expanded with little effort 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.400
 become 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.890
 so will the single-storey two 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.200
 module a two-storey three modules 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.980
 in which then the little love you 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.110
 own children's room education 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.209
 when expanding on a fair module 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.560
 would have the proud grandmother 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.840
 own room for yourself 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.400
 The iphone can be anytime 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.890
 each current life situation 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.450
 to adjust 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.209
 so it is not bad than yourself 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.400
 a few years later professionally new 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.290
 wants to make challenges and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.720
 a new job in another region 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.239
 because the iphone is not only 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.319
 expandable but also at any time 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.530
 low 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.719
 land so the two have to go in 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.409
 your new home no compromises 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.630
 enter 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.530
 They are looking for a new property and 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.120
 the album is coming inside 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.700
 and what the rising energy prices 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.680
 the two are independent of 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.130
 nuclear energy and the increasingly scarce and 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.380
 more expensive oil or gas because they 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.970
 produce your own energy 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.910
 every sunbeam through the 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.830
 photovoltaic system on your roof like that 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.380
 the house comes without energy from outside 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.100
 because it generates the needed 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.500
 energy itself and stores these 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.580
 Another advantage is that the iphone is one 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.440
 kfw efficiency home is 55 and therefore by 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.360
 kfw bickel eligible 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.240
 through the use of solar energy 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.580
 spare empty and if in addition the environment 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.280
 and make their contribution against the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.710
 greenhouse effect so that our earth and 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.380
 nature also for the little lilly and the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:13.140
 desired grandchildren worth living and beautiful 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:16.550
 the aroma remains free to experience 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:22.490
 this is how you build more information today
