and add new stuff for you to go out and
do<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.409> definitely<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:34.920> broken<00:01:35.220> steel<00:01:35.430> is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
do I definitely think broken steel is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.219 
do I definitely think broken steel is
bigger<00:01:35.790> than<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.210> pit<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.600> Anchorage<00:01:36.990> we

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
bigger than the pit in Anchorage we

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.590 
bigger than the pit in Anchorage we
toyed<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.670> while<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> idea<00:01:39.420> of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
toyed for for a little while the idea of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.380 
toyed for for a little while the idea of
potentially<00:01:40.729> putting<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> higher

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
potentially putting it out at a higher

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.999 
potentially putting it out at a higher
price<00:01:42.630> point<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.680> bigger

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
price point because it is a bit bigger

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
price point because it is a bit bigger
in<00:01:44.220> size<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> scope<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:45.570> keeping<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
in size and scope but we're keeping it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.319 
in size and scope but we're keeping it
at<00:01:46.110> 800<00:01:46.560> points<00:01:46.759> feel<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.180> it's

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
at 800 points feel like you know it's

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.999 
at 800 points feel like you know it's
okay<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.439> bigger<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.860> scope

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
okay for it to be a bit bigger in scope

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.740 
okay for it to be a bit bigger in scope
but<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:50.970> value<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.329> people<00:01:51.659> are

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
but if it's a good value and people are

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.200 
but if it's a good value and people are
really<00:01:51.869> into<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.610> which<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.030> will

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
really into it which I think they will

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.450 
really into it which I think they will
be<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
be and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.810 
be and
you<00:01:55.760> know<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.090> that's<00:01:56.299> all<00:01:56.450> right<00:01:56.510> with<00:01:56.659> us
