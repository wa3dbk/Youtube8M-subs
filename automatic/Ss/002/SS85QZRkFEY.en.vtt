00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.680
 now that three of me in this ces 2015 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.379
 We expected without any doubt given the year 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.080
 what is the flying skateboards of 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.640
 return to the future we have not 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.410
 found also I tell you that it would be a 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.810
 bit complicated to see them here 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.720
 circular but yes we have seen one that 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:26.039
 of course it 's very technological it's called 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:29.009
 llull and I say and because I'm unique ego 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.580
 it's so technological because it turns out 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.950
 which is a skateboard that has an engine 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.260
 electric in fact we have here the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 motorcito by this part of here is by 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.180
 where would the electronics be the battery 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 etc. because man goes unplugged 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.290
 we have to move through this gives 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.150
 lots of good speed at speed 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.620
 that we want does not have to be very 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.350
 fast because that we can also 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.210
 control for it we have two options 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.950
 the first option is using this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.600
 I control this remote control that we can 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.340
 put on the wrist has a kind of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 control similar to the hitch 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.060
 remote water on this side what 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.769
 we see are the different ways we can 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.949
 use a more sporty mode and a mode 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.170
 plus 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.390
 ecological to save battery and here 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.340
 So we have the turtle mode and the mode 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.740
 fast rabbit let's go 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.149
 you're supposed to go a lot more 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.560
 fast and a lot slower I would go in 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.909
 the turtle mode of course but 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.399
 there is also another way to be able 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.409
 control this technological skateboard and 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.899
 is with an application that is already 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.640
 available in and today it will be available 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.409
 shortly also for android at the moment 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.969
 it's only on that first platform of 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.630
 technology and let's take a look 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.460
 also so you can see what else you have if 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.619
 you see in this part of here we are going to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.840
 remove the single track we find 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.459
 a usb port this usb port is very 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.829
 curious because it helps us to recharge 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.090
 the remote control but we also 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.060
 it serves to recharge our smartphone 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.979
 we can use it as a battery 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.420
 additional thing is to be comfortable 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.610
 take the skateboard to recharge your 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.709
 gadgets but there are people for everything in this 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.270
 in this part of here what we would have 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.709
 it is a switch that would allow us to change 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.209
 Bluetooth connectivity wi-fi 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.470
 depending on what we want to use 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.229
 if we want to use the remote control 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.899
 if we want to use the application if you 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.220
 we turn the skateboard a moment 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.640
 it weighs a little bit is not 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.860
 very light what we see is this button 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.190
 which is the power off and by 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.590
 here we have the connection to recharge it 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.200
 with electric current we go with what 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.460
 the gases are recharged from all life 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.970
 electricity this fig skateboard has 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.130
 an autonomy of 30 kilometers we go that 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.780
 gives you to go to almost any city 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.820
 from the periphery of madrid or any 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.030
 where you live is approximately 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.070
 about 18 miles its price is 699 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.709
 dollars and about six hundred euros 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.300
 approximately and is already available from 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.800
 done for example if any of those who 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.260
 you are there in Spanish, you are interested 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.780
 can be found in barcelona and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.980
 also online is already available as well 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.390
 that I think the best thing is that what 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.740
 let's test and see if it really works 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.330
 how it has to work and I do not 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.600
 pot around there or murdered anyone the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.600
 fair 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.709
 adio clip &amp; is that I'm going to the future 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.709
 to 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.680
 you have seen and that is how it really is 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.120
 works with someone who does it well 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.040
 there is jp that you will love 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.040
 so I challenge you
