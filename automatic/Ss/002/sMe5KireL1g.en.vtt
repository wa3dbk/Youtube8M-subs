00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.620 
now what I'm going to do is I take my
tinfoil<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:09.280> my<00:02:09.460> lid<00:02:09.640> on<00:02:09.759> top<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:10.390> it's

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
tinfoil then my lid on top so now it's

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.320 
tinfoil then my lid on top so now it's
time<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.080> pop<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.380> in<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.740> oven

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
time to pop it in the oven

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.090 
time to pop it in the oven
3:24<00:02:13.330> procs<00:02:13.630> two<00:02:13.840> hours<00:02:14.140> maybe<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.770> little<00:02:14.890> bit

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
3:24 procs two hours maybe a little bit

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.860 
3:24 procs two hours maybe a little bit
less<00:02:15.280> maybe<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.730> little<00:02:15.850> bit<00:02:16.060> more

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.770 

the<00:02:19.380> reason<00:02:19.770> why<00:02:19.980> short<00:02:20.760> ribs<00:02:21.000> are<00:02:21.180> fantastic

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
the reason why short ribs are fantastic

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.300 
the reason why short ribs are fantastic
for<00:02:21.810> braising<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.099> fat

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
for braising is because of the fat

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.120 
for braising is because of the fat
content<00:02:23.489> as<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.810> see<00:02:24.989> we've<00:02:25.290> raised<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.770> for

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
content as you see we've raised it for

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.490 
content as you see we've raised it for
about<00:02:26.250> two<00:02:26.550> times<00:02:26.849> fifteen<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.349> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
about two times fifteen but you see the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.010 
about two times fifteen but you see the
fat<00:02:28.709> on<00:02:28.890> top<00:02:29.120> that's<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.330> was<00:02:30.480> inside<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
fat on top that's what was inside the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.750 
fat on top that's what was inside the
meat<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.860> why<00:02:32.069> it's<00:02:32.220> fantastic<00:02:32.700> when

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
meat and that's why it's fantastic when

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.550 
meat and that's why it's fantastic when
it<00:02:32.880> comes<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.209> braising<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:33.959> what<00:02:34.110> we<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.410> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it comes to braising but what we have to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710 
it comes to braising but what we have to
do<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:35.250> take<00:02:35.489> some<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.880> off<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.330> just<00:02:36.390> tilt

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
do is take some of it off you just tilt

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.400 
do is take some of it off you just tilt
your<00:02:36.780> pan<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:38.700> run<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.090> ladle<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:43.140> skim

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
your pan just run your ladle just skim

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.670 
your pan just run your ladle just skim
the<00:02:43.590> fat<00:02:43.739> off<00:02:43.950> without<00:02:44.720> removing<00:02:45.720> our

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the fat off without removing our

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.070 
the fat off without removing our
braising<00:02:46.950> juices<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.810> braise<00:02:49.050> with

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
braising juices I like to braise with

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.710 
braising juices I like to braise with
the<00:02:49.560> bone<00:02:49.709> on<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.910> serve<00:02:51.150> without

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the bone on but I like to serve without

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.380 
the bone on but I like to serve without
the<00:02:52.049> bone<00:02:52.310> as<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.030> bones<00:02:54.239> just

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the bone as you can see the bones just

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.160 
the bone as you can see the bones just
dropping<00:02:55.140> off<00:02:55.760> but<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.850> bones<00:02:57.030> Nate's<00:02:57.299> job<00:02:57.660> is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
dropping off but the bones Nate's job is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.840 
dropping off but the bones Nate's job is
that<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.470> flavor<00:02:58.769> its<00:02:59.760> retain<00:03:00.120> moisture<00:03:00.330> I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
that is flavor its retain moisture I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.460 
that is flavor its retain moisture I
think<00:03:02.850> what's<00:03:03.030> really<00:03:03.120> important<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.140> when

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
think what's really important is when

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.020 
think what's really important is when
you<00:03:04.590> cook<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.190> you're<00:03:05.489> cooking<00:03:05.700> for<00:03:05.910> your
