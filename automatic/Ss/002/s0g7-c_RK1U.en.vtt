00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.810 

I<00:00:35.220> didn't<00:00:36.180> want<00:00:36.300> my<00:00:36.329> favorite<00:00:36.720> workers<00:00:37.820> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820

I didn't want my favorite workers and
it's<00:00:38.940> quite<00:00:39.120> perky<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.630> drive<00:00:39.810> as<00:00:40.020> well<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it's quite perky to drive as well and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.330 
it's quite perky to drive as well and
you<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.250> 1.5<00:00:41.790> four-cylinder<00:00:42.780> engine

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you get a 1.5 four-cylinder engine

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.500 
you get a 1.5 four-cylinder engine
I<00:00:44.370> think<00:00:44.760> kicks<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.180> about<00:00:45.360> 117<00:00:46.170> rifles<00:00:47.100> now

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

I think kicks out about 117 rifles now
yeah<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.290> handling<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.090> phenomenal<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.329> just

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
yeah the handling is phenomenal for just

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590 
yeah the handling is phenomenal for just
a<00:00:52.140> little<00:00:52.440> bitty<00:00:52.590> car<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:54.120> read

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
a little bitty car like this I read

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350 
a little bitty car like this I read
somewhere<00:00:54.900> maybe<00:00:55.710> wrong<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.730> weight

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
somewhere maybe wrong but the weight

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.049 
somewhere maybe wrong but the weight
distribution<00:00:57.600> front<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.489> almost

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
distribution front to back is almost

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.140 
distribution front to back is almost
perfect<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.050> 5050<00:01:01.739> which<00:01:02.370> makes<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> driving

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
perfect to 5050 which makes the driving

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.300 
perfect to 5050 which makes the driving
experience<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.440

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
keeps the safety features pretty much

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.609 
keeps the safety features pretty much
identical<00:02:01.539> across<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.750> board<00:02:02.960> even<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.380> their

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
identical across the board even on their

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.029 
identical across the board even on their
you<00:02:04.580> know<00:02:04.610> lower<00:02:04.940> end<00:02:05.210> yeah<00:02:06.020> absolutely<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.950> I

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
you know lower end yeah absolutely and I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.719 
you know lower end yeah absolutely and I
think<00:02:07.220> one<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.820> key<00:02:07.850> things<00:02:08.619> about

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
think one of the the key things about

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.990 
think one of the the key things about
that<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:11.019> even<00:02:12.019> in<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:12.650> car<00:02:12.980> Honda<00:02:13.730> has<00:02:13.850> put

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
that is even in this car Honda has put

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.569 
that is even in this car Honda has put
in<00:02:14.120> their<00:02:14.329> AC<00:02:14.660> body<00:02:15.380> structure<00:02:15.950> which

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
in their AC body structure which

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.600 
in their AC body structure which
obviously<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.030> designed<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:18.040> deflect<00:02:19.040> energy

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
obviously is designed to deflect energy

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.470 
obviously is designed to deflect energy
from<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.880> cabin<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.380> resultant<00:02:22.010> impact<00:02:22.480> you

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480

the<00:04:57.260> Honda<00:04:57.500> Fit<00:04:57.710> which<00:04:57.950> i<00:04:58.100> think<00:04:58.160> is<00:04:58.370> pretty

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
the Honda Fit which i think is pretty

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.430 
the Honda Fit which i think is pretty
awesome<00:04:58.670> and<00:04:59.540> I<00:04:59.600> think<00:04:59.630> one<00:04:59.900> of<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.050> thing<00:05:00.230> one

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
awesome and I think one of the thing one

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.950 
awesome and I think one of the thing one
of<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.620> changes<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.190> Honda<00:05:01.370> did<00:05:01.670> make<00:05:01.960> from

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
of the changes that Honda did make from

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.100 
of the changes that Honda did make from
the<00:05:03.080> 2012<00:05:03.980> to<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.340> 13<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:06.050> car<00:05:06.550> itself<00:05:07.550> is

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
the 2012 to the 13 the car itself is

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.260 
the 2012 to the 13 the car itself is
identical<00:05:09.110> and<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.130> price<00:05:10.340> point<00:05:10.730> is<00:05:10.970> the

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
identical and the price point is the

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.150 
identical and the price point is the
same<00:05:11.540> as<00:05:11.780> well<00:05:12.020> but<00:05:12.500> one<00:05:12.650> of<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.830> things<00:05:12.980> they

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
same as well but one of the things they

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.790 
same as well but one of the things they
did<00:05:13.370> do<00:05:13.580> was<00:05:14.300> change<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.930> couple<00:05:15.620> of<00:05:15.680> the

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
did do was change the couple of the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.900 
did do was change the couple of the
color<00:05:17.680> colors<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:18.920> big<00:05:19.070> was<00:05:19.250> available<00:05:19.550> in

color colors of the big was available in

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.570 
color colors of the big was available in
certainly<00:05:20.840> this<00:05:21.050> one<00:05:21.290> the<00:05:21.440> vortex<00:05:21.890> blue<00:05:22.190> is<00:05:22.520> a

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
certainly this one the vortex blue is a

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.810 
certainly this one the vortex blue is a
new<00:05:23.300> for<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.630> 13<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:25.220> color<00:05:25.490> that<00:05:25.700> they've

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
new for the 13 the color that they've

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.420 
new for the 13 the color that they've
stopped<00:05:26.120> making<00:05:26.570> from<00:05:27.350> the<00:05:27.470> 12<00:05:27.770> which<00:05:28.070> is

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
stopped making from the 12 which is

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.460 
stopped making from the 12 which is
going<00:05:28.640> to<00:05:28.700> appear<00:05:28.790> on<00:05:29.090> 13<00:05:29.540> is<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:29.810> sunburst

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
which is a cool looking car is kind of a

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.640 
which is a cool looking car is kind of a
very<00:05:42.710> very<00:05:42.980> dark<00:05:43.220> purple<00:05:43.780> so<00:05:44.780> there<00:05:45.290> those<00:05:45.530> are

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
very very dark purple so there those are

very very dark purple so there those are
the<00:05:45.740> only<00:05:45.950> changes<00:05:46.430> that<00:05:46.640> under<00:05:46.940> made<00:05:47.210> on<00:05:47.419> the

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
the only changes that under made on the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.080 
the only changes that under made on the
fit<00:05:47.750> from<00:05:48.050> the<00:05:48.169> 12<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.680> 13<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.760> say<00:05:49.940> the

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
fit from the 12 to the 13 and say the

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.880 
fit from the 12 to the 13 and say the
car<00:05:50.300> is<00:05:50.330> identical<00:05:51.169> other<00:05:51.320> than<00:05:51.440> those<00:05:51.560> couple

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
car is identical other than those couple

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.880 
car is identical other than those couple
of<00:05:51.950> color<00:05:52.190> changes<00:05:52.760> and<00:05:53.200> the<00:05:54.200> one<00:05:54.740> of<00:05:54.860> the

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
of color changes and the one of the

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.650 
of color changes and the one of the
things<00:05:55.130> I<00:05:55.280> find<00:05:55.520> awesome<00:05:55.760> is<00:05:56.090> that<00:05:56.240> Honda<00:05:56.450> has

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
things I find awesome is that Honda has

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.390 
things I find awesome is that Honda has
kept<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:56.990> price<00:05:57.200> exactly<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:57.950> same<00:05:58.160> as<00:05:58.370> a

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
kept the price exactly the same as a

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.060 
kept the price exactly the same as a
drug<00:05:58.760> right<00:05:59.180> so<00:05:59.900> so<00:06:00.200> and<00:06:00.470> the<00:06:00.680> turning<00:06:01.040> radius

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
drug right so so and the turning radius

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.969 
drug right so so and the turning radius
is<00:06:01.550> apparently<00:06:02.360> pretty<00:06:02.540> good<00:06:02.780> yeah<00:06:03.500> we<00:06:03.650> around

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
is apparently pretty good yeah we around

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.530 
is apparently pretty good yeah we around
there<00:06:04.160> if<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.370> do<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.550> couple<00:06:04.700> loops<00:06:05.030> there<00:06:05.300> but

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
there if you do a couple loops there but

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.760 
there if you do a couple loops there but
it's<00:06:06.530> really<00:06:06.740> tight<00:06:07.040> so<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:08.350> mean<00:06:09.350> I<00:06:09.410> think<00:06:09.440> it's

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
it's really tight so I mean I think it's

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.920 
it's really tight so I mean I think it's
a<00:06:09.830> for<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.640> value<00:06:11.000> it's<00:06:11.150> an<00:06:11.240> incredible<00:06:11.750> car

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
a for the value it's an incredible car

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.210 
a for the value it's an incredible car
and<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:13.630> mean<00:06:14.630> it's<00:06:14.780> got<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.070> reliability<00:06:16.070> the

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
and I mean it's got the reliability the

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.920 
and I mean it's got the reliability the
safety<00:06:17.350> functionality<00:06:18.350> of<00:06:19.390> you<00:06:20.390> know<00:06:20.479> even<00:06:20.840> if

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
safety functionality of you know even if

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.630 
safety functionality of you know even if
a<00:06:20.990> larger<00:06:21.380> SUV<00:06:21.890> in<00:06:22.070> a<00:06:22.160> small<00:06:22.970> compact<00:06:23.450> car<00:06:23.750> and

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
a larger SUV in a small compact car and

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.890 
a larger SUV in a small compact car and
that's<00:06:25.640> pretty<00:06:25.910> much<00:06:26.030> the

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
that's pretty much the

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.700 
that's pretty much the
the<00:06:27.800> fit<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.550> base<00:06:28.760> -<00:06:29.360> for<00:06:29.540> 2013

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
the fit the base - for 2013

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.170 
the fit the base - for 2013
and<00:06:31.190> then<00:06:31.310> we<00:06:31.460> can<00:06:31.640> do<00:06:31.990> some<00:06:32.990> shots<00:06:33.230> of<00:06:33.500> the

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
and then we can do some shots of the

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.580 
and then we can do some shots of the
interior<00:06:35.180> with<00:06:35.510> the<00:06:35.570> different<00:06:36.290> ways<00:06:36.410> the

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
interior with the different ways the

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.230 
interior with the different ways the
seats<00:06:36.890> fold<00:06:37.160> down<00:06:37.220> stuff<00:06:37.700> like<00:06:37.820> that<00:06:38.000> so<00:06:38.150> you

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
seats fold down stuff like that so you

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.300 
seats fold down stuff like that so you
get<00:06:38.360> an<00:06:38.450> idea<00:06:38.540> of<00:06:38.840> what<00:06:39.110> what<00:06:39.890> that<00:06:40.040> looks<00:06:40.220> like

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
get an idea of what what that looks like

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.820 
get an idea of what what that looks like
-<00:06:40.580> yeah<00:06:40.910> definitely<00:06:41.150> get<00:06:41.510> a<00:06:41.540> ton<00:06:42.440> of<00:06:42.470> stuff<00:06:42.710> in
