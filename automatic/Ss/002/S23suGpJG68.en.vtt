arm<00:00:25.300> now<00:00:26.300> I'd<00:00:26.390> like<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.539> start<00:00:26.810> off<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.170> class

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
arm now I'd like to start off this class

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.830 
arm now I'd like to start off this class
everywhere<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:28.010> do<00:00:28.130> it<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:28.310> like<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:28.520> ask<00:00:28.840> a

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
everywhere I do it I like to ask a

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.779 
everywhere I do it I like to ask a
question<00:00:29.930> just<00:00:30.650> a<00:00:30.800> little<00:00:30.949> reality<00:00:31.189> check<00:00:31.430> to

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
question just a little reality check to

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.640 
question just a little reality check to
give<00:00:31.910> by<00:00:32.029> an<00:00:32.360> impression<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:33.050> what<00:00:33.170> I<00:00:33.230> believe

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
give by an impression of what I believe

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.710 
give by an impression of what I believe
to<00:00:33.680> be<00:00:33.860> true<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.370> it's<00:00:34.970> borne<00:00:35.239> out<00:00:35.390> every<00:00:35.629> time

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
to be true and it's borne out every time

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.260 
to be true and it's borne out every time
I<00:00:35.809> ask<00:00:35.930> this<00:00:36.079> question<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:38.000> I'm<00:00:38.090> going<00:00:38.210> to

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
I ask this question and I'm going to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.549 
I ask this question and I'm going to
include<00:00:38.420> myself<00:00:38.629> in<00:00:38.870> this<00:00:38.989> survey<00:00:39.350> i<00:00:39.379> just

yes kind of put your hand up at any time
in<00:00:45.199> your<00:00:45.290> careers<00:00:45.739> have<00:00:46.519> you<00:00:46.790> had<00:00:48.220> experienced

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
in your careers have you had experienced

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.979 
in your careers have you had experienced
a<00:00:49.309> drivability<00:00:50.180> issue<00:00:50.330> that<00:00:50.570> was<00:00:50.660> tough<00:00:50.870> to

a drivability issue that was tough to

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.530 
a drivability issue that was tough to
diagnose<00:00:51.410> took<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:51.860> too<00:00:52.820> long<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.120> finally

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
diagnose took you too long to finally

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.780 
diagnose took you too long to finally
figured<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.110> out<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.800> figure<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.160> out<00:00:55.250> longer

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
figured it out to figure it out longer

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.640 
figured it out to figure it out longer
than<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.059> thought<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.390> should<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.470> when

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
than you thought it should have and when

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.469 
than you thought it should have and when
you<00:00:57.769> got<00:00:57.949> there<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.489> was<00:00:58.729> a<00:00:58.760> fuel<00:00:59.000> system<00:00:59.360> as

again monitored by the sensor fed back

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.140 
again monitored by the sensor fed back
to<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.410> PCM<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.010> it<00:01:34.100> can<00:01:34.220> keep<00:01:34.400> say<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.730> PCM

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
to the PCM so it can keep say to PCM

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
of this entire class this is what kicks

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.080 
of this entire class this is what kicks
are<00:01:44.870> but<00:01:45.080> on<00:01:45.230> fuel<00:01:45.440> system<00:01:45.740> diagnosis<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:46.610> the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
are but on fuel system diagnosis is the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.270 
are but on fuel system diagnosis is the
concept<00:01:47.510> that<00:01:47.630> pressure<00:01:48.020> volume<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.950> Flo<00:01:49.250> are

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
concept that pressure volume and Flo are

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.430 
concept that pressure volume and Flo are
three<00:01:49.850> different<00:01:50.300> things<00:01:50.720> they<00:01:50.960> are<00:01:50.990> not<00:01:51.260> the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
three different things they are not the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.730 
three different things they are not the
same<00:01:51.620> thing<00:01:51.680> okay<00:01:52.720> if<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:54.409> ever<00:01:54.500> get<00:01:54.680> confused

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
same thing okay if you ever get confused

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.230 
same thing okay if you ever get confused
two<00:01:55.280> weeks<00:01:55.460> turn<00:01:55.580> out<00:01:55.700> two<00:01:55.820> months<00:01:55.970> now<00:01:56.120> two

two weeks turn out two months now two
years<00:01:56.570> ago<00:01:56.659> think<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.140> balloon<00:01:57.380> okay

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
years ago think of the balloon okay

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.200 
years ago think of the balloon okay
we'll<00:01:59.240> blow<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.420> up<00:02:03.400> would<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:04.520> agree<00:02:04.670> this

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
we'll blow it up would you agree this

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.289 
we'll blow it up would you agree this
balloon<00:02:05.510> has<00:02:05.690> pressure<00:02:07.000> how<00:02:08.000> much<00:02:08.119> pressure

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
balloon has pressure how much pressure

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.770 
balloon has pressure how much pressure
does<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.690> have

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.970 

yeah<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> don't<00:02:13.050> know<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.349> got<00:02:13.500> its<00:02:13.890> got

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
yeah I don't know it's got its got

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.500 
yeah I don't know it's got its got
pressure<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.610> could<00:02:14.819> measure<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.390> had<00:02:15.480> a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
pressure we could measure if we had a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.449 
pressure we could measure if we had a
way<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.200> took<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.530> pin<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.980> pop<00:02:17.220> this

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
way if I took a pin and I pop this

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.800 
way if I took a pin and I pop this
balloon<00:02:17.640> you'd<00:02:17.910> hear<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.180> pressure<00:02:18.420> release

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
balloon you'd hear that pressure release

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.410 
balloon you'd hear that pressure release
but<00:02:19.140> okay<00:02:19.769> anyway<00:02:20.190> everybody<00:02:20.790> agrees<00:02:21.120> Scott

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
but okay anyway everybody agrees Scott

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.140 
but okay anyway everybody agrees Scott
pressure<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:24.050> balloon<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.200> volume

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
pressure this is for balloon have volume

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.140 
pressure this is for balloon have volume
how<00:02:27.150> much<00:02:27.300> volume<00:02:27.450> does<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:30.030> got

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
how much volume does it have it's got

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330 
how much volume does it have it's got
three<00:02:30.390> lungfuls<00:02:30.840> three<00:02:31.440> smokers<00:02:31.860> lungfuls

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
three lungfuls three smokers lungfuls

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.790 
three lungfuls three smokers lungfuls
okay<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.690> there's<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.930> measurement<00:02:34.230> right<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
okay but there's a measurement right and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.500 
okay but there's a measurement right and
we<00:02:35.280> could<00:02:35.459> measure<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.819> pressure<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.300> we<00:02:36.390> got

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
we could measure the pressure and we got

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.000 
we could measure the pressure and we got
three<00:02:36.750> smokers<00:02:37.200> lungs<00:02:37.530> full<00:02:37.709> size<00:02:37.890> as<00:02:37.980> a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
three smokers lungs full size as a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.150 
three smokers lungs full size as a
measurement<00:02:38.310> does<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.239> have<00:02:39.330> any<00:02:39.480> flow<00:02:40.160> not

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
measurement does it have any flow not

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.680 
measurement does it have any flow not
yet<00:02:41.459> everybody<00:02:41.730> always<00:02:42.030> gets<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.450> okay<00:02:42.660> now

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
yet everybody always gets it okay now

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.870 
yet everybody always gets it okay now
it's<00:02:43.019> got<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> flow<00:02:43.440> that's<00:02:44.160> three<00:02:44.459> different

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
it's got the flow that's three different

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.400 
it's got the flow that's three different
measurements<00:02:45.390> there's<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.870> measurement<00:02:46.230> of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
measurements there's a measurement of

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.289 
measurements there's a measurement of
pressure<00:02:46.940> measurement<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.000> volume

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
pressure measurement of volume

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.420 
pressure measurement of volume
measurement<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.810> fluff<00:02:49.019> three<00:02:49.739> different

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
