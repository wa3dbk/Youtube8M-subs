00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.700
 So people of pretty much standard 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.969
 the most important for beginners as well 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.760
 he that she stands in the left of the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.910
 submit to the ball then beats 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.110
 go forward in the heat should be about 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.899
 be charged equally 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.039
 maybe how much that should be 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.579
 could start 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.610
 there is always important here the right one 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.739
 angle and the left 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.280
 should be well developed 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.280
 are placed 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.979
 cramped but should loose and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.719
 casually a concern and beyond that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:02:09.750
 then also be of the bad what they are 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:02:13.500
 you should feel more automated 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.739
 the street space of softing and there 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.079
 really again and again ten 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.750
 meter for the mirrors in the stand 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.410
 go in and see that all that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.410
 he feels good 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.690
 the right people whom that 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.540
 probably pretty fast then at 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.870
 the wm of course, there is enough chamber 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.550
 variations that he can make harder 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.160
 a variant is then simply the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.310
 female staggered my 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.489
 make real fans and then just the same 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.870
 Of course, the euro will do that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:01.050
 nothing starts again and something falls 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.130
 looks currently plays you just go 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:09.480
 quite easily because the film about the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.790
 Kugel considered that no bag and 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.239
 the line looks at mountain railways 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.870
 represent the point and the remember 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.269
 is then the point of place claim if 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.799
 you can build the farm yet, of course 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.799
 go a little further 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.180
 the players whom the devices of cindy 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.299
 then should perhaps after 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.370
 interest gestocher concerned by 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:53.319
 wolfs is nothing like the white 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:57.879
 top half to the bar next 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.930
 the fabric where we try in the middle 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:04.329
 alluded 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:07.170
 partly stand the device together 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.170
 to reduce 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.980
 where the journey to worry 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.120
 the little exercise with 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.789
 Just set two balls on approx 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.169
 20 cm apart from each other she poses 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:40.479
 again attempts just always 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:43.400
 Whole table on the bath and back 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.410
 the ball comes through one again 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.180
 have really nice just closed 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.370
 Of course that was a bit harder 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.919
 you can do the coca leaves 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.960
 team up and then it really has to be 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.389
 times that creates the tracks at one 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.440
 sphere broader emphasis what should then 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.570
 maybe as such a profile with it 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.009
 He wants to come to a conclusion, of course 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.570
 every player first then me 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.389
 finally decided on billet 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.669
 has and will do what it wants to do well 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:15.650
 of course, for luck and munich 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.120
 very important tool, of course 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.860
 have more fun with what you do because 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.810
 that does not work without fun 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.810
 thanks to one wanted
