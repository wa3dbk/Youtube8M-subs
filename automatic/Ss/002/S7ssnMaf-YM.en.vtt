into<00:01:47.310> being<00:01:47.910> a<00:01:47.970> quarterback<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.630> league

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
into being a quarterback in this league

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.620 
into being a quarterback in this league
and<00:01:49.440> we<00:01:49.650> did<00:01:49.830> that<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.030> feel<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.270> good

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and we did that and we feel really good

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.890 
and we did that and we feel really good
with<00:01:51.900> with<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.130> or<00:01:53.460> decision<00:01:53.940> as<00:01:54.570> far<00:01:54.750> as

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
with with you know or decision as far as

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.990 
with with you know or decision as far as
a<00:01:54.930> client<00:01:55.140> goes<00:01:55.350> being<00:01:55.590> back<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.190> he's<00:01:56.850> going

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
a client goes being back up he's going

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.609 
a client goes being back up he's going
to<00:01:57.119> work<00:01:57.270> extremely<00:01:57.540> hard<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.260> he<00:01:58.410> knows

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
to work extremely hard I think he knows

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.960 
to work extremely hard I think he knows
that<00:01:58.650> he's<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.100> play<00:01:59.310> away<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.550> being<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
that he's one play away from being the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.500 
that he's one play away from being the
starter<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.560> told<00:02:01.979> him<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.970> so<00:02:03.330> our

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
starter and told him that and so our

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.090 
starter and told him that and so our
expectation<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.229> plan<00:02:04.470> is<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.740> work<00:02:04.890> really

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
expectation for plan is to work really

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.969

believing<00:04:00.140> in<00:04:01.030> trusting<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.990> guy<00:04:03.170> that

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
believing in trusting and the guy that

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.620 
believing in trusting and the guy that
is<00:04:03.560> their<00:04:03.740> quarterback<00:04:04.280> not<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.210> the<00:04:05.360> others

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
is their quarterback not that the others

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.170 
is their quarterback not that the others
didn't<00:04:05.990> have<00:04:06.140> that<00:04:06.550> but<00:04:07.550> again<00:04:07.850> as<00:04:08.000> we

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
didn't have that but again as we

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.720 
didn't have that but again as we
evaluated<00:04:08.810> all<00:04:09.020> of<00:04:09.380> those<00:04:09.530> things<00:04:09.890> not<00:04:10.610> to

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
evaluated all of those things not to

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.160 
evaluated all of those things not to
mention<00:04:10.910> obviously<00:04:11.510> what<00:04:11.690> they<00:04:11.780> do<00:04:11.840> on<00:04:11.960> the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
mention obviously what they do on the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.590 
mention obviously what they do on the
field<00:04:12.320> day<00:04:12.680> in<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.010> day<00:04:13.070> out<00:04:13.190> which<00:04:14.150> was<00:04:14.390> very

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
field day in and day out which was very

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.030 
field day in and day out which was very
close<00:04:15.850> taking<00:04:16.850> all<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:17.150> into<00:04:17.359> consideration

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
close taking all that into consideration

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.289 
close taking all that into consideration
again<00:04:19.040> we<00:04:19.190> just<00:04:19.370> felt<00:04:19.549> like<00:04:19.609> this<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.000> this

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
again we just felt like this is this

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.410 
again we just felt like this is this
gives<00:04:20.600> us<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.870> best<00:04:21.049> opportunity<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.680> win
