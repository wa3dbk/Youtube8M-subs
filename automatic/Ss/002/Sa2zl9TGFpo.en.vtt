00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
ah now most of these platforms ooh have

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.069 
ah now most of these platforms ooh have
nothing<00:03:32.709> on<00:03:32.890> them<00:03:35.340> they're<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:37.019> kind<00:03:38.019> of

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
tricks to get you to go out there and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.830 
tricks to get you to go out there and
explore<00:03:39.700> for<00:03:39.760> things<00:03:40.150> like<00:03:40.239> totems<00:03:40.720> and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
explore for things like totems and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.479 
explore for things like totems and
tribals<00:03:41.370> as<00:03:42.370> far<00:03:42.640> as<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.879> know<00:03:42.939> there<00:03:43.209> are<00:03:43.329> none

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
tribals as far as I know there are none

tribals as far as I know there are none
all<00:03:45.489> right<00:03:45.640> seriously<00:03:45.879> this<00:03:46.209> guy<00:03:46.359> good<00:03:46.510> with

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
all right seriously this guy good with

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.819 
all right seriously this guy good with
you<00:03:46.690> just<00:03:46.870> through<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.109> whole<00:03:47.260> time<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.680> is

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
you just through the whole time this is

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.480 
you just through the whole time this is
getting<00:03:48.129> really<00:03:48.250> annoying

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:02.000 

finally<00:03:55.390> Jesus<00:03:57.990> all<00:03:58.990> right

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.140 

yeah<00:04:03.010> those<00:04:03.190> two<00:04:03.460> out<00:04:03.640> there<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.850> don't<00:04:04.000> have

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
yeah those two out there you don't have

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.700 
yeah those two out there you don't have
anything<00:04:04.390> that<00:04:04.570> furthest<00:04:05.140> one<00:04:05.380> out<00:04:05.530> there

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
anything that furthest one out there

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.620 
anything that furthest one out there
doesn't<00:04:06.040> have<00:04:06.130> anything

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.860 

so<00:04:12.290> as<00:04:12.410> I<00:04:12.560> know<00:04:12.620> they're<00:04:12.920> just<00:04:12.950> traps<00:04:13.780> once<00:04:14.780> you

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
so as I know they're just traps once you

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.120 
so as I know they're just traps once you
get<00:04:15.020> out<00:04:15.140> there<00:04:15.170> usually<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.800> don't<00:04:15.920> have

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
get out there usually you don't have

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.590 
get out there usually you don't have
enough<00:04:16.370> fuel<00:04:16.550> to<00:04:16.640> get<00:04:16.790> back<00:04:22.240> you<00:04:23.240> can<00:04:23.390> imagine

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
enough fuel to get back you can imagine

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.360 
enough fuel to get back you can imagine
being<00:04:24.080> up<00:04:24.200> this<00:04:24.350> high<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.620> fall<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.130> going<00:04:25.250> to

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
being up this high the fall is going to

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:34.950 
being up this high the fall is going to
be<00:04:25.960> instant<00:04:26.960> death

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.340 

luckily<00:04:35.960> there's<00:04:36.260> only<00:04:36.320> one<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.650> those<00:04:36.770> little

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
luckily there's only one of those little

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.820 
luckily there's only one of those little
flying<00:04:39.350> drones<00:04:39.800> out<00:04:40.220> here<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:42.530> would<00:04:42.680> really

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
flying drones out here it would really

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.350 
flying drones out here it would really
be<00:04:43.040> awful<00:04:43.370> if<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.550> had<00:04:43.670> to<00:04:43.760> fight<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:43.940> bunch<00:04:44.180> of

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
be awful if you had to fight a bunch of

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.050 
be awful if you had to fight a bunch of
those<00:04:44.450> things<00:04:44.690> at<00:04:44.810> once<00:04:45.520> they<00:04:46.520> had<00:04:46.700> some<00:04:46.910> sort

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
those things at once they had some sort

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.820 
those things at once they had some sort
of<00:04:47.180> turret<00:04:47.540> on<00:04:47.660> that<00:04:47.810> glider<00:04:48.140> in<00:04:48.380> their<00:04:48.530> riding

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
of turret on that glider in their riding

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.350 
of turret on that glider in their riding
so

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.100 

and<00:04:56.360> here's<00:04:56.569> one<00:04:56.749> thing<00:04:56.870> that's<00:04:56.990> gonna

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
and here's one thing that's gonna

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.860 
and here's one thing that's gonna
confuse<00:04:57.469> the<00:04:57.650> hell<00:04:57.800> out<00:04:57.830> of<00:04:57.949> everybody<00:04:58.870> when

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.459 
confuse the hell out of everybody when
we<00:04:59.930> go<00:05:00.199> in<00:05:00.349> here<00:05:01.300> it's<00:05:02.300> like<00:05:02.539> we<00:05:02.930> just<00:05:02.960> went<00:05:03.770> in

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
we go in here it's like we just went in

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.869 
we go in here it's like we just went in
looks<00:05:06.469> like<00:05:06.529> we're<00:05:06.740> going<00:05:06.889> up<00:05:07.129> the<00:05:07.279> way<00:05:07.849> we

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
played through this section of Rosetta

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.339 
played through this section of Rosetta
in<00:05:30.740> forever<00:05:31.129> but<00:05:32.059> it<00:05:32.389> doesn't<00:05:32.809> it<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.020> kind<00:05:33.289> of

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
in forever but it doesn't it is kind of

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:42.429 
in forever but it doesn't it is kind of
lame<00:05:40.569> these<00:05:41.569> guys<00:05:41.749> are<00:05:41.899> just<00:05:41.990> killing

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
a little too early I just don't feel

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:28.420 
a little too early I just don't feel
like<00:06:15.570> walking<00:06:15.720> down<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.140> hallway<00:06:16.440> I'm<00:06:16.650> lazy

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.610
