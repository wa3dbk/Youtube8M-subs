00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
the flesh pack streamer volume tube

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.819 
the flesh pack streamer volume tube
without<00:01:57.039> any<00:01:57.279> air<00:01:57.579> without<00:01:58.240> any<00:01:58.569> any<00:01:59.529> weight

without any air without any any weight

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.999 
without any air without any any weight
in<00:01:59.859> there<00:02:00.219> and<00:02:00.609> like<00:02:01.179> this<00:02:01.420> one<00:02:01.599> is<00:02:01.749> and<00:02:02.009> well

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
in there and like this one is and well

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.069 
in there and like this one is and well
there<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.459> have<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:03.969> know<00:02:04.359> this<00:02:04.689> popper

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
there you have it I know this popper

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.870 
there you have it I know this popper
head<00:02:05.349> will<00:02:05.529> move<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.889> bit<00:02:06.039> about<00:02:06.310> on<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.700> hook

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
head will move a bit about on the hook

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.870 
head will move a bit about on the hook
but<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.270> well<00:02:08.200> actually<00:02:08.709> really<00:02:09.459> doesn't

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
but that well actually really doesn't

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.180 
but that well actually really doesn't
matter<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.720> course<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.950> can

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
matter and of course you can you can

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.760 
matter and of course you can you can
apply<00:02:12.520> some<00:02:12.580> eyes<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.750> popper<00:02:14.410> headed

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
apply some eyes to this popper headed

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.100 
apply some eyes to this popper headed
you<00:02:14.890> can

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
you can

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.320 
you can
also<00:02:15.410> make<00:02:15.980> some<00:02:16.190> legs<00:02:16.430> if<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.670> want<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:17.120> but

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
also make some legs if you want to but

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.890 
also make some legs if you want to but
but<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:17.960> is<00:02:18.430> basically<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.580> easiest<00:02:20.120> way<00:02:20.690> of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
but this is basically the easiest way of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
but this is basically the easiest way of
fast<00:02:21.530> converting<00:02:22.370> any<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.300> your<00:02:23.750> your<00:02:24.560> other

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
fast converting any of your your other

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.940 
fast converting any of your your other
flies<00:02:25.460> into<00:02:25.820> poppers<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.950> works<00:02:28.930> well

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
flies into poppers and it works well

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.380 
flies into poppers and it works well
this<00:02:30.950> was<00:02:31.190> probably<00:02:31.520> one<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.120> shortest

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
this was probably one of the shortest

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.630 
this was probably one of the shortest
videos<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:33.020> ever<00:02:33.170> made<00:02:33.440> but<00:02:33.620> well<00:02:33.830> there<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.610> go

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
videos I ever made but well there you go

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.570 
videos I ever made but well there you go
an<00:02:35.540> easy<00:02:36.530> easy<00:02:36.650> way<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.550> make<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:38.030> popper
