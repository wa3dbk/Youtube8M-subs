00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 good 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.189
 hello youtube friends we are again 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.980
 here with big pautó 5 this time I do not know 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.250
 I had a problem with the audio I do not know 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.690
 What happened with the audio 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.640
 it was recorded as they burn the video 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.680
 but also because I had to overcome 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.890
 in three here the voice why not 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.930
 did not help me nothing even came 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.170
 friend neither the volume of the game nor anything 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.170
 that is 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.180
 It was a failure but well I could not 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.710
 repeat the video then we are here 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.870
 I wanted to show you this part of the same 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.900
 Friday is not very long 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.080
 here our friend wants to steal 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.890
 like a jewelry store and I wanted to show you that 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.840
 we have several options for in this 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.159
 case two options to be able to steal 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.880
 jewelry then a new one is said 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.980
 option that brings us this gta a new and 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.580
 very good 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.600
 Well, option 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.090
 as 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.060
 we can choose several aspects and how it 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.950
 wants us to realize how we can 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.729
 perform the mission without shimbashi and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.729
 follow as a pattern 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.079
 mandatory then after 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.840
 very good option for a game of this 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.670
 type because even though it's a sandbox 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.080
 and we can go everywhere 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.840
 before we were like 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.830
 limited 100% if we did a mission 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.480
 It had to be the same 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.409
 we always had to do it the same 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.069
 way then 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.950
 no no there was no grace not for the 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.660
 product if you do not know how it was not 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.150
 we had seen exactly present what 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.290
 I put from the same equal here we have two 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.489
 options the one we like the most 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.489
 in which we can perform 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.870
 then as you can see is 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.750
 showing what we can do 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.930
 what we have to do here our friend 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.690
 leader is called is helping here to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.130
 our friend and here we can select 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.170
 two options 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.840
 the options that our 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.290
 then here I already select the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.290
 first 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.450
 but then 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.860
 we choose according to what suits us or what 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.330
 that we want so much 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.260
 after we have already chosen 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.560
 we choose our option 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.450
 So we have the option to save 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.330
 plenty of choosing our team 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.090
 our team that will help us 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.300
 something also new that helps us 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.300
 quite 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.120
 in this case the driver not the son a 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.890
 experienced driver 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.500
 the more experience they have increases 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.350
 better be our helpers more 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.800
 money will charge us 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.260
 then the driver is not as with 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.500
 much 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.900
 very good 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.900
 recrecerá was not very important 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.760
 so that's why I chose 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.530
 - Here we have 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.530
 the gunman is to say what is lame with 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.710
 with very good because suddenly says by 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.840
 the rapping bow 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.700
 then because you do not have to take shot 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.180
 no more than in this grand theft auto 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.510
 already the shots are how they get too much is 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.620
 a good help would be paramount and 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.109
 we have the hacker 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.509
 l harker in this mission will give us time 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.460
 and if the bad guy will give us less time 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.690
 so I do not know how hard it is going to 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.330
 be 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.410
 so I put the nothing better than 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.430
 best 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.430
 if it will be better 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.069
 the rest of the time to carry out the mission 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.069
 already having our team 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.799
 work team 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:51.429
 the leek produces us we will proceed to 

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:51.429
 perform the function 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.530
 and such 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.570
 I think it's important to raise this for the 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.500
 that not the incoming have not played or not 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.500
 have seen but 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:11.100
 to show you again of this 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.100
 great game that brought us rock star 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.440
 then friends 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.529

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.259

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.679

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.679

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.620
