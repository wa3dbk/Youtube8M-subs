Woodford<00:01:17.930> looking<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> sign<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.710> easy<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Woodford looking at the sign is easy to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.240 
Woodford looking at the sign is easy to
think<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.850> our<00:01:21.150> exit<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.470> fifth<00:01:22.770> exit

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
think that our exit is the fifth exit

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
think that our exit is the fifth exit
because<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.600> two<00:01:24.869> openings<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
because there are two openings at the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190 
because there are two openings at the
top<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.090> compare<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> picture<00:01:28.020> on

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
lanes in front of you this means that

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.699 
lanes in front of you this means that
our<00:02:15.010> lane<00:02:15.280> hadn't<00:02:15.670> developed<00:02:15.850> yet<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:17.260> if<00:02:17.500> you

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
our lane hadn't developed yet but if you

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.460 
face the rights must you can your lane
will<00:02:21.520> start<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.790> develop<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.870> pass<00:02:23.140> the

will start to develop as you pass the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.420 
will start to develop as you pass the
first<00:02:23.709> exit<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:26.110> can<00:02:26.140> see<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.740> lane

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
first exit you can see that as the lane

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.820 
first exit you can see that as the lane
opens<00:02:27.850> out<00:02:28.060> you'll<00:02:28.600> see<00:02:28.780> some<00:02:28.959> markings<00:02:29.470> for

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
opens out you'll see some markings for

opens out you'll see some markings for
the<00:02:29.890> a113<00:02:30.820> now<00:02:31.720> all<00:02:32.050> we<00:02:32.290> need<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.440> do<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:33.040> stay

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the a113 now all we need to do is stay

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.610 
the a113 now all we need to do is stay

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.400 
between the lines and this will lead it
to<00:02:35.709> your<00:02:35.800> exit<00:02:36.130> as<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:37.300> pass<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.630> second<00:02:38.080> exit

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
to your exit as you pass the second exit

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.160 
to your exit as you pass the second exit
you<00:02:38.800> can<00:02:38.860> see<00:02:39.190> another<00:02:39.850> lane<00:02:40.120> opening<00:02:40.870> on<00:02:41.050> the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
you can see another lane opening on the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.650 
you can see another lane opening on the
right<00:02:41.410> which<00:02:41.800> then<00:02:42.130> pushes<00:02:42.520> us<00:02:42.790> towards<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
right which then pushes us towards the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.820 
right which then pushes us towards the
middle<00:02:45.300> now<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.110> where<00:02:47.290> things<00:02:47.320> get

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
middle now this is where things get

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.910 
middle now this is where things get
slightly<00:02:48.400> more<00:02:48.640> complicated<00:02:49.920> firstly

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
slightly more complicated firstly

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.070 
slightly more complicated firstly
because<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.790> left<00:02:52.060> lane<00:02:52.270> should<00:02:52.840> lead<00:02:53.050> to

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
because the left lane should lead to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.190 
because the left lane should lead to
just<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.590> a1<00:02:54.190> or<00:02:54.370> four<00:02:54.700> but<00:02:55.330> sometimes<00:02:55.870> people

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
just the a1 or four but sometimes people

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.920 
just the a1 or four but sometimes people
don't<00:02:56.590> stick<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:58.000> second<00:02:58.510> reason<00:02:58.660> is

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
don't stick to that the second reason is

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.440 
don't stick to that the second reason is
because<00:02:59.019> as<00:02:59.769> you<00:03:00.070> go<00:03:00.160> further<00:03:00.430> round<00:03:00.730> we're

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
because as you go further round we're

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.630 
because as you go further round we're
not<00:03:01.690> going<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.110> move<00:03:02.290> out<00:03:02.470> any<00:03:02.680> further<00:03:02.950> we'll

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
not going to move out any further we'll

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.380 
not going to move out any further we'll
stay<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:05.110> middle<00:03:05.320> lane<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:07.000> middling

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
stay in the middle lane the middling

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.240 
stay in the middle lane the middling
gives<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.870> choice<00:03:08.200> between<00:03:08.890> either

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
gives you a choice between either

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.789 
gives you a choice between either
getting<00:03:10.030> off<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.080> one<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.560> three

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
getting off on to the a one and three

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.250 
getting off on to the a one and three
and<00:03:12.070> sticking<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.090> right-hand<00:03:13.420> lane<00:03:13.600> all

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
and sticking to the right-hand lane all

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.650 
and sticking to the right-hand lane all
going<00:03:14.709> further<00:03:15.040> round<00:03:15.280> as<00:03:15.630> demonstrated<00:03:16.630> by

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
going further round as demonstrated by

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.259 
going further round as demonstrated by
the<00:03:16.840> car<00:03:17.140> ahead<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.440> us<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:18.370> other<00:03:18.880> things<00:03:19.150> are

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
the car ahead of us and other things are

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.720 
the car ahead of us and other things are
very<00:03:19.299> mind<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.950> next<00:03:21.370> set<00:03:21.640> of

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
very mind is that the next set of

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.240 
very mind is that the next set of
traffic<00:03:21.910> lights<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.900> last<00:03:23.170> set<00:03:23.410> will<00:03:23.680> always

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
traffic lights the last set will always

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.460 
traffic lights the last set will always
be<00:03:24.459> read<00:03:24.760> by<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.450> time<00:03:25.750> against<00:03:25.989> them<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:28.470> as

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
be read by the time against them and as

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.630 
be read by the time against them and as
we<00:03:29.680> leave<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.070> round<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.310> elm

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
we leave the round of elm

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.880 
we leave the round of elm
we're<00:03:31.090> in<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.450> right<00:03:31.660> hand<00:03:31.900> lane<00:03:32.049> already<00:03:32.590> and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
we're in the right hand lane already and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.310 
we're in the right hand lane already and
that<00:03:33.670> leads<00:03:33.940> us<00:03:34.060> back<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.360> Hermon<00:03:34.900> Hill<00:03:34.959> and
