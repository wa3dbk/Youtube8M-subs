in my black new version the key changes
are<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.070> follows<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.299> first<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:12.750> you're

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
are as follows the first thing you're

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
are as follows the first thing you're
going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.130> fact<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
going to see is the fact that on the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.539 
going to see is the fact that on the
back<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.420> they've<00:01:15.780> moved<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.710> big<00:01:17.100> area<00:01:17.520> of

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
back here they've moved this big area of

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.859 
back here they've moved this big area of
Schoeller<00:01:17.850> DynaTAC<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.600> still

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
Schoeller DynaTAC which is still

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
Schoeller DynaTAC which is still
reflective<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:19.860> moved<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> down<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
reflective and they moved it down and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.469 
reflective and they moved it down and
made<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> stripe

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
made it a stripe

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
made it a stripe
they've<00:01:21.659> also<00:01:21.869> connected<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.560> bungee<00:01:22.799> cord

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
they've also connected this bungee cord

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.620 
they've also connected this bungee cord
and<00:01:23.310> what<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.580> does<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.299> gives<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and what that does is it gives you a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.940 
and what that does is it gives you a
little<00:01:24.810> bit<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:25.110> control<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> back

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
little bit more control here on the back

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
little bit more control here on the back
a<00:01:25.979> little<00:01:26.189> bit<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.490> pack<00:01:26.700> ability<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
a little bit more pack ability but that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
a little bit more pack ability but that
reflectivity<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.590> worked<00:01:28.860> into<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
reflectivity is now worked into the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
reflectivity is now worked into the
bungee<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.610> also<00:01:29.970> worked<00:01:30.329> into<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.689> stripe

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
bungee it's also worked into this stripe
