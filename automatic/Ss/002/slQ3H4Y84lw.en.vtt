00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.770
 In this video tutorial, I will show you how to do it. 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.720
 just such an interesting origami box 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 to create a box take color 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.730
 paper size 20 by 20 centimeters 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.730
 we fold our leaf in half 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.110
 unfold and fold again in half 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.740
 turn around again 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.890
 now every corner we bend to the center 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.930
 and last 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.490
 now we need to find the middle here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.340
 this side for this we fold our 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.980
 billet in half well crease not 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 We mark but only slightly with our fingers 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.200
 we press the top of the paper we get 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.220
 fold this little corner 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.570
 we need to hold on to this crease here 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 So 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.130
 and the intersection of this side and with 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.130
 of this side note 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.590
 I'll put this mark in pencil here 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.960
 It is ours from the mark now for this 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.960
 marks we need to fold a strip 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.700
 fold the strip and unfold 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.700
 paper 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.400
 now this side we need to bend to 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.880
 our intended ski 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.880
 we bend in my 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.170
 here we got two strips do 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:33.480
 two same strips from this position 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.300
 again we find the middle strange 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.610
 marked for tweezers 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.420
 bend the corner of the paper to this point and 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:49.560
 pencil mark the point of intersection 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.680
 at the point of intersection lay the strip 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680
 paper 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:00.370
 do the fold we straighten the paper and 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.370
 bend the upper side to this crease 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.540
 we unroll all leaf at us 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.780
 it turns out a piece of pleat at the bottom 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.020
 small fold 1 fold the triangle 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.459
 on her now this side is needed 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.459
 bend to this fold 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.000
 and once again on the crease do fold with volume 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.000
 there is each side 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.340
 and 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.800
 and 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.670
 this is the result 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.670
 turn over 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.969
 every little square figure 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.969
 we fold diagonally 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.320
 day 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.710
 car wash 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.229
 the third 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:59.919
 and the last will work well 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.919
 folds 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.530
 so that our work is well laid out to us 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.050
 need to work on the diagonal ki in the corners 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.050
 for this we bend paperwork like this 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.449
 we will work every diagonal 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.119
 at last 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.550
 turn over 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.980
 and we outline once again these folds of these 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:42.450
 two and these two 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.450
 with a fire figure so on the floor so 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.800
 and this side 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.280
 We start to collect our box for 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.389
 this one finger open here these 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.490
 here are the pockets and pushing the paper like this 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.840
 a pocket opens here 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:08.119
 and this side is hiding there and turning down 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.129
 strip of paper 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:12.829
 in every corner we repeat the same 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.829
 operation 

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:15.829
 turn down 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:26.400
 we fill in it we straighten a pocket 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.070
 here 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.530
 and straighten feed 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.010
 look again this difficult mother 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:38.700
 folding boxes we have to bend 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:41.100
 top red paper up and white 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.100
 triangle should bend at us in 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.670
 inside here look he bends we 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.010
 there we hide the workpiece and unfold 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.520
 to form the box we had a form 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.520
 public 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:58.529
 the folded side I hold big 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:03.479
 finger and here 's another side bend 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:05.749
 inside make a triangle and hide 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.749
 inside 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.770
 you and I have to lay down this 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.289
 square cube 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.690
 when all the folds are scheduled here 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:21.229
 look they are bent then you easily 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:23.240
 collect the workpiece in a box to 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:27.490
 the box did not open you can 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.490
 fasten it with a bow or ribbon
