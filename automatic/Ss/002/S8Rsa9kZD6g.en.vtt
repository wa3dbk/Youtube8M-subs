can see here I'll put a link down in the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
can see here I'll put a link down in the
description<00:00:40.079> below<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.460> exact<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.000> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
description below see the exact one I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.130 
description below see the exact one I
bought<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.800> only<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.399> was<00:00:44.579> under

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
bought I think it was only it was under

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
bought I think it was only it was under
$13<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.070> twelve<00:00:47.430> dollars<00:00:47.850> so

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
$13 I think like about twelve dollars so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.770 
$13 I think like about twelve dollars so
it's<00:00:48.270> very<00:00:48.539> cheap<00:00:50.300> compared<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.760> OEM

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
it's very cheap compared to the OEM

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.279 
it's very cheap compared to the OEM
version<00:00:55.489> directly<00:00:56.489> from<00:00:56.640> brother<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.329> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
version directly from brother but this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.560 
version directly from brother but this
one<00:00:58.559> actually<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.609> cannot<00:01:00.149> remember<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
one actually I cannot remember the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
one actually I cannot remember the
numbers<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> looking<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> box<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.280> but

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
numbers and looking on the box here but

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.450 
numbers and looking on the box here but
I'm<00:01:02.730> pretty<00:01:02.789> sure<00:01:03.409> this<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> high<00:01:05.100> output

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
I'm pretty sure this was the high output

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.969 
I'm pretty sure this was the high output
one<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:07.280> is<00:01:08.280> comparable<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.380> TN<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
one that is comparable to the TN the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.530 
one that is comparable to the TN the
high<00:01:11.189> yield<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.180> TN<00:01:12.510> 450<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> give

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
high yield the TN 450 you know to give

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.240 
high yield the TN 450 you know to give
you<00:01:15.659> basically<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.170> lot<00:01:16.439> more<00:01:16.680> pages<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you basically a lot more pages of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.960 
you basically a lot more pages of
printing<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:19.159> anyway<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
printing so anyway I'm going to put a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
printing so anyway I'm going to put a
link<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> description<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.259> said

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
link down in the description like I said

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.960 
link down in the description like I said
so<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.070> which<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
so you can see which one it is that I

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.630 
so you can see which one it is that I
got<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.619> show<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.580> now

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
box out of the packaging basically what

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.920 
box out of the packaging basically what
I<00:02:15.549> think<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.030> going<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.209> happen<00:02:16.420> here<00:02:16.780> when<00:02:16.900> I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
I think is going to happen here when I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.930 
I think is going to happen here when I
put<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.280> I'm<00:02:18.370> going<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.519> have<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.790> use

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
put this in is I'm going to have to use

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.680 
put this in is I'm going to have to use
a<00:02:18.970> part<00:02:20.459> from<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.910> current<00:02:22.840> toner<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:25.180> install

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
a part from the current toner to install

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.449 
a part from the current toner to install
on<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.319> then<00:02:26.440> install<00:02:26.829> inside<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
on here and then install inside of the

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.430 
on here and then install inside of the
machine<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:30.090> can<00:02:31.090> see<00:02:31.540> right<00:02:31.870> here<00:02:31.900> it

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
machine so you can see right here it

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.530 
machine so you can see right here it
says<00:02:33.120> eg<00:02:34.120> TB<00:02:34.569> 450<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.410> believe<00:02:36.400> that's<00:02:36.700> whoever

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
says eg TB 450 I believe that's whoever

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.839 
says eg TB 450 I believe that's whoever
manufactures<00:02:38.349> this<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.980> it's<00:02:39.280> their<00:02:39.519> model

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
manufactures this is it's their model

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.949 
manufactures this is it's their model
number<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.450> 450<00:02:41.190> pertains<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.959> basically

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
number but the 450 pertains to basically
