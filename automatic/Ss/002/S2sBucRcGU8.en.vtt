 welcome to another peak in games and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.990
 this time talking about gigantic or 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.470
 giant that is different from other games 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.320
 moba nÃ© that already has there the game he 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.020
 has some shooting elements and the focus 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.039
 him in great giants 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.740
 the developer of gui giant motivated 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 fashion will be released for xbox the year and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.899

 a release title for windows 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.739
 cross-platform with users of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.250
 xbox year 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 I will actually be participating in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.010
 giant and sure to bring 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.660
 for you too here on the giant channel 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.820
 that through the xbox in the year because I 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.890
 I have xbox the year and probably the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.980
 Bring gameplay to you. 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.199
 Let's cheer up people , yes. 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.520
 means that giant will eventually 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.010
 be produced only on windows 10 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.470
 similar to that was the legends for you that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.049
 still do not know the game let's talk one 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.560
 about their differentials and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.200
 reason is a team action game where 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.229
 heroes fighting alongside a guardian 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 one and a fight for supremacy 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 principle the game offers 18 super heroes 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.470
 differentiated and exclusive and very well 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.400
 designed intelligent guardians and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.740
 agile and lethal your guardian is the greatest 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.290
 ally of your team 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.070
 with the help of your team the guardian 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.350
 boost your enemies back 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.530
 going and remodeling on the battlefield 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.370
 Where the business goes is destructive. 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.229
 but your enemies also have a tutor 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.660
 helping them there a giant also 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.690
 who helps your enemies is not only you 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.900
 not one giant to meet the other 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.009
 Imagine what you see is more or less the hulk 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.110
 along with the thing the ultimate goal is 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.540
 work together to overcome the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.739
 enemy guardian then attack your 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.810
 heart when you have the chance and 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.450
 each guardian has his or her 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.350
 attacks and tactics 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.080
 everything from massive strong attacks 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.420
 and destructive tornadoes 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.520
 you can summon creatures to 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.550
 protect strategic points on the map 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.250
 to your team and every creature you 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.440
 summoning makes your guardian grow and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.230
 get even stronger 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.720
 the creatures you put in make more 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.820
 than just attacking your enemies 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.870
 you can choose creatures that heal 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.260
 your team 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.040
 increase your damage locate enemies 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.620
 hidden or resuscitate closer 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.019
 of the action in the game instead of having a 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.560
 Isometric perspective like lol 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.180
 giant that will be played with the camera in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.670
 back of your character 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.340
 another difference of the game in relation to 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.079
 its most traditional competitors to the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.150
 focus on the drive 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:23.640
 You can control your characters. 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.640
 players will have the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.920
 option not only to divert from inves- 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.500
 enemies but also to jump through the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.570
 scenarios discover alternative routes 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.549
 to surprise your opponents if you 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.890

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.250

 The team is still working on the 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.730
 details of the business model 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.459

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.329
 15 characters that change the look of 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.549
