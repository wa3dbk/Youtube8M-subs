00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.779
 found on a fly of at 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.520
 Research and Intervention 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.860
 destruction for a double comment 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.980
 greet flash saÃ¯fi rang it okay 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.450
 quiet and quiet state too 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.980
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.980
 wonderful stop to you to judge 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.199
 thereafter and so we had chosen a 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.940
 little topic for this video that we go 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.879
 try to send a code qr codes cf 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.160
 that would be what will mark us 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.510
 on mw3 and what marked us 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.330
 on the other call of duty before 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.590
 that is, a weapon something 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.480
 different from other call of 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.820
 duty something that really has us 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.550
 who stayed in our heads 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.559
 flash you / code 4 bets on four 4 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.410
 month it's the m16 and the desert eagle 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.730
 oh yes why bala n 16 to me a 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.989
 pussy and a lot finally I find that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.479
 it's easy to play 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.340
 here I choose children on the web 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.990
 and his signs normally on others 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.479
 that tremendous speed difficult and there that 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.970
 remains huge variety without there is not 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.979
 of shit weapons and so in cad code so 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.840
 is a pretty simple weapon to play 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.209
 I am a beginner on cat cat and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.399
 I manage to manage a little with this weapon 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:24.590
 and the single desert which is a weapon 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.599
 to the only secondary weapon drinking 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.009
 it's nothing true on this game 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:29.810
 when we see the three guns we get 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.060
 says that when we have virtues mouth that 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.640
 change all the less so sure that 5 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.810
 what made you tick 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.979
 this is the beginning of the zombie 1 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.039
 it's true that after the goal of the zombie 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.630
 it's all yalaoui never stopped what 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.539
 no more in the shadows until the first 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.009
 fps no it's not my first fps because 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:57.500
 that I'm going to corte 3 but that's in 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:59.869
 line yes yes we say ok the iphone 5 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.130
 what marked me I played recently and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.840
 so what will see who will give in 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.190
 heart I think I'm not the only one 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.679
 in this case there were only 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.599
 hackers so I could not see them 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.750
 good points of the game of the blow this is I 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.280
 stay on my hunger for this game took mw2 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.200
 what marked you then that we 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.270
 is debating the sniper as you can 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.220
 see the magnificent stop of 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.280
 the intervention I'm proud of you fashion 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.870
 kikoolol where I tried cheats 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.760
 it's true but hey you did it 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.620
 three months after landing me it's 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.049
 by that 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.180
 but so what has marked you 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.799
 the other of these towers after Basel and the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.720
 weapons the end of May it would be who is where 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.970
 I was not from the publication of the coup and there 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.620
 the neck especially I think it's okay 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.180
 to mark one has every two years does not have 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.090
 badly played black up sound joy we 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.310
 help the maximum it was we ski with 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.129
 the dogs then it's that to have this 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.790
 luc la sas had camped people when 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.890
 even 1.75 to trigger the appearance of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.000
 campers in quotes to want 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.859
 unlock 7 nape 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.819
 the appearance of the group that it would be that 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.040
 that may have been done before 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.930
 but maybe finally it's me what 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.810
 personally marked me down this is 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.569
 the ump 45 and crazy manade it's not 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.739
 necessarily positive but I played like 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.959
 everyone I think we can not 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.640
 to say we've never played but then that 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.079
 serves to have something I think when 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.480
 we talk about getting up 2 it's one of 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.180
 stuff right now we'll think about it 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.920
 you do not find ah yes it's true that 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.269
 it's the community and now the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.069
 connection there that drops because of 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.180
 kites french good it's not a 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.769
 stuff that really want to mark us 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.169
 i think i can on a blu ray 3d 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.560
 finally good on black ops what is this 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:38.200
 marked you sheaf the low coast was 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:43.269
 again it was for me it's a game 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.459
 hyper s1 I'm going to buy it all no but 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.109
 Weapons and weapons were recent 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.010
 while I was used to code 5 or 4 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.810
 3 so this blackout me this is my first 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.790
 call of duty I immediately hung 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.010
 that's where I understood the principle of 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.299
 Prestigious listening and or green class 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.410
 is all a little young before I think 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.780
 it's not something that marks 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.340
 really ski marked on black ops me 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.049
 I find it was the difficulty for 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.150
 to kill an enemy is not like 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.079
 double b 2 where you want quickly on 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.329
 black hole if you really had to be 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.940
 strong you could return a situation 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.930
 at any time if it was 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.940
 better than your opponent 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.709
 I think it's more present 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.690
 now on she is out on black 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.090
 ops that's fine it's the weapons there are 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.990
 about equal eh yeah you do not 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.880
 easily so 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.009
 good it was the coffee a bit controversial 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.139
 but hey it does not matter you have 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.389
 a lot of backgammon played after the 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.289
 sniper also on blackops to sniper it 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.449
 has completely changed on the crises 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.190
 clave it was really charming after 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.810
 I was not I do not know yet 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.150
 the quick scope we him that armies 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.770
 yes, but when I'm used to 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.199
 blackos have loved giving him apart 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.520
 so that you unblock a gunner 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.740
 seek destruction mingle people 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.750
 elderly what worries him about studies 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.880
 previous there is soon the end for 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.990
 him of course mw3 what is it that made you 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.310
 Mark 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.229
 what will mark you later? 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.759
 as always to block that was not doing the 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.849
 sniper number it was not bad 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.289
 the ease of the snipers and would finally 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.780
 it's me it's a thing that works but 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.919
 not necessarily positively because I 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.419
 think it's nice to know joe 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.650
 sowing fear but when you come across 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.169
 someone sniper who kills too much 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.020
 easily too often this is what 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.190
 marked me it's now it's the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.759
 new fashions they did there in 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.340
 modes for example chaos mode or 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.139
 the affected I like it is not the same 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.490
 but now we are a language and in 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.110
 particles do not really know it is 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.750
 also month what will mark this is the 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.370
 lake compensation is something that 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.919
 really change everything in this game 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.570
 you do not find and my strength for mathias 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.930
 heymann connection to bad players 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.820
 level 2 to progress finally good it's 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.169
 finished for our subject tell us in 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.370
 comments what marked you 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.940
 Hello everyone 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.940
 Hi
