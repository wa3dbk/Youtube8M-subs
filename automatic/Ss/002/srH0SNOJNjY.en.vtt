watching film or doing live scouting

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.990 
watching film or doing live scouting
based<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> positions<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.610> played<00:00:56.879> on

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
based on the positions they played on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
based on the positions they played on
their<00:00:57.120> college<00:00:57.420> teams<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:58.649> i<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
their college teams but i think the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.439 
their college teams but i think the
draft<00:00:59.219> has<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.640> good<00:00:59.760> depth<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
draft has really good depth I think you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
draft has really good depth I think you
need<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.660> quality<00:01:00.930> players<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.980> think<00:01:02.399> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
need a quality players and I think it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.410 
need a quality players and I think it's
all<00:01:02.609> based<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.090> level<00:01:03.359> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
all based on what your level of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.080 
all based on what your level of
expectation<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.460> but<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:06.000> it's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
expectation is but I think I think it's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.460 
expectation is but I think I think it's
a<00:01:06.150> solid<00:01:06.360> draft<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.869> mean<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.229> where<00:01:07.409> we're

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a solid draft I mean I like where we're

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
a solid draft I mean I like where we're
position<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.150> good

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
position I think there are really good

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.719 
position I think there are really good
players<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.290> level<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.640> if

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
players at that level that you know if

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.429

you<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> realistic<00:01:12.540> expectation<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.320> what

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you have a realistic expectation of what

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.469 
you have a realistic expectation of what
they<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.770> produce<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.180> even<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
they can produce I think you even get a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.410

throughout<00:06:35.049> the<00:06:35.229> year<00:06:35.409> and<00:06:35.589> you<00:06:36.519> know<00:06:36.610> coming

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
throughout the year and you know coming

throughout the year and you know coming
in<00:06:37.089> at<00:06:37.539> the<00:06:37.689> end<00:06:37.779> of<00:06:37.899> season<00:06:38.079> and<00:06:38.589> coming<00:06:39.099> into

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
in at the end of season and coming into

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.469 
in at the end of season and coming into
the<00:06:39.279> draft<00:06:39.549> I'm<00:06:39.759> sure<00:06:39.909> we'll<00:06:40.059> do<00:06:40.179> the<00:06:40.299> same

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 
the draft I'm sure we'll do the same

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:42.719 
the draft I'm sure we'll do the same
thing<00:06:40.659> in<00:06:40.749> free<00:06:40.929> agency<00:06:41.049> but<00:06:41.559> I<00:06:42.069> think<00:06:42.610> it's

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
thing in free agency but I think it's

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.729 
thing in free agency but I think it's
important<00:06:43.149> that<00:06:43.179> the<00:06:43.449> that<00:06:44.049> the<00:06:44.079> roster<00:06:44.559> makes

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:44.739 
important that the that the roster makes

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:47.429
