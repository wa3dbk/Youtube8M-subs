00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.100
 the free application slide movies 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.080
 that can be used to get out 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 several photos taken 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.250
 to make a short video or a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.469
 short video slideshow which one also with 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.880
 music can be inferior if we do that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.500
 show the application at just above 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.970
 right you can create new who 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 was made around how long the whole thing 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.710
 I say 30 seconds 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.330
 and would like to have this in landscape format here 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 also continue and can tell photos 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.560
 Add at least five to a maximum of 30 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 bottom left I come to the photo 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.050
 library I'll jump in and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.270
 just take the first 12345 here 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.579
 plant pictures that we have in there 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.440
 I keep going , so we need it 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.239
 customer then proposes music to me or 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 First a handful of filters can do that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.760
 But I do not have to apply it 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.760
 I'll take the somewhat powerful filter 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.920
 can choose my music and have it now 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.609
 also the possibility of your title 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.159
 I'll call this video 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:08.250
 nature finished so well from so far title 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.960
 on the video yes font with me lust 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.119
 maybe still have a color through 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
 in finnish the exported in the movie 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.810
 brown companies get what they need 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.460
 for a longer and for how many pictures 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.409
 you have decided and afterwards 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 We should actually have the little clip 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.270
 then we play by e-mail 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.060
 can send by sms or imessage l 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.409
 to send in the family 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 yes, and you should be a relatively simple one 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.920
 variant the snapshots how to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.900
 has done a bit on the way 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 to prepare it easier 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.500
 Maybe you can consume it 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.939
 can look a bit more beautiful than 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.430
 just look through five pictures 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.049
 wait to pass through a second and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.610
 just leave it in real-time with time 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.680
 run with it was about to see again 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.420
 lasts the whole story is here 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.500
 by the way also from 5s 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.630
 the movie is rendered and should be slow 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.130
 but surely the lakes some believe 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.570
 wanted to come to the end there we have 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.460
 see them and them 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.840
 now with one of the preset ones 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.100
 songs you could if you had loss 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.290
 also music from your own library 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.789
 below we have the sharing 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.400
 options and i showcase i 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.570
 just continue filming with and that is 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.570
 possible with the application
