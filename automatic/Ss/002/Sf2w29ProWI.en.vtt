something happens down here well it's
there<00:01:33.600> before<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.500> even<00:01:34.590> think<00:01:34.799> about<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
there before you can even think about it

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
there before you can even think about it
now<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.820> information<00:01:36.000> has<00:01:36.420> been<00:01:36.540> processed

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
now that information has been processed

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.410 
now that information has been processed
and<00:01:37.200> sent<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.369> no<00:01:38.610> resistance<00:01:39.000> of

to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> brain<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.240> processed<00:01:42.950> it's<00:01:43.950> in

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
to the brain to be processed it's in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.130 
to the brain to be processed it's in
other<00:01:44.790> words<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> goes<00:01:45.240> there

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
other words it goes there

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.069
