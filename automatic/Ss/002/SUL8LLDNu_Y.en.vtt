00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello everyone and today we 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.980
 is rather amazing when 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.870
 I had sorry for the team at the microphone I 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.719
 am still sick but worry 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 not here I manage to hold after five 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.480
 minutes for all and so that's it takes 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 an acebo tutorial with the crossbow so good 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.820
 the dive the lease is stable with the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 three so already thought you'll need the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.740
 electric charge or the room or tex 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.669
 and of course the crossbow I progress and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 to games because I want 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.800
 so you see when I pull the sides 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.050
 of the crossbow these cards are not going to have to 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 wait for this moment to change weapons 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.680
 and take his electric charge like that 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.870
 that's what will get you back soon enough 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 much faster than if you change 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.000
 to get to you on the only one so it's okay 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.340
 put you much faster 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 the intruder must wait until it is 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.619
 in the air and take the electric charge 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.270
 while changing art so here 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.340
 now must change weapons 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:16.170
 but I missed a bit it works too without 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.970
 without discomfort do not worry you 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.049
 So jelly launched it takes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.670
 supervisors to keep her us you 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.530
 can also rotate I suicide 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.820
 and you too do so without harm is there 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.799
 the rock and pia so the fault just a 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.079
 little bit fast learn it gesture en 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.759
 direct triangle this in it takes you 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.560
 too much time 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.030
 look at it takes too much time 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.390
 go you have arrived directly 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.220
 in the water here I did not make a mass 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.810
 of time so it's a tutorial to these 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 practical because it allows you to 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 to make pretty good trip shot I can 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.180
 not go back small club since he 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.110
 there are a few people sorry here 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.360
 I hope you do not hear 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.010
 my mother yelling behind but good so 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.320
 this is a title i shot so you 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.180
 wait for these cards to wait for you 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.260
 that it departs and at that moment you 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.070
 take your electric charge as you 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.000
 had on triangle 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.050
 I had a little bit to take and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.930
 blow it's going to put you lets do 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.240
 really and rich iott magic that's with 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.500
 they smirking smirk I know when you 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:27.610
 take it because otherwise it's okay 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.350
 do it okay it does audits for the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.260
 little whites that's gonna make you really 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.360
 very beautiful shot tricks 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.970
 here I go back with pomp 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.670
 so is I saying or pulling that you 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.050
 wait for it deviates and you take 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.610
 your electric charge and you change 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.420
 weapon 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.340
 once you understand it's 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.739
 very very easy for sometimes it happens 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.380
 it's not going to work many times 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.420
 right away because there I'm too confident 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.260
 that's what happens to me 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.060
 do not worry it's super easy 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.060
 to take in hand so to look at home 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.260
 to show us of yesteryear the best is to 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.580
 to play clown because if you play 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.720
 not paddock it's going to be a lot more 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.670
 complicated here you see but with 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.959
 malaise is still a lot more 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.610
 easy on the neck so here I wanted 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.100
 it was my first time you trick shots 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.530
 so you saw I succeed at not all 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.110
 and it bothers me a lot the mouth la 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.060
 throat mouth short that's because there is 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.890
 3.8 or 2 it's still one too 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.920
 good tutorial go a little last for the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.739
 end to shit 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.519
 well we will still try it then I 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.480
 you repeat it 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.590
 ah yes we can do it too with the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.120
 holy thecla 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.220
 me but it's more complicated sir 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.550
 must change his hands even placed 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:48.470
 a little more boring otherwise it will be done 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:51.800
 like you've seen it gold on this at 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.690
 review I hope you pass you 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.049
 pass a good video you happen to him 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.049
 story
