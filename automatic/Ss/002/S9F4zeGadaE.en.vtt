00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
the back of this knife you could

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.050 
the back of this knife you could
potentially<00:01:18.500> add<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.100> lanyard<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.850> holes

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
potentially add a lanyard to the holes

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.990 
potentially add a lanyard to the holes
there<00:01:20.440> but<00:01:21.440> it's<00:01:21.560> got<00:01:21.680> a<00:01:21.710> nice<00:01:22.010> grip<00:01:22.549> on<00:01:22.790> the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
there but it's got a nice grip on the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.580 
there but it's got a nice grip on the
back<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.450> handle<00:01:23.780> there<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.170> even<00:01:24.320> a

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
back of the handle there and even a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.160 
back of the handle there and even a
thumb<00:01:24.890> grip<00:01:25.100> here<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.540> don't<00:01:26.840> have<00:01:27.020> to
