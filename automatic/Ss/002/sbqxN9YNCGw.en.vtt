00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
but anyways it took me since august 17th

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.820 
but anyways it took me since august 17th
from<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.779> was<00:00:24.900> my<00:00:25.019> first<00:00:25.289> episode<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.800> i

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
from that was my first episode that i

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.529 
from that was my first episode that i
uploaded<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.789> probably<00:00:26.970> took<00:00:27.119> me<00:00:27.300> three

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
uploaded and it probably took me three

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.779 
uploaded and it probably took me three
days<00:00:27.689> before<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> make<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.130> i'd<00:00:29.730> say

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
days before that to make it so i'd say

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.020 
days before that to make it so i'd say
it's<00:00:30.300> been<00:00:30.510> since<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.260> 14th<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> august<00:00:32.579> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it's been since the 14th of august that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.850 
it's been since the 14th of august that
i<00:00:33.090> started<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.719> series<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.710> now

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
i started this series and now right now

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.790 
i started this series and now right now
it's<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.280> november<00:00:35.790> 21st<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:37.260> recording

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it's the november 21st as of recording

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040 
it's the november 21st as of recording
so<00:00:38.070> that's<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.430> pretty<00:00:38.850> long<00:00:39.239> series<00:00:39.719> three

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so that's a pretty long series three

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
so that's a pretty long series three
months<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:40.980> week<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.879> did<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.180> math

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
months and one week if I did my math

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.779 
months and one week if I did my math
right<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.660> think<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.989> did<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.890> yeah<00:00:44.070> overall<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
right I think I did so yeah overall the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.450 
right I think I did so yeah overall the
entire<00:00:45.090> thing<00:00:45.390> I'd<00:00:45.570> killed<00:00:46.079> around<00:00:46.530> 15<00:00:47.219> per

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
entire thing I'd killed around 15 per

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.270 
entire thing I'd killed around 15 per
hour<00:00:47.640> non-stop<00:00:48.350> like<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.559> average<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.219> was

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
hour non-stop like on average it was

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
hour non-stop like on average it was
around<00:00:50.520> 15<00:00:51.030> per<00:00:51.239> hour<00:00:51.360> which<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> pretty<00:00:51.960> good

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
around 15 per hour which is pretty good

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
around 15 per hour which is pretty good
because<00:00:52.559> at<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:52.890> max<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.430> was<00:00:53.550> getting<00:00:53.820> 21<00:00:54.270> per

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
because at my max I was getting 21 per

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.930 
because at my max I was getting 21 per
hour<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.930> most<00:00:55.559> trips<00:00:55.860> were<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.219> 18<00:00:56.670> an<00:00:56.820> hour

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
hour and most trips were like 18 an hour

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.270 
hour and most trips were like 18 an hour
so<00:00:57.270> 15<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:57.960> hour<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> pretty<00:00:58.410> good<00:00:58.680> including

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so 15 an hour is pretty good including

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880 
so 15 an hour is pretty good including
like<00:00:59.430> waiting<00:00:59.789> time<00:01:00.030> dying<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.469> yeah<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.829> was

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
like waiting time dying so yeah it was

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.250 
like waiting time dying so yeah it was
around<00:01:02.660> 70<00:01:03.660> hours<00:01:04.140> worth<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.890> killing<00:01:05.220> QbD<00:01:05.610> and
