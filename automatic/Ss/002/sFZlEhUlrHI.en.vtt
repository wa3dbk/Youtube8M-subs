what<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> started<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.100> didn't<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
what you started and didn't get the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.779 
what you started and didn't get the
layers<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.329> today's<00:00:43.110> Ares<00:00:43.410> -<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.860> take<00:00:44.610> back

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
layers in today's Ares - I take back

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
layers in today's Ares - I take back
what<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> said<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.629> there<00:00:45.840> definitely<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
what I said and there definitely are a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.389 
what I said and there definitely are a
student<00:00:51.469> yeah<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:52.800> probably<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.309> only

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
student yeah I think probably the only

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.400 
student yeah I think probably the only
downfall<00:00:53.670> would<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> size<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
downfall would be the size of the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.110 
downfall would be the size of the
portion<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.850> terms<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
portion I don't think in terms of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.670 
portion I don't think in terms of
expecting<00:00:57.570> something<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.170> delicate

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
expecting something that's so delicate

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 
expecting something that's so delicate
only<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> bit<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.789> amante's<00:01:00.420> portion

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
only one a bit more amante's portion

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.630 
only one a bit more amante's portion

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.100 

so<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.640> looks<00:01:33.820> as<00:01:33.970> if<00:01:34.000> Claire's<00:01:34.390> pulled<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.960> off

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
so it looks as if Claire's pulled it off

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.080 
so it looks as if Claire's pulled it off
but<00:01:35.860> now<00:01:36.010> it's<00:01:36.190> time<00:01:36.400> for<00:01:36.430> her<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.880> taste

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.890 
Danny's pot I think he needs to maybe
obviously<00:01:39.760> work<00:01:39.940> on<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.210> presentation<00:01:40.810> of

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
the dish I think it could really like

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.030
