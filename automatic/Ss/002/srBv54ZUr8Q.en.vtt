00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Iron Rose

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Lyrics by Jonathan LEE, music by Sandy LAM, performed by Dingding

00:00:10.486 --> 00:00:12.358
Like a ghost hidden deep in the heart,

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:18.124
the feeling of decadence always follows her.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.219
She doesn't mind spitting out words that hurt others.

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:32.460
Don't try to convince her to love with no regret.

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:36.439
Loving with no regret is too unrealistic.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.632
She never thinks that love is the most beautiful.

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:46.594
She says all love is fake.

00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:48.887
Like a rose in wild field,

00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.086
She uses her proud petals

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:55.719
to resist the fate of withering after blossoming.

00:00:55.954 --> 00:00:59.886
So she is ardent and dubious, appealing and specious.

00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:04.471
She is driven by her instinct.

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:08.824
She always gives out her love.

00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:13.568
Each love is casual.

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:17.779
She doesn't mind if her heart is broken.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.212
If she is serious to love,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.675
she always ends up in despair and depression.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.922
Like a rose in wild field,

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.076
She uses her proud petals

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:32.661
to resist the fate of withering after blossoming.

00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:36.827
So she is ardent and dubious, appealing and specious.

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:41.506
She is driven by her instinct.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.766
Everytime she gives out her love,

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:50.539
the pleasure deserves recall.

00:01:50.774 --> 00:01:54.705
The feeling never fades away after a long time,

00:01:54.985 --> 00:02:03.456
like a hangover persisting in the morning.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:13.752
Isn't it true? She says she is not afraid of anyone.
