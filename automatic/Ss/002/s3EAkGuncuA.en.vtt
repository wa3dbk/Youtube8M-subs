this<00:02:53.880> piece<00:02:54.180> right<00:02:54.329> here<00:02:54.390> was<00:02:55.140> actually

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
this piece right here was actually

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.979 
this piece right here was actually
detached<00:02:55.860> from<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.610> base<00:02:56.810> actually<00:02:57.810> posed<00:02:57.930> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
detached from the base actually posed to

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.830 
detached from the base actually posed to
be<00:02:58.079> connected<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> base<00:02:58.799> but

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
be connected to the base but

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.819 
be connected to the base but
unfortunately<00:03:00.840> arrived<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.440> be<00:03:01.560> probably

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489

using<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.849> plain<00:04:08.060> base<00:04:08.239> or<00:04:08.390> something<00:04:08.599> like

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
using a plain base or something like

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.009 
using a plain base or something like
that<00:04:09.430> don't<00:04:10.430> anyone<00:04:11.030> unfortunate<00:04:11.750> thing<00:04:11.840> but

that don't anyone unfortunate thing but

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.150 
that don't anyone unfortunate thing but
it's<00:04:12.140> kind<00:04:12.319> of<00:04:12.349> unbalanced<00:04:12.829> if<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.010> see<00:04:13.129> a

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
it's kind of unbalanced if you see a

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.580 
it's kind of unbalanced if you see a
wall<00:04:13.370> over<00:04:13.400> here

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
wall over here

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.629 
wall over here
that's<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.650> bigger<00:04:15.859> of<00:04:15.920> issue<00:04:16.070> when<00:04:16.430> just

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
that's a bigger of issue when just

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.430 
that's a bigger of issue when just
leaving<00:04:17.060> her<00:04:17.150> standing<00:04:17.449> but<00:04:17.840> that's<00:04:18.350> just

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
leaving her standing but that's just

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.550 
leaving her standing but that's just
something<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.709> keep<00:04:18.799> in<00:04:18.949> mind<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:21.079> each<00:04:21.380> of

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
something to keep in mind and each of

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.320 
something to keep in mind and each of
these<00:04:21.650> chains<00:04:21.979> are<00:04:22.460> actually<00:04:22.760> all<00:04:22.850> separate

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
these chains are actually all separate

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.480 
these chains are actually all separate
pieces<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:24.020> they<00:04:24.560> were<00:04:24.620> quite<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:25.100> pain<00:04:25.340> in<00:04:25.430> the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
pieces and they were quite a pain in the
