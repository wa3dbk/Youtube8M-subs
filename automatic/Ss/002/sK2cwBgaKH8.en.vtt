wouldn't<00:02:53.660> be<00:02:53.750> hard<00:02:53.930> at<00:02:54.110> all

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
wouldn't be hard at all

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.250 
wouldn't be hard at all
otherwise<00:02:55.760> I've<00:02:55.940> got<00:02:56.120> my<00:02:56.270> hinge<00:02:56.540> covers<00:02:56.959> on

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.140 

I'll<00:03:00.260> probably<00:03:00.560> customize<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.790> bit<00:03:01.940> more

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
I'll probably customize it a bit more

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.630 
I'll probably customize it a bit more
with<00:03:02.690> um<00:03:03.850> decals<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.180> stuff<00:03:05.570> but<00:03:06.370> don't<00:03:07.370> need

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
with um decals and stuff but don't need

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.820 
with um decals and stuff but don't need
to<00:03:08.680> really<00:03:09.680> worry<00:03:11.290> about<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.500> too<00:03:12.800> much

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
to really worry about that too much

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.420 
to really worry about that too much
because<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.880> can<00:03:14.060> do<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.330> after<00:03:15.040> any<00:03:16.040> time

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
because you can do that after any time

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.190 
because you can do that after any time
really<00:03:16.880> cuz<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.540> don't<00:03:17.690> have<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.900> take<00:03:18.080> it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
really cuz you don't have to take it

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.340 
really cuz you don't have to take it
apart<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:20.030> if<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.600> want<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.780> add<00:03:20.900> me<00:03:21.049> on<00:03:21.080> xbox

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
apart so if you want to add me on xbox

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.509
