00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.419
 even 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.250
 it's like any heart attack there's behind this week but not 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.599
 that of pity for at least water 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.510
 no but what could we say no 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.750
 it's something 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.750
 in the world anyway 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.140
 let me do their homework 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.290
 lyon and we created or to make accessible the car race to 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.440
 through three flagship disciplines that are formula 1 the rally and 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.680
 endurance and the idea was to find a way for these millions 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.250
 of dpe and spectators watching 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.890
 it is especially the formula 1 with eyes of spectators can one day 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.440
 to become an actor of this sport we wanted it to be a place first and foremost 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.260
 of sharing and that this is not only dedicated place actually to the race 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.810
 this is why we have 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 create a real living place that are in tune with a moment 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.520
 in euros as well for car enthusiasts but also people who 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.630
 will accompany them who are not necessarily in the eyes the concerned by the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.070
 car part for that we set up 5 a bar-restaurant with a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.760
 great chef this is only jean-christophe ansanay-alex 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.160
 that a shop is delicate products related to the world of the automobile 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.150
 prestige 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.060
 a gym and a very upscale spa that caters to both 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.860
 a hundred subscribers who can come from outside as a room 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.940
 fitness but also to people who go while 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.270
 for example sir in formula 1 lady little and to be pampered 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 around a damage damas ap 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.380
 I find your destination three-towers with the help of the car 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.489
 it's exactly like a real car 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.109
 speed is fully with pedals 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:18.119
 accelerator 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.119
 and you will see at the end of the race and it works 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.419
 probably not he has harshly ford 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.509
 wisp robert laffont 4 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.939

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.939
 only two groups 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.079
 why this competition you know 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.669
 they do not have the same match anymore 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.070
 Toulouse, we can understand how 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.070
 frankfurt 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.059

 6 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.640
 percent an hour 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.640
 while waiting for the greatest number 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.569
 yet even updated at 19 hours in his jacket another strong 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.909
 benchmark match here we're glad not to shut up percent I 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:30.969
 knew I was going there 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.349
 so I contacted the sponsor of the term 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.929
 but be careful not just any since he was his vincent manager 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:41.059
 this does not justify if samia g so i wanted to get around 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.299
 cruel amendments the first workshops we can say that our 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.939
 cameraman sylvain chavanel who went 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.299
 after more than 11 km even before having the same time I imagine that this same 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:51.869
 moment 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.669

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.159

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.149
 five best times and it takes less than 5 minutes it is 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:04.279

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.940
 and actually blame his first novel subject that we do not have 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.330

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.930
