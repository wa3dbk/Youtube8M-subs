00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.920
 hello let's draw with salt in concrete 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.600
 to this minion so I leave it on the web to 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.430
 that you can download or see if you want 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.469
 do the same and we're going to use salt 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.610
 colors that we already saw in another video and you 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.200
 I leave the link at the end too 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.700
 Well, the first thing we have to do 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.830
 do it on a card making 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.690
 our drawing you can do about 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.060
 cardboard of the color that you want I am 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.980
 using black better on a cardboard 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.580
 than on a folio because it weighs a lot 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.580
 the salt 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.570
 we are going to put glue and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.579
 moisten like this 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.250
 on the black as you see the graphite a 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.930
 normal pencil is well marked 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.790
 so you do not need any marker 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.340
 special chosen this mini although it has 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.230
 seemed pretty easy and now we're going to 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.960
 prepare white glue or glue if 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.500
 you want transparent 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.780
 and I will use a brush too 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.309
 that I have for crafts and we're going to 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.989
 start with the different colors and I'll 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.140
 to start with the white color that would be 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.269
 in this case the eyes of the minion 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.680
 placed glue only in that part 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.500
 that goes white 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.390
 you put a pretty thick cap and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 now let's take white salt 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
 Normal time without salt cross the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.050
 white we throw it over we move to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.120
 that covers the whole area well you can 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.870
 do with the brush or with your finger or 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.820
 moving the cardboard 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.860
 and as you can see it does not matter that we leave 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.630
 out because right now we're going to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.670
 to retire so as not to lose it I am going to throw 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.280
 of again in the little boat that I have 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.740
 you see and the salt stays stuck where 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.100
 we have put the glue now we pass 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.659
 to another color in this case the blue of my 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.759
 line 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.550
 I put glue in all areas that 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.440
 they go blue 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.250
 If you're doing another drawing, 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.770
 color you want we go for colors 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.890
 placed the glue and placed the room 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.230
 blue over in this case a 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.760
 little angels and strong fact 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.100
 remember that in the end you have the link 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.100
 how to dye the salt in case you do not know or 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.049
 you have not seen it 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.610
 distributed it well with finger tight 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.270
 a little bit so that it stays stuck in 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.270
 the glue 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.840
 and when I have the covered area 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.990
 without the goal I put the card I give 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.570
 taps to drop all the excess 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.300
 beige and stays blue but christmas 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.050
 that some pieces remain blue only 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.690
 the area that we have painted with glue 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.330
 for I'm going to do another part with another 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.250
 color that are the glasses with blue clarito 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.140
 because I do not have gray it would be gray in 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.150
 actually be careful not to salt 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.850
 one color above another color 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.220
 We will do it carefully but I will 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.110
 make the yellow color as you see 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.640
 always equal of minion does not have 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.710
 too many colors blue white and 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.670
 yellow basically and use the black 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.670
 the black of the cardboard 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.150
 Well, I'm filling in all the parts 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.920
 yellow with glue 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.110
 and as it is an area that is beginning to be 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.510
 between areas of other colors I will 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.760
 use a teaspoon to throw 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.350
 only the room and where I need it and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.140
 that does not mix with the rest of colors 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.610
 let's go to the abundant and now I will go 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.260
 cleaning with a pincelito out 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.480
 so that I do not fall on the blue or 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.310
 on the white 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.200
 if I did it like before putting in 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.640
 vertical cardboard as it would go through 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.879
 over the colors that I already have 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.879
 acts 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.129
 I could also have done it in parts 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.470
 for example the head and empty it towards 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.360
 up etc 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.550
 well once I have all the 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.280
 beige colors with the back end of the 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.230
 Brush 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.390
 I'm going to review the forms a little 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.470
 in this case the eyes so they remain 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.990
 well round 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.020
 and with a skewer or a stick I go to 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.000
 recover the black areas to do the 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.070
 I draw like my black cards because 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.410
 It helps me if your card is white 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.230
 and you want to delineate in black as you pass 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.400
 a felt- tip pen a marker I'm going too 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.350
 to do then anyway for 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.540
 mark a little more I'm going to them king 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.490
 drawing by removing the salt from the zones 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.680
 where I do not want this 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.960
 as you know wrong it also serves us 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.290
 a toothpick or the brush to be removed 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.290
 the salt 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.770
 carlos if they the rest of the drawing 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.000
 so you can see the black underneath 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.729
 eyes like brown if I do not have 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.919
 dark brown I have this light brown 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.900
 and I redraw the pupil with the 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.710
 skewer removing salt 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.710
 Y 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.500
 I have few details left 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.520
 ah 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.840
 they mark a little more the glasses and 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.990
 now so that the black areas can be seen 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.000
 like the gloves and the drops what I'm going 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.850
 to do is to paint the background usually 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.290
 of a color like pink and like glue 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.000
 on the part of ways to do so 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.820
 whole I will do as a kind of 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.980
 floor from the middle because you can 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.810
 do the entire fund if you want with a 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.850
 silver marker I have drawn the 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.380
 hairs and with a black one as I tell you I'm going 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.540
 to recover the areas where I've done 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.160
 hollow with the stick I'm going to outline 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.160
 in black again to be marked 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.680
 plus 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.500
 the parts that you see in contrast to the 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.930
 pink although the boots and the gloves and 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.120
 here is the minimum now let's do 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.860
 a pretty easy drawing for the 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.920
 children, for example , I finished 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.990
 it was especially easy it's about 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.700
 make a landscape as you see I am 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.080
 using now a gray cardboard that 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.180
 is the back of a notebook that 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.640
 it did not work for me anymore and I'm just going 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.440
 putting glue and I'm going to do it 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.960
 some vertical lines I can do 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.610
 mountaineers around placing salt 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.740
 different colors a landscape a little bit 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.729
 abstract that is very easy for 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.229
 children 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.990
 then we are doing from below 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.820
 up to the top to go 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.590
 eliminating salt 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.270
 for heaven I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.130
 blue 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.610
 and I will also make some little clouds 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.610
 white 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.729
 and you draw some clouds with the glue 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.949
 We put sugar white and good these 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.750
 are ideas of easy drawings that 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:21.099
 can children do also in another 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.099
 if you are starting and want to try 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.000
 You see, there would be a landscape then these 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.340
 little squares to call them like that the drawings 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.050
 you can frame them if you want you know 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.820
 I'm also drawing with the skewer 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.820
 some lines you see 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.280
 you can hang vertically have in 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.320
 account that when it dries it will lose a 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.570
 little bit more salt than you have to 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.700
 remove will be a little softer the 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.700
 good colors, I'll leave you another pair of 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.410
 ideas with colored salt some candles or 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.630
 some decorated boats and as I told you 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.150
 before I leave you the video of how to dye the 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.920
 come out very easily I'll tell you that 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.920
 is made with colored chalks ciao
