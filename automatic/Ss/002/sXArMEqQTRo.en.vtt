00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.229 
we're going to push the loop through the
back<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:53.730> now<00:02:54.730> I'm<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.000> slip

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
back like that and now I'm going to slip

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.910 
back like that and now I'm going to slip
this<00:02:55.420> off<00:02:57.150> there<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.050> you've<00:02:59.230> created<00:02:59.500> two

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
this off there so now you've created two

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.180 
this off there so now you've created two
stitches<00:03:00.930> I'm<00:03:01.930> gonna<00:03:02.110> do<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.440> same<00:03:02.470> thing<00:03:02.680> to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
stitches I'm gonna do the same thing to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.300 
stitches I'm gonna do the same thing to
the<00:03:03.280> other<00:03:03.310> ones<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:04.630> from<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.989> back<00:03:05.310> through

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
the other ones so from the back through

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.790 
the other ones so from the back through
the<00:03:06.459> front<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.140> then<00:03:08.140> around<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:12.130> then<00:03:13.800> pull

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
the front and then around and then pull

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.630 
the front and then around and then pull
the<00:03:15.010> loop<00:03:15.190> through<00:03:18.989> slip<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.110> off<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:21.550> you're

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
the loop through slip it off so you're

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.570 
the loop through slip it off so you're
going<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.790> be<00:03:21.940> doing<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.420> for<00:03:23.400> all<00:03:24.400> the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
going to be doing that for all the

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.920 
going to be doing that for all the
stitches<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.209> let's<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:27.280> say<00:03:27.400> you've<00:03:27.930> just
