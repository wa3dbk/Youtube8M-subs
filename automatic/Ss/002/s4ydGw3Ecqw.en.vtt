00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 really i'm easy to fish out of the ice is not 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.069
 take out and therefore remain in force two 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.580
 fishing precepts first permanent 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 Search 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.280
 and secondly a constant experiment and with 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.170
 nozzle and of course with tackles and not 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.830
 just new well and well forgotten 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.130
 old 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.510
 or rather, it is good that not forgotten how 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 expressed by Sergey Makarov 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.430
 he explores fishing almanacs 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.920
 thirty or forty years ago 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.320
 say with very interesting results 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.340
 very very interesting lure 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.450
 the only thing so to say minus this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.219
 spring she is somewhat complicated in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.710
 making but still I spent 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.020
 a few hours very much according to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 drawings night turned out that's such 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.600
 here's the thing there she's described as goose 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.700
 paw well really remind 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.649
 goose foot 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.559
 what is the originality of this song and and her 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.050
 games mean this bauble is made in two 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.670
 planar variants, that is, the upper 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.470
 part of it fulfilled means like an edge 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.380
 saber forms 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.750
 the lower part expands dramatically and also 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.979
 form a platform for horizontal 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.790
 movement without him I spring to you in general 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.920
 I tried to catch it, which is interesting 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.270
 work even at very small depth 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 that is, along the line you can even see that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.110
 very decent care from the hole to the side 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.759
 that is, on some kind of you said 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.590
 balloon attacked at a meter depth then 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.060
 eat it instantly takes 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.500
 horizontal position and 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 horizontal plane continue 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.290
 movement so interesting i'm the only one 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.850
 minus this one of them and very difficult 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.649
 do that is a few 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.770
 background, he probably nevertheless nevertheless 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.890
 less these things were done about 35 40 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.500
 years ago I see a tricky ring there 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.360
 some kind of non-standard way oh 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.590
 Rings is a trifle in general but on 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.159
 enough 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.439
 was not the important part in the spinner in more often 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.340
 all spinners used rings 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.429
 ellipsoidal shape that is what it gives 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.739
 what a plus unfortunately rings 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.599
 traditional round shape sometimes with 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.379
 especially with small diameter 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.420
 holes give jamming a threesome and 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.700
 it turns out it is not suspended 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.010
 let's say in such a odzak Lenin flood 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.580
 stuck that is like without practice 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.049
 does not work the same function and it means 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.450
 hanging triple usually after 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.829
 the return of lure in place some more 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.540
 oscillate thereby causing 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.560
 bite but extra 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.900
 This situation Zeus wheel ring 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.160
 virtually eliminates him being swallowed and 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.680
 jamming threesome 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.019
 and how to make it the usual end 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.150
 bend that no you know it this 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:53.430
 In general, well, it is ridiculous to just 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.769
 Here is your time, but in general, I guess 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.769
 can now be found on sale 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.200
 here is this piece of small room fragment 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.310
 so to speak applied armbands 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.650
 there is this spring . 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.980
 the doctor to close from two sides was put on 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.170
 on the sleeves, I think about the goods 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.799
 still preserved some of these here 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.959
 of these deposits, yes, she herself has a form 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.870
 backlash for a year is the only way 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.900
 say work on the cortex wiki and on 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.590
 bite well how much do you need these little rings 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.340
 that is, you can 23 and . in the end it turns out 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.630
 so here are these elite rings 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.419
 completely factory and perfectly 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.400
 factory they basically metal goes here 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.010
 not bad they are moderately thin too 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.010
 pretty has her own 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.010
 litter
