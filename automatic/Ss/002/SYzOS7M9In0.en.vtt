00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
get guts like I'll be in the clear to

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.520 
get guts like I'll be in the clear to
just<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.400> everything<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.780> he<00:02:25.260> goes<00:02:25.410> for

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
just see see everything but he goes for

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.140 
just see see everything but he goes for
hydro<00:02:25.830> pump<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.190> does<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.460> half<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.970> my

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
health was just kind of insane so he's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.450 
health was just kind of insane so he's
probably<00:02:31.080> some<00:02:31.350> offensive<00:02:31.650> area<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.340> go

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
probably some offensive area and I go

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.980

for<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> knock<00:02:32.820> off<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.210> i<00:02:33.240> do<00:02:33.300> not<00:02:33.570> go<00:02:33.750> up<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.960> a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
for a knock off and i do not go up as a

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.190 
for a knock off and i do not go up as a
cell<00:02:34.230> best<00:02:34.760> kind<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.850> confirming<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.390> but

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
cell best kind of confirming that but

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.620 
cell best kind of confirming that but
i'm<00:02:37.350> gonna<00:02:37.470> live<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.710> second<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.270> i'm<00:02:39.270> gonna

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
i'm gonna live the second one i'm gonna

i'm gonna live the second one i'm gonna
switch<00:02:39.810> into<00:02:40.200> my<00:02:40.320> cryogonal<00:02:40.709> here<00:02:41.660> because<00:02:42.660> I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
switch into my cryogonal here because I

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.050 
switch into my cryogonal here because I
can<00:02:42.990> eat<00:02:43.260> everything<00:02:43.560> up<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:44.430> cryogonal<00:02:44.820> has

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
can eat everything up just cryogonal has

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.840 
can eat everything up just cryogonal has
like<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.240> bajillion<00:02:45.570> special<00:02:46.260> offense<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.850> I'm

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
amount i have 250 to its special attack

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.820

but crowd I'm timid I'm not even modest
so<00:03:17.720> he's<00:03:18.720> probably<00:03:18.959> physically<00:03:19.560> defensive

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
so he's probably physically defensive

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.870 
so he's probably physically defensive
and<00:03:22.040> combine<00:03:23.040> bearings<00:03:23.370> run<00:03:23.550> physically

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
and combine bearings run physically

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.670 
and combine bearings run physically
defensive<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.480> I'm<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:25.380> gonna<00:03:25.470> get<00:03:25.620> the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
right here and this is where lefties may

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.140 
right here and this is where lefties may
have<00:04:46.990> come<00:04:47.470> in<00:04:47.590> handy<00:04:47.770> if<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.370> would<00:04:48.639> have<00:04:48.910> any

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
have come in handy if it would have any

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.960 
have come in handy if it would have any
point<00:04:49.389> of<00:04:49.510> battle<00:04:50.190> if<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.340> had<00:04:51.430> lefties<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.789> might

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
point of battle if I had lefties I might

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.420 
point of battle if I had lefties I might
have<00:04:52.090> been<00:04:52.120> able<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.389> live<00:04:52.860> another<00:04:53.860> platelets

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
have been able to live another platelets

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.700 
have been able to live another platelets
but<00:04:54.960> it's<00:04:55.960> whatever<00:04:56.229> it<00:04:56.380> doesn't<00:04:56.680> really

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
but it's whatever it doesn't really

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.520 
but it's whatever it doesn't really
matter<00:04:56.979> too<00:04:57.639> much<00:04:57.669> because<00:04:58.180> he's<00:04:59.080> pretty<00:04:59.380> low

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
matter too much because he's pretty low

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.409 
matter too much because he's pretty low
on<00:04:59.560> health<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.070> I<00:05:00.580> can<00:05:00.729> just<00:05:00.849> go<00:05:00.970> right<00:05:01.000> into

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
on health and I can just go right into

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.320 
on health and I can just go right into
my<00:05:01.599> flygon<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.849> looking<00:05:03.849> at<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.000> damage<00:05:04.150> that

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
my flygon and looking at the damage that

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.670 
my flygon and looking at the damage that
he<00:05:04.479> did<00:05:04.599> to<00:05:04.690> my<00:05:04.780> best<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.139> know<00:05:05.169> I<00:05:05.260> can<00:05:05.530> just

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
he did to my best you know I can just

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.990 
he did to my best you know I can just
assume<00:05:05.919> that<00:05:06.130> he's<00:05:06.220> banded<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:06.639> he's<00:05:06.760> locked

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
assume that he's banded and he's locked

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.110 
assume that he's banded and he's locked
in<00:05:07.150> so<00:05:07.930> he<00:05:08.320> has<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.560> die<00:05:08.710> staining<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.760> died

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
in so he has to die staining and died

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.120 
in so he has to die staining and died
because<00:05:10.419> Bronx<00:05:11.260> are<00:05:11.410> up<00:05:11.590> so<00:05:11.830> I'm<00:05:11.919> just<00:05:12.039> gonna
