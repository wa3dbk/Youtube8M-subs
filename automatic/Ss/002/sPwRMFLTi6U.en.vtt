00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.150
 that of simon forever so today 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.280
 I find you in a video mode that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.040
 will be to make the presentation of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.650
 megherbi so finally yes I did not 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.599
 never said I would have you subject 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.949
 a long time ago but I have not had the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.529
 time to finish it I already had them 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 presented on video but I never came 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.000
 to put the video online 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.609
 this is good so I wanted to introduce 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.769
 so I have six gerbi so blockages 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.859
 with two gervis and a cage with 4 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.469
 jarry so here you go see by 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.840
 you even there we have the cage of males 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.640
 which there is that wrong so that actually 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.600
 I'm not getting much, I'm not coming 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.670
 good at catching them 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.789
 because in fact you see he gets started 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.820
 just here and colm approach up will go they 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.710
 get into their pipes so that's 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 not easy to catch and I put 45 years 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.250
 to catch him then the technique I 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.920
 leave the cage open like that they 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.350
 can go out when they go to the cage 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.170

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.700
