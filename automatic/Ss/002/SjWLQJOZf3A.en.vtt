help but feel there's just not much here

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.759 
help but feel there's just not much here
there's<00:02:43.359> only<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.659> few<00:02:43.900> different<00:02:44.290> weapons<00:02:44.620> to

there's only a few different weapons to

there's only a few different weapons to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.179 
collect which makes the game feel
limited<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.170> enemy<00:02:47.469> placement<00:02:48.010> can

limited and the enemy placement can
sometimes<00:02:48.639> be<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:49.180> bit<00:02:49.450> erratic<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.409> messy<00:02:50.829> so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
sometimes be a bit erratic and messy so

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.390 
sometimes be a bit erratic and messy so
it's<00:02:52.180> far<00:02:52.659> from<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.109> great<00:02:53.349> game<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:53.709> as<00:02:54.159> an

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
it's far from a great game but as an

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.729 
it's far from a great game but as an
early<00:02:54.760> Genesis<00:02:55.269> release<00:02:55.599> I<00:02:55.870> guess<00:02:56.409> some<00:02:56.620> of

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
early Genesis release I guess some of

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.409 
early Genesis release I guess some of
its<00:02:56.859> problems<00:02:57.159> are<00:02:57.489> kind<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.790> understandable

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
its problems are kind of understandable

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.300 
its problems are kind of understandable
so<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.049> you're<00:02:59.169> really<00:02:59.379> into<00:02:59.709> space<00:03:00.040> harrier

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
so if you're really into space harrier

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.479 
so if you're really into space harrier
