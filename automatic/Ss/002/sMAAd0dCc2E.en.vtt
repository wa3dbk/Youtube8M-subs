 Alan Wine - Performance You've Lost That Loving Feeling 

00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:13.137
 You never close your eyes anymore. 

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:18.669
 when I kiss your lips 

00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:27.522
 And there is no tenderness like before at the tips of your fingers 

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:35.134
 You're trying hard not to show 

00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:37.642
 Honey... 

00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:41.258
 Honey, I know ... 

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:46.310
 You lost that affectionate feeling 

00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:50.854
 That affectionate feeling 

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:54.668
 You lost that affectionate feeling 

00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:58.860
 Now he's gone ... gone ... gone ... 

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:08.055
 Now there is no welcome expression in your eyes 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.177
 when I look for you. 

00:01:14.193 --> 00:01:16.624
 And girl, you're starting. 

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:21.302
 to criticize the things that I do. 

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:27.755
 It only makes me feel like crying. 

00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:31.211
 For, my dear, 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.842
 Something in you is dying. 

00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:40.184
 You lost that affectionate feeling 

00:01:40.654 --> 00:01:44.511
 That affectionate feeling 

00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:48.501
 You lost that affectionate feeling 

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:52.702
 Now he's gone ... gone ... gone ... 

00:01:54.892 --> 00:01:55.461
 "Come on" 

00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:56.605
 "Come on" 

00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:01.097
 Dear, dear ... 

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:05.026
 I get down on my knees for you. 

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:10.285
 Honey.. 

00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:12.684
 Honey... 

00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:19.642
 I need your love 

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:21.798
 I need your love 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.938
 Bring back that lovely feeling 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.554
 Oh, that lovely feeling. 

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:42.525
 Bring back, back that lovely feeling 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:46.707
 He's gone ... gone ... gone. 

00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:51.491
 And I can not go on.
