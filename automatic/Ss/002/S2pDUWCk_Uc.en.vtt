and<00:02:11.730> we'll<00:02:12.730> close<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.000> one<00:02:13.360> what<00:02:14.020> I'm<00:02:14.140> going

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
and we'll close that one what I'm going

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.750 
and we'll close that one what I'm going
to<00:02:14.380> do<00:02:14.590> now<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:15.010> open<00:02:15.489> up<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.180> Naza<00:02:16.720> assistant

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
to do now is open up the Naza assistant

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.059 
to do now is open up the Naza assistant
2.2<00:02:18.760> which<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.420> version<00:02:19.840> 2<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.920> as<00:02:21.040> a

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
2.2 which is for the version 2 and as a

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:31.080 
2.2 which is for the version 2 and as a
unit<00:02:21.489> we'll<00:02:21.910> start<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:29.550> ok<00:02:30.550> what<00:02:30.849> I'll<00:02:30.940> do

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
unit we'll start that ok what I'll do

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.300 
unit we'll start that ok what I'll do
now<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:31.870> connect<00:02:32.230> power<00:02:32.650> again<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.190> my

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
now is just connect power again to my

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
now is just connect power again to my
quad<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.260> you'll<00:02:41.890> see<00:02:42.160> it's<00:02:43.090> actually

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
quad and you'll see it's actually

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.390 
quad and you'll see it's actually
recognized<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.470> telling<00:02:44.830> me<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.040> do<00:02:45.190> an

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
recognized that it's telling me to do an

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.990 
recognized that it's telling me to do an
advanced<00:02:46.290> calibration<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.860> IMU<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:48.910> I'll

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
advanced calibration of the IMU so I'll

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.059 
advanced calibration of the IMU so I'll
do<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.209> shortly<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:49.930> let's<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.860> click

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
do that shortly but let's just click

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.670 
do that shortly but let's just click
away<00:02:51.220> from<00:02:51.549> there<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.260> what<00:02:53.260> I'll<00:02:53.380> do<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.530> I'll

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
away from there and what I'll do is I'll

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.900 
away from there and what I'll do is I'll
show<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.940> actually<00:02:56.730> showing<00:02:57.730> you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
show you that it is actually showing you

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.750 
show you that it is actually showing you
that<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.180> firmware<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.290> 4.0<00:03:00.069> -<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.610> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that the firmware is now 4.0 - so the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.270 
that the firmware is now 4.0 - so the
upgrade<00:03:00.880> was<00:03:01.360> successful<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
upgrade was successful and this is the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.009 
upgrade was successful and this is the
fourth<00:03:03.580> unit<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.209> I've<00:03:04.330> done<00:03:04.510> this<00:03:04.690> with<00:03:04.870> and

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
fourth unit that I've done this with and

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.300 
fourth unit that I've done this with and
I've<00:03:05.110> test<00:03:05.470> flow<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.830> first<00:03:06.069> three<00:03:06.280> and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
I've test flow in the first three and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.250 
I've test flow in the first three and
they<00:03:06.610> just<00:03:06.790> fly<00:03:07.030> beautifully<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.810> doesn't

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
they just fly beautifully it doesn't

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.770 
they just fly beautifully it doesn't
have<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.549> drift<00:03:09.549> problem<00:03:10.060> anymore<00:03:10.269> then<00:03:10.660> as

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
have that drift problem anymore then as

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.330 
have that drift problem anymore then as
a<00:03:10.810> light<00:03:11.049> has<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> drift<00:03:11.650> when<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.920> first<00:03:12.099> take

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
a light has a drift when you first take

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.120 
a light has a drift when you first take
off<00:03:12.549> but<00:03:12.790> with<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.840> updated<00:03:14.620> firmware

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
off but with this updated firmware

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.460 
off but with this updated firmware
there's<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:15.640> no<00:03:15.880> drift<00:03:16.180> problem<00:03:16.329> at<00:03:16.660> all<00:03:16.750> so

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
there's just no drift problem at all so

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.530 
there's just no drift problem at all so
what<00:03:17.620> we'll<00:03:17.709> do<00:03:17.829> now<00:03:17.859> I<00:03:18.280> won't<00:03:18.820> keep<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.329> video

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
what we'll do now I won't keep a video

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.360 
what we'll do now I won't keep a video
running<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:20.470> if<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.769> go<00:03:20.890> back<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.250> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
running of it but if you go back to the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.580 
running of it but if you go back to the
tools<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:22.030> do<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.329> advanced<00:03:22.810> calibration<00:03:23.470> it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
tools you do the advanced calibration it

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.500 
tools you do the advanced calibration it
takes<00:03:23.799> about<00:03:23.950> five<00:03:24.340> minutes<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:24.910> I'll<00:03:25.209> stop

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
takes about five minutes so I'll stop

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.630 
takes about five minutes so I'll stop
the<00:03:25.630> video<00:03:25.870> there<00:03:26.290> but<00:03:26.400> everything<00:03:27.400> else

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
the video there but everything else

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.280 
the video there but everything else
seems<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:27.970> work<00:03:28.239> what<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.690> noticed<00:03:29.140> is<00:03:29.350> all<00:03:30.100> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
seems to work what I noticed is all the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.420 
seems to work what I noticed is all the
parameters<00:03:32.290> all<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.560> gains<00:03:32.829> are<00:03:33.069> still<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
parameters all the gains are still the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.490 
parameters all the gains are still the
same<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.970> GPS<00:03:34.390> mounting<00:03:34.750> position<00:03:35.140> none<00:03:35.380> of

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
same the GPS mounting position none of

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.009 
same the GPS mounting position none of
that<00:03:35.530> has<00:03:35.799> changed<00:03:36.030> what<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.090> did<00:03:37.630> just<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.930> be

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
that has changed what I did just to be

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.500 
that has changed what I did just to be
on<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.230> safe<00:03:38.440> side<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.220> did<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.790> nother

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
on the safe side is I did a nother

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.449 
on the safe side is I did a nother
calibration<00:03:41.290> I'll<00:03:41.440> do<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:41.829> this<00:03:41.980> quad<00:03:42.220> -

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
calibration I'll do that on this quad -

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.449 
calibration I'll do that on this quad -
of<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:43.359> RC<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.380> make<00:03:44.560> sure<00:03:44.799> everything<00:03:45.370> is

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
of the RC just make sure everything is

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.930 
of the RC just make sure everything is
still<00:03:46.319> at<00:03:47.319> the<00:03:47.470> correct<00:03:47.769> setting<00:03:48.130> so<00:03:48.489> yeah

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
still at the correct setting so yeah

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.340 
still at the correct setting so yeah
just<00:03:49.150> making<00:03:49.329> sure<00:03:49.600> all<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.049> different

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
just making sure all the different

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.500 
just making sure all the different
windows<00:03:50.650> are<00:03:50.859> as<00:03:50.980> they<00:03:51.130> should<00:03:51.190> be<00:03:51.609> failsafe

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
windows are as they should be failsafe

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.150 
windows are as they should be failsafe
please<00:03:53.260> go<00:03:53.739> home<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.130> landing<00:03:55.920> voltage<00:03:56.920> I'll

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
please go home and landing voltage I'll

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.610 
please go home and landing voltage I'll
just<00:03:57.310> set<00:03:57.489> my<00:03:57.870> voltage<00:03:58.870> warnings<00:03:59.260> they<00:03:59.410> don't

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
just set my voltage warnings they don't

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.960 
just set my voltage warnings they don't
appear<00:03:59.859> to<00:03:59.920> have<00:04:00.010> changed<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:00.609> that's<00:04:00.790> all

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
appear to have changed so that's all

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.699 
appear to have changed so that's all
good<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.900> other<00:04:02.019> window<00:04:02.319> you'll<00:04:02.500> get

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
good and the other window you'll get

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.800 
good and the other window you'll get
here<00:04:02.950> which<00:04:03.340> is<00:04:03.519> not<00:04:03.730> on<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.090> Naza<00:04:04.269> light<00:04:04.569> is

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
here which is not on the Naza light is

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.690 
here which is not on the Naza light is
this<00:04:05.049> limits<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:05.769> it's<00:04:05.980> like<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.160> maximum

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
this limits so it's like a maximum

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.280 
this limits so it's like a maximum
height<00:04:06.880> maximum<00:04:07.150> radius<00:04:07.780> limit

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
height maximum radius limit

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.170 
height maximum radius limit
I<00:04:08.319> haven't<00:04:09.069> experimented<00:04:09.370> with<00:04:09.700> those<00:04:09.910> but<00:04:10.150> I

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
I haven't experimented with those but I

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.670 
I haven't experimented with those but I
will<00:04:10.389> over<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.690> next<00:04:10.720> few<00:04:11.019> days<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.260> see<00:04:11.530> how
