00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.300 
we go to the cable box set up we go to
the<00:02:33.430> cable<00:02:33.819> box<00:02:34.110> setup<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.319> then<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:36.040> one

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
the cable box setup and then this one

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.199 
the cable box setup and then this one
right<00:02:36.340> here<00:02:36.700> our<00:02:37.200> f5s<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:39.370> switch<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:39.849> iron

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
right here our f5s we switch it to iron

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.900 
right here our f5s we switch it to iron
so<00:02:40.870> basically<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.620> cable<00:02:42.040> box<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.610> going<00:02:42.790> to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
so basically the cable box is going to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.540 
so basically the cable box is going to
do<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.239> bypass<00:02:43.450> for<00:02:44.170> us<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:44.620> send<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.340> signal

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
do the bypass for us and send a signal

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.090 
do the bypass for us and send a signal
through<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.480> cable<00:02:46.930> wire<00:02:47.110> hit<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.709> TV<00:02:48.069> and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
through the cable wire hit to the TV and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.500 
through the cable wire hit to the TV and
that's<00:02:48.459> what<00:02:48.640> gives<00:02:48.790> us<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.090> ability<00:02:49.330> to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that's what gives us the ability to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.490 
that's what gives us the ability to
switch<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.319> out<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.620> watching<00:02:51.220> TV<00:02:51.610> before

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
switch in and out of watching TV before

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.340 
switch in and out of watching TV before
playing<00:02:53.500> up<00:02:53.800> playing<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> ps4<00:02:55.690> or<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.170> could

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
playing up playing on a ps4 or you could

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.370 
playing up playing on a ps4 or you could
do<00:02:56.530> anything<00:02:57.040> else<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.489> can<00:02:57.670> do<00:02:57.850> ps4<00:02:58.540> your

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
do anything else you can do ps4 your

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
to show that not just Xbox one would

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.820 
to show that not just Xbox one would
give<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> ability<00:03:10.269> TVs<00:03:11.080> also<00:03:11.500> give<00:03:11.709> you
