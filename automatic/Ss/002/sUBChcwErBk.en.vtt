00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
weaknesses but with the resist we have

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.580 
weaknesses but with the resist we have
one<00:00:30.119> quarter<00:00:30.390> resistance<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> ice<00:00:31.199> which<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
one quarter resistance to ice which is

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.650 
one quarter resistance to ice which is
really<00:00:31.920> cool<00:00:32.160> because<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> thick<00:00:33.450> fat

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
ability that wall ring gets you are

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090 
ability that wall ring gets you are

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
me from ice types to you so that's just

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.970 
me from ice types to you so that's just
a<00:00:40.050> little<00:00:40.079> interesting<00:00:40.649> thing<00:00:40.770> also

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
a little interesting thing also

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310 
a little interesting thing also
mitigates<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> fire<00:00:42.210> neutrality<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.930> turns

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
mitigates the fire neutrality and turns

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
mitigates the fire neutrality and turns
it<00:00:43.469> back<00:00:43.590> into<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.890> resistance<00:00:44.550> now<00:00:45.030> hopping

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it back into a resistance now hopping

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.630 
it back into a resistance now hopping

defense 200 on hit points it's pretty

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.689 
defense 200 on hit points it's pretty

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
your hip points you're not gonna be

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.740 
your hip points you're not gonna be
taking<00:01:05.880> any<00:01:06.150> damage

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
taking any damage

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
taking any damage
Chester<00:01:07.530> resto<00:01:07.830> has<00:01:07.950> any<00:01:08.189> main<00:01:08.490> idea<00:01:08.790> with

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
Chester resto has any main idea with

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.070 
Chester resto has any main idea with
velodrome<00:01:09.420> stockpile

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
velodrome stockpile

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
velodrome stockpile
so<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.439> essentially<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.860> having<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> water

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so it's essentially like having a water

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
so it's essentially like having a water
ice<00:01:11.670> type<00:01:11.939> Snorlax<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.320> where<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
ice type Snorlax now this is where it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.410 
ice type Snorlax now this is where it
gets<00:01:13.590> interesting<00:01:13.860> avalanche<00:01:14.760> don't<00:01:15.330> let

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
gets interesting avalanche don't let

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.550 
gets interesting avalanche don't let
Rome<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.689> avalanche<00:01:16.080> you're<00:01:16.229> gonna<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
Rome into avalanche you're gonna have a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.380 
Rome into avalanche you're gonna have a
great<00:01:16.890> amount<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> damage<00:01:17.310> taking<00:01:18.119> almost

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
great amount of damage taking almost

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
great amount of damage taking almost
nothing<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.020> dishing<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.530> very<00:01:19.830> hard<00:01:20.070> hit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
nothing and then dishing a very hard hit

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.710 
nothing and then dishing a very hard hit
back<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.090> pretty<00:01:21.270> much<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> be

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
back and that's pretty much going to be

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
back and that's pretty much going to be
one<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> your<00:01:22.439> better<00:01:22.590> options<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.490> do

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
one of your better options if you do

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.770 
one of your better options if you do
have<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> couple<00:01:24.000> other<00:01:24.119> things<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.420> aqua

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

tail you can get water absorbs so it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
tail you can get water absorbs so it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
isn't really the most efficient and then

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.929 
isn't really the most efficient and then
we<00:01:28.619> also<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.920> body<00:01:29.130> slam<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> lot<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.790> other
