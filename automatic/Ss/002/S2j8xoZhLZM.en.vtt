00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.340
 which was not that long ago 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.710
 science fiction has been done away with 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.509
 moving into our life service robot 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 People become everyday 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.560
 relieve hire and support for 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.029
 Take on logistics tasks, for example 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
 the all-round care in nursing 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.269
 ensure and people with one 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.609
 handicap again on the mobility 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.730
 automatica 2014 in munich is 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.730
 professional service robotics a new one 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 exhibition focus 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.590
 the platform for automated 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.110
 But production processes do not just show 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.210
 innovations in robotics assembly and 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.800
 handling technology and industrial 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.480
 image processing but also the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 latest assistance systems the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.320
 people in the future go to hand 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.949
 in industrial processes as well as in industrial processes 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.949
 daily use 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.120
 this is how the technical university shows 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.930
 munich's humanoid robot robbi 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.930
 I can be happy 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.950
 i could already be in the humanoid 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.780
 owns 48 engines 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.390
 The movements are controlled by cable 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.020
 The skeleton was completely made in 3d printer 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.090
 create 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.020
 Of course you can do that with his 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.020
 interact with each other 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.930
 I'm so shy 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.490
 I say always is then finished 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.830
 If I give them a week in 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.259
 can put a kita and then them 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.790
 get back that's for sure 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.930
 a further step but that is one 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.930
 Of course we also use them 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.220
 think the robo just for kids as a lot 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.890
 advanced that toy or 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.020
 learning instrument is used on 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.119
 Chair of Applied Mechanics of Tu 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.500
 munich is creating a manipulator for the 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.899
 use in agriculture 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.119
 Incidentally, the goal of the development is with you 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.950
 funded by the EU 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.380
 the selective harvesting of fruits 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.970
 mounted on a mobile platform 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.650
 this robot will be in the fields 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.480
 tasks are taken over by people 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.870
 not run efficiently enough 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.150
 can 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.200
 the robot will replace the human 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.150
 but of course you do not always have to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.730
 background see it here 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.040
 technical system is natural 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.690
 also has to provide certain security 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.160
 And I think it will definitely be 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.239
 come and will hear another 20 years 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.850
 reality, on the other hand, is already that 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.920
 reebok the berliner andrÃ© is ten years old 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.380
 years paraplegic the wearable 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.450
 motorized exoskeleton from eur medical 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.549
 gives paraplegic people like 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.549
 Give back your upright mobility 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.760
 and I am shy then but already 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.380
 Such feelings because it was already total 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.360
 europe run run one 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.700
 forward tilt of the upper body triggers 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.550
 The first step will be to help out 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.590
 as stabilization in the course of movement 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.530
 even stair climbing is possible the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.280
 Reebok personnel will be around 63,000 euros 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.319
 costs 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.000
 a broad public will 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.370
 system first on the coming 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.370
