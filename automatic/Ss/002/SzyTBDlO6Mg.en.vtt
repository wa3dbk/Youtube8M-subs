 steps our teaching 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.379
 I will remind you briefly to be in time 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.739
 first we did the most common movement we 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.449
 learned to do the swing up and down we 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.269
 learned to make some movements 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.839
 by hands 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.580
 learned how to do the basic steps that the 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.920
 the first lesson of the second stage is dedicated to 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.920
 that we are more actively developing 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.229
 the casing is actually next I him 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.409
 used but now we will do right 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.409
 specifically what we are first 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.750
 arc and takach which is concentrated here 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.110
 here 107 i still work mundi 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.040
 but now the emphasis is here 1 2 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.670
 They are 4 than you notice when I do it 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.180
 and here I am the body goes flour and thigh 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.420
 goes ahead then there it is like this 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.120
 not good you have a whole body they work 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.860
 here to work the whole body of you here 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:43.509
 remember you fold your spouse one two three 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:43.509

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.470

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.520
 same 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.640
 that is, here it means my diaphragm 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.420
 comes forward and the thigh goes back at all 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.420

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.420
 do a little exercise so that you 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.200
 Understood and I understood exactly what you mean. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.980
 understood we connect the arc inwards and the arc 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:28.820
 outward twice so 1 2 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:31.030
