00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040
 The problem is so common that I give to the leaves while earlier reports earlier work in the mouth 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.700
 Most of the engineers who left were not armed this year and left twice. 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.650
 Question We have seen the example of a bar and gave the word Park So-hyun 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.220
 I met a reporter. 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:22.320
 I 've got a few of them coming out for a while. 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.970
 How many people have you met? Our reporters have spent a few days in this March issue 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 The agency had broken the previous day, I met with five people or yourself, or call 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.840
 I've heard stories on the currency, but in the past half year, 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:41.640
 After confirming that five of them had quit , 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:47.010
 I asked, and during this period, the crew were all talking to Eagle 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.270
 Yes, of course I quit for health reasons. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 There was a declaration. 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:59.129
 Especially, one of these declarations is that I do not want to get tired of riding the boat. 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.899
 I told him I had to change it to another industry. 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.720
 Let's look at it. 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 Seowall is different from other passenger ships, but it is felt that the ship is also raised in the 2nd Guam room. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.060
 It was about 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.159
 It's easy to say. Looks like the ship is in front of you. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:22.860
 It looks like this alphabet v. Yes. I do not like that period. 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:26.909
 Institutions that have branches Defense at this point is located at the bottom 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:32.009
 If you were to feel like you were hungry, 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 The passengers who were on the ship on the 4th and 5th floors were getting more money , 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.920
 Wrote many feel is the story of a captain's example, one of the crew declared that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.930
 I'll see you. 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.710
 Hey hwipak to establish even more true carols written by Karune thumbnail sloppy musicians say 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.439
 It's possible. 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:53.170
 Art show cdi only what is going to happen where you will not kill again 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.690
 Are you not a great fun 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.789
 Yes , I've heard it now. 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:05.619
 So this is not dwaeseo baeman have to check that the engineer to be right about it 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.920
 Did you get off at once? Did you see the other bed? No. 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.069
 That's right 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.959
 Now I bwatneundeyo much to ask to talk to the engineer 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.700
 The other declaration is that the crew members of the agency on the vessel are 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.080
 He says he did not. 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.180
 That is, if the reason is now Comment 7 March 1000, as a ferry 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.540
 17,000 gold medals. 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.880
 So it 's supposed to be very complicated with the internal hardware. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:34.030
 This is because it takes a long time to get accustomed to the machine. 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.470
 Well, if you get on the boat now, I will not quit easily. 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.220
 For something different gapan neomdeul department responsible for the protests is now often seen changes 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.940
 But if this time sub crew not quit easily embark on one ship 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.320
 If you did that I'd sold or is the turnover rate was high so that for example, 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:54.519
 But the engineer who fits're doing mworaedo Vera These same experts machines 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:59.140
 If you feel like you're leaning like this 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.130
 Uh not I do not want to know the reason for the circular That you know 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.130
 Was there 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.940
 These people also wondered that the Daddy held his mouth. 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:13.120
 I guess that's because now my stomach has lost a lot of balance 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.380
 Now, the crew of this period gathered their mouths and talked. 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.329
 Yes, the center of gravity has now moved from below to this proposal, 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.920
 Depositors and to move down 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:28.510
 Now the already ballast tanks now that Pyongyang did good standing taenggu 1 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:32.080
 It was the story of the crew that they often lost their balance, overlapping the cause 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.700
 I listen to stories on such declarations and write watches 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:40.150
 I was lost when I was annoyed. 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:46.200
 Write Korea car come to be split according to tha 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.200
 Give it back to me and give it to me. 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:58.250
 Yes, I heard. The marchers are strangers. 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:03.140
 It's not just two minutes, but it 's coming out everywhere . 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:06.440
 We sent it to you yesterday, but there was an electrical safety check , 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:12.530
 It was not so much checked. 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:14.090
 Just does not yet lead it went beyond that passes through the primary one this car 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.230
 One week left 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:22.850
 As I've just been passed without any problems ah Example 2 Safety 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:26.350
 I guess so beogeopda the system is working properly get out of the interpretation that should 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.350
