some kind of safe Jack's down I was
using<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:48.359> you<00:00:49.359> know<00:00:49.449> factory<00:00:49.899> Jack<00:00:50.170> with

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
using the you know factory Jack with

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.110 
using the you know factory Jack with
game<00:00:51.010> at<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.219> vehicle<00:00:51.519> here<00:00:51.640> but<00:00:51.760> I<00:00:51.789> threw<00:00:51.969> the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
game at the vehicle here but I threw the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.549 
game at the vehicle here but I threw the
tire<00:00:52.300> underneath<00:00:52.660> there<00:00:52.929> in<00:00:53.019> case<00:00:53.199> something

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
tire underneath there in case something

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.900 
tire underneath there in case something
comes<00:00:53.589> off<00:00:53.980> at<00:00:54.190> least<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:54.460> won't<00:00:54.519> fall<00:00:54.760> all<00:00:54.879> the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
comes off at least it won't fall all the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.299 
comes off at least it won't fall all the
way<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.089> the<00:00:55.239> ground<00:00:55.589> you<00:00:56.589> can<00:00:56.649> also<00:00:56.829> use<00:00:57.070> jack

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
way to the ground you can also use jack

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.950 
way to the ground you can also use jack
stands<00:00:57.579> it's<00:00:57.760> probably<00:00:57.999> a<00:00:58.030> good<00:00:58.120> idea<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.960> once

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
stands it's probably a good idea so once

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.599 
stands it's probably a good idea so once
you've<00:01:02.109> got<00:01:02.289> your<00:01:02.320> new<00:01:02.649> control<00:01:03.069> arms<00:01:03.370> here

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
you've got your new control arms here

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.410 
you've got your new control arms here
the<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.890> job<00:01:06.130> seems<00:01:06.400> simple<00:01:06.820> there's<00:01:07.120> only<00:01:07.330> a

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
the the job seems simple there's only a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.330 
the the job seems simple there's only a
couple<00:01:07.480> of<00:01:07.930> bolts<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.320> remove<00:01:08.350> I<00:01:08.830> think<00:01:09.010> six

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
couple of bolts to remove I think six

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.550 
couple of bolts to remove I think six
bolts<00:01:09.610> total<00:01:10.060> we'll<00:01:10.210> get<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.540> done<00:01:10.750> if<00:01:10.990> you

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
bolts total we'll get it done if you

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.830 
bolts total we'll get it done if you
could<00:01:11.740> just<00:01:12.370> easily<00:01:12.700> get<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.180> them<00:01:13.300> but<00:01:13.540> that's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
could just easily get to them but that's

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.270 
could just easily get to them but that's
not<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.680> case<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.360> front<00:01:16.510> two<00:01:16.720> bolts<00:01:17.110> are<00:01:17.290> the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
not the case the front two bolts are the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.450 
not the case the front two bolts are the
real<00:01:18.640> problem<00:01:19.060> so<00:01:19.900> I'll<00:01:20.740> try<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.040> show<00:01:21.430> you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460

too<00:01:42.940> difficult<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.450> access<00:01:43.540> although<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:44.140> did

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
too difficult to access although I did

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.740 
too difficult to access although I did
have<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.620> hard<00:01:44.830> time<00:01:44.980> getting<00:01:45.130> mine<00:01:45.370> out<00:01:45.750> but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.520 
so this rear bolt of the front tube that
amount<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.760> control<00:02:16.090> arm<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.480> can<00:02:17.380> be<00:02:17.500> a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
amount the control arm is can be a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.990 
amount the control arm is can be a
little<00:02:17.620> bit<00:02:17.739> hard<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.370> had<00:02:18.610> our<00:02:18.760> time

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
little bit hard to get to I had our time

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.850 
little bit hard to get to I had our time
because<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.450> sway<00:02:20.019> bar<00:02:20.230> link<00:02:20.440> was<00:02:20.620> in<00:02:20.769> the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
because this sway bar link was in the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.559 
because this sway bar link was in the
way<00:02:21.010> um<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:28.030> sway<00:02:28.180> bar<00:02:28.360> link

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
way um this here is the sway bar link

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.840 
way um this here is the sway bar link
and<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:29.350> metal<00:02:29.769> piece<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.069> goes<00:02:30.459> across

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and this metal piece that goes across

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.789 
and this metal piece that goes across
over<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.870> other<00:02:31.959> side<00:02:34.230> I've<00:02:35.230> just<00:02:35.470> changed

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
over to the other side I've just changed

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.440 
over to the other side I've just changed
mine<00:02:35.950> recently<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.760> wasn't<00:02:37.090> too<00:02:37.180> hard<00:02:37.269> for

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
mine recently so it wasn't too hard for

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.270 
mine recently so it wasn't too hard for
me<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.660> get<00:02:37.750> mine<00:02:37.930> apart<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:38.739> if<00:02:38.890> you've<00:02:39.040> got

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
me to get mine apart but if you've got

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.710 
me to get mine apart but if you've got
the<00:02:39.489> original<00:02:39.640> ones<00:02:40.030> or<00:02:40.209> something<00:02:40.330> they'll

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
the original ones or something they'll

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.240 
the original ones or something they'll
be<00:02:40.870> quite<00:02:41.200> difficult<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.709> get<00:02:41.860> off<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.190> you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
be quite difficult to get off and you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.860 
be quite difficult to get off and you
might<00:02:42.400> find<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.760> easiest<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.480> cut<00:02:43.690> them

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
might find it easiest just to cut them

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.960 
might find it easiest just to cut them
out<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.200> replace<00:02:45.040> them<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.549> will<00:02:45.640> cost<00:02:45.790> you

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
out and replace them it will cost you

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.190 
out and replace them it will cost you
about<00:02:46.030> 30<00:02:46.390> bucks<00:02:46.600> but<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:48.090> get<00:02:49.090> them<00:02:49.269> out<00:02:49.390> not

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
about 30 bucks but to get them out not

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.990 
about 30 bucks but to get them out not
under<00:02:50.470> tension<00:02:50.739> one<00:02:51.549> thing<00:02:51.730> you're<00:02:51.850> going<00:02:51.940> to

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
under tension one thing you're going to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.410 
under tension one thing you're going to
want<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.269> do<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.880> know<00:02:54.970> carefully

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
want to do is just you know carefully

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.720 
want to do is just you know carefully
jack<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.010> whole<00:02:58.470> wheel<00:02:59.470> assembly<00:02:59.950> up<00:03:00.430> a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
jack the whole wheel assembly up a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.610 
jack the whole wheel assembly up a
little<00:03:01.150> bit<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.480> that'll<00:03:02.109> take<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.320> tension

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
little bit and that'll take the tension

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.190 
little bit and that'll take the tension
off<00:03:02.859> that<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.430> then<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.390> can<00:03:04.540> undo<00:03:04.750> them<00:03:04.900> now

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
off that and then you can undo them now

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.800 
off that and then you can undo them now
just<00:03:05.230> one<00:03:05.769> thing<00:03:05.799> I'll<00:03:06.730> learn<00:03:06.880> for<00:03:07.120> me<00:03:07.269> when

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
just one thing I'll learn for me when

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.300 
just one thing I'll learn for me when
you<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:07.989> this<00:03:08.140> make<00:03:08.350> sure<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.620> don't<00:03:08.739> have<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
you do this make sure you don't have the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.190 
you do this make sure you don't have the
three<00:03:09.760> bolts<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.239> connect<00:03:10.570> your<00:03:10.750> ball<00:03:10.900> joint

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
three bolts that connect your ball joint

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.380 
three bolts that connect your ball joint
um<00:03:13.620> those<00:03:14.620> bolts<00:03:15.100> there<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.730> ball<00:03:15.910> joint<00:03:16.150> you

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
um those bolts there the ball joint you

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.449 
um those bolts there the ball joint you
don't<00:03:16.540> want<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.720> have<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.049> undone<00:03:17.459> because

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
don't want to have that undone because

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.420 
don't want to have that undone because
then<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.880> might<00:03:19.060> you'll<00:03:19.690> pop<00:03:19.930> part<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
then you might you'll pop part the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.080 
then you might you'll pop part the
Seaview<00:03:22.359> boot<00:03:23.079> over<00:03:23.380> there<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:24.010> I'm<00:03:24.160> aiming

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
Seaview boot over there that I'm aiming

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.789 
Seaview boot over there that I'm aiming
at<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.959> added<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.500> lot<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.650> work<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:27.579> this<00:03:27.700> job

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
at that added a lot of work to this job

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.960 
at that added a lot of work to this job
so<00:03:29.799> yeah<00:03:29.890> just<00:03:30.160> make<00:03:30.280> sure<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.489> ball<00:03:30.700> joints

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
so yeah just make sure that ball joints

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.280 
so yeah just make sure that ball joints
all<00:03:31.090> connect<00:03:31.359> up<00:03:31.480> when<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:31.660> jack<00:03:31.840> ups<00:03:32.049> that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
all connect up when you jack ups that

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.809 
all connect up when you jack ups that
your<00:03:32.500> shock<00:03:32.859> moves<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.579> right<00:03:33.670> direction

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
your shock moves in the right direction

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.789 
your shock moves in the right direction
and<00:03:34.180> then<00:03:34.959> hopefully<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.319> can<00:03:35.410> get<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.680> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
and then hopefully you can get to that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.680 
and then hopefully you can get to that
bolt<00:03:36.040> if<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.280> can<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.299> thought<00:03:37.540> on

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
bolt if you can get to a thought on

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.410 
bolt if you can get to a thought on
doing<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.049> all<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.280> better<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.609> you

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.450 

so<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.170> engine<00:03:43.380> mount<00:03:43.530> itself<00:03:43.890> isn't<00:03:44.310> too

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
so the engine mount itself isn't too

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.150 
so the engine mount itself isn't too
difficult<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.270> undo<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> bolts<00:03:45.990> there's<00:03:46.890> one

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
difficult to undo the bolts there's one

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.699 
difficult to undo the bolts there's one
here<00:03:47.340> on<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.520> top<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.260> then<00:03:49.260> there's<00:03:49.470> two

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
here on the top and then there's two

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.699 
here on the top and then there's two
that<00:03:49.890> are<00:03:50.150> underneath<00:03:51.150> there<00:03:51.990> actually<00:03:52.410> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
that are underneath there actually the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.550 
that are underneath there actually the
the<00:03:53.100> not<00:03:53.310> cause<00:03:53.580> onion<00:03:53.910> on<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.050> inside<00:03:55.410> of

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
the not cause onion on the inside of

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.340 
the not cause onion on the inside of
this<00:03:57.140> frame<00:03:58.820> piece<00:03:59.930> there's<00:04:00.930> one<00:04:01.140> on<00:04:01.230> each

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
this frame piece there's one on each

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.220 
this frame piece there's one on each
side<00:04:01.380> there's<00:04:01.740> one<00:04:02.270> here<00:04:03.270> and<00:04:03.480> then<00:04:04.050> there's

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
side there's one here and then there's

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.060 
side there's one here and then there's
one<00:04:04.640> back

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
one back

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.250 
one back
well<00:04:08.070> back<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.340> behind<00:04:08.790> there<00:04:09.140> they're<00:04:10.140> not

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
well back in behind there they're not

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.540 
well back in behind there they're not
too<00:04:10.410> hard<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.650> get<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.980> just<00:04:11.100> go<00:04:11.310> underneath

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
too hard to get to just go underneath

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.130 
too hard to get to just go underneath
you<00:04:11.850> can<00:04:12.000> undo<00:04:12.180> those<00:04:12.300> like<00:04:12.569> they're<00:04:12.720> 17

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
you can undo those like they're 17

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.140 
you can undo those like they're 17
millimeter<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:14.340> then<00:04:14.489> there's<00:04:14.670> one<00:04:14.850> engine

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
millimeter and then there's one engine

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.680 
millimeter and then there's one engine

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
but then what you have to do is you have

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.590 
but then what you have to do is you have
to<00:04:24.990> jack<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.590> engine<00:04:26.010> up<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.419> actually<00:04:27.419> get

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
to jack the engine up to actually get
