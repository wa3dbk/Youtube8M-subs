00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.170 
pinkish tint I mean you're not pink I'm
just<00:02:05.200> saying<00:02:05.380> there's<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.830> pink<00:02:06.220> undertone<00:02:06.880> to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
just saying there's a pink undertone to

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.440 
just saying there's a pink undertone to
this<00:02:07.810> formula<00:02:08.229> instead<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:09.609> it<00:02:09.729> being<00:02:09.759> orange

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450
