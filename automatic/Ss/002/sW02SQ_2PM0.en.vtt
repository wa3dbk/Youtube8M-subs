00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.670
 the first game will be early ram timed 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 to the release of a new movie about spongebob a 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.400
 it's called spongebob sponge he's fat 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.740
 it ran to like other games of this 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350
 genre such as the minions of the temp of wounds 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.060
 Well, actually subspace surfer run and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.010
 here on three tracks we collect coins 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.199
 different pawepas and dodging 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.330
 The obstacles graphics are very nice and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 control responsive play want 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.529
 again and again a nice feature 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.320
 is the presence of several locations and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.510
 coin collecting mini game 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640
 most coins then you can buy new ones 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.739
 costumes and pumping pauperapi game 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.930
 is rapidly gaining momentum and playing 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.969
 first time i went so far that i have 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.230
 there was not a second to think about everything 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.140
 wanted at me in huge quantities 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.239
 and with great speed how to play 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 mini game I did not have time to understand 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.500
 Sorry for other characters to us 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.420
 play will not let them flicker at all 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.379
 the game has only plankton which 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.059
 sometimes helps spongebob 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.580
 quest decorated in the style of steampunk and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.530
 he is called a steam banker is not like that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.930
 quest as we looked before but not 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.299
 less interesting i would call it wrong 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.850
 to a quest but rather a puzzle with 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.590
 foot transitions between levels and the fact that 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.119
 managed to pass did not require to cross 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.159
 some subjects among themselves for 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.320
 getting another and then further 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.450
 solve the riddle by 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.369
 it turned out all tasks were by type 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.530
 find some gears and then time 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.299
 such so that everything works and you can 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.060
 go further well and all that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.490
 like management intuitive 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.500
 game language english game design and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.689
 three-dimensional and use two-dimensional 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.939
 sprites but in a bunch it all looks 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.560
 very interesting advise game lovers 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.570
 puzzle lovers search 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.070
 hidden items on the screen and of course 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.020
 lovers of quests 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.450
 Well, finally, I left a short 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.970
 a story about goats called beat 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.830
 year this is a brief interactive story and 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.229
 most of all it will suit children 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.030
 framed simply and beautifully on each 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.560
 the screen has a bunch of little things on which 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.080
 can be pressed and thus 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.820
 to interact with them such things i 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.830
 I love to sit there in games 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.990
 poke in all and see what 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.850
 will happen but as I said 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.070
 the game will be interesting only for children 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.200
 adults it will be short and not 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.030
 impressionable but at the same time playing on 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.430
 English and it will be clear only to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.410
 who knows even the slightest bit of my tongue 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.630
 like the trend of such stories for 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.530
 handheld devices but as usual on 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.420
 our languages 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.950
 they are much smaller and they are less 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.140
 quality than in the west 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.150
