00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.609
 no no 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.150
 or 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.830
 Well, good, tell us a little bit 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.920
 what expectations do you have for the year 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.160
 2015 in this modified 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 good with the new change because they are the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.550
 objectives and well I hope to repeat and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.290
 improve this year's results 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.290
 it can be a victory 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.290
 and the road because I do not think that 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.940
 have enough options 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.250
 and when we have the good ones I have the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.290
 possibility but not everything is to shine 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:01.370
 give the best and come from opportunities 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:03.610
 that already have free spaces for this 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.610
 year 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.160
 something has been taken to the side but it was not 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.230
 sure in the team had to see more 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.270
 things he wants to be more signings 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.750
 surely the budget so there 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.780
 something next but not fixed I think that 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.240
 then go ahead with the turn of Spain 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.570
 the performance is surely also a 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.550
 hundred for the victory of the stage so 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.740
 well that's what has strengthened what 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.740
 that have been fixed from the beginning 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.720
 strengths of other teams but I think that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.390
 I have a good team as well as a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.009
 joy a good family atmosphere 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.520
 He built a great career 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.520
 started 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.140
 and he is also champion as he has 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.820
 been in hard of the known danger 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.310
 so many others that surely I 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.080
 you want to name so good 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.300
 surely for the same reason 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.610
 family has managed that a team lost 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.400
 so much so that I am sure of all that have 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.489
 gone through this team leave then 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.470
 they always tell the whole deal how 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.019
 this structure works then 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.239
 nothing before reaching the companions I 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.600
 they said congratulations that a good 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.600
 team 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.940
 and it motivates us so it 's a good environment 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.260
 and I think that also influences a lot 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.560
 something that is about the bicycle and good 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.970
 but maybe with compatriots something good 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.970
 you already know someone 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.250
 with two who are the Quintana sisters 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.220
 in the first year it is also shared to 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.040
 a colleague from Colombia 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.640
 so let's approve always help a little 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:08.019
 because in this case suddenly something much 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.760
 with them we live the same city we are 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.430
 from the same region so surely 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.890
 we understand each other a bit more since we are 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.010
 of same customs and good come from the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.980
 same place no and well now nairo is 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.519
 one of the best in the world 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:28.769
 equality like to be with them and if the 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.480
 country is going through a period of two 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.989
 years I think that 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.400
 it has been lost a bit but but of 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.209
 and about five years ago I think that 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.870
 again step by step every year 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.640
 it comes from more from less to more and also 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.950
 new generations are coming 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.710
 some hear names and every one of us 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.770
 leaving more Colombians 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.270
 the world tour of europe teams 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.490
 professionals I think that also those 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.590
 good results that has been had and that 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.860
 bayern thomas doors to more guys 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.660
 young people and that it ended up taking little 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.130
 little new discoveries are 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.550
 stars so to speak new 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.550
 talents 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:19.660
 the strongest and we fight for 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.040
 keep us there for now the vision is 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:28.840
 continue in italy 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.840
 if I suddenly have Spain then if 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.030
 within one year 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.249
 and good the truth I hope to improve more 50 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.469
 physical aspect and consolidate more 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.929
 say positive results both 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.849
 personal as for the team and I hope 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:52.909
 be of great support for them and good 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.349
 I think it would close with victories in 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.349
 this mystery 1015
