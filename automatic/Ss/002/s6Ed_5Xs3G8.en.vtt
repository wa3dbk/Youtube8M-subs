helmet<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.580> that<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.630> me<00:00:57.660> thinking<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
helmet so that got me thinking that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.720 
helmet so that got me thinking that
there<00:00:59.100> could<00:00:59.430> actually<00:00:59.790> might<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
there could actually might be of

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.250 
there could actually might be of
dinosaur<00:01:02.730> mo<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.210> battle<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.810> three<00:01:04.080> if

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
dinosaur mo in battle for the three if

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.690 
dinosaur mo in battle for the three if
it<00:01:04.410> does<00:01:04.620> then<00:01:04.980> that<00:01:05.220> would<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.460> good

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it does then that would be a good

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.040 
it does then that would be a good
addition<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.390> battle<00:01:06.690> for<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.840> theory

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
addition to the battle for the theory

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.770 
addition to the battle for the theory
but<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> wouldn't<00:01:07.650> make<00:01:07.740> any<00:01:07.920> sense<00:01:08.190> as

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
but it wouldn't make any sense as

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.030 
but it wouldn't make any sense as
diamonds<00:01:09.780> remote<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.290> battle<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.710> free<00:01:10.920> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
diamonds remote in battle for free but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
diamonds remote in battle for free but
that<00:01:11.250> would<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.850> good<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.360> put<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that would actually be good to put that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
that would actually be good to put that
in<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:15.210> let<00:01:15.990> me<00:01:16.080> zubin<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:17.270> doing<00:01:18.270> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that but I think they should put like

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.510 
that but I think they should put like

will<00:03:40.790> probably<00:03:41.030> playing<00:03:41.390> dinosaur<00:03:42.050> mo<00:03:42.200> more

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620

than<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.070> multiplayer<00:03:43.760> for<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.810> fact<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.440> might

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
than the multiplayer for a fact I might

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.300 
than the multiplayer for a fact I might
be<00:03:45.920> playing<00:03:47.170> but<00:03:48.170> they<00:03:48.290> do<00:03:48.350> have<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> co-op<00:03:49.070> mode

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
be playing but they do have a co-op mode

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.580 
be playing but they do have a co-op mode
for<00:03:49.520> battlefield<00:03:50.030> 3<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.870> probably<00:03:51.410> gonna

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
for battlefield 3 so probably gonna

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.040 
for battlefield 3 so probably gonna

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
combine that with the co-op mode or put

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.110 
combine that with the co-op mode or put
a<00:03:54.080> different<00:03:54.440> load<00:03:54.800> under<00:03:55.250> co-op<00:03:55.610> modes<00:03:55.850> and
