00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.460
 I want to fight you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.750
 This guy is also from that cultural background right now at the same time 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.730
 Well like that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.430
 I think that Fukui Minami back ground will be a point after all 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.909
 But 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.589
 That interior is deaf until the first 830 years since China's split 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:24.140
 Everyone was falling apart 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.509
 Questions still popular with their children at the convenience of both 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.279
 Because it is difficult to get labre bacteria 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.430
 Then I have to think so much that I'm just a gull company 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.800
 Not in each land 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.810
 each 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.750
 Thing is 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.580
 It has been used 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.060
 So everyone is new to the Tokyo Geiko Caritti 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.200
 In the old days 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.460
 So it becomes especially the city fish market gold of two south of the florist 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.960
 The history of various ethnic groups has many ethnic groups until decision making 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.750
 From the first 995 large lcd burn mark 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.090
 A system of people who make updates and various countries 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.210
 It's usually together 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.560
 This new growth will grow again as Hino City Hall leaves 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.950
 It is called 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.020
 If you look at it through w7 it's a very nice possibility 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.700
 Even if Suzuki learned no longer 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.790
 Make it a British colonial circle colonial colony. 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.150
 It is the April-June period 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.410
 Frame rate 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.850
 Attention Takata night also clothes 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.260
 I'm indebted to offer my own biz shape it 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.710
 Go to the southeast end of that navel bottle 9th floor and see 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 So you have some power 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.260
 That frustration yard's sales that exhaust gas emissions 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.300
 The monarchy was abolished and somehow it was one more than three points 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.730
 It is in Natori city, but it is such a difference in front of them 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.860
 Ochiai's and back etc. are stabbed for several years 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.170
 That Italian 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.200
 As we could see figure from previous work 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430
 It is a lucky man who won the British of alienware 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.770
 It is also interesting 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.310
 this is- 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.990
 Japan travel future person 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.550
 I report that it is in English but 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.579
 Originally considered by the British, this partnership is not considered 2 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.969
 As before, the tone of the president of this year, Mr. Shiratori, has died 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:17.909
 is not it 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.900
 So the foreign phase is from 33mm to 35mm alternative 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.140
 But it is about 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.590
 There are usually 14-16 co-ops 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.610
 Think of this button as a coat 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.419
 What can we do 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
 Because I'm meeting these two people to hold back 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.149
 shoulder 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:36.040
 With the UK 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.919
 US American is wrecked 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.629
 The US is about 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.820
 Member is 16mm 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.109
 8 cases of play and 14 mm turn 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.499
 Inside 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.389
 The diameter of this button is 15 people 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:55.319
 Nakaumi and 15287.5m7.5 stick together where I am going 7.5 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.799
 Because 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.070
 It is a place where the pre-button and r button are stacked 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.509
 Trial death one third 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.529
 So I went to the propeller to attack 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.539
 Run but 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.340
 Although the quotient shows, 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.940
 Foreigners are absolutely back with this 1mm button or button on TV 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.560
 Between 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.829
 And it will be 966 mm 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.499
 That really 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:23.239
 Quilt I also based on the weird runaway sky runaway 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.759
 Such is completely burned 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:26.879
 Scale merit 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.059
 Age group 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.209
 What is saying cold soba? 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.289
 What is it? It means that you can carry it 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.429
 This is your ability 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.060
 It is other than the number 2.5 type 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.520
 There are 3 centimeters 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.080
 If you do so at Tendo City Ogino Matsuri 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.150
 The photo opened on October 1 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.420
 It is a pillow It is the first company of 1.5 cm to be the most beautiful 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.479
 It is about 4.5 centimeters from the right lung in person 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.679
 And conversely 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:55.039
 There is no punishment in the possession of the actual bullet to put out the president twelve centimeters 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.229
 you know 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.649
 But the Italians are thinking about that during the heat 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.969
 I guess it's a joke 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:07.309
 This April side using the quality that made the Sapporo High Court and less than 1% of thought 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.479
 of 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.769
 Because the cause of defeat is very narrow 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.139
 I'm going to go along with my own, broken yacht life 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.319
 I'm off 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.799
 There is a real conflict 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.229
 You are fashionable while you 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.319
 Kohei Satoh Undecided 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.619
 As Nobuo Asano curator of the arts department was the largest 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.059
 I have no idea 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.059
 I thought it was okan 20 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.110
 I speak that I want to be strong 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:39.409
 There is a strike line that 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.449
 What is the difference between the tire turning angle and other countries? 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.719
 It is different from other countries and it loses 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.999
 Great Britain 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:54.270
 I speak 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.419
 Wintering 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.139
 The groove you set yourself 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.779
 there 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.300
 that 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.289
 Titles omitted 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.520
 And 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.550
 Tomomi Ando 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.330
 I think it's original, but I have the idea of â€‹â€‹making things apart and tools 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.930
 The final in a very strong sound was played clearly 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.160
 With heavy fabrics 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.080
 I can not keep the sharp color 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.660
 It is said that it is beyond the stand when it is a very rare design 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:21.219
 Ne 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:25.469
 If we make a human shape here, we will be class conscious 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:26.680
 For example 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.349
 Just wear clothes such as accessories 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.900
 In short, you can have fellowship 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.749
 The brightness of that class 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.529
 Because it does not fit 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.270
 That's why I make it with shovels 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.409
 that 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.849
 There is a total number of history It is Italian where place is aligned 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.830
 I do not like energy saving in Italy when I do it 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.240
 Respect 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.710
 Let's take away the individuality because it is for more work 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.619
 It seems that there was an idea that 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:57.000
 But for that 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.790
 Very red and use a lot of that color or soon 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.760
 A piece large enough to miss the entrance of South Africa using a beautiful color 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.310
 Eight people do not do such a monday at pace over there 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.210
 More 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.210
 The individual who used that enjoyable 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.129
 You claimed that personality 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:15.150
 There is a history against 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.499
 It was said that it was made for that 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:19.919
 In the meantime, a man's usual tie was 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.220
 It looks like it's not a sanctuary of customers only from there in November 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.139
 But asbestos 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.310
 A place like you really do this Anpanman mini 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.280
 Rather 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.600
 Can you re-watch that person's personality?
