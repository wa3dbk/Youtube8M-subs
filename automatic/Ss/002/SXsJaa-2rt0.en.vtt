00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.560
 Hello and welcome to the 26th edition of Ollis Abendshow the last one 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.490
 Broadcast 2007 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.190
 to the financial statements give who Celebrity Maze I really gas again today with it 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.970
 Joey Kelly Lotti Krekel Hans Neblung and rolls over Andreas Vollenweider 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.999
 all this and much more in the next 55 minutes or so 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.899
 Name is to Live Rosental I am glad that you have turned on 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.499
 the Circus Roncalli has pitched his tents in Oldenburg again 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.940
 Together with the Kelly Family they present the program 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.540
 Circus meets Music Â«The friendship between the Kelly Family and jumped 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.270
 Kali is already over 30 years old 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.310
 because Kelly helped the circus director Bernhard Paul once out of trouble and 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.890
 this event welded the two together 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.500
 Deep in the heart is the friendship between Ron Kali and Kelly 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.060
 the singing sisters and brothers remain true to their roots and are in 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.520
 their hearts moving people remained in the best sense 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.130
 like Bernhard Paul, whose "Circus" was also famous and famous 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.440
 Successful here is the heart and not the prophet dictates here 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.720
 the hard work for easy entertainment prevail the day here 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.090
 Openness and tolerance a bit like the Kelly Family so at least 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.150
 describes the Circus Roncalli themselves are legendary not only the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.260
 Kelle concerts on huge stages and staging of the Roncalli circus in 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.050
 a legendary legendary creature is already creative 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.540
 Interplay of circus and music since 2004 already affects small clubs 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.010
 So the art of the body banned the art of cayenne fantasy 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.320
 The first program with the new project Ron Kelly was called at that time 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.670
 Oberhausen has since started experiencing tens of thousands between Berlin and Berlin 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.840
 Oldenburg this mixture of finest artistry of Ron Cawley with the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.690
 Kelly's unique music as its quiet sounds and smart to become one 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.120
 for that the sensuality of a movement or the nonsense of a clown made 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.430
 Accurately accentuated on the day of the Germany premiere met 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.429
 Kelly in the circus tent at the weser ems hall in Oldenburg 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.830
 Joey Kelly premiere German premiere of Roncalli's The 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.399
 Chamber is nothing to the cooperation with Mrs Coleen 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.959
 before 30 years 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.039
 Mining was easier than playing on the street 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.499
 then they visited back at them and already have to mail 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:34.929
 At that time, the focus was on and then there were two truck drivers around 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.969
 Dismantling the equipment of Krailling a refund friendship and since 30 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.749
 Years, Kettmann is fine 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:41.810
 the winegrowing is 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.610
 Unkel for me fly for my sister and about four-five 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.510
 Years ago, where we always had the idea together with Neil Sieg mit Zirkus 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.400
 It had been realized in March to Oberhausen and it had to be realized 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.989
 second time in 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.230
 So that will be so already production is already now foot rather than solutions 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.849
 the city always like that 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:02.659
 weeks 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.620
 the feeling that you feel right at home here so that's no 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.359
 Trends or both cases 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.079
 Definitely good Kansas water percent so it's all over 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.869
 relaxed 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:18.809
 most desirable process they are totally comfortable are very high quality 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.459
 Power fast hard-working 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.579
 pleasant people 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.010
 around people doing that and everyone has their party on this way everything 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:31.049
 happened without stress without stress and everyone does not know what he does 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.120
 then it runs from one point of view rather than the other what is expected 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.389
 So it's more of a Kelly concert or more of a future for the audience 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.659
 imagine or 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.269
 both equally 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.859
 The world needs people 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.799
 he successfully set it's time for any artistry her presentation stops 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.590
 adapted by a musical part of and Peitz percent by the way new 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:57.849
 Songs the new around 14 choice of juggler or wedding why percent 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.289
 it takes longer or shorter than the downgrade is good, "she said 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.369
 Circus knows itself also very sporty marathon runner to six times 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:08.110
 considered to focus on the second was made narrow 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.810
 No, I just framed here from our production with Millingen for 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.660
 That's why I worked so well I've done so well for the second time 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.120
 he knows mine here 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.030
 and clearly now as a broadcast with ten man 26 steam vehicles Manassas in the 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.289
 ARD at 20 o'clock at it I work with a test loser demolition was 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.419
 Will the Kellys go on tour with new bonds without 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.060
 Circus maybe when the production was over we were just up 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.300
 to the last week 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.550
 and now Cloud Gate to Mine arrives at Colin and there and then there is 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.400
 I can take a break and then catch the gates I can in the summer of spring 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.169
 again and then celebrated a question I still have what do you personally believe 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.479
 What is the Kelly Family's secret of success? Why are you so popular? 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.550
 I do not think maybe because it's too long for my family 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.559
 because we stop and stay loyal always we do not care about which one 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:02.019
 Modes adapt because we just go under my way and because he's hard for it 

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:04.639
 work and have benefited 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.870
 Taylor for the conversation 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.760
 She was watching Abendshow every first and third Wednesday of the month 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.490
 1 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.740
 Oldies evening show 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.660
 turn it on then turn it off
