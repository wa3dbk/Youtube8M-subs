00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.100
 watch 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.710

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.140
 it is quite a help to the channel the great support 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.360
 that you stay in position I think that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.620
 number two and good remember that your 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.270
 racing is in the part of 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.690
 instruction and I also put some 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.130
 similar for the other consoles I hope 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.220

 me and is fighting between a thousand child 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.250
 Carlos and Kevin, let's see, we're not going to 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.160
 wait for the third place to see if it is given and 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.560
 isolates it seems to me that it can be third 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.920
 place let's see if it does not fall 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.690
 Come, come, come, come on, there's no 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.570
 conflict and it seems to me that maybe the 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.770
 third place yes yes if it was not passing 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.090
