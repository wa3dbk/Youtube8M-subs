some tiny little delicas and round them

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.189 
some tiny little delicas and round them
on<00:00:20.789> wire<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.330> I'm<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> show<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.930> how<00:00:22.140> to

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
on wire and I'm going to show you how to

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.990 
on wire and I'm going to show you how to
do<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.920> sec<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.369> take<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> look<00:00:23.880> at

magatama it's a dagger style of bead
that<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.640> hole<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> top<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.420> those<00:00:31.199> are

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that has a hole at the top and those are

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.990 
that has a hole at the top and those are
directional<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.099> they<00:00:32.219> create<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.700> sort<00:00:32.880> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
directional so they create this sort of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
directional so they create this sort of
pinecone<00:00:33.510> effect<00:00:33.870> when<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.200> coil<00:00:34.500> them

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
pinecone effect when you coil them

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.520 
pinecone effect when you coil them

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you want to use the end of your wire to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
you want to use the end of your wire to
pick<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> beads<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.659> press

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
pick up the beads so you just press

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.710 
pick up the beads so you just press
right<00:01:28.259> down<00:01:28.530> into<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> bead<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:30.299> tip<00:01:30.509> about

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
right down into the bead and a tip about

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.510 
right down into the bead and a tip about
using<00:01:30.780> bead<00:01:31.290> mats<00:01:31.530> too<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.040> only<00:01:32.070> does<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
using bead mats too not only does it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
using bead mats too not only does it
prevent<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:33.180> beads<00:01:33.420> from<00:01:33.540> rolling<00:01:33.659> away<00:01:34.049> but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
prevent your beads from rolling away but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.429 
prevent your beads from rolling away but
the<00:01:35.070> fibers<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> bead<00:01:35.880> mats<00:01:36.090> also<00:01:36.450> work

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the fibers of the bead mats also work

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.990 
the fibers of the bead mats also work
with<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> beads<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.130> help<00:01:38.310> them<00:01:38.490> land<00:01:38.700> whole

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
with the beads to help them land whole

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
with the beads to help them land whole
side<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.829> scooted

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
side up so you can see I just scooted

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.649 
side up so you can see I just scooted
them<00:01:41.460> down<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> wire<00:01:42.119> here

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
them down on the wire here

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.510 
them down on the wire here
and<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.110> left<00:01:43.290> myself<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:43.920> bit<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.310> tail

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and I left myself a little bit of a tail

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.389 
and I left myself a little bit of a tail
so<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.119> something<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> hold<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
so that I have something to hold on to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.240 
so that I have something to hold on to
okay<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.850> I'm<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.720> gently

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
okay so now I'm just going to gently

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.310 
okay so now I'm just going to gently
coil<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.460> around<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> beads<00:01:52.140> are

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
coil this around so the beads are

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
coil this around so the beads are
already<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:54.149> using<00:01:54.360> my<00:01:54.509> thumb

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
already on there and I'm using my thumb

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.889 
already on there and I'm using my thumb
and<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:55.290> forefinger<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.119> hold<00:01:57.570> them<00:01:57.719> in

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and my forefinger to just hold them in

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.219 
and my forefinger to just hold them in
place<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:59.250> want<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.790> kind<00:02:00.090> of

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
place and you want to do that kind of

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.859 
place and you want to do that kind of
loosely<00:02:01.460> because<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> too<00:02:03.509> tightly

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
loosely because if you do it too tightly

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660 
loosely because if you do it too tightly
you<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.320> cause<00:02:04.530> some<00:02:04.560> problems<00:02:04.740> there<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you can cause some problems there so

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.109 
you can cause some problems there so
keep<00:02:06.090> your<00:02:06.270> tension<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.719> little<00:02:06.810> bit<00:02:07.049> loose<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
keep your tension a little bit loose and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.059 
keep your tension a little bit loose and
coil<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.270> around<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.050> you'll<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.860> keep

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
coil it around and you'll just keep

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.800 
coil it around and you'll just keep
going<00:02:11.430> now<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.640> could<00:02:11.970> cover<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> whole<00:02:12.569> bead

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
going now you could cover the whole bead

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.880 
going now you could cover the whole bead
like<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.080> did<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> air

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
like I did on the air

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
like I did on the air
that<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.160> showed<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.790> started<00:02:15.210> you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
that I showed you and we started you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.500 
that I showed you and we started you
could<00:02:15.630> cover<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.990> whole<00:02:16.140> hoop<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.470> mean<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:17.510> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
could cover the whole hoop I mean or you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.790 
could cover the whole hoop I mean or you
can<00:02:18.660> do<00:02:18.780> something<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.290> where<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
can do something like this where you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.250 
can do something like this where you
have<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.459> coiled<00:02:21.000> section<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.600> center<00:02:21.990> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
have a coiled section in the center and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.320 
have a coiled section in the center and
this<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> fun<00:02:23.160> way<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.340> add<00:02:23.459> color<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.180> your

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
this is a fun way to add color to your

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.120 
this is a fun way to add color to your
earring<00:02:24.690> hoops<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.830> gives<00:02:26.010> it

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
earring hoops and it really gives it

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.650 
earring hoops and it really gives it
that<00:02:26.160> hand-beaded<00:02:26.610> look<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.060> dresses<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.569> up

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
that hand-beaded look that dresses it up

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.840 
that hand-beaded look that dresses it up
and<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.709> one<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:29.250> just

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
and you can see on this one I just

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.650 
and you can see on this one I just
pulled<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> coil<00:02:30.360> apart<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.800> would<00:02:32.040> just

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
pulled the coil apart so you would just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.330 
pulled the coil apart so you would just
carefully<00:02:33.660> take<00:02:33.900> your<00:02:34.080> fingers<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.740> pull<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
carefully take your fingers and pull the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.860 
carefully take your fingers and pull the
coil<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.150> get<00:02:36.300> some<00:02:36.540> different

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
coil and then you can get some different

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.360 
coil and then you can get some different
effects<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> great<00:02:37.920> way<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.100> bring

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370

directional you can see how these I've
loaded<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.310> wire<00:03:05.580> are<00:03:05.820> all<00:03:05.940> facing<00:03:06.360> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
loaded on to the wire are all facing the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.540 
loaded on to the wire are all facing the
same<00:03:06.600> direction<00:03:06.920> that's<00:03:07.920> important<00:03:08.430> because

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
same direction that's important because

when you begin coiling you'll want to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.910 
when you begin coiling you'll want to
wrap<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.830> around<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:16.470> will<00:03:16.680> create

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
wrap that around and that will create

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.750 
wrap that around and that will create
the<00:03:17.070> textured<00:03:17.820> effect<00:03:18.170> with<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.290> daggers<00:03:19.760> so
