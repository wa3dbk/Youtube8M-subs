remote-controlled tank such as this one
I've<00:00:21.840> had<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:22.380> since<00:00:22.769> around<00:00:23.130> about

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
I've had this one since around about

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.029 
I've had this one since around about
2001<00:00:24.240> 2002<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.199> fact<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> was<00:00:25.619> my<00:00:25.769> first

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
2001 2002 in fact it was my first

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.790 
2001 2002 in fact it was my first
remote-controlled<00:00:26.970> tank<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:28.140> always<00:00:28.529> been

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
remote-controlled tank it's always been

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.400 
remote-controlled tank it's always been
far<00:00:29.130> too<00:00:29.160> fast<00:00:29.670> good<00:00:30.420> fun<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.869> not

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
far too fast good fun but not

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
far too fast good fun but not
particularly<00:00:31.830> release<00:00:32.250> stick<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.059> looks

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
particularly release stick and it looks

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
particularly release stick and it looks
absolutely<00:00:33.450> horrible<00:00:34.200> as<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.950> in

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
absolutely horrible as you can see in

absolutely horrible as you can see in
the<00:00:35.190> video<00:00:35.390> now<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.690> you're<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> need

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the video now what you're going to need

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650 
the video now what you're going to need
is<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.680> soldering<00:00:38.309> iron<00:00:38.460> some<00:00:39.149> electrical

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
is a soldering iron some electrical

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.110 
is a soldering iron some electrical
diodes<00:00:40.079> these<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:41.100> basically<00:00:41.489> one-way

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
diodes these are basically one-way

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
diodes these are basically one-way
electrical<00:00:42.750> valves<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.290> allow<00:00:43.379> current<00:00:43.890> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
electrical valves that allow current to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.029 
electrical valves that allow current to
flow<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.610> direction<00:00:45.000> only<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:46.800> also

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
flow in one direction only and they also

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.700 
flow in one direction only and they also
reduce<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.760> voltage<00:00:47.879> by<00:00:48.329> 0.6<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> volt<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
reduce the voltage by 0.6 of a volt and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.970 
reduce the voltage by 0.6 of a volt and
it's<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.550> effect<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.239> today<00:00:51.980> by

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's this effect that we want today by

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.160 
it's this effect that we want today by
putting<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> diodes<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.539> back<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
putting the diodes back to back as you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
putting the diodes back to back as you
can<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.920> means<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> current<00:00:57.300> can

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
can see here means that the current can

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.990 
can see here means that the current can
flow<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:58.020> both<00:00:58.230> directions<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:59.550> your<00:00:59.670> forward

in this case I've replaced the motor set

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.249 
in this case I've replaced the motor set
so<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> colors<00:01:47.970> don't<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.750> correspond

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so the colors don't actually correspond

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.800 
so the colors don't actually correspond
then<00:01:49.890> solder<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.670> pair<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> diodes<00:01:51.450> into

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
then solder in a pair of diodes into

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.039 
then solder in a pair of diodes into

each feed wire as seen here finally make
sure<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.290> they're<00:01:55.590> carefully<00:01:56.270> fixed<00:01:57.270> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
sure that they're carefully fixed so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.240 
sure that they're carefully fixed so
they<00:01:57.689> can't<00:01:57.960> shake<00:01:58.350> around<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.920> cause<00:01:59.100> any

I use hot melt glue okay let's take the
tank<00:02:05.110> for<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:05.350> test<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.799> see<00:02:06.040> how<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.310> runs

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.090 

so<00:02:13.600> it's<00:02:13.750> certainly<00:02:13.930> much<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.530> controllable

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
so it's certainly much more controllable

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.580 
so it's certainly much more controllable
and<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.370> was<00:02:15.520> still<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.090> bit<00:02:16.300> too<00:02:16.330> fast<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.440> this

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and it was still a bit too fast but this

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.990 
and it was still a bit too fast but this
is<00:02:17.709> never<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.370> good<00:02:18.400> as<00:02:18.730> proper

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
is never going to be good as proper

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.300 
is never going to be good as proper
proportional<00:02:19.720> control<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.800> needs<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.130> very

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
proportional control but it needs a very

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.479 
proportional control but it needs a very
simple<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.000> cheap<00:02:22.030> way<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.989> slow<00:02:23.230> down<00:02:23.590> your

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
simple and cheap way to slow down your

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.090 
simple and cheap way to slow down your
basic<00:02:24.910> model<00:02:25.239> tank<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.750> get<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.770> little<00:02:27.010> bit

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
basic model tank and get a little bit

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.860 
basic model tank and get a little bit
more<00:02:27.250> enjoyment<00:02:27.550> out<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.030> hope<00:02:28.600> this<00:02:28.750> was

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
more enjoyment out of it hope this was

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.370 
more enjoyment out of it hope this was
