00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.070
 very good friends and support friends 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.379
 tape punto net my name is pablo 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.090
 martÃ­nez and I go with a quick video a 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.160
 video of this that explains a trick 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.150
 from windows 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.060
 You usually know that I roll more 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.230
 with technical videos do not be afraid of windows 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.179
 server and things like these 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.890
 but let's say there I'm going to make a video 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.179
 so a little bit softer too for me 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.439
 relax a little I deserve it and put 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.110
 I'm going to teach a trick that I think 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.150
 that we are going to you and it is a trick that we 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.629
 will allow modifying the list of 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.360
 send the statesman to send to 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.520
 can modify is very very simple 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.649
 modify is ready for it 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.930
 we would simply have to execute the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.130
 command this we are seeing here be 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.940
 two points sen 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.040
 according to this command we accede 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.050
 directly to the list that no 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.560
 we want to access here here comes the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.900
 full path appears two points users 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.300
 bar pablo bar application data 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.570
 varroa will diminish microsoft for windows 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.640
 bars in total to say very around here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:19.120
 users pablo application data roaming 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 microsoft windows and center and we access 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.979
 we come to the same place 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.869
 well what can we put here 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.990
 well then shortcuts basically 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.980
 anything with a shortcut that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.320
 allow us 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.170
 execute a program or that it reaches a 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.510
 concrete folder the rope for example 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.440
 I'm going to create here in downloads a 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.340
 folder that is going to be called test for 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.840
 the video of agreement I get here here 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.720
 I have a complete test route to 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.300
 the video if I copy this now I 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.770
 back off I go here to the center and created 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.840
 a new shortcut 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.219
 with this next route end test 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.750
 for the video if I now go to 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:10.789
 images and I tell this to send to 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.739
 try for the video and I'm going to my 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.750
 download test for the video here I have 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.400
 the picture of agreement we can create a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.280
 direct access to a folder so that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.540
 automatically the file goes away 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.269
 there 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.310
 well another little thing we can do is 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.709
 for example then put a shortcut 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.160
 to an application for example one that 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.680
 we know all you do not peace point excel 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.510
 obviously I'm going to finish it and here 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.760
 I have peace of mind in agreement I will open 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.660
 another then I go to images 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.239
 test for the video send to note peace and 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.640
 automatically opens the file with 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.470
 notepad 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.630
 in agreement 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.400
 more little things more programs so 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.020
 we can put browsers or we can 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.660
 put good each of the programs 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.280
 what else do you use to pick up some file 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.620
 send him there because he works a lot with 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.660
 this or folders as we have seen then 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.760
 put a folder a shortcut to 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.170
 a folder that we work a lot that is 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.670
 a work folder that we like 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.430
 send a lot of information there and so on 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.990
 for a folder that is junk and we're going 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.490
 looking for politics put to the folder goes 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.290
 to let go and there we are revising or 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.080
 whatever it is worth, whatever one wants 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.840
 agree a little water and we have 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.050
 for example is that we can put 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.400
 to see if I clarify a bit we can put 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.620
 a direct access for example to a 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.690
 internet browser browsers 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.190
 Internet do many beautiful things 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.739
 It is worth, for example, to open 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.750
 images then a possibility that 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.690
 we would have would be to put the internet 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.890
 explorer of agreement I do not know if this if I 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.890
 he's going to catch him and explorer 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.830
 good if the program does not find it 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.060
 we have a very simple solution of the 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.590
 next we give here right button 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.090
 properties and here comes the route 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.599
 complete so it would simply be 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.060
 copy this route and new shortcut 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.430
 paste this route in agreement is going to 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.959
 remove the quotes just in case 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.890
 next and explorer finish I have already 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.750
 here on the list and exploded 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.220
 agree what happens they are called this 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.819
 image and tell him to send and explorer 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.310
 it is automatically opening the 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.930
 image with the internet explorer 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.329
 remember that in this case they want 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.820
 install what you can try with chrome with 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.380
 firefox with whatever you want to in 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.120
 beginning any file that is 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.240
 I could talk with open pardon with 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.880
 Internet explorer could be opened with the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.460
 menu sat down to see if this one sent it to 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.910
 internet explorer then it shows me the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.160
 text 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.630
 according to whether it was an htm document 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.680
 so you would see a web page in this 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.960
 case 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.670
 this is ready and if I give it here to see 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.220
 source code because what it shows me is 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.690
 this visit cake agree 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.240

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.370
