strong man with a key body nice and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.930 
strong man with a key body nice and
here's<00:00:42.219> a<00:00:42.309> key<00:00:44.040> right<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.280> bloke<00:00:45.520> on<00:00:45.790> the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
here's a key right the bloke on the

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.549 
here's a key right the bloke on the
YouTube<00:00:46.390> thing<00:00:46.420> reckoned<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.290> had<00:00:47.500> a

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
YouTube thing reckoned I had a

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.590 
YouTube thing reckoned I had a
combination<00:00:48.370> on<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.640> flip<00:00:48.850> side<00:00:48.879> of<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.390> key

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
combination on the flip side of the key

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.450 
combination on the flip side of the key
I<00:00:49.629> think<00:00:50.260> that's<00:00:50.559> what<00:00:50.739> he<00:00:50.829> was<00:00:50.950> getting<00:00:51.160> at

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
I think that's what he was getting at

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.970 
I think that's what he was getting at
now<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.719> would<00:00:52.899> be<00:00:52.930> useless<00:00:53.530> because

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
now that would be useless because

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.040 
now that would be useless because
there's<00:00:54.670> only<00:00:54.760> one<00:00:55.030> set<00:00:55.270> of<00:00:55.390> pins<00:00:55.600> in<00:00:55.840> this

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
there's only one set of pins in this

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.520 
there's only one set of pins in this
lock

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
lock

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.069 
lock
unless<00:00:57.100> he's<00:00:57.370> suggesting<00:00:58.030> at<00:00:58.149> some<00:00:58.480> point<00:00:58.870> I

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
unless he's suggesting at some point I

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.529 
unless he's suggesting at some point I
flipped<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.710> over<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.850> revealed<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.360> real

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
flipped it over to revealed a real

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:02.310 
flipped it over to revealed a real
combination

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
combination

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.760 
combination
I<00:01:02.500> mean<00:01:03.100> it's<00:01:03.280> ludicrous<00:01:03.430> if<00:01:04.000> I<00:01:04.149> add<00:01:04.770> slight

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
I mean it's ludicrous if I add slight

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.499 
I mean it's ludicrous if I add slight
advanced<00:01:06.100> skills<00:01:06.490> like<00:01:06.759> that<00:01:06.789> wouldn't<00:01:07.389> be

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
advanced skills like that wouldn't be

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.169 
advanced skills like that wouldn't be
bumping<00:01:07.929> locks<00:01:08.139> for<00:01:08.319> a<00:01:08.350> living<00:01:08.649> art<00:01:08.799> area

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
bumping locks for a living art area

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:15.239 
bumping locks for a living art area
anyway<00:01:10.179> is<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:11.170> key<00:01:11.579> as<00:01:12.579> you<00:01:12.819> see<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.979> a

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
anyway is the key as you see that's a

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:21.089 
anyway is the key as you see that's a
moat<00:01:15.490> we<00:01:15.639> lock<00:01:15.819> machine<00:01:15.999> cap<00:01:18.719> funky<00:01:20.099> both

okay now people that good these are the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.020 
okay now people that good these are the
dampers<00:01:32.970> I'm<00:01:33.120> gonna<00:01:33.300> use<00:01:34.310> nope<00:01:35.310> let<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> key

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
dampers I'm gonna use nope let the key

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.810 
dampers I'm gonna use nope let the key
out<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> shot<00:01:36.600> can't<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.410> bring<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.550> their

show you it again okay I'm gonna put
away<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:49.190> dampeners<00:01:50.190> go<00:01:50.400> on

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
away here right dampeners go on

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
away here right dampeners go on
anyone<00:01:52.890> who<00:01:52.979> knows<00:01:53.130> UK<00:01:53.670> bunkies<00:01:54.240> will<00:01:54.450> now

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
anyone who knows UK bunkies will now

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
anyone who knows UK bunkies will now
work<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.670> by<00:01:56.670> lining<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.990> with

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
work that out by lining up there with

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.740 
work that out by lining up there with
those<00:01:59.550> seven<00:02:00.090> bleeding<00:02:01.080> pins<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.630> I'm

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
those seven bleeding pins and now I'm

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.830 
those seven bleeding pins and now I'm
going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.050> show<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.350> how<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> bump<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.840> when

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
going to show you how to bump it when

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.380 
going to show you how to bump it when
when<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.590> using<00:02:07.860> dampeners<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.179> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
when you're using dampeners you it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.540 
when you're using dampeners you it
yarder<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.530> why<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:10.860> called<00:02:11.100> dampers

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
yarder that's why they called dampers

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.030 
yarder that's why they called dampers
they<00:02:11.700> dampen<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.900> won't<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.410> causing<00:02:13.950> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
they dampen it you won't be causing a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.240 
they dampen it you won't be causing a
lot<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.580> impact<00:02:15.300> inside<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.930> lock<00:02:16.170> these<00:02:16.950> will

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
lot of impact inside the lock these will

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.470 
lot of impact inside the lock these will
absorb<00:02:17.580> most<00:02:17.820> of<00:02:18.120> it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
absorb most of it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:42.060 
absorb most of it
so<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.680> bum<00:02:20.070> key<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:23.760> look<00:02:27.500> here<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.620> go

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070
