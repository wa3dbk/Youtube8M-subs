00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
four mysteries of the rosary I believe

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.850 
four mysteries of the rosary I believe
the<00:05:42.210> reason<00:05:42.390> we<00:05:42.600> have<00:05:42.810> four<00:05:43.170> mysteries<00:05:43.650> is

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
the reason we have four mysteries is

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.940 
the reason we have four mysteries is
because<00:05:44.370> that<00:05:44.580> is<00:05:44.640> an<00:05:44.880> end<00:05:45.180> times<00:05:45.600> number<00:05:45.950> for

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
because that is an end times number for

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.530 
because that is an end times number for
almost<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.340> thousand<00:05:47.850> years<00:05:47.880> there<00:05:48.180> are<00:05:48.240> only
