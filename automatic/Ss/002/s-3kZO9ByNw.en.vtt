00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:19.090
 hi people, we will hold now 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:22.000
 video card installation 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.340
 this system unit 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.560
 so in order to put the mill video 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:35.620
 card slot write express here it is 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.620
 slot but she does not confuse the fleet to write 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.339
 letters express back walls here 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.329
 We've already broken out reshetochki 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:51.679
 3 pieces you can have them just 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.249
 so take and break off not easy 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.249
 break off 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.899
 take a video card 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.500
 there is a video card with a jeep connector 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.920
 but it became somehow we become with the map 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.920
 Come with plug and gray and neat 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 we insert 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:49.590
 Everything here has become normal. 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:54.660
 her graphics card does n't have an extra 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.840
 power it is not much possible from the sheet and 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:02.850
 extra power on the video card then 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.850
 sleep back we still have 4 pin input from 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.450
 system unit also on some 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.900
 video cards are worth the cooler and that is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.220
 cooling and power from these coolers are not 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.010
 in the video card itself 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.640
 and on the motherboard that is 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.300
 wire 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.630
 and it needs to be connected to the mother 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.510
 charge as well as central 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.590
 processor we see that there is a wire from 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:40.010
 cooler and it inserts a motherboard 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.190
 then it's all and here we tighten the bolt 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:49.950
 also 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:53.060
 then the plug is inserted and the principle 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.040
 thank you all for watching 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.459
 subscribe to my channel put like 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.459
 until
