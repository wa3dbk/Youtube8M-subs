00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it back you're going to start twisting

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.800 
it back you're going to start twisting
around<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.200> around<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.840> around

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.200 

ok

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
you see how that looks now if you look

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.889 
you see how that looks now if you look
real<00:00:59.170> close<00:00:59.200> here<00:01:00.030> you've<00:01:01.030> got<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.390> ad<00:01:01.660> that

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
real close here you've got this ad that

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.720 
real close here you've got this ad that
can<00:01:02.020> slip<00:01:02.290> through<00:01:02.320> that<00:01:02.590> little<00:01:02.920> loop<00:01:03.190> okay

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
can slip through that little loop okay

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.090 
can slip through that little loop okay
so<00:01:04.150> you<00:01:04.210> flipped<00:01:05.170> over<00:01:05.409> this<00:01:05.650> way<00:01:05.860> we<00:01:05.979> went

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
so you flipped over this way we went

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.130 
so you flipped over this way we went
around<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.460> run<00:01:06.610> around<00:01:06.700> now<00:01:07.630> when<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.900> draw

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
around and run around now when you draw

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.760 
around and run around now when you draw
it<00:01:08.320> up<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:10.240> these<00:01:10.540> turns<00:01:10.900> in<00:01:11.140> here<00:01:11.409> is<00:01:11.560> what's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
it up all these turns in here is what's

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.109 
it up all these turns in here is what's
going<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:11.979> create<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.340> friction<00:01:12.729> on<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.850> log

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
going to create the friction on the log

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.340 
going to create the friction on the log
and<00:01:13.330> help<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:13.600> pull<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:14.130> okay<00:01:15.130> now<00:01:16.090> this<00:01:17.050> is<00:01:17.320> a

and help you pull it okay now this is a

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.469 
and help you pull it okay now this is a
timber<00:01:17.890> hitch<00:01:18.100> okay<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.790> not<00:01:19.030> have<00:01:19.240> done

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
timber hitch okay that not have done

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.690 
timber hitch okay that not have done
what<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:20.229> do<00:01:20.290> is<00:01:20.710> I'll<00:01:21.509> put<00:01:22.509> this<00:01:23.399> rope<00:01:24.399> like

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
what I do is I'll put this rope like

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.389 
what I do is I'll put this rope like
this<00:01:25.000> now<00:01:25.659> if<00:01:25.990> they<00:01:26.200> drag<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.740> unable<00:01:27.369> to

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
this now if they drag it unable to

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.160 
this now if they drag it unable to
control<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.119> much<00:01:28.390> better<00:01:28.630> as<00:01:28.869> I<00:01:28.899> go<00:01:28.990> through

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
control it much better as I go through

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.749 
control it much better as I go through
the<00:01:29.470> woods<00:01:29.679> and<00:01:29.860> stuff<00:01:30.070> especially<00:01:30.280> if<00:01:30.640> you're
