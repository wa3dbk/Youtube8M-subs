00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.950
 the changes that characterized the channel in 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.990
 his day that we got to know videos 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.750

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.120
 I needed a short video today because the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.159
 because if God rest on the seventh day 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.110

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.420
 short and so fast on a map where 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.430
 normally you should not go with your 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.740
 rifle but rubÃ©n is how is it that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.090

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 the defense of the modern has changed 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.950
 warfare 3 to white whistles so nothing 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.840
 the video is ending we said goodbye 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.700
 for those who do not know what is the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.080
 modern warfare is that the maps are not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.940
 Well here I leave the explosion because 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 this is how they were treated from the modern 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.560
 warfare 3 to nuclear bombs not like 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.050
