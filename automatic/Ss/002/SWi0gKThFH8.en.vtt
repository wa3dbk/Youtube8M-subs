00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.020 
with wooden blocks then with guidance
from<00:01:55.380> Ford<00:01:55.740> engineers<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.640> set<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> work

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
from Ford engineers they set to work

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
from Ford engineers they set to work
with<00:01:57.180> powerful<00:01:57.780> hydraulic<00:01:58.290> steel<00:01:58.560> jaw

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
with powerful hydraulic steel jaw

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.430 
with powerful hydraulic steel jaw
cutters<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.490> spreaders<00:02:00.140> they<00:02:01.140> were<00:02:01.200> very

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
cutters and spreaders they were very

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.870 
cutters and spreaders they were very
surprised<00:02:01.830> how<00:02:01.860> strong<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.490> door<00:02:02.670> actually

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
surprised how strong the door actually

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.899 
surprised how strong the door actually
is<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> took<00:02:03.690> them<00:02:03.869> some<00:02:04.080> time<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.909> remove

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
is so it took them some time to remove

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.089 
is so it took them some time to remove
the<00:02:06.150> door<00:02:06.299> from<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.690> vehicle<00:02:07.110> arm<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:08.039> were

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the door from the vehicle arm they were

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.430 
the door from the vehicle arm they were
interested<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.810> new<00:02:09.989> locking

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
interested to see the new locking

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.039 
interested to see the new locking
mechanism<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.760> are<00:02:11.879> very<00:02:12.090> keen<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> get

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
mechanism so they are very keen to get

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.170 
mechanism so they are very keen to get
access<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.379> latest<00:02:13.830> technologies<00:02:14.459> because

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
access to latest technologies because

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.309 
access to latest technologies because
obviously<00:02:15.420> sooner<00:02:15.810> or<00:02:15.870> later<00:02:15.930> they're<00:02:16.200> going

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
obviously sooner or later they're going

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.780 
obviously sooner or later they're going
to<00:02:16.409> see<00:02:16.560> these<00:02:16.739> vehicles<00:02:16.889> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> road<00:02:17.579> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to see these vehicles on the road and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.970 
to see these vehicles on the road and
then<00:02:18.450> need<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.079> know<00:02:19.200> upfront<00:02:19.409> how<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
then need to know upfront how to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.300 
then need to know upfront how to
approach<00:02:20.370> them<00:02:20.639> form<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.689> team<00:02:21.870> that's<00:02:22.200> very

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
approach them form a team that's very

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.059 
approach them form a team that's very
very<00:02:23.310> difficult<00:02:23.639> but<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.359> it's<00:02:25.079> a<00:02:25.290> very

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
very difficult but it's it's a very

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.440 
very difficult but it's it's a very
interesting<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:27.329> learn<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:29.040> new<00:02:29.450> rescue

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
interesting to learn a new rescue

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.569 
interesting to learn a new rescue
technology<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:31.349> it's<00:02:31.590> very<00:02:31.859> important<00:02:32.340> to

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
technology and it's very important to

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.580 
technology and it's very important to
discuss<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> engineers<00:02:34.170> family

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
discuss this with the engineers family

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.039 
discuss this with the engineers family
from<00:02:34.859> Ford<00:02:35.219> it's<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.419> first<00:02:36.599> time<00:02:36.719> four

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
from Ford it's not the first time four

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.869 
from Ford it's not the first time four
is<00:02:37.200> donated<00:02:37.590> vehicles<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.189> fire<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.549> rescue

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
is donated vehicles to fire and rescue

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.909 
is donated vehicles to fire and rescue
crews<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.599> practice<00:02:39.959> extraction<00:02:40.499> techniques

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
crews to practice extraction techniques

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.479 
crews to practice extraction techniques
and<00:02:41.159> more<00:02:41.639> planned<00:02:41.999> for<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.239> future<00:02:43.279> we<00:02:44.279> have

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
and more planned for the future we have

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.940 
and more planned for the future we have
done<00:02:44.790> several<00:02:45.260> trials<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.499> past<00:02:46.739> we've

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
done several trials in the past we've

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.039 
done several trials in the past we've
done<00:02:46.980> one<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.400> earth<00:02:47.639> or<00:02:47.849> two<00:02:48.029> on<00:02:48.180> SMX<00:02:48.569> actually

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
done one on earth or two on SMX actually

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.019 
done one on earth or two on SMX actually
I<00:02:49.230> think<00:02:49.620> we've<00:02:49.950> done<00:02:50.099> one<00:02:50.279> on<00:02:50.310> fiestas<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:50.849> we

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:51.029 
I think we've done one on fiestas and we

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.080 
I think we've done one on fiestas and we
plan<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:52.409> future<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.129> additional<00:02:53.760> ones

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
plan the future to be additional ones

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.599 
plan the future to be additional ones
here<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.840> mönchengladbach<00:02:55.650> or<00:02:56.279> and<00:02:56.459> other

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
here in mönchengladbach or and other

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:06.620 
here in mönchengladbach or and other
fire<00:02:56.909> brigade
