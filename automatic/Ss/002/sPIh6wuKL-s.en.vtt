00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the baby version of this phone but

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.380 
the baby version of this phone but
really<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.370> biggest<00:03:11.670> difference<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.360> that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
really the biggest difference is that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.150 
really the biggest difference is that
the<00:03:12.660> Voyager<00:03:13.080> has<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.440> awesome<00:03:13.769> flip<00:03:13.980> up

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.449 
the Voyager has the awesome flip up
keyboard<00:03:14.190> thing<00:03:14.790> right<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:17.040> one<00:03:17.220> I

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
keyboard thing right and this one I

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.830 
keyboard thing right and this one I
think<00:03:17.519> takes<00:03:17.880> better<00:03:18.090> pictures<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:18.660> other

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
think takes better pictures but other

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.330 
think takes better pictures but other
than<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.140> there's<00:03:19.860> not<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.130> much

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
than that there's not that much

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.130 
than that there's not that much
difference<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:20.790> if<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:20.940> want<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.180> save<00:03:21.360> 150

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
difference so if you want to save 150

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.289 
difference so if you want to save 150
