the surface causing it to blur this is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.690 
the surface causing it to blur this is
the<00:02:51.900> door<00:02:52.400> zooming<00:02:53.400> closer<00:02:54.650> okay<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:56.190> blur

of the structure of this rock and

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.449 
of the structure of this rock and
possibly<00:04:00.629> a<00:04:00.720> cave<00:04:01.079> next<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.069> entrance

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
possibly a cave next to this entrance

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.869 
possibly a cave next to this entrance
here<00:04:02.810> looks<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:03.959> possible<00:04:04.590> cave<00:04:04.859> going<00:04:05.220> this

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
here looks like possible cave going this

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.640 
here looks like possible cave going this
direction<00:04:07.519> but<00:04:08.519> look<00:04:09.090> at<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.650> sudden

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
direction but look at this a sudden

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.059 
direction but look at this a sudden
automatic<00:04:11.720> distortion<00:04:12.720> right<00:04:13.079> here<00:04:13.560> it's

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
automatic distortion right here it's

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.000 
automatic distortion right here it's
huge<00:04:14.669> and<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.810> was<00:04:15.959> not<00:04:16.410> caused<00:04:16.739> by<00:04:16.919> the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
huge and it was not caused by the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.729 
huge and it was not caused by the
satellite<00:04:17.579> but<00:04:17.880> caused<00:04:18.090> by<00:04:18.329> something<00:04:18.739> under

the ground in the volcano

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.459 
the ground in the volcano
it<00:04:23.039> looks<00:04:23.370> like<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.789> entrance<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.900> volcano

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
it looks like the entrance to volcano

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:26.660 
it looks like the entrance to volcano
which<00:04:25.710> everyone<00:04:26.130> always

going into inside cone they always said

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.770 
going into inside cone they always said
the<00:04:32.160> entrance<00:04:32.550> is<00:04:32.730> somewhere<00:04:33.090> along<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.570> side

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
the entrance is somewhere along the side

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.210 
the entrance is somewhere along the side

of the mountain they always saw the UFO
coming<00:04:35.700> from<00:04:35.790> this<00:04:35.970> side<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.540> mountain

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
coming from this side of the mountain

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.900 
coming from this side of the mountain
well<00:04:37.470> that's<00:04:37.710> what<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:39.350> this<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:41.010> side

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
well that's what this is this is a side

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.270 
well that's what this is this is a side
of<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.240> mountain<00:04:42.390> right<00:04:42.870> here<00:04:43.100> zoom<00:04:44.100> out

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
of the mountain right here zoom out

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.460 
of the mountain right here zoom out
again<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.820> can<00:04:44.940> see<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.240> see<00:04:45.960> this<00:04:46.110> is<00:04:46.320> the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
side this is the inside the center this

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.840 
side this is the inside the center this
is<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.190> side

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
is the side
