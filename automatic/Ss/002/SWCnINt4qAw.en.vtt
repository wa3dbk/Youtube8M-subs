00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and if you have a zoom lens like this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.250 
and if you have a zoom lens like this
get<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> position<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.220> want<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.260> then

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
get it to the position you want and then

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.430 
get it to the position you want and then
just<00:02:13.500> check<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.580> make<00:02:14.730> sure<00:02:15.440> that

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
just check it just to make sure that

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.440 
just check it just to make sure that
it's<00:02:16.620> not<00:02:16.769> gonna<00:02:16.950> hit<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.370> glass<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:18.090> I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
it's not gonna hit the glass there I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.160 
it's not gonna hit the glass there I
think<00:02:18.810> that's<00:02:18.959> gonna<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.200> good<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.959> all

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
think that's gonna be good so that all

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.500 
think that's gonna be good so that all
set<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.650> we're<00:02:23.220> gonna<00:02:23.310> wrap<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.879> around<00:02:23.940> here

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
set up we're gonna wrap this around here

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.640 
set up we're gonna wrap this around here
and<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.690> reason<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:25.019> using<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:25.500> is

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and the reason I'm using this this is

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.869 
and the reason I'm using this this is
just<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.370> want<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> be<00:02:26.849> a

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
just because I just want to be a

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.570 
just because I just want to be a
temporary<00:02:27.209> setup<00:02:28.040> we're<00:02:29.040> gonna<00:02:29.129> wrap<00:02:29.370> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
temporary setup we're gonna wrap that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.550 
temporary setup we're gonna wrap that
like<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.269> could<00:02:33.540> use<00:02:33.780> tape<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.500> if

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
like so and you could use tape here if

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.050 
like so and you could use tape here if
you<00:02:34.650> wanted<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.519> nice<00:02:35.760> because<00:02:35.970> it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
you wanted but this is nice because it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.650 
you wanted but this is nice because it
gives<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.420> little<00:02:36.510> bit

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
gives a little bit

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.310 
gives a little bit
wrap<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.440> here<00:02:38.680> like<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:40.170> check<00:02:41.170> your

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
wrap it on here like that check your

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.380 
wrap it on here like that check your
positioning<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.520> can<00:02:42.670> adjust<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.240> end

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
positioning and you can adjust the end

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.030 
positioning and you can adjust the end
here<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.780> gives<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:44.140> little<00:02:44.260> bit<00:02:44.470> as<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.890> see

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
here it gives a little bit as you see

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.810 
here it gives a little bit as you see
just<00:02:48.040> kind<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.370> moves<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.730> little<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:51.670> as

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
just kind of moves a little bit as

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.600 
just kind of moves a little bit as
centered<00:02:52.150> as<00:02:52.240> possible<00:02:53.340> when<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.430> like

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
centered as possible when you like

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.450 
centered as possible when you like
everything<00:02:55.090> that's<00:02:55.240> set<00:02:55.450> up<00:02:55.480> grab<00:02:56.320> your<00:02:56.350> tape

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.000 

you'll<00:03:00.460> need<00:03:00.610> some<00:03:00.760> tape<00:03:01.560> gaffers<00:03:02.560> tape<00:03:02.740> is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
you'll need some tape gaffers tape is

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.500 
you'll need some tape gaffers tape is
probably<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.340> best<00:03:03.520> choice<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.150> just<00:03:04.360> got

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
probably the best choice but I just got

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.090 
probably the best choice but I just got
some<00:03:04.660> scotch<00:03:04.900> tape<00:03:05.200> here<00:03:06.540> wrap<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.950> now

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
some scotch tape here wrap it so now

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.400 
some scotch tape here wrap it so now
it's<00:03:09.250> secure<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.350> we<00:03:11.350> are<00:03:11.530> ready<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.490> go<00:03:13.410> we're

shootin fish eyed baby whoo this 200

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.550 
shootin fish eyed baby whoo this 200
degree<00:03:18.970> actually<00:03:19.480> has<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.810> best<00:03:20.080> look<00:03:20.350> I

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
degree actually has the best look I

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.400 
degree actually has the best look I
think<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.890> my<00:03:21.010> opinion<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.410> 160

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
think in my opinion this is the 160

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.640 
think in my opinion this is the 160
degree<00:03:23.740> lens<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:26.110> gives<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.350> little<00:03:26.530> bit

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
degree lens and it gives a little bit

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.130 
degree lens and it gives a little bit
different<00:03:26.980> look<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.310> little<00:03:27.490> less<00:03:27.790> ball<00:03:28.630> G<00:03:28.960> as

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
different look a little less ball G as

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.710 
different look a little less ball G as
you<00:03:29.470> can<00:03:29.620> see<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:31.090> in<00:03:31.240> case<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.570> were<00:03:31.690> curious

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
you can see but in case you were curious

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.210 
you can see but in case you were curious
what<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.320> looked<00:03:32.710> like

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
what that looked like

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.480 
what that looked like
there<00:03:33.550> it<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:34.350> 160<00:03:35.350> degree<00:03:35.620> wide<00:03:35.890> angle<00:03:35.920> fish

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
there it is 160 degree wide angle fish

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.810 
there it is 160 degree wide angle fish
Outlands<00:03:38.010> let's<00:03:39.010> do<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.130> little<00:03:39.250> side<00:03:39.460> by<00:03:39.610> side

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
Outlands let's do a little side by side

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:48.710 
Outlands let's do a little side by side
just<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.120> see<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.360> difference

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.270 

it's<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.710> not<00:03:49.890> fisheye<00:03:50.460> enough<00:03:50.940> for<00:03:51.240> me

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.720 

there<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.370> go

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
there you go

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.950 
there you go
that's<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.450> same<00:03:57.660> way<00:04:02.510> alright<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.720> there<00:04:03.870> you

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
that's the same way alright so there you

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.930 
that's the same way alright so there you
go<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.290> quick<00:04:04.500> effects<00:04:04.800> style<00:04:05.130> fisheye<00:04:05.610> lens

go the quick effects style fisheye lens
there's<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.510> bunch<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.990> different<00:04:07.290> ways<00:04:07.380> you

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
there's a bunch of different ways you

can<00:04:07.710> do<00:04:07.890> this<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.520> is<00:04:08.580> just<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.970> quick

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
can do this this is just the quick

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.600 
can do this this is just the quick
effect<00:04:09.510> style<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.080> of<00:04:10.860> course<00:04:11.130> we<00:04:11.310> tried<00:04:11.520> it

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
effect style and of course we tried it

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.460

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
on the DSLR didn't quite work the way I

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.770 
on the DSLR didn't quite work the way I
wanted<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:13.920> just<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> way<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.030> setup<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.540> and

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
wanted to just the way the setup is and

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.060 
wanted to just the way the setup is and
it<00:04:15.840> just<00:04:16.019> kind<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.260> made<00:04:16.410> me<00:04:16.500> nervous<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.980> way

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
it just kind of made me nervous the way

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.820 
it just kind of made me nervous the way
that<00:04:17.310> fisheye<00:04:18.180> lens<00:04:18.540> thing<00:04:18.930> kind<00:04:19.140> of<00:04:19.200> pushes

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
that fisheye lens thing kind of pushes

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.650 
that fisheye lens thing kind of pushes
back<00:04:19.980> towards<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.519> glass<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:21.090> just<00:04:21.270> didn't

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
back towards the glass it just didn't

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
back towards the glass it just didn't
really<00:04:21.720> feel<00:04:21.870> comfortable<00:04:22.110> it<00:04:22.410> seems<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.650> work

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
really feel comfortable it seems to work

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.160 
really feel comfortable it seems to work
the<00:04:22.860> best<00:04:22.890> on<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:24.000> setup<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.540> of<00:04:24.810> course<00:04:25.020> is

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
the best on this setup and of course is

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.470 
the best on this setup and of course is
temporary<00:04:25.620> which<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.340> perfect<00:04:26.820> let's<00:04:27.360> see<00:04:27.420> how

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
temporary which is perfect let's see how

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.850 
temporary which is perfect let's see how
fast<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.840> actually<00:04:28.230> takes<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.530> make<00:04:28.680> this

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
fast this actually takes to make this

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.170 
fast this actually takes to make this
