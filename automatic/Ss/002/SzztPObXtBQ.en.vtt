00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hello friends this is moment circle here

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.269 
hello friends this is moment circle here
and<00:00:03.720> in<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.140> tutorial<00:00:04.290> series<00:00:04.620> I'll<00:00:05.130> be

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
and in this tutorial series I'll be

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.639 
and in this tutorial series I'll be
showing<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.509> can<00:00:06.629> design<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.410> soap

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
showing you how you can design a soap

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.930 
showing you how you can design a soap
cover<00:00:07.950> which<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.460> can<00:00:08.670> see<00:00:09.000> right<00:00:09.330> here<00:00:10.940> by

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
cover which you can see right here by

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.780 
cover which you can see right here by
using<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.570> drawings<00:00:12.990> here<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.670> the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
using the drawings here so this is the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.660 
using the drawings here so this is the
second<00:00:15.120> part<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.660> tutorial<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.550> let<00:00:17.550> me

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
second part of our tutorial and let me

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.349 
second part of our tutorial and let me
switch<00:00:17.880> back<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.420> assualt<00:00:18.779> cover<00:00:19.050> study

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
switch back to the assualt cover study

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.470 
switch back to the assualt cover study
work<00:00:21.359> file<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.439> Slavia<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> next

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
work file and the Slavia now the next

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.200 
work file and the Slavia now the next
thing<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.230> need<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.490> create

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
thing what you need to do is to create

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.890 
thing what you need to do is to create
this<00:00:27.480> particular<00:00:27.840> pattern<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.900> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
this particular pattern here so you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.500 
this particular pattern here so you
could<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.590> by<00:00:31.920> selecting<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:33.210> plane

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
could do that by selecting this plane

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.500 
could do that by selecting this plane
right<00:00:33.540> here<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.440> go<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> sketch<00:00:35.130> and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
right here and go for the sketch and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
right here and go for the sketch and
without<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.750> particular<00:00:37.290> view<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:37.770> here

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
without this particular view right here

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.369 
without this particular view right here
now<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:42.829> create<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.100> surfer

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.370

point<00:01:25.100> right<00:01:25.340> here<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:26.210> make<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.050> equidistant

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
point right here and make it equidistant

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.850 
point right here and make it equidistant
point<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:29.150> now<00:01:29.450> there<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:29.960> small<00:01:30.260> thing

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
point and now there is a small thing

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.360 
point and now there is a small thing
what<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.160> can<00:01:31.340> do<00:01:31.900> is<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.290> select<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.770> circle

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
what you can do is to select the circle

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:43.000 
what you can do is to select the circle
at<00:01:34.760> this<00:01:35.000> point<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:37.150> select

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:52.570 

these<00:01:46.000> go<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:51.070> Phil<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.190> can<00:01:52.400> believe

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
these go for Phil you can believe

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.380 
these go for Phil you can believe
aloofness<00:01:53.590> incidence<00:01:55.600> ctrl-c<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.630> ctrl-v

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
aloofness incidence ctrl-c and ctrl-v

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
aloofness incidence ctrl-c and ctrl-v
and<00:01:59.390> just<00:01:59.980> drag<00:02:00.980> it<00:02:01.250> out

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.170 

and<00:02:05.370> place<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.920> again<00:02:07.920> give<00:02:08.310> control

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
and place it here and again give control

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.330 
and place it here and again give control
we<00:02:10.370> drag<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.790> place<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.950> or<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.130> can

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
we drag it and place it here or you can

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.570 
we drag it and place it here or you can
do<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.730> use<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.940> dimension<00:02:15.300> tool<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:17.460> you

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
do is use the dimension tool and you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.050 
do is use the dimension tool and you
just<00:02:19.040> give<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.070> tangency<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:21.890> can<00:02:22.890> use<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.640> same

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
just give a tangency I can use the same

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.930 
just give a tangency I can use the same
technique<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.890> give<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.100> tangency<00:02:26.690> again<00:02:28.940> you

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
technique and give a tangency again you

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.000 
technique and give a tangency again you
have<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> radius<00:02:30.570> 25<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.460> can<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:34.010> give

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
have a radius 25 so you can just give

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.050 
have a radius 25 so you can just give
radius<00:02:37.220> 25<00:02:39.890> now<00:02:40.890> what<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.370> do<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.760> select

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
radius 25 now what you can do is select

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.640 
radius 25 now what you can do is select
the<00:02:42.450> radius<00:02:44.540> select<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.720> radius<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the radius select the radius and the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.990 
the radius select the radius and the
surfer<00:02:47.310> control-c<00:02:48.300> control-v<00:02:49.490> place<00:02:50.490> for<00:02:50.760> now

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
surfer control-c control-v place for now

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.050 
surfer control-c control-v place for now
already<00:02:51.210> along<00:02:51.810> your<00:02:52.050> circle<00:02:52.410> over<00:02:52.560> there<00:02:52.770> I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
already along your circle over there I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.510 
already along your circle over there I
can<00:02:54.060> use<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:55.320> tangency<00:02:56.040> command<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.950> make<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
can use the tangency command to make the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.800 
can use the tangency command to make the
tangency<00:03:01.400> for<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> circle<00:03:02.940> also

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:18.900 

one<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:07.069> two<00:03:09.280> all<00:03:10.280> right<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:16.310> one<00:03:17.500> okay<00:03:18.500> now

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
one and two all right this one okay now

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.740 
one and two all right this one okay now
what<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.150> do<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:22.090> create<00:03:23.090> an<00:03:23.239> axis<00:03:23.690> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
what you can do is create an axis and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.680 
what you can do is create an axis and
make<00:03:26.750> sure<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.290> this<00:03:27.680> circle<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:28.970> axis

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
make sure that this circle and this axis

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.190 
make sure that this circle and this axis
are<00:03:30.230> tangent<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.569> we<00:03:32.569> need<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.620> more<00:03:33.650> axis

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
are tangent and we need one more axis

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.509 
are tangent and we need one more axis
which<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.650> right<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:39.560> hope<00:03:39.739> I'm<00:03:40.130> not

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
which is right here and I hope I'm not

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:47.980 
which is right here and I hope I'm not
going<00:03:40.850> fast

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.250 

so

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.680 

we're<00:03:51.800> all<00:03:51.890> turned<00:03:52.190> out<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.819> guess<00:03:53.569> what<00:03:55.690> use

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
we're all turned out and guess what use

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.630 
we're all turned out and guess what use
the<00:03:56.989> arrow<00:03:57.230> key<00:03:58.300> and<00:03:59.300> take<00:03:59.660> all<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.640> small
