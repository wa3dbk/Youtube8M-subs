00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.470 
that enough so once again here I'm
guessing<00:02:02.440> fastball<00:02:02.830> it's<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.610> little<00:02:03.820> high<00:02:04.120> and

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
guessing fastball it's a little high and

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.860 
guessing fastball it's a little high and
I<00:02:04.690> take<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.380> opposite<00:02:06.100> field<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.880> that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
I take it to the opposite field and that

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.660 
I take it to the opposite field and that
ball<00:02:07.930> will<00:02:08.320> sail<00:02:08.560> out<00:02:08.770> of<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.950> ballpark<00:02:09.190> for

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
ball will sail out of the ballpark for

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.540 
ball will sail out of the ballpark for
my<00:02:09.790> third<00:02:10.119> home<00:02:10.420> run<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.080> season<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.800> get<00:02:12.070> 38

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
my third home run of the season I get 38

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.010 
my third home run of the season I get 38
points<00:02:12.910> there<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:16.360> will<00:02:16.540> see<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> little

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
points there and you will see a little

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.460 
points there and you will see a little
instant<00:02:17.380> replay<00:02:17.890> here<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.400> was<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.580> pretty

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
could to the opposite field not the best

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.270 
could to the opposite field not the best
place<00:02:25.150> for<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> ball<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.470> be<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.890> go<00:02:27.010> out<00:02:27.250> there

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
place for the ball to be to go out there

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.560

and<00:03:55.300> my<00:03:55.390> stats<00:03:55.750> later<00:03:56.050> on<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.470> game<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:57.160> I

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
and my stats later on in the game so I

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.540

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
believe this was the next day and I

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.750 
believe this was the next day and I
crush<00:04:01.300> line<00:04:01.600> two<00:04:02.320> opposite<00:04:02.890> field<00:04:02.950> again<00:04:03.519> that

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.569 
is just my favorite part of the ballpark
and<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.510> will<00:04:07.780> end<00:04:07.989> up<00:04:08.200> she'll<00:04:09.010> get<00:04:09.160> around<00:04:09.400> the

and I will end up she'll get around the

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.559 
and I will end up she'll get around the
third<00:04:09.820> base

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
third base

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.709 
third base

I do get two RBIs there but I have

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.340 
I do get two RBIs there but I have
sustained<00:04:17.829> an<00:04:18.070> injury<00:04:18.190> an<00:04:18.699> ACL<00:04:19.329> sprain<00:04:19.690> but<00:04:20.289> i

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
sustained an injury an ACL sprain but i

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.740 
sustained an injury an ACL sprain but i
will<00:04:20.709> play<00:04:21.070> through<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.519> injury<00:04:21.600> but<00:04:22.600> my

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
will play through the injury but my

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.150 
will play through the injury but my
training<00:04:23.350> will<00:04:23.500> all<00:04:23.740> stop<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.789> all<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.210> my

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
training will all stop and all of my

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.430 
training will all stop and all of my
basically<00:04:27.160> my<00:04:27.509> advancement<00:04:28.509> goers<00:04:28.870> will<00:04:29.169> stop

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
basically my advancement goers will stop

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.320 
basically my advancement goers will stop
until<00:04:29.800> i'm<00:04:29.889> fully<00:04:30.190> recover<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.759> ground<00:04:31.000> first

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
until i'm fully recover the ground first

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.930 
until i'm fully recover the ground first
so<00:04:31.870> while<00:04:32.080> that's<00:04:32.259> going<00:04:32.380> on<00:04:32.710> i<00:04:33.009> guess<00:04:33.639> i<00:04:33.759> can

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
so while that's going on i guess i can

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.570 
so while that's going on i guess i can
beef<00:04:34.150> up<00:04:34.330> my<00:04:34.389> 15-day<00:04:35.199> i<00:04:35.229> get<00:04:35.590> i<00:04:35.620> get<00:04:36.070> basically

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580
