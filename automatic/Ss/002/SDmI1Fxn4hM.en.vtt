00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.830
 happy birthday 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.420
 I am very happy that the cake has 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:27.390
 this drawing because a year and a half ago 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 this gentleman called me and told me you are the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.059
 you have to direct this and we've already 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.469
 been a book currando elbow to elbow and 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.820
 that all this has been done so that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.370
 we are here and we can do 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.190
 this movie that really my blood my 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.239
 strength and all my desire in the middle and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.239
 share it with you is released 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.080
 we can talk about the project and little to 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.170
 little was lengthening the night we spent 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.670
 from a bar to another bar and we take the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.520
 distension of trying to play us a 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.440
 football game and we wanted to do 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.700
 union from the start the producer and I 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.080
 we made a union from the beginning of 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.629
 us against some guys who were 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.720
 there playing I think we beat them by 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.280
 force and the other two like the plan very 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.190
 aggressive came included one euro 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.369
 to get the revenge the zani caught 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.140
 the euro went to the uncle's face and he 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.830
 put a centimeter and said you have the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.900
 revenge and swallowed the euro 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.670
 is that at that time I asked if this 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.010
 It was the director that we wanted with whom 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.540
 we wanted to make this movie because the 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.280
 truth is that it was indeed up to date 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.890
 next I called him and said I think that 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.450
 you get the director for this movie and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.120
 I remember your call the next day 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.000
 Much to say, let's go back to see Santiago 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.370
 I understand perfectly how you are 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.050
 but we are going to tell you that here 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.470
 we work in this way we like 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.530
 very much your mistral and dad but but to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.100
 museum that you have some revolutions that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.490
 brothers I know that they live in 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.260
 first person juliÃ¡n is the one of some 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.820
 way the change he has to make 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.590
 to separate from the group what is 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.030
 suppose it has to be to start 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.950
 be alone but each of the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.180
 characters from the movie just like each 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.100
 one of the people that we are 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.950
 working on this movie we had a 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.180
 pain a tare an anger an anger and 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.500
 throughout the process of this movie 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.030
 Well, I think we've all left 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.980
 doing better and to go making you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.240
 better then you have to one day get upset 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.560
 one day you have to face yourself 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.790
 same normal 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.519
 then there is one thing that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.900
 santiago santiago wants us to be 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.659
 all day 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.670
 I constantly had them very many 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.799
 tension did not boar they were left 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.319
 talk to each other and listen to them all 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.060
 the time and when you want to descend from 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.709
 suddenly you look over there and you see that 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.510
 is with the helmets and looking at you 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.510
 fixedly and says listening 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:51.690
 your intensity level are not 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.540
 that suddenly you are like that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.540
 Disappear while I do not tell you anything 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.370
 because that's what he has to say 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.980
 have in your mother 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.690
 and I'll tell you a simple thing for 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.019
 that you see that you are not in shape where 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.019
 there are others 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.140
 animals then get in shape 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.670
 trunk you want me to look for boards 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.250
 rivals what I want is to get in 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.730
 way and make it something a little more east 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.430
 to the system to stop working 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.620
 all at a very high level then well 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.269
 generates a lot of friction but also 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.569
 in front of the camera generates a lot 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.569
 true 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.580
 at times 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.500
 that leads you to discuss because we have 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:46.950
 had tremendous tremendous battles 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.570
 moments because here we are all many 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.950
 granites in the same pen and is a 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.660
 method that you like celebration of 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.510
 intentions and we give it life will come out all 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.580
 a bit better 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.060
 on the floor we lower it and we do it 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.940
 all the children 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.130
 house a moment that the boys the 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.520
 way of looking at what they had was that 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.480
 way of looking at those guys that a 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.370
 Once when I was little I 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.020
 they chased once in the subway and that 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.550
 It is an image that I have and that I will have 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.709
 for the rest of my life and that really 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.040
 I was terrified suddenly when those 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.900
 guys not when my actors do 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.829
 of skin people soon look at you with those 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.829
 eyes of you 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.610
 or not 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.180
 it seems good to me 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.180
 good 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.580
 until we are enjoying ourselves a lot 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.890
 Of course they have been all the time about a 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.690
 loose rope and so much time on a 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.970
 tightrope because sometimes you explode 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.130
 realize that they have come out of their breastplate 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.500
 they have left themselves and when a 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.660
 actor is in the moving waters and already 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.090
 does not know where to go that moment where 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.870
 they go to the director first to criticize him already 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.480
 Tell him 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.330
 but then undoubtedly to say host 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.620
 and now let me where in Santiago 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.630
 it's the first time I worked with 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.920
 actors their first movie 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.220
 works with people from the street 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.920
 so it's a matter of how 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.200
 adjust to find a common language and 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.910
 the fund because we talk about the same and 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.620
 moment that everything I wanted 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.009
 to make like a shout a ritual tell me 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.749
 power in the photos 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.819
 the fund was a director that the end of 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:31.830
 week I was excited I was half 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:34.059
 crazy and he was at home 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.889
 putting a lot more energy and 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.779
 a lot more force the movie that 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.909
 this club movie put me out and 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.979
 visceral and the truth is that sometimes with 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:45.309
 the word we could not hear it because 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.409
 we are all equally excited not to 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:49.210
 make this movie that sometimes looks a 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.249
 image is worth more than a thousand words and 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.979
 four cuts of a warrior and pay 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:56.860
 before him today then risky is for 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.770
 Of course you are a little bit hurt 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.719
 sure now that what you leave to 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.189
 viewer is a point of your soul the 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.319
 tourist reality and your heart and 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:08.770
 movies have 100 years of life then 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:11.199
 then also it is also 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.879
 risky surfing not me I know 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.349
 with a wave of 30 meters but you will have to 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.180
 tell the surfer if he has a good time or 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:21.190
 I do not recognize 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.190
 right so I'm not going to take it back
