00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
make the cut really low so there's kind

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.810 
make the cut really low so there's kind
of<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> wide<00:00:32.850> armhole<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:34.050> both<00:00:34.620> sides<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.700> we

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
of a wide armhole on both sides so we

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.430 
of a wide armhole on both sides so we
want<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.090> make<00:00:36.210> our<00:00:36.360> cut<00:00:36.600> closer<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.320> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
want to make our cut closer to this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
want to make our cut closer to this
opening<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.250> rather<00:00:38.550> than<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
opening here rather than to the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119 
opening here rather than to the
shoulders<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> make<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> too

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
shoulders because if you make it too

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.500 
shoulders because if you make it too
wide<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> slip<00:00:42.300> off<00:00:42.450> your

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
wide it's just going to slip off your

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.779 
wide it's just going to slip off your
shoulders<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:44.040> I'm<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> I'm

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
shoulders so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150 
shoulders so what I'm going to do is I'm
basically<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> start<00:00:46.440> cutting<00:00:46.649> here

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
basically going to start cutting here

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.819 
basically going to start cutting here
and<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> way<00:00:47.820> down<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> same<00:00:49.620> on

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and all the way down and do the same on

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
and all the way down and do the same on
the<00:00:49.920> other<00:00:50.070> side<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> be

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the other side now if you want to be

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.750 
the other side now if you want to be
more<00:00:51.960> precise<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:52.890> go<00:00:53.160> ahead<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.550> mark

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
more precise you can go ahead and mark

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.260 
more precise you can go ahead and mark
it<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.690> chalk<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.520> something<00:00:56.520> washable

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
it with some chalk or something washable

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.200 
it with some chalk or something washable
but<00:00:57.960> I'm<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.670> ahead<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.030> cut

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
but I'm just going to go ahead and cut

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
but I'm just going to go ahead and cut
it<00:01:00.239> I'm<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.660> start<00:01:00.960> right<00:01:01.620> over<00:01:02.010> here

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it I'm going to start right over here

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:14.160 
it I'm going to start right over here
and<00:01:03.420> go<00:01:03.840> ahead<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.409> cut<00:01:04.830> down

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.690 

now<00:01:14.500> I'm<00:01:14.590> going<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.770> do<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.010> other<00:01:15.130> side<00:01:15.430> and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
now I'm going to do the other side and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.340 
now I'm going to do the other side and
you<00:01:16.030> want<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.240> make<00:01:16.360> sure<00:01:16.630> that<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:18.130> going<00:01:18.460> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you want to make sure that it's going to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.219 
you want to make sure that it's going to
go<00:01:20.350> like<00:01:20.560> that

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
go like that

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.580 
go like that
so<00:01:23.229> here<00:01:23.740> we<00:01:23.830> go<00:01:24.040> just<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:26.170> just<00:01:26.409> going<00:01:26.560> to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
so here we go just I'm just going to

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.180 
so here we go just I'm just going to
guesstimate<00:01:27.300> about<00:01:28.300> how<00:01:29.020> much<00:01:29.320> or<00:01:29.740> where<00:01:30.040> to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
guesstimate about how much or where to

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.370 
guesstimate about how much or where to
cut<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.360> want<00:01:31.509> it<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.630> be<00:01:31.810> relatively

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
cut and you want it to be relatively

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.250 
cut and you want it to be relatively
even<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.750> I'm<00:01:34.810> going<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.020> go<00:01:35.140> ahead<00:01:35.280> here

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.470 

so<00:01:42.160> before<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.550> finish<00:01:42.880> cutting<00:01:43.090> I'm<00:01:43.300> just

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
so before I finish cutting I'm just

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.060 
so before I finish cutting I'm just
going<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.780> go<00:01:44.290> ahead<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.740> draw<00:01:44.860> an<00:01:45.010> imaginary

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
going to go ahead and draw an imaginary

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.320 
going to go ahead and draw an imaginary
line<00:01:45.640> just<00:01:46.240> make<00:01:46.540> sure<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.580> can<00:01:48.760> get<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.180> as

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
line just make sure that I can get it as

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.090 
line just make sure that I can get it as
even<00:01:49.540> as<00:01:49.840> possible<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.530> again<00:01:50.740> like<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.040> said

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
even as possible and again like I said

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.040 
even as possible and again like I said
earlier<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:51.790> can<00:01:51.820> go<00:01:52.090> ahead<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.540> measure<00:01:52.720> it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
earlier you can go ahead and measure it

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.410 
earlier you can go ahead and measure it
and<00:01:53.230> Mark<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.190> shirt<00:01:54.430> prior<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.970> cutting<00:01:55.270> if

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
and Mark the shirt prior to cutting if

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.730 
and Mark the shirt prior to cutting if
you<00:01:55.480> want<00:01:55.660> to<00:01:55.720> be<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.810> little<00:01:56.020> bit<00:01:56.140> more<00:01:56.320> precise

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
you want to be a little bit more precise

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.310 
you want to be a little bit more precise
but<00:01:57.190> this<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.450> workout<00:01:58.780> tank<00:01:59.110> it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
but this is just a workout tank it's

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.350 
but this is just a workout tank it's
going<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.530> be<00:01:59.650> loose-fitting<00:02:00.130> anyway<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:00.730> it's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
going to be loose-fitting anyway so it's

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.420 
going to be loose-fitting anyway so it's
not<00:02:01.480> really<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.780> big<00:02:02.020> deal<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:02.950> there<00:02:03.160> you<00:02:03.250> go

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
not really a big deal so there you go

and now there's a lot of ways you can
kind<00:02:08.290> of<00:02:08.410> play<00:02:08.650> around<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.510> make<00:02:10.510> variations

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
kind of play around and make variations

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.500 
kind of play around and make variations
of<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.400> want<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.670> cut<00:02:12.820> it<00:02:12.940> lower<00:02:13.180> and
