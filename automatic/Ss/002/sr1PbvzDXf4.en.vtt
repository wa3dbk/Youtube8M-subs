00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.790
 Windows are the eyes of the house 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 varied forms and 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.429
 design options are on 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.720
 windows consist essentially of 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.900
 These three materials are wood aluminum 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.900
 and plastic 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 over half of all currently 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 used windows are made of plastic 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.330
 which also has its reasons for 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.220
 own high quality plastic windows 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.290
 excellent features the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:40.800
 crucial innovations are stuck in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.690
 the innovative profiles the profine 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.300
 group is pioneering in the field of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.330
 Plastic window technology is here 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 researched and produced ob 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.170
 for new developments or 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.390
 Maintenance work in the company's own 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 Tool making for over 50 years 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.879
 The tools are made for the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.680
 Extrusion process self made in 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.989
 the library will be the different 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.909
 components of profine's own recipe 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.729
 mixed as a main component 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:14.520
 pvc but also the self- made 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.740
 unleaded stabilizer pvc can be shut down 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 100 percent recycle old ones 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.970
 Plastic frames are ground and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.619
 brought back into the material cycle 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.039
 the profile production is done by the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.659
 so-called extrusion process this 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.759
 procedure allows the heated 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.770
 plastic with pressure through an opening 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.939
 to squeeze the material in the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.950
 desired shape brings are conspicuous 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.140
 the many chambers in the profiles 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.039
 They are mainly used for stability 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.039
 and thermal insulation 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.980
 in contrast to aluminum, the heat 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.810
 derives a very plastic 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.150
 low heat transfer coefficient 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.310
 Quality is the highest premise in the industry 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.100
 the test lab will be the profiles daily 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.750
 extensively tested the special 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.110
 Formulation makes the surface of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.060
 Window profiles against weather corrosion 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.100
 external environmental influences and ultraviolet radiation 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.860
 Insensitive to the appearance 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.730
 is preserved and that's why 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.280
 Plastic windows also so easy care 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.270
 and have to be unlike woodwind windows 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.270
 not be deleted 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.850
 Here is the maximum load capacity of the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.220
 Materials tested for elasticity and 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.540
 High resistance are also important 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.660
 safety features of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.410
 plastic windows will continue to be 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.440
 load tests of the fittings 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.750
 carried out sound tests 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.850
 built-in windows with noise pollution 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.880
 to the jet fighter noise can 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.410
 also be simulated 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.630
 only when the plastic window all 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.480
 these tests withstand the quality 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.590
 good enough 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.800
 Plastic windows are available in many 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.540
 different colors or with wood optics 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.510
 Also with aluminum cover bowls for one 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.459
 individual color design by the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.500
 easy to shape the pvc 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.860
 Plastic windows very variable and 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.880
 therefore available in many forms 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.720
 eg as a round arch window whether new or 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.970
 old building renovation for everyone 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.370
 application purpose, there is the suitable and 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.340
 customized windows classic 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.620
 colors and shapes everything is possible with 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.840
 You have plastic windows and doors 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.840
 a quality product for every purpose
