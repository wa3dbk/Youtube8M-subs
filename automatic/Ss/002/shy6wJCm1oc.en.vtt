we've<00:01:44.890> got<00:01:45.010> things<00:01:45.160> tidied<00:01:45.640> up<00:01:45.730> a<00:01:45.880> little<00:01:46.090> bit

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
we've got things tidied up a little bit

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.660 
we've got things tidied up a little bit
which<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.450> nice<00:01:46.750> what<00:01:47.620> I<00:01:47.650> want<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.920> do<00:01:48.070> now<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.310> I

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
want to give this text a little more

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.390 
want to give this text a little more
realism<00:01:53.230> in<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.560> sense<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:53.890> when<00:01:54.280> you're

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
realism in the sense that when you're

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.040 
realism in the sense that when you're
dealing<00:01:54.580> with<00:01:54.700> text<00:01:55.120> and<00:01:55.300> images<00:01:55.630> on<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:55.840> web

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
dealing with text and images on a web

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.680 
dealing with text and images on a web
page<00:01:56.250> typically<00:01:57.250> textus<00:01:57.910> doesn't<00:01:58.210> run<00:01:58.360> always

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
page typically textus doesn't run always

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.630 
page typically textus doesn't run always
in<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.870> single<00:01:59.170> column<00:01:59.560> like<00:01:59.740> this<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.520> will

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
in a single column like this you will

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.240 
in a single column like this you will
also<00:02:00.970> find<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.600> text<00:02:01.960> wraps<00:02:02.320> around<00:02:02.590> images

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
also find that text wraps around images

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.890 
also find that text wraps around images
and<00:02:03.430> normally<00:02:04.030> these<00:02:04.180> days<00:02:04.390> it's<00:02:04.600> done<00:02:04.750> using

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
and normally these days it's done using

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.990 
and normally these days it's done using
CSS<00:02:05.530> you'll<00:02:05.800> float<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.280> image<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.730> left

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
CSS you'll float the image to the left

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.940 
CSS you'll float the image to the left
or<00:02:07.180> right<00:02:07.210> side<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.810> container<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.349> the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
or right side of a container and the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.130 
or right side of a container and the
text<00:02:09.220> will<00:02:09.250> flow<00:02:09.550> around<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:10.000> image<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.539> want

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
text will flow around the image I want

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.110 
text will flow around the image I want
to<00:02:11.200> mock<00:02:11.379> up<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.769> look<00:02:12.069> inside<00:02:12.549> of<00:02:12.700> fireworks

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
to mock up that look inside of fireworks

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.610 
to mock up that look inside of fireworks
and<00:02:13.329> we<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.599> do<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.959> with<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> feature<00:02:14.500> called

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
and we can do that with a feature called

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.610 
and we can do that with a feature called
text<00:02:15.430> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
text and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.890 
text and
path<00:02:15.830> now<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:16.819> have<00:02:17.090> our<00:02:17.120> text<00:02:17.510> already

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
path now we have our text already

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.809 
path now we have our text already
created<00:02:18.349> what<00:02:18.830> we<00:02:18.950> need<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.430> make<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:19.760> work

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
created what we need to make this work

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.449 
created what we need to make this work
is<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.390> path<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:21.830> going<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.069> go<00:02:22.190> ahead<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
is a path so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.199 
is a path so I'm going to go ahead and
grab<00:02:22.700> my<00:02:22.849> pen<00:02:23.060> tool<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:24.700> all<00:02:25.700> I'm<00:02:25.849> going<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.030> do

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
grab my pen tool and all I'm going to do

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.600 
grab my pen tool and all I'm going to do
is<00:02:26.510> draw<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.319> path<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.920> sort<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.190> mimics<00:02:28.340> the

is draw a path that sort of mimics the

is draw a path that sort of mimics the
shape<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:29.030> want<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.450> text<00:02:29.629> to<00:02:29.780> wrap

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
shape that I want the text to wrap

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.869

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
vector path here kind of outlining my

vector path here kind of outlining my
text<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:05.109> get<00:03:06.109> right<00:03:06.200> back<00:03:06.409> to<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.650> beginning

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
text I get right back to the beginning

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.390 
text I get right back to the beginning
and<00:03:07.190> now<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.239> have<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:08.480> big<00:03:08.870> vector<00:03:09.440> path<00:03:09.680> now

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
and now I have one big vector path now

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.470 
and now I have one big vector path now
at<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.579> moment<00:03:10.849> we<00:03:10.940> don't<00:03:11.090> see<00:03:11.209> any<00:03:11.329> real

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
at the moment we don't see any real

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.390 
at the moment we don't see any real
difference<00:03:11.690> that's<00:03:12.470> because<00:03:12.799> we<00:03:13.129> need<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
difference that's because we need to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.979 
difference that's because we need to
group<00:03:13.670> these<00:03:13.849> two<00:03:14.090> elements<00:03:14.209> together<00:03:14.599> and

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
group these two elements together and

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.089 
group these two elements together and
that's<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.230> special<00:03:15.590> command<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:15.980> we're

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
that's a special command that we're

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.130 
that's a special command that we're
going<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.310> use<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.579> do<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:16.909> so<00:03:17.629> first<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.049> all

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
going to use to do this so first of all

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.319 
going to use to do this so first of all
grab<00:03:18.739> my<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.890> pointer<00:03:19.310> tool<00:03:19.489> hold<00:03:20.060> down<00:03:20.209> my

shift key and select my text so now I

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.150 
shift key and select my text so now I
have<00:03:22.910> both<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.389> vector<00:03:23.690> path<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.859> text

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
have both the vector path and the text

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.400 
have both the vector path and the text
