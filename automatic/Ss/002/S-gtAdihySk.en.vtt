00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
think there's an episode I think we're

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
think there's an episode I think we're
like<00:00:27.330> he<00:00:27.480> actually<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:28.140> puts<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> sector<00:00:29.220> on

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
like he actually like puts the sector on

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.040 
like he actually like puts the sector on
and<00:00:29.550> flips<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> horn<00:00:30.090> over<00:00:30.390> immediately<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
he doesn't go in a mass form it goes

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.250 
he doesn't go in a mass form it goes
right<00:00:32.489> brighter<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.180> him<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.110> most

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
only way to get a figure of it really at

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.560 
only way to get a figure of it really at
least<00:01:00.629> opposable<00:01:01.140> somewhat<00:01:01.859> figure<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
least opposable somewhat figure of it

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
least opposable somewhat figure of it
that<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.660> aware<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.320> anyway<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.129> they

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
little bit of damage just because

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090

the arm pieces that come with it and
then<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.750> horn<00:02:08.990> just<00:02:09.170> like<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.530> show

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950

then the horn just like in the show
flips<00:02:10.160> up<00:02:10.280> over<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.580> face<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:12.620> form<00:02:13.300> Kabuto

flips up over the face to form Kabuto

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.830 
flips up over the face to form Kabuto
now<00:02:15.550> there<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> little<00:02:17.030> bulkier<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.720> like

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
now there is a little bulkier just like

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.530 
now there is a little bulkier just like
especially<00:02:18.170> down<00:02:18.500> here<00:02:19.030> he's<00:02:20.030> not<00:02:20.210> quite<00:02:20.420> as

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
especially down here he's not quite as

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.590 
especially down here he's not quite as
slim<00:02:20.930> as<00:02:20.960> he<00:02:21.830> actually<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.400> show<00:02:22.640> just

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
slim as he actually is on the show just

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.910 
slim as he actually is on the show just
because<00:02:23.690> they<00:02:23.930> have<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> incorporate<00:02:24.740> all

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
because they have to incorporate all

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.100 
because they have to incorporate all
that<00:02:25.070> spring<00:02:25.400> mechanism<00:02:25.910> into<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.840> figure

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
that spring mechanism into the figure

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.020 
that spring mechanism into the figure
itself<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.620> even<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.070> like<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.760> figure

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
itself but even then like in the figure

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.360 
itself but even then like in the figure
Gainsville<00:02:29.600> implausibility<00:02:30.250> there's<00:02:31.250> no

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
Gainsville implausibility there's no

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.580 
Gainsville implausibility there's no
waist<00:02:31.580> level<00:02:31.760> obviously<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:33.290> got<00:02:33.410> ball

jointed hips swivel knee ankle I now

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.520 
jointed hips swivel knee ankle I now
turn<00:02:39.950> his<00:02:40.340> head<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:41.810> well<00:02:42.020> yeah<00:02:42.350> there's<00:02:42.500> a

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.230 
turn his head as well yeah there's a
little<00:02:42.590> bit<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:42.800> damage<00:02:42.980> there<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.970> on<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
little bit of damage there just on the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.160 
little bit of damage there just on the
chest<00:02:44.510> paint<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:44.930> nothing<00:02:45.170> nothing<00:02:45.650> horrible

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
and so there's a couple to cast off and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.140 
and so there's a couple to cast off and
attack<00:02:51.860> will<00:02:52.010> be<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.130> bit<00:02:52.310> easier<00:02:52.700> with<00:02:52.820> because

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
attack will be a bit easier with because

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.070 
attack will be a bit easier with because
his<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.360> sort<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.900> like<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.140> fly<00:02:54.350> off<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:56.080> tops

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
head's a little bit more limited just

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.490 
head's a little bit more limited just
due<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.090> high<00:03:44.209> collar<00:03:44.480> there<00:03:45.080> around<00:03:45.320> his

head oh yeah they're pretty neat he said

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.380 
head oh yeah they're pretty neat he said
they're<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.280> lot<00:03:52.459> more<00:03:52.489> basic<00:03:53.030> than<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.239> figure

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
they're a lot more basic than the figure

they're a lot more basic than the figure
arts<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.959> definitely<00:03:54.500> think<00:03:54.650> I'm<00:03:54.830> going<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:54.980> be

over the gimmick line the only gimmick

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.390 
over the gimmick line the only gimmick
line<00:04:00.590> that<00:04:00.739> I've<00:04:00.830> really<00:04:01.160> really<00:04:01.340> been

their function of swapping things around
but<00:04:08.239> they<00:04:08.299> were<00:04:08.390> still<00:04:08.660> just<00:04:08.950> not<00:04:09.950> as<00:04:10.130> good<00:04:10.310> as

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
but they were still just not as good as

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.060

zeg figures because like before is a
figures<00:04:27.139> are<00:04:27.259> much<00:04:27.860> improvement<00:04:28.629> well<00:04:29.919> and<00:04:30.919> a

little bit more in scale or not quite as

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.110 
little bit more in scale or not quite as
