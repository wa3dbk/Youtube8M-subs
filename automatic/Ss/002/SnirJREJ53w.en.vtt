eight<00:02:18.640> nine<00:02:18.849> ten<00:02:19.150> keep<00:02:19.360> coming<00:02:19.629> -<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:30.120> think

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
eight nine ten keep coming - I think

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:45.360 
eight nine ten keep coming - I think
it's<00:02:31.299> number<00:02:31.450> three<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.950> go<00:02:45.069> ahead<00:02:45.190> and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
it's number three so just go ahead and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.699 
it's number three so just go ahead and
cut<00:02:45.549> some<00:02:45.730> low<00:02:45.910> frequencies<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.660> all<00:02:46.989> on<00:02:47.530> these

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
cut some low frequencies on all on these

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.660 
cut some low frequencies on all on these
downstage<00:02:48.519> mics<00:02:50.370> -<00:02:52.349> are<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:53.470> cutting<00:02:53.680> 125<00:02:54.430> out

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
downstage mics - are you cutting 125 out

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.050 
downstage mics - are you cutting 125 out
of<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.819> graph<00:02:57.690> there<00:02:59.549> high-pass<00:03:00.549> filters<00:03:00.940> are

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
of the graph there high-pass filters are

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.839 
of the graph there high-pass filters are
just<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:03.780> okay<00:03:04.980> set<00:03:05.980> them<00:03:06.099> up<00:03:06.190> oh<00:03:06.310> yeah<00:03:06.459> set

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
just a okay set them up oh yeah set

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.960 
just a okay set them up oh yeah set
those<00:03:07.980> what<00:03:08.980> we're<00:03:09.129> doing<00:03:09.340> here<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:09.700> setting

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
those what we're doing here is setting

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.610 
those what we're doing here is setting
some<00:03:10.209> high-pass<00:03:10.599> filters<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.230> get<00:03:11.349> rid<00:03:11.500> of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
some high-pass filters to get rid of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.110 
some high-pass filters to get rid of
that<00:03:11.769> low-frequency<00:03:12.370> feedback<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:12.970> you

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
that low-frequency feedback that you

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.650 
that low-frequency feedback that you
heard<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:14.350> again<00:03:15.160> just<00:03:15.639> like<00:03:15.850> with<00:03:16.090> guitar

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
heard and again just like with guitar

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.420 
heard and again just like with guitar
amplifiers<00:03:17.139> and<00:03:17.319> other<00:03:17.410> things<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:18.190> need<00:03:18.310> to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
amplifiers and other things you need to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.270 
amplifiers and other things you need to
find<00:03:18.639> a<00:03:18.760> usable<00:03:19.079> low-frequency<00:03:20.079> limit<00:03:20.350> of

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
find a usable low-frequency limit of

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.610 
find a usable low-frequency limit of
stuff<00:03:21.700> onstage<00:03:21.970> because<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.930> low<00:03:23.079> frequency

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
stuff onstage because that low frequency

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.160 
stuff onstage because that low frequency
energy<00:03:24.190> will<00:03:24.760> eat<00:03:25.000> up<00:03:25.150> all<00:03:25.359> of<00:03:25.840> your<00:03:25.930> amplifier

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
energy will eat up all of your amplifier

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.370 
energy will eat up all of your amplifier
power<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:28.540> will<00:03:28.630> actually<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.230> know

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
power and it will actually you know

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.379 
power and it will actually you know
unless<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.739> get<00:03:29.889> control<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.670> then<00:03:31.269> you're

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
unless you get control of it then you're

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.289 
unless you get control of it then you're
not<00:03:31.540> really<00:03:32.040> you're<00:03:33.040> not<00:03:33.190> really<00:03:33.430> applying

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
not really you're not really applying

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.080 
not really you're not really applying
all<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.989> power<00:03:35.230> in<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:36.370> right<00:03:36.519> in<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
all of the power in the right in the

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.270 
all of the power in the right in the
correct<00:03:37.389> place<00:03:37.720> on<00:03:38.560> -<00:03:38.889> one<00:03:39.340> two<00:03:39.700> one<00:03:40.000> two

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
of these Wireless goes down so right now

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.930 
of these Wireless goes down so right now
let's<00:04:57.690> go<00:04:57.900> ahead<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.259> adjust<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.280> spare<00:04:59.639> to
