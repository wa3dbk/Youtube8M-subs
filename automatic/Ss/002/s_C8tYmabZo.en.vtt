00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 pegi 18 to some spectators 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.470
 could find the images that are going 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:17.600
 to follow violent or shocking 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:19.010
 here are warned hello everyone 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.330
 I hope you're fine, it's gone 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.189
 we will try to hunt a little bit 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.050
 tiger so that's pretty much the animal 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.519
 the most powerful of the game in my eyes because 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.409
 that in fact he is fast he is very 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.060
 effective and at the same time they 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.529
 simply move very 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.759
 quickly over long distances 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.840
 you will see for yourself by 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.430
 against opening and I do not recommend 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.960
 strongly take of throwing stones 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.120
 otherwise I think you're going 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.710
 be sounded before him so take it 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.780
 obviously a bow with narcos b 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.580
 soul is enough the green arrows in 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.720
 done to be able to obviously the 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.600
 sum and still keep a good 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.160
 safety distance of 50 to 70 meters 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.780
 then and it comes to the world a 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.400
 simply tried to back down for 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.690
 can not be especially touched 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.980
 because of him that touches you 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.660
 jumped back two meters 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.270
 in 3 scratches it happens to you and 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.740
 you will have completely disoriented so 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.870
 of course it's still 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.640
 tense enough why capture him so 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.320
 it's a carnivore so we'll have to take 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.400
 buses or narcotics so the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.420
 skins of course we can 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.409
 take what many have asked me if 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.409
 we can talk powell you can 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.180
 take and that makes you 50 narco bo 40 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.330
 after it will obviously have to be limited 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.010
 waited meat three hours three 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.390
 half hours because it depends on the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.650
 level of which bath 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.240
 the lion and is tamed cell has been 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.920
 at level 11 so still moaning not 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.300
 bad luck so I called him the lion 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.710
 but it's a tiger in fact so after 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.310
 I do not know it looks like a shot or 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.930
 really very effective 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.400
 I'll call him the lion late 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.540
 I said I believe tonight to call 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.640
 the lion what for me it stays when 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.620
 even the king of the jungle not everything 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.750
 simply from you arca what can you 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.799
 put ko a t-rex a rex anyone 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.140
 can put you limits 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.909
 in less than a few times and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.010
 you'll see by volume that I'm kidding 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.630
 really not so there I decided everything 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.710
 just that he's following now we're going 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.920
 take a small step of the carvings a 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.850
 a little more nag look well 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.140
 now I'm in sprint mode 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.060
 so I'm going to show you he's 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.890
 much faster than high- speed abduction 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.830
 level of help of the race 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.050
 he is much faster 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.460
 much more responsive and he shares curie 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.170
 course also distances a lot 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.180
 higher you need to know it 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.700
 stamina is much more important than 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.410
 that of the raptor and at the same time 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.850
 you feel like 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.110
 frankly 20 sites almost with him 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.240
 because even in a few strokes 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.540
 claws and spreads any threat on your 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.220
 path 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.950
 what I tell you that sincerely 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.930
 that you make one or two and with 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.960
 them with tigers you have pretty much 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 no problem that risks you 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.590
 get to give at the level of the fighting 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.020
 I have an express looking for a little bit low 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.430
 just not fighting I'm 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.710
 obviously escorted for not 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.660
 to lose needlessly either 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.120
 tiger so the ankles escorted from 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.800
 raptor and scorpion to be able to be 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.240
 really quiet 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.810
 look away look - how he 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.840
 eat how there in front of the direct 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.200
 the rex forgiveness he has no limit in 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.550
 made 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.900
 and knowing that even though I'm fine 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.630
 escorted see well I have a scorpio 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.860
 level 63 so sincerely now 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.080
 The damage is very important 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.730
 the lion and calumnies will vote 3 or 40 I 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.070
 know exactly but it's when 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.380
 even very effective and that he has 160 in 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.360
 damage actually it gets closer to the 600 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.489
 few bites into account what 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.380
 any animal does not fall 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.090
 so there are not necessarily lines 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.170
 compared to that so that allows you 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.450
 simply to be able to occupy 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.250
 a lot of pau a lot of meat 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.180
 especially that the meat know that this 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.950
 track-there must feed them 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.480
 okay there are all we can 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.970
 recover 54th skin we have no limit 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.350
 I attack everyone on the area I 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.810
 note that we spent a lot of 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.400
 also to fight moncade lyon I had to 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.380
 spend limit 8 hours to do it 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.970
 back up like the scorpion I had to 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.790
 spend 24 hours to be able to do 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.260
 mount a so sincerely scorpion 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.910
 you are going to have well mounted animals 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.800
 and try to group them together 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.570
 the more you are, the more it will be 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.070
 well then there I advise you 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.650
 to avoid the fleet in which he 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.170
 was just mingling my animals 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.430
 because here there are piranhas and 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.170
 megalodon so simply 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.850
 sharks so I advise you all 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.470
 just to be careful because 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.910
 there it will become a limit fight 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.360
 aquatic are necessarily they do not have 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.340
 a lot of oxygen 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.170
 your animals to be able to bah everything 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.700
 simply confront several modes of 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.200
 shark is the same piranhas 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.760
 so we can attack everyone 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.109
 a high level of land will not have 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.090
 difficulty will not have for them 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.250
 moms of the world I tell you the tiger is 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.750
 very very effectively sincerely take the 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.960
 and you will see for yourself that 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.970
 almost nothing resists you 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.410
 eyes on just not paying attention 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.090
 to knock out some who gets 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.740
 knock out for example or equipped 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.330
 stung by scorpions ben there 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.020
 obviously he'll see stars so 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.120
 will have to take 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.770
 db white to be able to get down 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.110
 all this for now we do not have this 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.510
 threat that is invisible but the more you 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.620
 beat the lion scorpions things 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.210
 like that that might knock you out 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.440
 walk it is necessary to teach them the stamina 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.410
 edge to carry to the descendants otherwise 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.480
 your pet simply fall asleep 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.740
 and sincerely as soon as they make the decision makers

 the other little malignant who's of the 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.190

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.300
 effective for me that said my pet 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.530
 favorite with the scorpion and sincerely 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.790
