00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
airbag light I already get a good view

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.510 
airbag light I already get a good view
of<00:00:38.140> that<00:00:38.170> it<00:00:38.770> just<00:00:38.800> looks<00:00:39.040> like<00:00:39.250> a<00:00:39.370> little

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
of that it just looks like a little

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
failed in the system and the everybody

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.830 
failed in the system and the everybody
will<00:00:54.100> not<00:00:54.310> go<00:00:54.520> off<00:00:54.550> an<00:00:54.940> accident<00:00:55.570> there's<00:00:55.780> a

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
will not go off an accident there's a

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.080

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
problem

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.200 
problem
so<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.770> some<00:00:59.980> people<00:01:00.340> now<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.730> big<00:01:01.030> deal<00:01:01.180> I

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
so to some people now the big deal I

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.210 
so to some people now the big deal I
could<00:01:01.390> deal<00:01:01.540> with<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.690> light<00:01:01.930> but<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:03.070> is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
could deal with the light but it is

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.149 
could deal with the light but it is
something<00:01:03.400> you<00:01:03.550> should<00:01:03.579> get<00:01:03.820> checked<00:01:04.000> out<00:01:04.210> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
something you should get checked out a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.590 
something you should get checked out a
lot<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.280> scan<00:01:06.490> tools<00:01:06.729> can't<00:01:07.060> read<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.450> you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
lot of scan tools can't read it you

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.649 
lot of scan tools can't read it you
gotta<00:01:07.719> have<00:01:07.929> something<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.350> reads<00:01:08.499> airbags

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
gotta have something that reads airbags

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.480 
gotta have something that reads airbags
most<00:01:10.659> will<00:01:11.020> read<00:01:11.140> ABS<00:01:11.560> airbag<00:01:11.770> stuff<00:01:12.369> like

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
most will read ABS airbag stuff like

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.929 
most will read ABS airbag stuff like
that

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
that

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.889 
that
in<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:13.630> case<00:01:13.960> using<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> forward<00:01:14.979> IDs<00:01:15.369> tool

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
in this case using the forward IDs tool

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.819 
in this case using the forward IDs tool
in<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.200> beam<00:01:17.409> it's<00:01:17.679> a<00:01:17.799> seat<00:01:18.009> belt<00:01:18.219> buckle<00:01:18.670> set

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
in the beam it's a seat belt buckle set

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.770 
in the beam it's a seat belt buckle set
nut<00:01:20.829> not<00:01:21.729> getting<00:01:21.999> the<00:01:22.060> connection<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:22.630> it's

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
nut not getting the connection so it's

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.260 
nut not getting the connection so it's
not<00:01:22.869> really<00:01:23.109> to<00:01:23.229> see<00:01:23.409> pulse<00:01:23.590> plugged<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
not really to see pulse plugged in and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.059 
not really to see pulse plugged in and
its<00:01:25.899> problems<00:01:26.350> it's<00:01:26.560> part<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.859> airbag

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
its problems it's part of the airbag

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.730 
its problems it's part of the airbag
system<00:01:27.399> for<00:01:27.579> when<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.819> seat<00:01:27.999> belt<00:01:28.740> there's

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
system for when the seat belt there's

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.349 
system for when the seat belt there's
actually<00:01:30.069> an<00:01:30.189> explosive<00:01:30.819> in<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.060> that

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
actually an explosive in it that

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.569 
actually an explosive in it that
ratchets<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.439> see<00:01:32.590> bolts<00:01:32.889> super<00:01:33.159> tight<00:01:33.369> an

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
ratchets the see bolts super tight an

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.120 
ratchets the see bolts super tight an
accident<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.689> part<00:01:35.649> of<00:01:35.679> the<00:01:35.770> restraint

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
accident and part of the restraint

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.989 
accident and part of the restraint
system<00:01:36.929> so<00:01:37.929> and<00:01:38.049> so<00:01:38.170> that's<00:01:38.350> why<00:01:38.499> the<00:01:38.759> no<00:01:39.759> seat

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
system so and so that's why the no seat

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:45.980 
system so and so that's why the no seat
belt<00:01:40.209> light<00:01:40.329> keeps<00:01:40.689> beeping<00:01:41.409> at<00:01:41.740> me<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.670> also

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
belt light keeps beeping at me it's also

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.429 
belt light keeps beeping at me it's also
on<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.139> kids<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.770> seat<00:01:48.039> belt<00:01:48.219> buckle<00:01:48.700> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
on this kids that seat belt buckle and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.870 
on this kids that seat belt buckle and
there's<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:50.529> wire<00:01:50.709> touching<00:01:51.459> in<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.670> clock

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
there's a wire touching in the clock

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.690 
there's a wire touching in the clock
spring<00:01:52.380> which<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.619> inside<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.219> steering<00:01:54.549> wall

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
spring which is inside the steering wall

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.120 
spring which is inside the steering wall
so<00:01:54.969> I'm<00:01:55.149> going<00:01:55.329> to<00:01:55.359> replace<00:01:55.659> both<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:56.139> those

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
so I'm going to replace both of those

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.529 
so I'm going to replace both of those
