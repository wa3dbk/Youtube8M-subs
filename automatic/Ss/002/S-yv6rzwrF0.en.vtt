eight<00:02:52.359> months<00:02:52.750> ago<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.349> even<00:02:53.620> though<00:02:53.769> I

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
eight months ago but even though I

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.099 
eight months ago but even though I
rarely<00:02:54.250> max<00:02:54.700> out<00:02:54.909> and<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.680> reason<00:02:57.129> being<00:02:57.310> is

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
rarely max out and the reason being is

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.750 
rarely max out and the reason being is
testing<00:02:59.109> strength<00:02:59.530> isn't<00:02:59.769> building<00:03:00.430> strength
