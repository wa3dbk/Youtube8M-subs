00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.390
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.629
 17.1 shows you a lot in this video 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.629
 fun 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.050
 as already mentioned should go to 17:14 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.230
 See, I 've already done that 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.910
 installed this is the first beta of 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.039
 17.1 and I just have today 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.689
 to show the innovations for a moment 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.230
 I have the whole thing on mine for that 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.089
 iphone 5 is installed and it is not 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.100
 I say many new things 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.400
 but nevertheless I have the for you 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.510
 just to demonstrate briefly 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.489
 So here we are the settings 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.890
 are you have already seen 7.1 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.420
 I can install you here again 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.850
 zack likes to say pay 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.399
 then we just go down here 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.530
 helper and go ladder here 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.230
 down here this section has become 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.859
 We have done something here and we have it here 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.019
 increase contrast 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.809
 and there we can just the transparency 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.050
 reduce it was already possible before 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.350
 I'll tell you here 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.149
 to reduce the animation so this 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.960
 I already had a parallax effect 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.940
 Video made about it if you stop 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.470
 Do not fancy these animations and 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.050
 so on now I'll show you something 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.390
 as a result you have already seen this one 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.369
 Transparency that is here or in the new 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.780
 action center which is no longer there 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.840
 completely black 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.670
 i do not like it well but it is 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.479
 a matter of taste if you have this 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.149
 transparency may not like it 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.099
 you better then me personally here 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.580
 I do not like I better directly 

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:46.270
 we prefer the whole but is just 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.459
 a matter of taste 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.959
 then I have darken color yet 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.170
 I do not know what exactly it means here 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.729
 I have darkened this color 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.709
 I had the whole time activated and 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.840
 future cuckoo looked but somehow 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.550
 not found what 's up with that 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.310
 Darken is not synonymous color 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.750
 important so then we have dark ones here 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.000
 use keyboard 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.950
 By default, yes, the white keyboard 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.470
 activated and if we do the whole 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.940
 then we can have activated 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.190
 Simply when we are in safari for example 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.569
 in there are white at the end 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.190
 I have the whole thing now and now 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.349
 activated and you see you have now 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.989
 by default the black keyboard 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.530
 I like it very much that's otherwise 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.480
 only available in spotlight search 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.300
 Now you can stop them everywhere 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.489
 practically use yes what else do we have 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.450
 here 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.019
 right here we have it again 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.459
 Nothing 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.769
 that was it already here but already 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.190
 If we go to the new fiction center 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.840
 go 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.519
 i dont know i have to be honest 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.769
 say if it is so with all but at 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.599
 I'm here 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.290
 this weather is no longer there with yahoo 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.069
 Strangely, it is not there anymore 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.180
 I always had a little bit too 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.560
 I have to say that I am disturbed 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.560
 always this advertising from yahoo 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.030
 well in any case this is now 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.280
 at least away from me and if we are now 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.140
 we do not see any over here second 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.640
 Messages no missed 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.359
 messages, etc 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.690
 that has also changed yes then 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.349
 short to weather app which hooks a bit 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.090
 with me 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:21.040
 that's probably such a small one 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.500
 Error 1 7 and 1 times purely 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.440
 Of course, now it does not hang or 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.560
 but now she has gone 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.480
 but not so important is more important 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.590
 What is more important than just one 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.840
 little innovation that yahoo stands for 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.540
 should actually synonymous in non fiction 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.889
 center have changed but there it 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.169
 nothing at all with me 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.000
 So here is nothing there 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:49.079
 That's why I can do that here with me 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.190
 just demonstrate in this weather app 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.290
 otherwise it was that too 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.940
 yes many are probably wondering 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.599
 always install such or now 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.730
 not it is a beta you have to 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.099
 be clear it is a beta the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.799
 is not running as smoothly it runs 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.630
 certainly not worse than on 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:12.370
 7.4 but maybe to the world 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.650
 generally the battery is already 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.590
 bit faster I have to be empty 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.380
 I had charged the whole thing yesterday 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.660
 to 100 percent and change this morning 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.539
 juwi has been away ten percent now 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.099
 not dramatic one comes through the day 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.970
 but who now takes use 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.139
 The whole thing should of course be assumed 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.030
 do not install 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.500
 besides, it's actually only for 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.479
 user released 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.610
 for developers, of course, for 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.289
 developer 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.430
 yes it should have been so first 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.110
 be from 17.10 beta 1 if it is in the 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.699
 another beta is of course more 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.439
 innovations should give 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.689
 of course you will be back with me 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:54.229
 otherwise it will be good to see you 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.229
 next video
