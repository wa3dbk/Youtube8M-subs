the<00:02:04.920> way<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.070> has<00:02:05.430> went<00:02:05.759> much<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.450> chaos

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750

to work even though I only got two and I

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.350 
to work even though I only got two and I
had<00:04:05.820> four<00:04:06.810> loaded<00:04:07.170> there<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.739> lose<00:04:08.340> all<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:09.180> it's

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.670 
had four loaded there I lose all so it's
only<00:04:09.540> eight<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:09.840> as<00:04:10.170> soon<00:04:10.320> as<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.470> press<00:04:10.590> that

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
why but you pretty much have to do

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.530 
why but you pretty much have to do
another<00:04:12.720> physical<00:04:13.110> attack<00:04:13.470> like<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:13.680> to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
another physical attack like this to

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.920 
another physical attack like this to
load<00:04:15.540> up<00:04:15.720> again<00:04:16.019> on<00:04:16.560> your<00:04:16.769> mark<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.040> execute

the face

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.230 
the face
pretty<00:04:27.410> much<00:04:27.530> in<00:04:27.650> any<00:04:27.740> game<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.910> other<00:04:29.000> spy

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
pretty much in any game the other spy

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.460 
pretty much in any game the other spy
and<00:04:29.390> I<00:04:29.420> have<00:04:29.540> basically<00:04:29.960> been<00:04:30.050> staying<00:04:30.380> on

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and I have basically been staying on

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.040 
and I have basically been staying on
there's<00:04:30.680> our<00:04:31.250> own<00:04:31.460> sides<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.880> map<00:04:32.090> just<00:04:32.930> cuz

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
there's our own sides the map just cuz

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.450 
there's our own sides the map just cuz
there's<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.320> many<00:04:33.410> terrorists<00:04:33.980> around<00:04:34.250> me

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
there's so many terrorists around me

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.160 
there's so many terrorists around me
that<00:04:34.730> it's<00:04:35.000> hard<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.330> really<00:04:35.450> just<00:04:35.690> run<00:04:35.840> by<00:04:35.990> all

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
that it's hard to really just run by all

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.900 
that it's hard to really just run by all
of<00:04:36.200> them<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.620> feel<00:04:37.130> kind<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.340> kill<00:04:37.520> but<00:04:37.640> I<00:04:37.670> think

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
of them I feel kind of kill but I think

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.160 
of them I feel kind of kill but I think
he<00:04:37.970> does<00:04:38.180> end<00:04:38.360> up<00:04:38.420> coming<00:04:38.660> my<00:04:38.750> way<00:04:38.780> as<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.050> can

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
he does end up coming my way as you can

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.900 
he does end up coming my way as you can
see<00:04:39.290> how<00:04:39.380> they're<00:04:39.680> all<00:04:39.800> dropping<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.490> it's

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
see how they're all dropping and it's

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.330 
see how they're all dropping and it's
not<00:04:41.090> for<00:04:41.300> me<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.680> I<00:04:42.710> figure<00:04:42.950> he's<00:04:43.070> got<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.280> be

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
not for me so I figure he's got to be

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.410 
not for me so I figure he's got to be
over<00:04:43.430> there<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.730> like<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:43.940> know<00:04:43.970> what<00:04:44.150> let's
