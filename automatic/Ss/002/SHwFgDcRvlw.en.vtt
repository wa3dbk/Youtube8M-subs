00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
notice when I deadlift I reset every

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.310 
notice when I deadlift I reset every
single<00:00:23.789> rep<00:00:23.970> there<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.420> minimum<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.080> two

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
single rep there is a minimum of two

single rep there is a minimum of two
seconds<00:00:25.710> between<00:00:25.859> every<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.400> my<00:00:26.550> reps<00:00:26.789> and

seconds between every one of my reps and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.570 
seconds between every one of my reps and
that<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.320> generally<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.890> way<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.160> should<00:00:29.550> be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
like George he can do a lot of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.600 
like George he can do a lot of
wrong<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.420> still<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.590> amazing<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.280> he

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
wrong and still be amazing because he

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.920 
wrong and still be amazing because he
trains<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.920> really<00:01:14.430> hard<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.299> he

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
trains really really hard and he

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.330 
trains really really hard and he
has<00:01:16.110> elite<00:01:16.560> genetics<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.189> strength<00:01:17.930> so

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
has elite genetics for strength so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.590 
has elite genetics for strength so
that's<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> example<00:01:20.939> I've<00:01:21.000> gotten<00:01:21.390> when<00:01:21.570> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that's the example I've gotten when I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.880 
that's the example I've gotten when I
mentioned<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.110> before<00:01:22.259> people<00:01:22.650> will

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
mentioned this before people will

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
mentioned this before people will
mention<00:01:23.070> George<00:01:23.400> Lehmann<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.000> he<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.509> doesn't

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
mention George Lehmann and he it doesn't

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
mention George Lehmann and he it doesn't
work<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.020> way<00:01:25.229> guys

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
work that way guys

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.609 
work that way guys
for<00:01:26.400> 99%<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> lifters<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
for 99% of lifters it's not going to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
for 99% of lifters it's not going to
work<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.600> here's<00:01:30.600> why<00:01:31.189> number<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.850> not

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
work and here's why number one it's not

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
work and here's why number one it's not
going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> improve<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.229> deadlift<00:01:34.680> because

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
going to improve your deadlift because

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
going to improve your deadlift because
what<00:01:35.400> you're<00:01:35.520> doing<00:01:35.549> obviously<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.509> only

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
what you're doing obviously you're only

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.359 
what you're doing obviously you're only
able<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> bounce<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.619> way<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.950> you're<00:01:38.100> doing

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
able to bounce the way if you're doing

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.590 
able to bounce the way if you're doing
more<00:01:38.549> than<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.909> rep<00:01:39.119> which<00:01:39.270> means<00:01:39.509> you're

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
more than one rep which means you're

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.350 
more than one rep which means you're
doing<00:01:39.689> work<00:01:40.020> sets<00:01:40.400> with<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> sub<00:01:41.820> maximum

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
doing work sets with a sub maximum

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
doing work sets with a sub maximum
weight<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.899> what<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:43.920> doing<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.369> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
weight and what you're doing is that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.670 
weight and what you're doing is that
you're<00:01:44.670> actually<00:01:44.820> only<00:01:45.270> training<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you're actually only training the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.389 
you're actually only training the
weakest<00:01:47.100> part<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> lift<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.100> part<00:01:50.310> of

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
weakest part of the lift and the part of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.800 
weakest part of the lift and the part of
the<00:01:50.460> lift<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.759> recruits<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> most<00:01:51.479> muscle

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the lift that recruits the most muscle

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.469 
the lift that recruits the most muscle
fibers<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.439> very<00:01:52.920> first<00:01:53.220> rip<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.759> I've

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
fibers on the very first rip and I've

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
fibers on the very first rip and I've
seen<00:01:54.750> guys<00:01:54.930> who<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.229> watch<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.070> they'll

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
seen guys who you watch them and they'll

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.060 
seen guys who you watch them and they'll
say<00:01:56.520> take<00:01:56.790> four<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.270> five<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.890> I've<00:01:58.890> seen

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
say take four and five and I've seen

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.709 
say take four and five and I've seen
videos<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.060> YouTube<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.659> they

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
videos up of this on YouTube and they

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.050 
videos up of this on YouTube and they
might<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.170> five<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:01.530> eight<00:02:01.799> reps<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.460> 4:05

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
might get five or eight reps with 4:05

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.580 
might get five or eight reps with 4:05
they<00:02:03.810> almost<00:02:04.110> hit<00:02:04.799> they<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.460> barely<00:02:05.939> pull<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
they almost hit they can barely pull the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.850 
they almost hit they can barely pull the
405<00:02:08.300> 405<00:02:09.300> pounds<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.440> they<00:02:10.560> end<00:02:10.770> up

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
405 405 pounds and then they end up

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.900 
405 405 pounds and then they end up
getting<00:02:11.039> five<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.610> six<00:02:11.819> reps<00:02:12.060> by<00:02:12.270> bouncing

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
getting five or six reps by bouncing

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.640 
getting five or six reps by bouncing
every<00:02:13.180> rep<00:02:13.360> after<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.810> with<00:02:14.020> bad<00:02:14.170> technique

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
every rep after that with bad technique

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.250 
every rep after that with bad technique
and<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.520> reality<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.060> there<00:02:16.510> max<00:02:16.720> deadlift

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.380 
and the reality is there max deadlift
might<00:02:17.470> still<00:02:17.770> only<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.220> 405<00:02:18.820> if<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.150> were<00:02:19.270> to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
might still only be 405 if you were to

15 or 20 pounds heavier than that off
the<00:02:26.620> floor<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.950> will<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.220> stick<00:02:27.520> because

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the floor it will just stick because

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.220 
the floor it will just stick because
they<00:02:27.910> have<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.210> improve<00:02:28.570> their<00:02:28.750> strength<00:02:29.080> off

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
they have it improve their strength off

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.840 
they have it improve their strength off
the<00:02:29.440> floor<00:02:29.740> through<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> repetition<00:02:30.250> work

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
the floor through the repetition work

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.280 
the floor through the repetition work
which<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.180> where<00:02:31.420> you're<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> weakest<00:02:32.080> act

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
which is where you're the weakest act

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.230 
which is where you're the weakest act
and<00:02:32.530> they<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.160> only<00:02:33.370> trained<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.030> motor

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
and they have only trained the motor

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.890 
and they have only trained the motor
pattern<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:35.370> one<00:02:36.370> rep<00:02:36.970> because<00:02:37.450> when<00:02:37.780> you're

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
pattern on one rep because when you're

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.510 
pattern on one rep because when you're
bouncing<00:02:38.260> off<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.500> floor<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.890> bar<00:02:39.100> path<00:02:39.340> is

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
bouncing off the floor the bar path is

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.390 
bouncing off the floor the bar path is
completely<00:02:40.090> different<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:41.710> motor<00:02:41.980> units

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
completely different the motor units

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.380 
completely different the motor units
involved<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.940> way<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.210> your

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
involved in the way that your

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.960 
involved in the way that your
biomechanics<00:02:44.290> function<00:02:44.800> are<00:02:45.430> completely

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
biomechanics function are completely

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.270 
biomechanics function are completely
different<00:02:46.150> than<00:02:46.330> all<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.540> other<00:02:46.780> reps<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
different than all the other reps so the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.130 
different than all the other reps so the
only<00:02:48.490> rep<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.480> increasing<00:02:49.840> their

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
only rep that is really increasing their

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.750 
only rep that is really increasing their
strength<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.710> first<00:02:50.920> rep<00:02:51.160> everytime<00:02:51.550> and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
strength is the first rep everytime and

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.620 
strength is the first rep everytime and
they're<00:02:51.850> using<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.270> same<00:02:52.420> weight

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
they're using the same weight

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.020 
they're using the same weight
continually<00:02:53.320> so<00:02:53.950> they<00:02:54.070> don't<00:02:54.310> improve<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.880> it

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
continually so they don't improve on it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.570 
continually so they don't improve on it
so<00:02:55.990> that's<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> whole<00:02:56.530> point<00:02:56.770> when<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.160> do

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
so that's the whole point when you do

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.100 
so that's the whole point when you do
each<00:02:57.850> rep<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.270> need<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.510> stop<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.960> need<00:02:58.990> to

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
each rep you need to stop you need to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.170 
each rep you need to stop you need to
reset<00:02:59.740> and<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.070> need<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.310> pull<00:03:00.550> from<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.880> dead

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
reset and you need to pull from a dead

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.960 
reset and you need to pull from a dead
stop<00:03:01.510> using<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.020> exact<00:03:02.500> same<00:03:03.340> technique<00:03:03.850> you

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
stop using the exact same technique you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.880 
stop using the exact same technique you
use<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.390> first<00:03:04.600> rep<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.050> those<00:03:05.680> people

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
use on the first rep and those people

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.000 
use on the first rep and those people
need<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.220> use<00:03:06.370> mental<00:03:06.700> cues<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.270> order<00:03:07.360> to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
need to use mental cues in order to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.080 
need to use mental cues in order to
learn<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.070> pullback<00:03:09.400> which<00:03:09.820> means<00:03:10.030> you

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
learn the pullback which means you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.090 
learn the pullback which means you
either<00:03:10.180> do<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> hip<00:03:10.660> drop<00:03:10.930> like<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.200> do<00:03:11.380> or<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:11.980> do

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
either do a hip drop like I do or you do

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.890 
either do a hip drop like I do or you do
a<00:03:12.130> bar<00:03:12.460> roll<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.000> whenever<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.390> do<00:03:13.570> any<00:03:13.750> of

a bar roll and whenever you do any of

a bar roll and whenever you do any of
those<00:03:13.960> things<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.350> need<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.530> do<00:03:14.710> them<00:03:14.890> or

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
those things you need to do them or

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.980 
those things you need to do them or

every single rep whatever it is that you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
maximum weight is what you need to do on

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.760 
maximum weight is what you need to do on
every<00:03:21.580> single<00:03:22.180> rep<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.810> need<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.140> reset

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
every single rep so you need to reset

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.830 
every single rep so you need to reset
your<00:03:24.280> set<00:03:24.640> up<00:03:24.760> every<00:03:25.090> single<00:03:25.390> time<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.750> that

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
your set up every single time and that

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.160 
your set up every single time and that

other thing to consider there is the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.870 
other thing to consider there is the
safety<00:03:31.750> factor<00:03:32.100> because<00:03:33.100> you're<00:03:33.340> bouncing

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
safety factor because you're bouncing

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.520 
safety factor because you're bouncing
out<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.120> your<00:03:34.240> bar<00:03:34.420> path<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:34.930> you're<00:03:35.050> doing<00:03:35.260> it

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
out of your bar path and you're doing it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.550 
out of your bar path and you're doing it
in<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.970> way<00:03:37.120> that's<00:03:37.360> less<00:03:37.750> controlled<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.500> you

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
in a way that's less controlled and you

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.230 
in a way that's less controlled and you
have<00:03:38.650> less<00:03:38.830> control<00:03:39.100> over<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.460> bar<00:03:39.670> path<00:03:39.910> and

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
have less control over the bar path and

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.150 
have less control over the bar path and
you're<00:03:40.330> probably<00:03:40.720> using<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.440> weight<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.830> can't

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
you're probably using a weight you can't

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.920 
you're probably using a weight you can't
handle<00:03:42.610> for<00:03:42.790> more<00:03:42.940> than<00:03:43.090> one<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.360> two<00:03:43.390> reps<00:03:43.690> if

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
handle for more than one to two reps if

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.870 
handle for more than one to two reps if
you're<00:03:44.050> bouncing<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.530> off<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.800> floor<00:03:45.010> you're

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
you're bouncing it off the floor you're

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.880 
you're bouncing it off the floor you're
also<00:03:46.090> putting<00:03:46.570> yourself<00:03:46.990> at<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.140> higher<00:03:47.470> risk

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
also putting yourself at a higher risk

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.760 
also putting yourself at a higher risk
of<00:03:48.070> injury<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:49.360> if<00:03:50.020> you<00:03:50.200> want<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.440> injure

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
of injury so if you want to injure

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.230 
of injury so if you want to injure
yourself<00:03:51.160> doing<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.490> deadlift<00:03:51.850> doing<00:03:52.150> this

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
yourself doing a deadlift doing this

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.480 
yourself doing a deadlift doing this
touch<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.660> go<00:03:52.780> bouncing<00:03:53.200> stuff<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.860> good

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
touch and go bouncing stuff is a good

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.490 
touch and go bouncing stuff is a good
way<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.790> increase<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.450> risk<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.780> injury<00:03:56.140> on<00:03:56.350> an

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
way to increase the risk of injury on an

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.560 
way to increase the risk of injury on an
lifts<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.190> not<00:03:57.400> normally<00:03:57.940> fairly<00:03:58.330> safe

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
lifts that is not normally fairly safe

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.230 
lifts that is not normally fairly safe
but<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:58.870> does<00:03:59.020> have<00:03:59.170> a<00:03:59.200> bad<00:03:59.410> reputation<00:03:59.680> for

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
but it does have a bad reputation for

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.100 
but it does have a bad reputation for
injuries<00:04:01.240> it's<00:04:01.420> because<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.780> people<00:04:01.810> doing

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
injuries it's because of people doing

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.800 
injuries it's because of people doing
silly<00:04:02.650> like<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.450> that's<00:04:04.570> a<00:04:04.690> good

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
silly like that so that's a good

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.449 
silly like that so that's a good
way<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:04.990> snap<00:04:05.320> your<00:04:05.709> up<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:06.040> now<00:04:06.160> even

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
way to snap your up and now even

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.060 
way to snap your up and now even
when<00:04:06.550> it<00:04:06.670> comes<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.780> hypertrophy<00:04:08.590> aspect

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
when it comes to the hypertrophy aspect

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.250 
when it comes to the hypertrophy aspect
of<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.370> people<00:04:10.270> will<00:04:10.420> argue<00:04:10.600> well<00:04:10.990> you're

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
of it people will argue well you're

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.020 
of it people will argue well you're
you're<00:04:11.590> using<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:12.040> heavier<00:04:12.370> weight<00:04:12.580> then<00:04:12.820> and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
you're using a heavier weight then and

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.400 
you're using a heavier weight then and
you're<00:04:13.180> doing<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.780> through<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.050> stronger

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
you're doing it through the stronger

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.570 
you're doing it through the stronger
range<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.740> motion<00:04:15.010> because<00:04:15.190> you're<00:04:15.310> it's

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
range of motion because you're it's

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.699 
range of motion because you're it's
helping<00:04:15.820> you<00:04:15.910> out<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.209> bottom<00:04:16.480> you're<00:04:17.440> not

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
helping you out of the bottom you're not

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.670 
helping you out of the bottom you're not
if<00:04:17.980> you<00:04:18.520> want<00:04:18.730> to<00:04:18.820> do<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.270> partial<00:04:19.780> rep<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.440> work

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
if you want to do a partial rep to work

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.670 
if you want to do a partial rep to work
the<00:04:20.919> top<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.549> lift<00:04:21.850> or<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:23.470> get<00:04:23.620> more

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
the top of a lift or to get more

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.010 
the top of a lift or to get more
hypertrophy<00:04:24.580> through<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.850> higher

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
hypertrophy through a higher

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.450 
hypertrophy through a higher
work<00:04:26.229> alone<00:04:26.380> through<00:04:26.740> there<00:04:26.919> you<00:04:27.099> need<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.340> do

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
work alone through there you need to do

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.890 
work alone through there you need to do
it<00:04:27.580> from<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.819> dead<00:04:28.030> stop<00:04:28.360> because<00:04:28.720> you're

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
it from a dead stop because you're

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.529 
it from a dead stop because you're
bouncing<00:04:29.349> from<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.650> bottom<00:04:30.210> you're<00:04:31.210> lifting

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
bouncing from the bottom you're lifting

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.159 
bouncing from the bottom you're lifting
a<00:04:31.840> heavier<00:04:32.259> weight<00:04:33.180> for<00:04:34.180> those<00:04:34.360> reps<00:04:34.660> but<00:04:35.020> it's

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
a heavier weight for those reps but it's

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.809 
a heavier weight for those reps but it's
not<00:04:35.349> your<00:04:35.590> muscles<00:04:36.039> actually<00:04:36.220> lifting<00:04:36.729> the

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
not your muscles actually lifting the

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.730 
not your muscles actually lifting the
light<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:37.539> you're<00:04:37.690> not<00:04:37.810> actually<00:04:38.289> getting<00:04:38.470> any

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
light so you're not actually getting any

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.620 
light so you're not actually getting any
more<00:04:39.039> muscle<00:04:39.400> stimulation<00:04:39.849> from<00:04:40.090> doing<00:04:40.449> it

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
more muscle stimulation from doing it

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.230 
more muscle stimulation from doing it
because<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.500> actual<00:04:42.009> floor<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.580> doing<00:04:42.849> work

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
because the actual floor is doing work

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.420 
because the actual floor is doing work
not<00:04:43.690> your<00:04:43.930> muscles<00:04:44.289> because<00:04:44.680> if<00:04:44.919> it<00:04:45.039> drops

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
not your muscles because if it drops

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.730 
not your muscles because if it drops
you're<00:04:45.699> getting<00:04:45.910> energy<00:04:46.360> as<00:04:46.569> the<00:04:47.319> object

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
you're getting energy as the object

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.230 
you're getting energy as the object
drops<00:04:47.889> its<00:04:48.160> building<00:04:48.460> kinetic<00:04:48.789> energy<00:04:49.120> and

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
drops its building kinetic energy and

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.670 
drops its building kinetic energy and
hits<00:04:49.449> the<00:04:49.569> floor<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:49.960> bounces<00:04:50.289> often<00:04:50.560> that's

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
hits the floor and bounces often that's

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.710 
hits the floor and bounces often that's
what's<00:04:50.860> getting<00:04:51.069> the<00:04:51.160> weight<00:04:51.310> started<00:04:51.759> so

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
what's getting the weight started so

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.110 
what's getting the weight started so
you're<00:04:52.900> just<00:04:53.110> continuing<00:04:54.099> to<00:04:54.460> accelerate<00:04:54.759> an

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
you're just continuing to accelerate an

you're just continuing to accelerate an
already<00:04:55.419> moving<00:04:55.599> object<00:04:56.110> it's<00:04:56.620> not<00:04:56.860> giving

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
already moving object it's not giving

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.129 
already moving object it's not giving
you<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.550> same<00:04:57.729> benefits<00:04:58.270> you're<00:04:58.539> not<00:04:58.659> getting

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
you the same benefits you're not getting

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.529 
you the same benefits you're not getting
more<00:04:59.349> hypertrophy<00:04:59.979> or<00:05:00.009> more<00:05:00.340> muscle<00:05:01.330> fiber

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
more hypertrophy or more muscle fiber

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.360 
more hypertrophy or more muscle fiber
recruitment<00:05:01.930> then<00:05:02.680> had<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:02.889> pulled<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.280> from

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
recruitment then had you pulled it from

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.830 
recruitment then had you pulled it from
a<00:05:03.520> dead<00:05:03.699> stop<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:04.150> in<00:05:04.240> fact<00:05:04.389> you<00:05:04.539> would<00:05:04.659> get<00:05:04.810> a

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
a dead stop and in fact you would get a

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.480 
a dead stop and in fact you would get a
hell<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.259> lot<00:05:05.409> more<00:05:05.620> as<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:05.889> pulled<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.400> from

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
hell of a lot more as you pulled it from

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.909 
hell of a lot more as you pulled it from
a<00:05:06.639> dead<00:05:06.819> stop<00:05:07.090> because<00:05:07.599> your<00:05:07.930> actual<00:05:08.380> muscle

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
a dead stop because your actual muscle

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.120 
a dead stop because your actual muscle
fibers<00:05:09.400> are<00:05:09.690> having<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.810> do<00:05:10.990> all<00:05:11.500> of<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.979> work

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
fibers are having to do all of the work

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.480 
fibers are having to do all of the work
and<00:05:12.340> that's<00:05:12.940> what<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.240> want<00:05:14.069> very<00:05:15.069> simple

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
and that's what you want very simple

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.040 
and that's what you want very simple
concept<00:05:15.940> if<00:05:16.030> you<00:05:16.120> want<00:05:16.300> a<00:05:16.360> muscle<00:05:16.539> fiber<00:05:16.690> to

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
concept if you want a muscle fiber to

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.870 
concept if you want a muscle fiber to
get<00:05:17.169> bigger<00:05:17.409> it<00:05:17.710> needs<00:05:18.009> to<00:05:18.159> do<00:05:18.310> some<00:05:18.520> work<00:05:18.699> that

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
get bigger it needs to do some work that

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.320 
get bigger it needs to do some work that
needs<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.150> contract<00:05:19.630> so<00:05:20.400> for<00:05:21.400> either<00:05:21.789> strength

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
needs to contract so for either strength

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.820 
needs to contract so for either strength
or<00:05:22.479> hypertrophy<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.289> need<00:05:23.440> to<00:05:23.560> follow<00:05:23.680> the

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
or hypertrophy you need to follow the

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.790 
or hypertrophy you need to follow the
exact<00:05:24.250> same<00:05:24.280> method<00:05:24.789> here<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:25.060> need<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.300> stop

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
exact same method here you need to stop

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.159 
exact same method here you need to stop
pause<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.250> reset<00:05:28.210> whatever<00:05:28.569> your<00:05:28.750> setup<00:05:29.050> is

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
pause and reset whatever your setup is

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.629 
pause and reset whatever your setup is
so<00:05:29.349> that<00:05:29.470> you<00:05:29.530> get<00:05:29.740> perfect<00:05:30.159> reps<00:05:30.340> every

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
so that you get perfect reps every

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.999 
so that you get perfect reps every
single<00:05:31.000> time<00:05:31.289> all<00:05:32.289> right<00:05:32.320> guys<00:05:32.560> that's<00:05:32.800> really
