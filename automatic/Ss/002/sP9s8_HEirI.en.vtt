00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
 I still suffer well, we're here to talk some more. 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.550
 under the theme on the very cool subject you are smarter 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.209
 perpendicular 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.940
 so to represent you better I put here in the stylistic cat the 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:13.909
 institution 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.209
 and two grandchildren 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.449
 ciao ya thais 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.099
 in some cases as the burning is reduced 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.099
 which has a coefficient of grinding 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.009
 or integrate 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.899
 they almost know me to finish 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.779
 but your point in those goals are going to be written so we will not get in too much 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.499
 in common on this merit 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.680
 already home more by another side 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.330
 How does the mullah sit? 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
 that I can feel the air 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.840
 khatami people that the world 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.120
 of the love that exists in front and herrera 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 do not forget we always need to measure 2 20 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.680
 fails counterclockwise 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.820
 so for example 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.390
 the hamburg wants until he is going to make elcio that is why the coefficient to 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.200
 ball touching the beam 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.210
 it will be so special 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.510
 the place is even going to do with us but if the offer 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.070
 that's why the grind coefficient on the straight is whether it will certainly offer 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.470
 what is the relation that has to exist if mpf also wants to see it appear 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.450
 is that those two who became sick perpendicular 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.800
 if you stop a little pink house so that the northern 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.270
 who will be so good and who has as one of his tormentors that the guardianship 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.530
 there is an action that says the following 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.490
 in a triangle one of the external students 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.759
 will always be the sum of the other two inmates 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.960
 was from there that I return not from May the creators that the sum 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.460
 of the other two inmates 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.260
 here folks 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.700
 I can then close is 90 degrees but hall 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.890
 Besides that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 I'm going to say that the black tangent is equal to the tangent 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.810
 of 90 michael I came back since we are equal 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.120
 so what will definitely berta we know there at coralnet website kurt a 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.930
 people hire more alpha equals less with so many alpha people 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.419
 we have to remember that it points in the opposite direction, the people 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.829
 but what is minus sign - in several people is one about the tragedy 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.049
 so I'm doing alpha tangent prank I'm going to pass on here 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.099
 multiplying 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.169
 How are you going to stay? 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.219
 so we just wait, we hosted the -1 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.290
 now remembered this year's explanation and who is currently trying to try to feel 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.859
 formulated straight lines that try to alpha because you feel now report reacting 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:36.829
 whenever two ships but perpendicular the producer who made 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.159
 things without horny dollars will always give less one 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.139
 that she needed a straight 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.309
 he takes a second try is a part of her home and two of adhesion 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:51.869
 perpendicular reminds us of the product we meet are glued on both straight 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.789
 try to give at least one 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.379
 I played such good evidence that it was substantial
