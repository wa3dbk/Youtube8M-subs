00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.559
 one of the protagonists of Sunday 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.440
 d'italia from which clubbing is a dj 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.249
 Italian he calls himself very Italian 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.249
 dj tuft 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.189
 we meet him before he gets in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.800
 console for his dj set and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.060
 we ask how it is I am very well like 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.060
 always see 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.130
 but you luca cassani and isa b for this 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.200
 on Sunday we say that by now by 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.420
 a few years we have set the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.470
 Sunday 6 arini from a weekend Friday e 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.410
 Saturday where more house vowers who more 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.629
 electric cars 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.370
 let's say house but with a certain class 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.440
 on Sundays the customer also wants to 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.140
 being a little more rounded is therefore the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.550
 first part we do it all with authors 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.160
 trying to use 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.290
 always to taste it with your own 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.110
 taste of each of us and I see that it is 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 very priced then two later in the arc 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.080
 the evening will also be used 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.790
 however, the concentration of the week remains 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.370
 obviously the Sunday of the here and historical 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 and it is always beautiful so there is no one 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.080
 evening that is hard to find one evening 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.310
 a brutal Sunday here therefore every 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.310
 Sunday to its charm 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.580
 13 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.710
 what is a record that cannot 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.679
 absolutely miss in an evening like 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.189
 this but I have to tell you the truth tonight 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.250
 I have not used it, however, a historical record that 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.000
 but still today for a certain audience 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.610
 it's not easy and it 's daiana ros boss 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.549
 it was also resumed later 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.150
 several times and let's say my record 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.709
 historian that I always have in my suitcase with me 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.830
 let's say I have seven copies on vinyl 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.760
 originals of the motown 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.150
 I think it's a 77 if I remember correctly and it is 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.019
 a record that does not 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.209
 I will never remove from the say again 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.840
 from my suitcases even if they are now records 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.840
 you are not anymore 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170
 no 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.710
 for a DJ like you who started with 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.280
 vinyls now computer cd or flash drive 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.610
 usb 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.570
 I must say that with the evolution of 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.550
 technology 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.120
 as not 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.799
 and never took the computer thing 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.739
 it is easier for me to work with 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:03.250
 digital sticks having a car 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.370
 like the cd of the 2000 of the penalty because me 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.950
 I am one that the 70 thousand vinyls I have a 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.930
 home I recognize them all from the covers 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.230
 because I have no memory for titles and names 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.500
 and therefore these machines like this 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.060
 cd of the 2000 as well as the computer but 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.250
 I don't like it from the public and therefore 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.470
 the only machine to dry because 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.460
 it also allows you to have both 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.640
 original covers 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.580
 the disks now cover them all now 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.390
 they have its original covers ones 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.290
 that I've gone from vinyl like this 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.569
 photocopied his original cover 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.190
 I applied it above every title 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.320
 that I put in I can recognize 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.600
 I do not remember the name of the still 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.600
 cover for me is a nice advantage 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.860
 which song of winter 2012 2013 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.520
 could be a new hit for the 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.520
 next summer 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.190
 I don't know why he's still there now 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.260
 all winter in front and summer 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.850
 next can change many things 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.489
 even though I see there it continues to 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.450
 depopulate the electro yet but there is a 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.610
 return to the lounge anyway and therefore to 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.490
 start from the deep that has become a 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.249
 kind of club now become too 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:37.339
 commercial in every room e 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:41.269
 and I really hope that next summer 

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:43.789
 there is a beautiful it with melodies with con 

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:45.679
 sounds not the usual electro 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.569
 why not to me sincerely a little 

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:50.689
 tired then I see that young people still 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:53.629
 love it so much and we'll see but I hope that 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.669
 may be a nice piece maybe with a 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.089
 nice engraved a beautiful song 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.089
 we see 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.280
 italy equal crisis to be the same 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.120
 golden moment 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.229
 you as you see it but I from Italian doc 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.960
 because in any case abroad as a DJ and there 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.960
 little work since I don't do it 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.960
 productions 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.550
 remain purely Italian each 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.080
 so I happen to go abroad for 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.680
 abroad and always fascinating so many 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.450
 they say ah I work only abroad 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.070
 according to me Italy as Italy there 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.270
 the problem is that there are few places 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.470
 obviously we live in a moment 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.480
 difficult and many do not want to invest 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.080
 they don't want to do this in my opinion it is 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.410
 wrong because since you take away 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.270
 everything is finished 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.330
 I continue to struggle to ensure that in 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.150
 Italy can still maintain one 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.370
 certain quality a certain level and being able to do it 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.930
 then obviously expose abroad though 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.300
 export abroad 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.560
 but you have to start from Italy in my opinion 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.210
 the samp loses Italy for a moment 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.430
 difficult if the crisis and aim 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.430
 only those abroad are wrong 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.370
 tuft we thank you and give you 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:29.370
 next appointment on in joy 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.370
 see you in the TV room
