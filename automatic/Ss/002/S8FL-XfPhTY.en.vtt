bar lock you have to keep your fly bar

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.720 
bar lock you have to keep your fly bar
perfectly<00:01:16.480> level<00:01:16.840> as<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.140> can<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.460> thing

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
perfectly level as you can the thing

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.700 
perfectly level as you can the thing
that<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:20.310> find<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.580> whole<00:01:21.820> new<00:01:22.060> level<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.750> kind

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
that I find a whole new level and kind

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.550 
that I find a whole new level and kind
of<00:01:23.830> look<00:01:23.979> at<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.250> pitches<00:01:24.670> same<00:01:25.030> time<00:01:25.560> no

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
of look at the pitches same time no

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.200 
of look at the pitches same time no
because<00:01:26.830> if<00:01:27.010> it<00:01:27.130> moves<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.610> little<00:01:27.760> bit<00:01:28.030> like

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
because if it moves a little bit like

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.420 
because if it moves a little bit like
that<00:01:28.479> then<00:01:29.380> your<00:01:29.650> pitch<00:01:29.860> could<00:01:30.100> be<00:01:30.250> off<00:01:30.400> a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
that then your pitch could be off a

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.670 
that then your pitch could be off a
degree<00:01:30.880> or<00:01:31.030> two<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.840> that's<00:01:32.050> why<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.290> can't

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
degree or two so that's why you can't

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.710 
degree or two so that's why you can't
use<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:32.979> digital<00:01:33.340> pitch<00:01:33.760> gauge<00:01:34.060> without<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.479> fly
