00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.710
 I've never been good at playing 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.570
 soccer as a child since not 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.219
 I was part of that group of children i 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.599
 hardcore fans who knew the names of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.400
 all the hunters by heart, yes 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.109
 they felt deeply wounded when there 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.699
 their team lost and they did 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.140
 fierce discussions to try to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.880
 prove that their team was 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.199
 better and that they always found one 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.760
 sorry to start a game 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 this does not mean that I did not play 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.939
 to soccer with them simply I was 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.920
 where the child came every time 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.779
 put in the door and everyone knows what matters 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.489
 nobody wants to be here except me 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 I could do my cocks all over 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 time losing even those few 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.890
 moments when something needed in 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
 some cases I was also referee e 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.250
 everyone knows that in a soccer game 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.739
 among children the referee is a ball boy 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.550
 however I played and of victory not me 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.260
 he didn't care 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.700
 unlike all the others that yes 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.410
 they got angry in the worst ways for 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.730
 any foul obviously having like 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.350
 idol footballers could not make a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 less to complete like them and spit 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.649
 on the ground every three seconds and what me 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.030
 I didn't do it but on the other hand I spit 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.920
 when I speak without realizing it 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.899
 the truth is that I have never been 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.500
 really competitive in sports in 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.820
 general 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.470
 in short, even during the hour of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.330
 physical education that 90 percent 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.040
 sometimes you play volleyball 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.780
 the important thing for me is to finish the hour 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.369
 and have fun even tasting doing 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.960
 pretend to play volleyball I don't hold 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.850
 account of points neither of fouls nor of whom 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.650
 he has to beat or whoever has to win but there is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.790
 always the opposite specimen that yes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 it pisses and calls everyone 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.150
 to the order that you score is that it ends 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.710
 match does yes i won 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.909
 I must say that in any case they predominate 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.189
 those who do not want too much 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.570
 play also because usually if all 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.549
 rather clumsy and uncoordinated a 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.390
 school volleyball football never is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.950
 was my sport 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.990
 sometimes I have to play 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.549
 I mean a match between friends and there 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.930
 always a little embarrassed because not 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.939
 I want to be what he says right away 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.950
 no so i just say if you want 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.630
 game but are obviously scarce 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 reaction of others is always and that you 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.470
 scrub play we're among friends but it's not 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.880
 true because in football games 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.290
 even the most friendly 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.180
 victory is a matter of life or 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.590
 death at the end when he is 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.939
 playing I can no longer pull myself 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.439
 back and I ca n't vague not 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.119
 it would make sense so he started playing 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.950
 bad with boldness and without shame 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.540
 I had told him after all that I was 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.149
 not even the ball flies mine 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.860
 sports in basketball I never found one 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.480
 sport that really took me 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.009
 especially if this is not a team 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.750
 means that I do not do activities 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.280
 physics i like to move i keep in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.450
 form let's say I try when I was 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.280
 little I played basketball 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.440
 then I did two years of gymnastics 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.330
 acrobatic which is gymnastic type 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.070
 artistic but only the free body does not 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.530
 I was too worn so I broke up and 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.390
 now i do crossfit it's cool thing 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.040
 very obviously the a 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.080
 level sucks I don't race things 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.150
 of the kind and gym type only one 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.100
 sport while doing gym is just not 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.520
 do a sport anyway as I always say 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.290
 I 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.730
 the important thing is not to become gods 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.920
 invertebrates in all the rest is 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.990
 superfluous at the end excluded calcium and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.820
 the hour of physical education if there is 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.650
 you need to be competitive too 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.180
 a bit like when I was a little boy 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.930
 competing with my brother for those who open 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.930
 first the door
