00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
some reason since I've downloaded this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.570 
some reason since I've downloaded this
mod<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:10.229> has<00:01:10.470> been<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:11.010> bit<00:01:11.220> laggy<00:01:11.430> I'm

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
mod it has been a little bit laggy I'm

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.219 
mod it has been a little bit laggy I'm
not<00:01:11.700> gonna<00:01:11.850> lie<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> reason<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.110> because

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
not gonna lie but the reason is because

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
not gonna lie but the reason is because
my<00:01:13.650> computer<00:01:13.860> can't<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.400> take<00:01:14.610> much

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
my computer can't really take much

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.770 
my computer can't really take much
anyways<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.630> having<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.180> program<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> mod<00:01:18.540> now

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
anyways and having to program a mod now

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.920 
anyways and having to program a mod now
if<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.970> quite<00:01:20.970> hard<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
if what it is quite hard so that's the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.359 
if what it is quite hard so that's the
only<00:01:22.049> reason<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.799> hopefully<00:01:22.979> fully

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
only reason it's like it hopefully fully

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
only reason it's like it hopefully fully
you<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.850> won't<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.150> laggy<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.750> it'll<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.049> so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you it won't be laggy and it'll be so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
you it won't be laggy and it'll be so
good<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.240> doing<00:01:27.450> right<00:01:27.600> now<00:01:27.659> is

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.660 
are new and if you go on balloon all of
these<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:48.750> balloons<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.470> go<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.829> top<00:01:50.220> that's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
these are balloons that go on top that's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.880 
these are balloons that go on top that's
why<00:01:50.850> I've<00:01:50.909> got<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.680> like

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
why I've got that up there it's like

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.670 
why I've got that up there it's like
that's<00:01:53.579> what<00:01:53.790> creates<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.630> lift<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.530> way

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
that's what creates the lift in a way

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
that's what creates the lift in a way
and<00:01:55.979> then<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.670> ship's<00:01:56.909> helm<00:01:57.119> allows<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and then the ship's helm allows you to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.160 
and then the ship's helm allows you to
kind<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.920> steer<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.520> around<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
kind of steer it around but you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.039 
kind of steer it around but you
definitely<00:02:01.560> need<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.460> ship's<00:02:02.759> helm<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.270> also

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
definitely need a ship's helm and also

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.709 
definitely need a ship's helm and also
the<00:02:04.619> balloons<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.149> I'm<00:02:06.240> gonna<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.540> is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
even 100 because the more it weighs the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.740 
even 100 because the more it weighs the
more<00:03:17.410> balloons<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.130> may<00:03:18.280> need<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.610> have<00:03:18.820> which
