00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
that this country is is even changed for

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
that this country is is even changed for
the<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.680> better<00:00:19.830> word<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.910> don't

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the one of a better word and I don't

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.759 
the one of a better word and I don't
think<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.539> for<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> betterment<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.500> and

we'd<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> nip<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.060> bud<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
we'd like to nip it in the bud and

way<00:00:42.890> when<00:00:43.890> she's<00:00:44.100> topped<00:00:44.370> herself<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.940> yep

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
way when she's topped herself up yep

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.940 
way when she's topped herself up yep
she's<00:00:45.600> now<00:00:45.780> made<00:00:46.050> ourselves<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> little

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
she's now made ourselves a little

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.790 
she's now made ourselves a little
armchair<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.760> yes<00:00:48.120> getting<00:00:48.570> deeper<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
armchair here yes getting deeper and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.580 
armchair here yes getting deeper and
wider<00:00:50.070> yes<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.300> look<00:00:51.480> over<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:52.079> yes

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
wider yes and if we look over there yes

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.560 
wider yes and if we look over there yes
we<00:00:53.010> will<00:00:53.100> find<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.550> these<00:00:53.850> two<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:54.360> join

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
we will find that these two will join

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.170 
we will find that these two will join
yes<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.800> pretty<00:00:56.070> soon<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> fingers<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.059> we

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
yes so pretty soon the fingers that we

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
yes so pretty soon the fingers that we
have<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:57.960> yeah<00:00:58.649> will<00:00:59.219> become

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
have going like that yeah will become

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.560 
have going like that yeah will become
one<00:01:00.210> massive<00:01:00.539> yep<00:01:01.350> gully<00:01:01.829> hidden<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.329> have

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
one massive yep gully hidden so we have

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.770 
one massive yep gully hidden so we have
to<00:01:03.809> intervene<00:01:04.320> yeah<00:01:04.920> stop<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.000> put<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
to intervene yeah stop it and put the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.500 
to intervene yeah stop it and put the
water<00:01:06.990> back<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.619> country<00:01:07.830> yes<00:01:11.510> gullies

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
water back on the country yes gullies

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
water back on the country yes gullies
form<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.320> surface<00:01:13.830> water<00:01:14.100> drops<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.670> natural

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the base of the scalp undermines it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
the base of the scalp undermines it

scarp upslope this was a natural broad
drainage<00:01:34.140> once<00:01:34.770> again<00:01:35.100> we've<00:01:35.280> turned<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.759> into

deeper waters come in dropped so anytime

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.590 
deeper waters come in dropped so anytime
that<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.350> drop<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.799> water<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:46.189> erosion

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
that you drop your water you get erosion

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.810 
that you drop your water you get erosion

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
are forced to cope with less water so

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.029 
are forced to cope with less water so
we're<00:02:07.079> getting<00:02:07.250> one<00:02:08.250> side<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> gully

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
we're getting one side of the gully

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.149 
we're getting one side of the gully
plenty<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:10.819> feed<00:02:11.120> plenty<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.659> grass<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.920> you

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
plenty of feed plenty of grass and you

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.099 
plenty of feed plenty of grass and you
get<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.459> other<00:02:13.640> side<00:02:14.290> dehydration<00:02:15.290> now<00:02:15.739> yep

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
get the other side dehydration now yep

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.110 
get the other side dehydration now yep
so<00:02:18.109> yeah<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.829> dehydration<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.640> happening<00:02:19.969> and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
so yeah the dehydration is happening and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.759 
so yeah the dehydration is happening and
you<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.659> can<00:02:20.810> see<00:02:20.989> its<00:02:21.140> own<00:02:21.290> sometimes

you go for the whole walk along here yes
I<00:02:28.040> bet<00:02:28.519> this<00:02:28.700> side<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.260> dehydrated<00:02:30.260> yes<00:02:30.439> rather

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
I bet this side is dehydrated yes rather

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.039 
I bet this side is dehydrated yes rather
than<00:02:31.159> that<00:02:31.280> side<00:02:31.519> because<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:32.359> has<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.780> drop

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
than that side because this has to drop

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.339 
than that side because this has to drop
yes<00:02:33.500> here<00:02:33.950> yes<00:02:34.430> whereas<00:02:34.879> this<00:02:35.120> comes<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.109> sits

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
yes here yes whereas this comes and sits

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.500 
yes here yes whereas this comes and sits
for<00:02:36.769> more<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.530> yeah<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.859> water<00:02:40.099> that<00:02:40.510> tries

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
for more so yeah so the water that tries

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.869 
for more so yeah so the water that tries
to<00:02:41.540> get<00:02:41.810> across<00:02:42.079> there<00:02:42.730> because<00:02:43.730> it's

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
to get across there because it's

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.300 
to get across there because it's
dropping<00:02:44.359> so<00:02:44.569> much<00:02:44.780> its<00:02:45.319> dehydrating<00:02:46.220> and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
dropping so much its dehydrating and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.220 
dropping so much its dehydrating and
this<00:02:46.489> little<00:02:46.760> girl<00:02:46.970> here<00:02:47.239> yeah<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.930> just

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
sucking the hell out of here yep galleys

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.589 
sucking the hell out of here yep galleys
can<00:02:51.319> also<00:02:51.470> drain<00:02:51.950> areas<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.639> kill<00:02:52.819> vegetation

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
can also drain areas and kill vegetation

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.539

that no longer has enough water to

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.809 
that no longer has enough water to
survive<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.560> obviously<00:03:01.099> because<00:03:01.430> it's<00:03:01.700> got<00:03:01.790> a

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819

these trees if and and they're fairly
lush<00:03:08.959> even<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.769> this<00:03:09.829> arid<00:03:10.159> area<00:03:10.459> yeah<00:03:12.609> we'll

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
lush even in this arid area yeah we'll

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.509 
lush even in this arid area yeah we'll
look<00:03:13.879> we'll<00:03:14.090> end<00:03:14.329> up<00:03:14.449> losing<00:03:18.129> we<00:03:19.129> look<00:03:19.310> down

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
look we'll end up losing we look down

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.659 
look we'll end up losing we look down
here<00:03:19.989> there's<00:03:20.989> something<00:03:21.250> very<00:03:22.250> sinister

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
here there's something very sinister

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.469 
here there's something very sinister
creeping<00:03:23.329> up<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:25.340> stop<00:03:25.639> galleys<00:03:26.060> eating<00:03:26.359> up

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
creeping up to stop galleys eating up

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.809 
creeping up to stop galleys eating up
slope<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.169> continuing<00:03:27.889> to<00:03:28.010> take<00:03:28.220> water<00:03:28.489> from

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
slope and continuing to take water from

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.420 
slope and continuing to take water from
the<00:03:29.000> land<00:03:29.239> we<00:03:29.780> start<00:03:30.109> by<00:03:30.290> finding<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.949> active

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
the land we start by finding the active

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.969 
the land we start by finding the active
Nick<00:03:31.699> points<00:03:32.090> down<00:03:32.329> slope<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.959> limit<00:03:33.440> inflow

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:33.979 
Nick points down slope and limit inflow

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.360 
Nick points down slope and limit inflow
by<00:03:34.250> diverting<00:03:34.760> water<00:03:35.120> away<00:03:35.780> with<00:03:36.019> banks<00:03:36.440> so

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
by diverting water away with banks so

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.490 
by diverting water away with banks so
what<00:03:37.549> we'd<00:03:37.729> have<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:37.879> do<00:03:38.150> first<00:03:38.449> up<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:39.260> we'd

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
what we'd have to do first up is we'd

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.699 
what we'd have to do first up is we'd
have<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.799> go<00:03:39.919> upstairs<00:03:40.250> here<00:03:41.169> shape<00:03:42.169> cut

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
have to go upstairs here shape cut

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.849 
have to go upstairs here shape cut
batter<00:03:43.449> put<00:03:44.449> our<00:03:44.599> banks<00:03:44.959> in<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.409> spread<00:03:45.709> the

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
batter put our banks in to spread the

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.159 
batter put our banks in to spread the
water<00:03:46.069> out<00:03:46.370> evenly<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.269> it<00:03:47.419> starts<00:03:47.780> sheeting

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
water out evenly so it starts sheeting

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.460 
water out evenly so it starts sheeting
and<00:03:48.769> as<00:03:49.040> we<00:03:49.220> work<00:03:49.519> on<00:03:49.699> down<00:03:49.940> slope<00:03:50.479> we<00:03:51.139> check

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
and as we work on down slope we check

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.189 
and as we work on down slope we check
bank<00:03:51.680> everything<00:03:52.190> we<00:03:53.150> also<00:03:53.359> take<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.930> sides

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
bank everything we also take the sides

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.589 
bank everything we also take the sides
there<00:03:54.439> the<00:03:54.620> steepness<00:03:54.889> of<00:03:55.159> the<00:03:55.220> sides<00:03:55.599> you

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
there the steepness of the sides you

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.179 
there the steepness of the sides you
know<00:03:56.689> if<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.019> don't<00:03:57.260> knock<00:03:57.470> down<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.829> batters

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
know if you don't knock down the batters

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.000 
know if you don't knock down the batters
in<00:03:59.120> between<00:03:59.569> your<00:03:59.780> banks<00:04:00.169> you're<00:04:00.769> going<00:04:00.949> to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
in between your banks you're going to

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.589 
in between your banks you're going to
get<00:04:01.159> cinders<00:04:01.579> working<00:04:01.939> their<00:04:02.090> way<00:04:02.120> up<00:04:02.239> there

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
get cinders working their way up there

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.759 
get cinders working their way up there
because<00:04:02.900> there's<00:04:03.049> still<00:04:03.199> got<00:04:03.349> a<00:04:03.379> dropping

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
because there's still got a dropping
