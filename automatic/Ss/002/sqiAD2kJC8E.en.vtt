00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I've tried um if you almost seem like

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.979 
I've tried um if you almost seem like
the<00:00:55.170> previous<00:00:55.410> materials<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.690> you're<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the previous materials so if you're a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.330 
the previous materials so if you're a
mercurial<00:00:58.530> where<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> same<00:01:00.510> book

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340

mercurial where it is the same book
really<00:01:03.080> another<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.500> realized<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:07.070> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
really another thing I realized is so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.120 
really another thing I realized is so
the<00:01:08.400> soul<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.090> higher<00:01:09.900> bit<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.890> high

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the soul is now higher bit it's high

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.999 
the soul is now higher bit it's high
okay<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.780> thicker<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.000> run<00:01:16.009> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
okay it's thicker you can like run you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.039 
okay it's thicker you can like run you
can<00:01:17.189> feel<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.430> acceleration<00:01:17.960> faster<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
can feel the acceleration faster you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.420 
can feel the acceleration faster you
know<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:21.020> thickness<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.430> also

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
know because of the thickness and also

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.120 
know because of the thickness and also
the<00:01:23.610> hardness<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.330> harder<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.710> as

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the hardness it's harder now it's not as

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.240 
the hardness it's harder now it's not as
soft<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.659> actually<00:01:27.900> feel<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.979> lake
