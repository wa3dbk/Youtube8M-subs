sec<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:59.269> see<00:00:59.420> how<00:00:59.480> you<00:00:59.539> could<00:00:59.809> pair<00:00:59.929> with<00:00:59.989> the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
sec you see how you could pair with the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.670 
sec you see how you could pair with the
Excalibur<00:01:00.769> for<00:01:00.980> speed<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:02.780> high<00:01:02.960> armor<00:01:03.440> step

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.630 

she<00:01:51.330> I<00:01:51.660> would<00:01:52.140> probably<00:01:52.590> recommend<00:01:52.920> loving

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
she I would probably recommend loving

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.060 
she I would probably recommend loving
her<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.300> ninja<00:01:54.860> because<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:57.860> helps<00:01:58.860> her

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
her up as a ninja because it helps her

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.450 
her up as a ninja because it helps her
build<00:01:59.430> her<00:01:59.520> speed<00:02:00.120> which<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.260> like<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.980> said<00:02:02.280> one

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
build her speed which is like I said one

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.630 
build her speed which is like I said one
of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.700> factors<00:02:03.210> why<00:02:03.510> he<00:02:04.470> end<00:02:04.770> up<00:02:05.220> not<00:02:05.400> really

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
of the factors why he end up not really

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.480 
of the factors why he end up not really
using<00:02:06.300> her<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.770> other<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.070> is<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> movement

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
using her the other one is the movement

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.340 
using her the other one is the movement
and<00:02:08.880> that's<00:02:09.090> why<00:02:09.240> I<00:02:09.270> gave<00:02:09.360> her<00:02:09.660> teleport<00:02:10.200> but

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
and that's why I gave her teleport but

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.860 
and that's why I gave her teleport but
even<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:10.770> teleport<00:02:11.760> seen<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.120> success<00:02:12.600> all

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
even then teleport seen a success all

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.690 
even then teleport seen a success all
depends<00:02:13.350> on<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> character's<00:02:14.550> movement

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
depends on what the character's movement

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.390 
depends on what the character's movement
is<00:02:18.260> still<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.320> think<00:02:19.440> she<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.860> survive<00:02:20.160> this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
is still I think she can survive this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.970 
is still I think she can survive this
fight<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:21.240> not<00:02:21.390> gonna<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.630> easy<00:02:21.780> though<00:02:21.980> that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
fight it's not gonna be easy though that

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.310 
fight it's not gonna be easy though that
chocobo<00:02:23.490> is<00:02:23.970> gonna<00:02:24.240> piss<00:02:24.630> me<00:02:24.840> off<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.260> you
