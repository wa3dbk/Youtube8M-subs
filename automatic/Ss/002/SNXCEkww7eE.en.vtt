this<00:00:34.900> device<00:00:35.170> right<00:00:35.200> here<00:00:35.380> is<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.650> mock-up

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
this device right here is a mock-up

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.130 
this device right here is a mock-up
actually<00:00:36.340> over<00:00:36.550> 7<00:00:36.820> inch<00:00:36.940> tablet<00:00:37.000> which<00:00:37.990> is

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
actually over 7 inch tablet which is

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.780 
actually over 7 inch tablet which is
supposed<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.620> use<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.980> old<00:00:39.070> track<00:00:39.310> platform

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
supposed to use the old track platform

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.090 
supposed to use the old track platform
but<00:00:40.000> UCS<00:00:40.570> isn't<00:00:40.870> sure<00:00:40.990> about<00:00:41.050> reusing<00:00:41.830> this

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
but UCS isn't sure about reusing this

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.090 
but UCS isn't sure about reusing this
one<00:00:42.310> in<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:42.790> way<00:00:42.970> because<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:44.560> size<00:00:44.770> is<00:00:44.950> too

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
one in this way because the size is too

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.040 
one in this way because the size is too
small<00:00:45.130> for<00:00:45.610> typical<00:00:46.030> windows<00:00:46.300> interface<00:00:46.600> and

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
small for typical windows interface and

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.800 
small for typical windows interface and
right<00:00:48.010> now<00:00:48.160> they're<00:00:48.370> deciding<00:00:48.790> if<00:00:49.120> they<00:00:49.270> are

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
right now they're deciding if they are

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.740 
right now they're deciding if they are
going<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.050> put<00:00:50.200> it<00:00:50.290> out<00:00:50.410> in<00:00:50.590> whole<00:00:51.580> trail<00:00:51.820> or<00:00:52.150> as

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
going to put it out in whole trail or as

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.060 
going to put it out in whole trail or as
an<00:00:52.989> arm<00:00:53.200> device

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
an arm device

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.430 
an arm device
as<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.760> said<00:00:56.000> this<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.360> mock-up<00:00:56.720> so<00:00:56.989> it's<00:00:57.140> not

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
as I said this is a mock-up so it's not

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.650 
as I said this is a mock-up so it's not
actually<00:00:57.770> working<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.280> let's<00:00:59.239> take<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.450> quick

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
actually working it let's take a quick

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.110 
actually working it let's take a quick
look<00:00:59.750> around<00:00:59.870> then<00:01:00.460> down<00:01:01.460> here<00:01:01.489> we<00:01:01.730> have<00:01:02.000> the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
look around then down here we have the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.890

give you about five hours runtime the
device<00:02:09.270> itself<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.720> actually<00:02:09.869> pretty<00:02:10.200> late<00:02:10.440> as

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
device itself is actually pretty late as

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.940 
device itself is actually pretty late as
you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.160> always<00:02:11.310> 360<00:02:12.240> grams<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:12.950> as

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you can see it's always 360 grams but as

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.410 
you can see it's always 360 grams but as
I<00:02:14.100> said<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:14.520> not<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.670> finished<00:02:14.970> point<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.240> yet

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
I said it's not a finished point out yet

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.060 
I said it's not a finished point out yet
and<00:02:15.630> they're<00:02:15.840> still<00:02:16.020> working<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.500> all

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
and they're still working on it all

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.500
