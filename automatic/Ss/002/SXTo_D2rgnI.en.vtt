00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.510
 good today we're going to make chicken to the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.119
 orange the ingredients that we're going to 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.820
 use your chicken breasts any way 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.869
 breast or fillets cut it as we 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.899
 like water wheat flour brown sugar 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.750
 black pepper cornstarch paprika coriander 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:40.010
 ginger garlic powder lemongrass or 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.010
 citronella egg soy sauce and orange 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.870
 The first thing I do not know is preparing the 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.640
 things necessary to coat the chicken 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.560
 in a container we have picked an egg 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.680
 we have added salt and we have beaten 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.440
 On the other hand we have the flour of my 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.020
 dinner and here we have normal flour in 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.790
 this flour we're going to sound a little 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.410
 things that we see convenient in this 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.410
 case , add a little pepper 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.740
 and I of coriander is not going to be the species 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.740
 to indicate before the presentation 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.640
 free 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.180
 under the dust 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.590
 a little bit of demonstrating citronella 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.590
 it gives an acid touch 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.700
 and a little bit of paprika 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.200
 as we saw everything well 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.490
 and we reserve them 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.820
 once commented the flour with the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.430
 species we have caught the chicken that already 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.560
 we have more or less thick cut to 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.650
 when it's cold, it's good 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.480
 and here we have eggs 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.100
 flour with spices and cornstarch 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.270
 remember that we have changed the order of 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.710
 the dishes before the mention was here 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.020
 but as per the order we're going to use 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.140
 the dishes I have put the medicine here in 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.640
 first place therefore like the chicken 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.640
 we went through the cornstarch 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.480
 from the cornstarch to the egg 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.480
 yours or that you take few pieces to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.930
 that did not stick to the other 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.930
 and the egg is well spent 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.660
 to the flour with its thick 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.910
 dynamo 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.930
 we remove the excess and separate 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.930
 we will be with all the chicken 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.670
 while the chicken rests with the flour and 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.250
 the species on the one hand we have taken a 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.250
 pan and we will add water 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.380
 the same amount of orange juice 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.810
 a little bit of brown sugar 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.760
 the scratches of the orange 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.680
 put a little more ginger 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.920
 and soy sauce 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.810
 when you are 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.280
 let's put it on medium high fire and then 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.280
 of rest about ten minutes 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.540
 while the sidewalks that are going on 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.150
 that lasts frying pan with a little bit of oil 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.100
 olive oil and over high heat and with 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.850
 this let's fry 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.110
 the chicken we will be in this golden and 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.980
 that the rest of the chicken is for when 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.310
 it is within the same house orange 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.989
 we add them and we're going giving 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.989
 turn so that everything is integrated 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.470
 after there has been during a 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.829
 time as you see the farce if still 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.990
 follow 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.620
 It is still liquid and what we have done for 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.460
 one side 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.510
 one third cup about 120 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.720
 ml of we have thrown two tablespoons of 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.139
 cornstarch we have moved well and we are going to 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.139
 to incorporate 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.009
 I think it's going to be a thickener is it going to 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.660
 put the sauce thicker and with more 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.870
 consistency and not as light as it is 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.870
 now 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.530
 as seen since approximately 23 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.530
 minutes you will give like the sauce already heavy 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.960
 as you see after having passed two 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.169
 minutes with the orange sauce and the 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.039
 Cornstarch consistency is that 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:09.580
 We wanted a kind of birds because 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:12.159
 we make at low heat and we finished 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.659
 bake and make the chicken that we had 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.659
 fried in the same house in the americas 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.800
 I do not see it a bit so I take all the 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.240
 chicken flavor of the sauce and we would have 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.240
 the chicken would only be missing 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.540
 well nothing like you see this aspect of 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.400
 our orange chicken that we have 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.840
 we are going to do and from there we go 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.190
 accompanied a little bit of rice for the 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.600
 late they have lived the nude 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.970
 which are faster is also very 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.220
 good yes I'm used to with less 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.050
 Chinese could see that this recipe for me 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.240
 is more good than the one they put in 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.710
 the restaurants and I think you like us 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.270
 we see the next recipe and remember 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.340
 subscribe to be informed of 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.340
 all our video awards until then 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.259
 do not 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.580
 ah
