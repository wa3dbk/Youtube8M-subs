00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
going to start on and it's going to be I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810 
going to start on and it's going to be I
think<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.809> did<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.350> say<00:00:43.469> maximum<00:00:43.950> fight<00:00:44.250> like

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
think of did you say maximum fight like

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
think of did you say maximum fight like
a<00:00:44.850> 5k<00:00:45.420> player<00:00:45.660> yeah<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.829> probably

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
a 5k player yeah I think that's probably

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.090 
a 5k player yeah I think that's probably
discuss<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:48.270> would<00:00:48.390> say<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.960> player<00:00:49.440> was

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
discuss that would say a player was

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
discuss that would say a player was
5,000<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.210> trading<00:00:51.449> with

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
5,000 so we're going to be trading with

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.729 
5,000 so we're going to be trading with
one<00:00:51.719> player<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> end<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
one player and so you end up with the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.029 
one player and so you end up with the
most<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> end<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> week<00:00:54.239> yeah<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.860> um

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
most at the end of the week yeah but um

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
most at the end of the week yeah but um
the<00:00:56.430> way<00:00:56.550> we're<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> kind<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.510> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the way we're going to kind of do it is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
the way we're going to kind of do it is
I<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.859> we're<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.550> obviously<00:00:59.850> do

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
I think we're going to just obviously do

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.450 
I think we're going to just obviously do
it<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.239> player<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.739> FEI<00:01:02.010> 10k

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it with one player and so it's FEI 10k

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.289 
it with one player and so it's FEI 10k
then<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.940> must<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.359> saved<00:01:04.280> 5k<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.610> yeah<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.090> we

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
then we must be saved 5k so yeah that we

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.730 
then we must be saved 5k so yeah that we
might<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> pick<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.200> three<00:01:07.470> players

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
might be have to pick like three players

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740 
might be have to pick like three players
up<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:08.520> sell<00:01:08.729> them<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.299> about

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
up and then sell them on for about about

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230

going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.149> quite<00:01:48.240> interested<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.049> i

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
going to be quite interested to see if i

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
going to be quite interested to see if i
can<00:01:49.409> put<00:01:49.530> effort<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.189> hopefully<00:01:50.700> level

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
can put effort in and hopefully level

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
can put effort in and hopefully level
out<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.290> feels<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.590> hopefully<00:01:52.860> as

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
out the but it feels and hopefully as

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.590 
out the but it feels and hopefully as
much<00:01:53.159> money<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.149> think<00:01:54.420> we're<00:01:54.509> going

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
much money is in so we think we're going

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.469 
much money is in so we think we're going
to<00:01:54.689> call<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.020> series<00:01:55.640> beast<00:01:56.640> versus<00:01:57.090> bad<00:01:57.299> or

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
to call this series beast versus bad or

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
to call this series beast versus bad or
bad<00:01:57.630> versus<00:01:58.049> beast<00:01:58.259> adversity<00:01:58.950> sounds<00:01:59.520> better

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
bad versus beast adversity sounds better

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.280 
bad versus beast adversity sounds better
but<00:01:59.939> i<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.360> we're<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.079> in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
but i think we're going to do it as in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.859 
but i think we're going to do it as in
um<00:02:01.439> i<00:02:01.829> denied<00:02:02.790> there<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> minute<00:02:03.390> ago<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.840> i

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
um i denied there a minute ago but i

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.100 
um i denied there a minute ago but i
totally<00:02:04.110> forgot<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.460> lost<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
totally forgot it and lost it but I'm I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.570

think<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.619> more<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.280> will<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.399> like

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
think it's more I think it will be like

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.150 
think it's more I think it will be like
10<00:02:08.849> rounds<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.780> first<00:02:10.020> win<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.920> ten

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
10 rounds like the first win at ten

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.320

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
episode so because it could technically

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.400

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
go down to like 20 episodes but then it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.710
