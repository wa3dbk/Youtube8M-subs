00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 customers and I want to talk to you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 about pay-per-click structuring more 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 how to properly structured your 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 This is a lot of money now 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 or facets to creating a well-organized 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 sustainable paper with a campaign 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 keywords are one of the biggest single 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 areas that you should focus on 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 chances are you're going to be missing 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 some key areas or some key issues when 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 it comes to talking about keywords like this 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 let's start there are proper keywords 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 course very important because you know 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 this is the obvious point if you're 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 selling boats you don't want to be 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 advertising for socks and vice versa 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 negative keywords however are equally 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 important negative keywords prevent your 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 ads from showing up when they shouldn't 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 so if you're an attorney you may want 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 people who are searching for 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 attorney to find your ads but not people 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 who are searching for an attorney 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 school this laugh group would most 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 likely to be people looking for a law 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 they would be costing the school 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 advertiser every single time they 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 erroneously clicked on their ads 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 negative keywords prevent your ads from running 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 showing to people who are looking for 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 seemingly related but not really 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 relevant terms generally avoid broad 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 matched keywords what does that mean 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Well just trust me when I say never use 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 broad match keywords especially not all 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 by themselves never ever ever just don't 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 do it instead of use phrase and exact match 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 keywords are broad match only campaigns 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 are probably the number one biggest 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 mistake many first-time PPC advertisers 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 making it winds up costing them a lot of 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 money what's the difference well look at 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 These three terms are all three 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 chiropractor on give you an example of 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 using each of them in and add 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 campaign so if you're using a broad word 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 match forward chiropractor anytime 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 anyone types in anything that has 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 something to do with Google's chiropractor 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 will say you know what I think 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 this is relevant to your ad and they'll 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 show your ad to these people and so when 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 someone types in good chiropractors are 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 bath care of practice doctors 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 work chiropractic schools or 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 chiropractic job openings all of these 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 are going to wind up being people who 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 See your ads and they're going to click 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 on it and waste your money or not click 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 on it and drive down your click-through 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 rate which I'll talk about a little bit 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 now if you were to use a phrase you 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 could put in a series of phrases that 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 when people search for them triggers 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 your ads to show so for instance 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 chiropractic adjustment chiropractic 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 treatment chiropractic therapy 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 These are all for chiropractic for back pain 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 things that if you are a chiropractor 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 You might want to be looking for us 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 customers who are typing these in and of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 course then there's the exact match it's 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 very similar in some respects to the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 phrase it works a little bit differently 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 I've been working with pay-per-click 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 a long time now and I still get confused 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 on exactly what he wants is on but 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 basically it's this when you put in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 and exact match so for instance if your 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 chiropractor in Reno Reno learned Alice 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 then you put in an exact match for 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 chiropractor in Reno it will show up 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 whenever some loads up in chiropractor 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 in Reno that exact phrase but it 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 wouldn't trigger for chiropractors 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Rio if you were a chiropractor in Dallas 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 I wouldn't show up for Dallas 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 chiropractor if you're only exact match 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 goes chiropractor and allison that's 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 when you actually want to wind up having 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 a lot of different keywords you want to 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 be focusing on the phrase and exact 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 matches do however use the broad match 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 modifier which isn't the same thing as 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 merely broadband keywords the broad 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 match modifier utilizes the plus sign to 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 combine words with other words 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 so that when certain combinations happen 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 they trigger your ads to display so for 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 instance if you were a plumber into 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 being Kansas whenever somebody typed in 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 plumber and Topeka maybe want your ad to 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 show or if you serve pizza in New York 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 City and every time someone typed in NYC 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 pizzeria you might want 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 To show them as well as the first 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 is step on any pay-per-click campaign 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 identifying what appear to be good 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 keywords to include and good keywords to 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Avoid getting those are the negative 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 keywords Google's keyword tools actually 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 really great for this i'm better than 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 that it's free once you've mastered 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 keyword fool you'll be one step closer 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 to PPC dominance and that's great news 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 All Things Considered But Remember 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 keywords are only part of the picture 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And they're a good place to start 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 because they are the easier to see tips 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 of the PPC iceberg what you don't see 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 when you're focusing on your PPC 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 usually this is a number of steps 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 you need to take to your campaign 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 running successfully first off you need 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 to always optimized for CTR I said I've 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 mentioned that a minute ago and now I'm 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 going to mention CTR is yours 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 click-through rate which means for every 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 thousand times Google shows your ad how 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 many times do people click on it which 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 is how many times the school gets paid 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 The more likely people are to click on 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Your ad most likely they are to show 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 your ad especially because you're at 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 winds up being seen in Google's eyes as 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 relevant and they're always looking to 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 make a much more relevant experience for 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 their users both in the organic search 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 results but also in the advertisers and 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 so they'll actually charge you less 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 money if you have a higher CTR or higher 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 click-through rate if you have a 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Low one you should also be split testing 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 your ads and your landing pages because 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 tiny little tweaks can make a point 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 five or point eight percent of a 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 click-through rate difference but that 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 can be huge when you're talking about a 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 click-through rates that are five 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 percent below on average so you might 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 have two ads if you are dentist in Fort 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Worth and they look pretty similar all 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 things considered the untrained eye but 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 There are some tiny differences 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 one of them may wind up getting a lot 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 more clicks there's some of the things 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 you do improve 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 click through 8 talk about that here 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 just a minute you need to have a 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 landing page so many people fall into 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 This trap and they just dump potential 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 customers on their homepage and most 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 people will click around read your blog 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 reach your valve section and then 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 they'll leave because you overwhelm them 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 with information you must control the 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 interaction also use control in your ads 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 themselves for which i mean build 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 urgency with a call to action that is given 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 a clear decision call now click the call 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 watch this video etc and take advantage 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 or all of the ad extensions you can when 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Advertising on a site like Google things 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 like site extensions can link to test 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Orioles that are on your web page or 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 other landing pages or other relevant 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 pages call extensions take up extra 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 screen space which is good because it 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 makes your ad bigger but they don't take 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 up extra ad swings which is also good 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 because it doesn't make you short 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 your message not only that 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 allow customers to call you rather than 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 click which means you wind up not paying 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 for those leads location extensions can 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 put you on the map and Google ranks the 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 maps above regular web sites very off 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 when it comes to local businesses 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 importantly each extension makes your ad 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 bigger than your competitors which makes 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 more likely to get clicked and more 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 clicks means a higher click-through rate 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 which means you can pay less than 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 similar ads from your competitors to 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 It is higher than them and paying less 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 always good however all of this takes a 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 lot of work and it's far more than more 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 keyword research 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 And that's where we come in marketing 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
