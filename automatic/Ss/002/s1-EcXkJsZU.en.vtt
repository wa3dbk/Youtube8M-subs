different parts part 1 part 2 and part 3

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.510 
different parts part 1 part 2 and part 3
these<00:00:18.960> parts<00:00:19.380> aren't<00:00:19.590> necessarily<00:00:20.010> played<00:00:20.340> in

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
these parts aren't necessarily played in

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.330 
these parts aren't necessarily played in
that<00:00:20.640> order<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.560> I'll<00:00:22.650> talk<00:00:22.859> about<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.220> a

that's<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.519> pattern<00:03:50.760> you'll<00:03:51.030> probably<00:03:51.150> want<00:03:51.420> to

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
that's a pattern you'll probably want to

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.940 
that's a pattern you'll probably want to
practice<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.870> bunch<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.409> then<00:03:52.470> when<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.830> apply

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
practice a bunch and then when you apply

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:37.000 
practice a bunch and then when you apply
it<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> drug<00:03:53.579> doing<00:03:54.329> this

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
sections in the middle are large part

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.600 
sections in the middle are large part
two<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.120> part<00:05:54.180> three<00:05:55.190> when<00:05:56.190> you<00:05:56.310> play<00:05:56.490> the

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
two and part three when you play the

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.040 
two and part three when you play the
beginning<00:05:56.730> you<00:05:57.030> go<00:05:57.180> immediately<00:05:57.480> in<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:57.840> part

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
beginning you go immediately in the part

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.260 
beginning you go immediately in the part
one<00:05:58.260> but<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.100> don't<00:05:59.370> automatically<00:05:59.910> go<00:06:00.120> into

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
one but you don't automatically go into

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.480 
one but you don't automatically go into
part<00:06:00.540> two<00:06:00.690> or<00:06:00.840> part<00:06:01.350> three<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:02.010> way<00:06:02.280> that

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
part two or part three the way that

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.400 
part two or part three the way that
works<00:06:02.700> is<00:06:03.030> whoever<00:06:03.600> is<00:06:03.840> leading<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.260> group

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
works is whoever is leading the group

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.880 
works is whoever is leading the group
will<00:06:05.180> call<00:06:06.180> out<00:06:06.300> part<00:06:06.540> one<00:06:06.750> or<00:06:07.110> call<00:06:07.380> part<00:06:07.680> two

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
will call out part one or call part two

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.660 
will call out part one or call part two
or<00:06:08.430> call<00:06:09.120> out<00:06:09.210> part<00:06:09.480> three<00:06:09.840> and<00:06:10.050> any<00:06:10.620> order<00:06:11.070> and

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
or call out part three and any order and

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.910 
or call out part three and any order and
that<00:06:11.970> basically<00:06:12.360> tells<00:06:12.840> you<00:06:12.960> what<00:06:13.290> part<00:06:13.620> to<00:06:13.770> do

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
that basically tells you what part to do

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.420 
that basically tells you what part to do
next<00:06:14.100> so<00:06:14.550> it<00:06:15.060> may<00:06:15.210> not<00:06:15.240> be<00:06:15.420> intro<00:06:16.410> part<00:06:17.010> 1<00:06:17.220> part

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
next so it may not be intro part 1 part

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.410 
next so it may not be intro part 1 part
2<00:06:17.520> part<00:06:17.850> 3<00:06:17.940> altro<00:06:18.780> it<00:06:18.930> might<00:06:19.110> be<00:06:19.760> intro<00:06:20.760> part<00:06:21.180> 1

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
2 part 3 altro it might be intro part 1

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.880 
2 part 3 altro it might be intro part 1
and<00:06:21.720> then<00:06:21.840> maybe<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.140> person<00:06:22.350> will<00:06:22.470> call<00:06:22.590> part

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
and then maybe the person will call part

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.950 
and then maybe the person will call part
3<00:06:23.160> and<00:06:23.340> then<00:06:23.490> you<00:06:23.520> switch<00:06:23.700> to<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:23.910> part<00:06:24.090> 3<00:06:24.360> so

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
3 and then you switch to the part 3 so

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.690 
3 and then you switch to the part 3 so
in<00:06:25.380> each<00:06:25.680> of<00:06:25.830> these<00:06:25.920> parts<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:26.310> just<00:06:26.490> play<00:06:26.610> it

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
in each of these parts you just play it

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.830 
in each of these parts you just play it
over<00:06:26.820> and<00:06:27.030> over<00:06:27.090> and<00:06:27.210> over<00:06:27.420> again<00:06:27.510> until

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
over and over and over again until

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.210 
over and over and over again until
someone<00:06:28.230> tells<00:06:28.500> you<00:06:28.560> to<00:06:28.650> change<00:06:28.980> something
