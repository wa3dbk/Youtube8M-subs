comments from one to how many and I'll

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.490 
comments from one to how many and I'll
assign<00:03:53.650> each<00:03:53.860> come<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.310> number<00:03:54.460> then<00:03:55.060> I'll

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
assign each come in a number then I'll

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.970 
assign each come in a number then I'll
roll<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.800> RNG<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:58.020> then<00:03:59.020> whatever<00:03:59.230> number<00:03:59.590> is

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
roll the RNG and then whatever number is

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
roll the RNG and then whatever number is
chosen<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:01.210> is<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:02.520> it's<00:04:03.520> a<00:04:03.640> comment<00:04:03.910> that
