00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
can see I've got just a couple of reps

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.819 
can see I've got just a couple of reps
here<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.680> don't<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.370> than<00:00:44.520> 32<00:00:45.210> his<00:00:45.360> ideal

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
here I don't like more than 32 his ideal

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.200 
here I don't like more than 32 his ideal
3<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.920> about<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> max<00:00:47.489> I'll<00:00:47.700> go<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.090> get

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
3 is about the max I'll go if you get

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.000 
3 is about the max I'll go if you get
any<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.390> than<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> whole<00:00:49.800> big

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
any more than that you get a whole big

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.529 
any more than that you get a whole big
bunch<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.370> leather<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.120> inhibits

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
bunch of leather here and it inhibits

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.180 
bunch of leather here and it inhibits
your<00:00:51.660> communication<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> horse<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
your communication with the horse and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
your communication with the horse and
actually<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> eventually<00:00:54.629> rub<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
actually can eventually rub them a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
actually can eventually rub them a
little<00:00:55.410> raw<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.610> I've<00:00:57.059> run<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> through

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
little raw there so I've run it through

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
little raw there so I've run it through
my<00:00:57.930> tongue<00:00:58.199> through<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.559> appropriate<00:00:59.219> hole

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
my tongue through the appropriate hole

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
my tongue through the appropriate hole
I've<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.239> quite<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> bit<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.809> slack<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:01.289> two

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
I've got quite a bit of slack about two

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.229 
I've got quite a bit of slack about two
and<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> half<00:01:01.620> feet<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> run<00:01:03.090> it

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and a half feet so I'm going to run it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.690 
and a half feet so I'm going to run it
back<00:01:03.480> through<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:04.650> d-ring<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.280> my<00:01:05.460> saddle

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
back through the d-ring on my saddle

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.969 
back through the d-ring on my saddle
this<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> flat<00:01:06.510> plate<00:01:06.780> rigging<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> Wade

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
this is a flat plate rigging on a Wade

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
this is a flat plate rigging on a Wade
tree<00:01:08.280> saddle<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.939> these<00:01:09.090> Wade<00:01:09.390> trees

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
tree saddle I like these Wade trees

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.420 
tree saddle I like these Wade trees
because<00:01:10.080> they<00:01:10.200> set<00:01:10.439> me<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.890> close<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.310> my

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
because they set me really close to my

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.149 
because they set me really close to my
horse<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> give<00:01:12.540> me<00:01:12.689> good<00:01:12.840> communication<00:01:13.710> now

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
horse and give me good communication now

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.620 
horse and give me good communication now
this<00:01:14.430> point<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> lot<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> people<00:01:15.360> make<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> big

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
this point a lot of people make a big

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.020 
this point a lot of people make a big
mistake<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.189> might<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.759> them

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
mistake and you might be one of them

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
mistake and you might be one of them
most<00:01:18.750> people<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.080> pull<00:01:19.470> straight<00:01:19.500> down<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
most people just pull straight down and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.320 
most people just pull straight down and
tighten<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.880> i'm<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> show<00:01:21.299> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
tighten this up i'm going to show you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.630 
tighten this up i'm going to show you
what<00:01:21.540> happens<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.799> that's<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> wrong<00:01:23.310> thing

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
what happens and that's the wrong thing

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.219 
what happens and that's the wrong thing
to<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.330> how<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.630> over<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to do you see how that's over to the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
to do you see how that's over to the
side<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.340> meant<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> overlap<00:01:27.090> about

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
side this was meant to overlap about

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
side this was meant to overlap about
half<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.770> meant<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.189> some

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
half way and it's meant to have some

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.069 
half way and it's meant to have some
friction<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.659> work

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
friction there this can actually work

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
friction there this can actually work
loose<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> wrong<00:01:32.130> way<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
loose and that's the wrong way to do it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
loose and that's the wrong way to do it
I'm<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.750> loosen<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.079> back<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.740> i'm

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I'm going to loosen it back up and i'm

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.840 
I'm going to loosen it back up and i'm
going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> show<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:35.909> way<00:01:37.850> let's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
going to show you the right way let's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
going to show you the right way let's
say<00:01:38.970> we've<00:01:39.119> passed<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.659> underneath<00:01:39.900> we've<00:01:40.710> got

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
say we've passed it underneath we've got

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.200 
say we've passed it underneath we've got
our<00:01:41.100> slack<00:01:41.340> instead<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.880> pulling<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.180> straight

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
our slack instead of pulling it straight

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.590 
our slack instead of pulling it straight
down<00:01:42.659> i'm<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> pull<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.600> take

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
down i'm going to pull it up and take

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840 
down i'm going to pull it up and take
that<00:01:45.780> slack<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:47.549> pull<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that slack right out and then pull it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.550 
that slack right out and then pull it
down<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.390> how<00:01:48.509> much<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:48.930> overlap<00:01:49.350> I've

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
down you see how much more overlap I've

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.350 
down you see how much more overlap I've
got<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.189> almost<00:01:50.399> halfway<00:01:50.700> overlapping

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
got here it's almost halfway overlapping

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
got here it's almost halfway overlapping
this<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.890> way<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.610> meant

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
this one and that's the way it was meant

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.700 
this one and that's the way it was meant
to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.840> friction<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.350> want<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to be that's the friction we want to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.859 
to be that's the friction we want to
create<00:01:56.009> leather<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.490> leather<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.689> will

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
create leather on leather and that will

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
create leather on leather and that will
hold<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> cinched<00:01:58.950> together<00:01:59.250> even<00:01:59.610> if<00:01:59.729> our

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
hold that cinched together even if our

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.249 
hold that cinched together even if our
tongue<00:02:00.149> comes<00:02:00.450> loose<00:02:00.689> or<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.930> didn't<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.229> our

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
tongue comes loose or we didn't have our

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.709 
tongue comes loose or we didn't have our
tongues<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.860> whole<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.540> hold

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
tongues of the whole that not will hold

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
tongues of the whole that not will hold
this<00:02:03.899> inch<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
this inch and as you can see it's not a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.190 
this inch and as you can see it's not a
big<00:02:05.490> bulky<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.540> still<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.960> good

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
big bulky not we still have good

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
big bulky not we still have good
communication<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.280> our<00:02:08.310> horse<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:09.270> I've

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
communication with our horse now I've

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.760 
communication with our horse now I've
got<00:02:09.509> about<00:02:09.629> two<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.050> half<00:02:10.110> feet<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.619> this

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
got about two and a half feet of this

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.770 
got about two and a half feet of this
lie<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> go<00:02:11.160> left<00:02:11.370> over<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> couple

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
lie to go left over and I have a couple

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.730 
lie to go left over and I have a couple
things<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.349> do<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
things I can do it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.710 
things I can do it
I<00:02:13.770> can<00:02:14.040> tuck<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> through<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.970> keeper<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.570> my

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
I can tuck it through the keeper on my

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080 
I can tuck it through the keeper on my
saddle<00:02:15.960> here<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.500> that's<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.520> pretty<00:02:17.850> nice

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
saddle here and that's in pretty nice

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.640 
saddle here and that's in pretty nice
shape<00:02:18.150> there's<00:02:18.630> about<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.900> foot<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> couple

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
shape there's about a foot a couple

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.950 
shape there's about a foot a couple
inches<00:02:19.980> hanging<00:02:20.370> down<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:21.180> won't<00:02:21.450> flop<00:02:21.690> so

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
inches hanging down it won't flop so

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.900 
inches hanging down it won't flop so
much<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.740> really<00:02:22.980> long<00:02:23.340> won't<00:02:23.670> hit<00:02:23.790> him

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
much it's not really long won't hit him

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.940 
much it's not really long won't hit him
down<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.300> her<00:02:24.390> leg<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.720> distract<00:02:25.080> him<00:02:25.260> nor<00:02:25.830> is

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
down in her leg and distract him nor is

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.920 
down in her leg and distract him nor is
it<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.340> short<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.330> eventually<00:02:27.510> would

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
it so short that it eventually would

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.650 
it so short that it eventually would
work<00:02:28.110> itself<00:02:28.470> out<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.920> hang<00:02:29.580> down<00:02:29.790> anyway<00:02:30.210> one

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
work itself out and hang down anyway one

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.090 
work itself out and hang down anyway one
of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> other<00:02:30.900> things<00:02:30.990> we<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.440> do<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.650> pass<00:02:31.920> it

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
of the other things we can do is pass it

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.800 
of the other things we can do is pass it
through<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.430> rear<00:02:33.060> cinch<00:02:33.390> ring<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
through the rear cinch ring of the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.800 
through the rear cinch ring of the
saddle<00:02:34.520> like<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.210> go<00:02:36.270> from<00:02:36.390> outside

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
saddle like so you can go from outside

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.510 
saddle like so you can go from outside
the<00:02:36.960> inside<00:02:37.320> or<00:02:37.530> inside<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.980> outside<00:02:38.130> it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the inside or inside to outside it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.100 
the inside or inside to outside it
really<00:02:38.730> doesn't<00:02:39.030> matter<00:02:39.150> if<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.870> long

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
really doesn't matter if it's long

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.140 
really doesn't matter if it's long
enough<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.650> even<00:02:40.770> sent<00:02:41.130> pass<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.030> back

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
enough you can even sent pass it back

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970 
enough you can even sent pass it back
through<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.510> keeper<00:02:42.870> here<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.260> I've<00:02:43.710> had<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
through the keeper here and I've had to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.400 
through the keeper here and I've had to
do<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.310> on<00:02:44.490> some<00:02:44.730> really<00:02:44.910> small<00:02:45.330> forces<00:02:45.870> so

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
do that on some really small forces so

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.870 
do that on some really small forces so
that's<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.710> little<00:02:46.920> tip<00:02:47.100> for<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.400> today<00:02:47.550> on
