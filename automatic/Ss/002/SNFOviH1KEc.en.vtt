00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.119
 xbox 360 in the first game 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.880
 two of the list we have the bat company 2 is a video game of shots in the first 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.070
 person belonging to the battlefield video game series developed by 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.939
 says and distributed by electronic ars for the xbox playstation 3 platforms 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.940
 360 and pc 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.070
 the game has an awesome multiplayer mode something like work in 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.110
 team a game that can not survive put taxes when the boat 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.140
 mechanics has unlockable arms rami 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 2 pins among others besides that this Thursday they drive carlos helicopters 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.600
 among others bad company 2 has four modes russo times after 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.739
 is to capture the enemy's system to gain the contrast is to capture 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.250
 the enemy's flag how many times can you 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.950
 and the diverse mode that has quotas with three 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.280
 the mossos d'esquadra 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.750
 an awesome game that if we were impressed with the individual mode we 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 he left speechless with the multiplayer 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.170
 in the second game of the list we have modern warfare 2 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.420
 an invaluable game that has an individual mode 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.210
 give him my good god 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.030
 has an amazing multiplayer mode but that certainly does not reach 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 to the bad company since bat with gangs more serious 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.530
 advantage they have 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.220
 you have ten days as well as 15 multiplayer modes while the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 downstroke only has eight maps and four multiplayer modes 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.970
 but still we are going 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.080
 they are numbers one in all aspects 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.490
 but of course what I like most about modern warfare is that it has better 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.810
 graphics and you can camouflage tussam 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.829
 more of your liking things you can not do 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.560
 but what most brings me the qualities that modern warfare is full of faith 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.140
 two subnormales who spend their time insulting you if you're better than them and 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.770
 they do not support so it grows at rates until rate cups on your face start you at 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.989
 say things like you father -5 the bastard and then you lose your temper and you 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.989
 rebate to similar subnormal 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.479
 it is bad what does it wrong or are people 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
 cup mug 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.659
 in the third games of the list we have the famous left high forum like 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.469
 summary 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.290
 like the dead reader 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.250
 has the same multiplayer modes but has been joined to four modes 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.959
 more over time 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.249
 the infected are the many enemies that we have to face throughout 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.249
 one hour a day 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.889
 in the fourth place we have souls effects begins after the events 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.659
 from mass effect 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.810
 while patrolling the jet space 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.920
 the ship of the commander shepard the normandy is attacked by an aggressor 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.050
 unknown 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.840
 the ship suffered serious damage 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.349
 forcing the crew to evacuate in the escape pods 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.099
 me that he is still the pilot of the ship which despite the serious 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.199
 Damage does not evacuate with the rest of the crew 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.830
 will leave until I erc and orders him to leave the ship 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.430
 me who insists that he can save her even though it is impossible 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.460
 shepard dragged me from her seat and put it in an escape pod but 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.509
 before the normandy can be raised it is attacked again 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.070
 causing an explosion that sends him into space after the remains of 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:06.960
 the ship will pierce you in the suit 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.409
 the suit begins to lose air and separ dies drowned 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.999
 your body is drifting through space 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.219
 the body of the commander shepard is recovered by the shadowy runner a 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:21.169
 secret buyer of information that is sold to the highest bidder from there 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.169
 Shepard will do everything to save humanity from a catastrophe 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:28.629
 really a great game but it would be missing a multiplayer mode for 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.629
 do better 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.710
 in the fifth game of the list we have the sprinter cell conviction 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.430
 explains herce conviction has a history wrapped hour in which 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.720
 we will handle the samu to be an ex-convict in jail and look for his 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.240
 daughter of return and who killed everything that stands in his way for it explains 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.960
 erceg conviction has a multiplayer mode in which we will handle the 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.610
 American archer and the Russian who are using the skills and 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.729
 new titles of the title as well as others of the cooperative aspect as 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.630
 the coverages to resurrect the fallen comrade reduce the enemy that 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.970
 have discovered our partner also the way my talk to 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.880
 the seclusion dependent on this his campaign in the purest modern style 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.509
 warfare 2 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.509
 beginning the twentieth century 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.119
 peking 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.629
 but no 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:48.929

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:50.439
