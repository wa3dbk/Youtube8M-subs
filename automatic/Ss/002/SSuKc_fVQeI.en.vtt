00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
to expand is the froth builds up when I

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.070 
to expand is the froth builds up when I
feel<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.250> have<00:04:22.400> enough<00:04:22.700> froth<00:04:22.970> I'll<00:04:23.450> raise<00:04:23.810> up

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
feel we have enough froth I'll raise up

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.100 
feel we have enough froth I'll raise up
the<00:04:24.890> cup<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:25.970> milk<00:04:26.150> actually<00:04:26.450> covers
