about<00:00:06.950> the<00:00:07.220> Duracell<00:00:07.730> 15<00:00:08.120> minute<00:00:08.389> charger<00:00:08.900> I

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
about the Duracell 15 minute charger I

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.070 
about the Duracell 15 minute charger I
have<00:00:09.680> to<00:00:09.830> admit<00:00:10.129> when<00:00:10.370> doso<00:00:10.940> asked<00:00:11.450> me<00:00:11.600> to<00:00:11.870> try

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
have to admit when doso asked me to try

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.410 
have to admit when doso asked me to try
the<00:00:12.139> battery<00:00:12.619> charger<00:00:13.129> I<00:00:13.340> was<00:00:13.789> a<00:00:13.820> little<00:00:14.299> bit

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
the battery charger I was a little bit

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.390 
the battery charger I was a little bit
skeptical<00:00:14.809> I<00:00:15.199> tried<00:00:15.949> using<00:00:16.160> rechargeable

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
skeptical I tried using rechargeable

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.750 
skeptical I tried using rechargeable
batteries<00:00:17.180> a<00:00:17.210> few<00:00:17.449> years<00:00:17.690> ago<00:00:17.810> I<00:00:18.140> got<00:00:18.830> tired<00:00:19.310> of

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
batteries a few years ago I got tired of

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.540 
batteries a few years ago I got tired of
waiting<00:00:20.210> overnight<00:00:20.720> for<00:00:21.230> them<00:00:21.350> to<00:00:21.560> charge<00:00:22.040> and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
waiting overnight for them to charge and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.960 
waiting overnight for them to charge and
then<00:00:23.120> they're<00:00:23.390> losing<00:00:23.720> their<00:00:24.080> charge<00:00:24.970> really

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
then they're losing their charge really

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.250 
then they're losing their charge really
really<00:00:26.270> quickly<00:00:26.510> I<00:00:26.690> didn't<00:00:27.020> use<00:00:27.140> them

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
really quickly I didn't use them

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.850 
really quickly I didn't use them
straight<00:00:27.560> away<00:00:27.800> but<00:00:28.100> actually<00:00:29.230> this<00:00:30.230> charger

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
straight away but actually this charger

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.709 
straight away but actually this charger
from<00:00:31.010> dear<00:00:31.280> itself<00:00:31.640> has<00:00:31.940> changed<00:00:32.300> my<00:00:32.450> view<00:00:32.689> on

batteries<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:39.920> just<00:00:40.130> 15<00:00:40.579> minutes<00:00:40.610> I<00:00:41.300> tested<00:00:42.290> it

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
batteries in just 15 minutes I tested it

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.530 
batteries in just 15 minutes I tested it
out<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:42.739> I<00:00:42.829> can<00:00:43.160> confirm<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.910> it<00:00:44.300> really

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
out and I can confirm that it really

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.930 
out and I can confirm that it really

from empty to fully charged in 15
minutes<00:00:52.660> when<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:53.750> check<00:00:53.960> out<00:00:54.079> the<00:00:54.230> power

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
minutes when you check out the power

minutes when you check out the power
rating<00:00:54.739> on<00:00:55.130> the<00:00:55.220> back<00:00:55.399> of<00:00:55.579> this<00:00:55.700> device<00:00:56.149> you

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
rating on the back of this device you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.160 
rating on the back of this device you
can<00:00:56.809> see<00:00:57.020> why<00:00:57.610> it<00:00:58.610> packs<00:00:59.059> in<00:00:59.329> a<00:00:59.450> whopping<00:00:59.870> 6

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
can see why it packs in a whopping 6

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.750 
can see why it packs in a whopping 6
point<00:01:00.440> 9<00:01:00.530> amps<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:01.070> power

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
point 9 amps of power

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.179 
point 9 amps of power
now<00:01:02.540> if<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:02.750> compare<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.170> to<00:01:03.530> conventional

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
now if you compare this to conventional

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.340 
now if you compare this to conventional
charges<00:01:04.670> which<00:01:04.879> use<00:01:05.149> about<00:01:05.329> half<00:01:05.689> an<00:01:05.930> amp<00:01:06.079> you

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
charges which use about half an amp you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.410 
charges which use about half an amp you
can<00:01:06.560> see<00:01:06.770> why<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.159> 15-minute<00:01:07.850> charge<00:01:08.240> of

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
can see why the 15-minute charge of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.699 
can see why the 15-minute charge of
charge<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.079> much<00:01:09.259> faster<00:01:09.789> to<00:01:10.789> do<00:01:10.999> the<00:01:11.149> maths

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:11.709 
charge is so much faster to do the maths

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:15.069 
charge is so much faster to do the maths
that's<00:01:12.709> about<00:01:13.009> 14<00:01:13.639> times<00:01:13.909> faster<00:01:14.569> than<00:01:14.959> a

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
that's about 14 times faster than a

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.590 
that's about 14 times faster than a
conventional<00:01:15.249> Duracell<00:01:16.249> charger<00:01:16.789> the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
conventional Duracell charger the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.359 
conventional Duracell charger the
charger<00:01:17.630> itself<00:01:18.139> is<00:01:18.499> neatly<00:01:18.740> designed<00:01:18.979> and

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
charger itself is neatly designed and

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.379 
charger itself is neatly designed and
easy<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.789> use<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:20.840> can<00:01:20.869> use<00:01:21.139> it<00:01:21.409> flat<00:01:22.039> or<00:01:22.459> on

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:23.389 
easy to use you can use it flat or on

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:26.980 
easy to use you can use it flat or on
its<00:01:23.539> side<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.939> the<00:01:25.939> batteries<00:01:26.389> just<00:01:26.509> go<00:01:26.840> in

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
its side and the batteries just go in

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.789 
its side and the batteries just go in
here<00:01:27.439> like<00:01:27.969> so<00:01:34.359> it<00:01:35.359> takes<00:01:35.659> double-a<00:01:36.139> auto-play

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
here like so it takes double-a auto-play

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.769 
here like so it takes double-a auto-play
batteries<00:01:37.279> or<00:01:37.520> combination<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.329> both<00:01:38.569> if<00:01:38.749> you

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:38.779 
batteries or combination of both if you

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:43.989 
batteries or combination of both if you
like<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.310> if<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.429> plug<00:01:40.639> it<00:01:40.759> in<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:43.670> can<00:01:43.819> see

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
like and if I plug it in you can see

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.059 
like and if I plug it in you can see
this<00:01:44.179> red<00:01:44.450> light<00:01:44.719> comes<00:01:45.049> on<00:01:45.319> to<00:01:45.679> let<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:45.920> know

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
this red light comes on to let you know

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.339 
this red light comes on to let you know
that<00:01:46.099> device<00:01:46.579> is<00:01:46.789> charging<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.509> if<00:01:47.929> you<00:01:48.109> look

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
that device is charging and if you look

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.769 
that device is charging and if you look
and<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:49.340> hear<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.639> too<00:01:49.849> you<00:01:50.419> can<00:01:50.630> see

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:50.779 
and can hear it too you can see

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:53.379 
and can hear it too you can see
something<00:01:51.020> else<00:01:51.319> going<00:01:51.649> on<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.669> device<00:01:52.969> is<00:01:53.149> so
