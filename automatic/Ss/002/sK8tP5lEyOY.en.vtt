ok<00:00:07.230> here<00:00:07.500> we<00:00:07.529> are<00:00:07.680> with<00:00:07.799> asphalt<00:00:08.309> 7<00:00:08.790> heat

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
ok here we are with asphalt 7 heat

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.520 
ok here we are with asphalt 7 heat
you'll<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.759> game<00:00:11.969> loft<00:00:12.530> creation

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
you'll know the game loft creation

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.609 
you'll know the game loft creation
fairly<00:00:14.160> well<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:17.779> can<00:00:18.779> see<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> framerate

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
fairly well I can see the framerate

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.200 
fairly well I can see the framerate
fresh<00:00:20.520> vault<00:00:20.699> 7<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.539> okay<00:00:25.730> I've<00:00:26.730> taken<00:00:27.000> off

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
fresh vault 7 it's okay I've taken off

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.580 
fresh vault 7 it's okay I've taken off
accelerometer<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.170> make<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.470> little

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
accelerometer just to make this a little

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
accelerometer just to make this a little
bit<00:00:28.890> easier<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:30.119> guys<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.330> kind<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> see

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
bit easier for you guys to kind of see

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.020 
bit easier for you guys to kind of see
but<00:00:31.859> also<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.399> me<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> actually<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.850> able<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
but also for me to actually be able to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.000 
but also for me to actually be able to
play<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.899> quite<00:00:34.110> difficult<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.500> tilt<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
play it's quite difficult to tilt the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
play it's quite difficult to tilt the
game<00:00:35.390> why<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.420> he<00:00:36.570> playing<00:00:36.719> off<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.170> don't

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
game why is he playing off I don't

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.229 
game why is he playing off I don't
personally<00:00:37.620> find<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> accelerometer<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:38.969> all

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
personally find the accelerometer is all

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
personally find the accelerometer is all
that<00:00:41.989> all<00:00:42.989> inaccurate<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.860> game<00:00:44.040> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that all inaccurate in this game you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.770 
that all inaccurate in this game you
know<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.430> compares<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.789> games<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.270> real

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
know it compares the games like real

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.920 
know it compares the games like real
racing<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.559> also<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:48.420> isn't<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
racing to I also think this isn't the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
racing to I also think this isn't the
best<00:00:49.079> example<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.980> racing<00:00:50.340> game<00:00:50.370> with

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
best example of a racing game with

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.880 
best example of a racing game with
Galaxy<00:00:51.210> s3

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
Galaxy s3

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.979 
Galaxy s3
Real<00:00:52.890> Racing<00:00:53.070> 2<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.550> seems<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.210> bit

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
Real Racing 2 just seems to be a bit

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.680 
Real Racing 2 just seems to be a bit
smoother<00:00:55.559> better<00:00:56.340> looking<00:00:56.910> better<00:00:57.090> textures

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
smoother better looking better textures

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.569 
smoother better looking better textures
etc<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.559> has<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.399> nice

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
etc this has got really really nice

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
etc this has got really really nice
lighting<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:01.579> bloom<00:01:02.579> etc<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.290> high

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
lighting going on bloom etc and high

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.350 
lighting going on bloom etc and high
dynamic<00:01:04.769> range<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> textures

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
dynamic range but you know the textures

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240 
dynamic range but you know the textures
look<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.840> look<00:01:07.020> weak<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> look<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.979> pop

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
look just look weak and look at that pop

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.630 
look just look weak and look at that pop
up<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> distance<00:01:10.250> just<00:01:11.250> feels<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
up in the distance just feels like a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
up in the distance just feels like a
game<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.110> could<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.409> been<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.400> see<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
game that could have been you see the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.969 
game that could have been you see the
frame<00:01:14.880> rate<00:01:14.909> starting<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:16.110> struggle

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
frame rate starting to really struggle

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.420 
frame rate starting to really struggle
there<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.970> corners<00:01:19.430> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
there as you go around the corners it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.740 
there as you go around the corners it
just<00:01:20.610> feels<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> game<00:01:21.180> that's<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.390> not

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
just feels like a game that's just not

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.320 
just feels like a game that's just not
being<00:01:21.960> well<00:01:22.200> optimised<00:01:23.090> certainly<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
being well optimised certainly this is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
being well optimised certainly this is
just<00:01:24.479> another<00:01:24.720> game<00:01:24.930> off<00:01:25.140> title<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.740> isn't

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
just another game off title that isn't

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.050 
just another game off title that isn't
using<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.240> s3<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.750> its<00:01:27.869> full<00:01:28.140> extent<00:01:29.060> just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
using the s3 to its full extent just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
using the s3 to its full extent just
like<00:01:30.210> Batman<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.570> spider-man<00:01:30.810> before<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
like Batman and spider-man before it you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
like Batman and spider-man before it you
know<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.790> feels<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.420> game<00:01:33.600> engine

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
know it just feels like this game engine

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.319 
know it just feels like this game engine
of<00:01:34.049> game<00:01:34.229> loss<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.590> about<00:01:34.920> done<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.939> really

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
of game loss is about done they really

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.749 
of game loss is about done they really
need<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> move<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.079> my<00:01:37.979> recommendation

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
need to move on now my recommendation

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.910 
need to move on now my recommendation
guys<00:01:39.329> why<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.200> buy<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> license

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
guys why don't you just buy a license

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.249 
guys why don't you just buy a license
for<00:01:41.040> unity<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.759> push<00:01:42.600> ahead<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:43.229> own

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
for unity or push ahead and get your own

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.910 
for unity or push ahead and get your own
real<00:01:43.500> engine<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> door<00:01:45.229> at<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> moment<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
real engine out the door at the moment I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.190 
real engine out the door at the moment I
have<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> say<00:01:47.390> it's<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> great

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
have to say it's not really a great

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
have to say it's not really a great
example<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> game<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.790> suppose

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
example of a game you know I suppose

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.850 
example of a game you know I suppose
from<00:01:52.159> our<00:01:53.159> perspective<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:53.970> 69p<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.500> App

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
from our perspective it's 69p on the App

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
from our perspective it's 69p on the App
Store<00:01:56.159> Play<00:01:57.030> Store<00:01:57.299> should<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.479> say

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
Store Play Store should I say

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.859 
Store Play Store should I say
so<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.979> exactly<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.869> bank

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
so you know it's not exactly a bank

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.590 
so you know it's not exactly a bank
breaker<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.829> even<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.360> killer

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
breaker but even so it's not the killer

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
breaker but even so it's not the killer
title<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.229> s3<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.920> there<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
title for the s3 you can see there the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.990 
title for the s3 you can see there the
frame<00:02:05.549> rates<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.090> struggling<00:02:06.810> along<00:02:08.000> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
frame rates just struggling along and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.270 
frame rates just struggling along and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
forking with such poor textures as well

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.580 
forking with such poor textures as well
just<00:02:11.940> feels<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.360> they<00:02:12.480> badly<00:02:12.780> optimized<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
just feels like they badly optimized it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.620 
just feels like they badly optimized it

I<00:02:25.890> mean<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:27.630> old<00:02:27.810> adage<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.560> front

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
I mean the old adage of get in front

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.559 
I mean the old adage of get in front
stay<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.069> front<00:02:29.459> pretty<00:02:29.910> much<00:02:30.120> works<00:02:30.360> here

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
stay in front pretty much works here

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.180 
stay in front pretty much works here
once<00:02:30.840> you're<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.050> front<00:02:31.290> let's<00:02:31.650> crash<00:02:31.920> into

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
once you're in front let's crash into

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.740 
once you're in front let's crash into
something<00:02:32.370> you're<00:02:32.670> gonna<00:02:32.760> win<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> race<00:02:33.060> easy

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
something you're gonna win the race easy

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.559 
something you're gonna win the race easy
as<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:35.280> AI<00:02:35.400> doesn't<00:02:35.819> really<00:02:36.209> put<00:02:36.480> up

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
as that the AI doesn't really put up

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.970 
as that the AI doesn't really put up
much<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.900> fight<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.349> challenge<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:37.920> it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
much of a fight or a challenge and it

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.190 
much of a fight or a challenge and it
doesn't<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.430> seem<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.880> able<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.360> you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
doesn't really seem to be able to you

doesn't really seem to be able to you
know<00:02:40.319> give<00:02:40.500> me<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.650> run<00:02:40.830> for<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:41.040> money

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
know give me a run for my money

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.250 
know give me a run for my money
particularly<00:02:41.790> although<00:02:42.780> admittedly<00:02:42.870> I've

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
particularly although admittedly I've

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.100 
particularly although admittedly I've
only<00:02:43.440> done<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.739> first<00:02:44.330> four<00:02:45.330> or<00:02:45.360> five<00:02:45.600> races

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
only done the first four or five races

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.100 
only done the first four or five races
so<00:02:46.290> far<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.209> there<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.630> your<00:02:48.750> boost<00:02:48.959> up

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
so far you see there is your boost up

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.670 
so far you see there is your boost up
Minos<00:02:50.959> interesting<00:02:51.959> thing<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.350> faster

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
Minos interesting thing is the faster

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.800 
Minos interesting thing is the faster
the<00:02:52.709> car<00:02:52.830> goes<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.970> framerate<00:02:54.269> seems<00:02:54.660> to

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the car goes that the framerate seems to

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.270 
the car goes that the framerate seems to
get<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.530> don't<00:02:55.739> know<00:02:55.799> whether<00:02:55.920> they've<00:02:56.100> just

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
get so I don't know whether they've just

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.440 
get so I don't know whether they've just
got<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.580> really<00:02:56.940> bad<00:02:57.120> bit<00:02:57.360> of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
got a really really bad bit of

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.809 
got a really really bad bit of
optimization<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.349> on<00:02:58.580> but<00:02:59.580> I've<00:02:59.670> noticed

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
optimization going on but I've noticed

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.610 
optimization going on but I've noticed
certainly<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.269> faster<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.660> car<00:03:00.810> goes<00:03:01.049> or

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
certainly the faster the car goes or

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.479 
certainly the faster the car goes or
appears<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.280> go<00:03:02.400> anyway<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:05.099> smoother<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
appears to go anyway the smoother the

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.759 
appears to go anyway the smoother the
frame<00:03:05.730> rate<00:03:05.940> gets<00:03:06.180> weird<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.440> can<00:03:07.500> see<00:03:07.590> there

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769
