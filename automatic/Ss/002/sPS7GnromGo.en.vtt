I'm<00:03:39.709> studying<00:03:40.280> stress<00:03:40.910> for<00:03:41.239> 30<00:03:41.480> years<00:03:41.750> now<00:03:42.020> and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
I'm studying stress for 30 years now and

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.410 
I'm studying stress for 30 years now and
I<00:03:42.380> even<00:03:42.590> tell<00:03:43.459> people<00:03:43.489> how<00:03:43.940> they<00:03:44.090> should<00:03:44.120> live

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
I even tell people how they should live

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.600 
I even tell people how they should live
differently<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.470> presumably<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.069> should<00:03:46.489> have

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
differently so presumably I should have

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.339 
differently so presumably I should have
incorporated<00:03:47.180> all<00:03:47.300> of<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:47.599> in<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.840> reality

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
incorporated all of this in the reality

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.770 
incorporated all of this in the reality
is<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:48.800> I'm<00:03:49.120> unbelievably<00:03:50.120> stressed<00:03:50.510> in

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
is like I'm unbelievably stressed in

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.830 
is like I'm unbelievably stressed in

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
Taipei and poorly coping and like why

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.140 
Taipei and poorly coping and like why
else<00:03:54.080> would<00:03:54.349> I<00:03:54.380> study<00:03:54.860> this<00:03:55.099> stuff<00:03:55.400> 80<00:03:55.700> hours<00:03:56.120> a

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
else would I study this stuff 80 hours a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.110 
else would I study this stuff 80 hours a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.729 
week no doubt everything I advise is
going<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.360> lose<00:03:59.480> all<00:03:59.690> this<00:03:59.810> credibility<00:04:00.500> if<00:04:00.620> I

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
going to lose all this credibility if I

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.650 
going to lose all this credibility if I
keel<00:04:01.040> over<00:04:01.069> dead<00:04:01.430> from<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.910> heart<00:04:02.120> attack<00:04:02.269> in<00:04:02.630> my

with<00:04:06.260> stress<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:07.310> know<00:04:07.400> one<00:04:08.090> thing<00:04:08.420> that

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
with stress you know one thing that

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.809 
with stress you know one thing that
works<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.989> my<00:04:09.110> advantage<00:04:09.140> is<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:09.860> love<00:04:10.340> my<00:04:10.370> work

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
works to my advantage is I love my work

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.640 
works to my advantage is I love my work
and<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.120> love<00:04:11.269> her<00:04:11.390> every<00:04:11.569> aspect<00:04:12.260> of<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.500> so

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
and I love her every aspect of it so

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.940 
and I love her every aspect of it so
that's<00:04:12.860> good<00:04:13.160> but<00:04:13.580> nonetheless<00:04:14.769> this<00:04:15.769> is

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
that's good but nonetheless this is

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.400 
that's good but nonetheless this is
pretty<00:04:16.190> clearly<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.700> different<00:04:17.120> place<00:04:17.359> than

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
pretty clearly a different place than

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.159 
pretty clearly a different place than

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
the savanna in East Africa you know you

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.190 
the savanna in East Africa you know you
can<00:04:21.350> do<00:04:21.500> science<00:04:21.979> here<00:04:22.280> that's<00:04:22.639> very

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
can do science here that's very

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.600 
can do science here that's very
different<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.440> more<00:04:24.770> interesting<00:04:24.830> in<00:04:25.400> some

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
different and more interesting in some

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.610 
different and more interesting in some
ways<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:26.210> can<00:04:26.360> have<00:04:26.479> hot<00:04:26.720> showers<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.470> more

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
ways you can have hot showers and a more

ways you can have hot showers and a more
regular<00:04:27.979> basis<00:04:28.490> it's<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.970> more<00:04:29.570> interesting

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
regular basis it's a more interesting

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.000 
regular basis it's a more interesting
varied<00:04:30.919> world<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.790> lots<00:04:32.150> of<00:04:32.389> ways<00:04:32.600> but<00:04:33.010> yeah

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
varied world and lots of ways but yeah
