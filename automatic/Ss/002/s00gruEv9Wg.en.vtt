 to fox stallion already starting from the 11th 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.370
 All the more even rounds in the Basque are excellent 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.610
 still no drop at the World Cup made 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.840
 to enter the final 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 then they will all start with zero that we will see the results of the 95th

 considered for the final 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.820
 Zwiener all with horse change 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.540
 HSG Osterburg location created the best four to come 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.840
 it was not meant to be 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.910
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, carsten-otto Nagel with an excellent fifth place 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.520
 but not event among the top four 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.830
 he managed Philipp lapping as well as he lived then and Rodrigo

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.129
 of the year as a serial winner of big prizes, his name was always completely 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.950

 both Abdullah's old hitters party the big names like Merckle in town are not 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.469
