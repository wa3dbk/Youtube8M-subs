00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.269 
traffic controller tower with a world on
the<00:05:45.699> top<00:05:45.939> oh<00:05:46.240> my<00:05:46.710> least<00:05:47.710> I<00:05:47.830> figured<00:05:48.129> that<00:05:48.250> out

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
the top oh my least I figured that out

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.510 
the top oh my least I figured that out
while<00:05:48.550> we're<00:05:48.729> still<00:05:48.939> on<00:05:49.029> camera<00:05:50.039> so<00:05:51.039> yeah<00:05:51.219> I

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
while we're still on camera so yeah I

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.950 
while we're still on camera so yeah I
guess<00:05:51.699> these<00:05:51.939> Asian<00:05:52.240> beetles<00:05:52.539> are<00:05:52.689> sort<00:05:52.899> of

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
guess these Asian beetles are sort of

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.869 
guess these Asian beetles are sort of
like<00:05:53.020> their<00:05:53.349> their<00:05:53.830> airplanes<00:05:54.189> in<00:05:54.460> their
