00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello to all guys well found in a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.540
 another video of cameron as promised here 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.389
 now a tutorial we will see to build one 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.230
 historical but a stabilizer for the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.000
 your video camera but also photographic 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.670
 to make your shots in 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.190
 protective that the results are not stable 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 that if cinematographic 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.270
 don't expect anything but who knows 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.239
 he gets along and does his job 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:44.260
 in the video you will see doctors this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.900
 but I deny here in this handle here they will be 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.960
 a little bit of the order 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:53.620
 I have shortened them a lot because 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.410
 I think this way this way 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.490
 a more stable structure you have the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.610
 more grip on the hands however we see 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:08.500
 how to build it well for this job 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:13.630
 four pieces of PVC of 10 will follow us 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:19.690
 centimeters each one a piece of PVC from 15 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.960
 centimeters and two lost by 28 cm this is 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.740
 all the material 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.890
 furthermore 14 curves will succeed 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.330
 the four pieces of morbidity enlivened 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:40.390
 of the same diameter as the other doubts 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.200
 and 2t always of the same diameter and gods 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.650
 our doubts 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.740
 ok 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.420
 3 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.890
 but aid is here that they will tell me here for 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.890
 stay together 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:04.500
 I have to say a glue two 5 tail screws 6 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.510
 levels from the diameter 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.929
 he made our car 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.929
 photo of two already of a stable 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.010
 of the attackers 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.530
 the nude 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:30.790
 a meter a sequel to physical cut 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.790
 and a permanent marker 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.110
 this is all material that ends 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.750
 well 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.750
 pure we should also unite precisely 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.060
 12 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:49.460
 ok once you've joined the last other pieces 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:53.120
 we must dismantle everything and 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:04:01.410
 glue them with glue 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:05.450
 now we have to take our lives 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:10.700
 well now let's insert the butterfly data 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.700
 within our life 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:26.820
 ok we put our ball 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:30.870
 inside the vine and now we take it 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.270
 insert the fruit into everything 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.270
 hole four preferences 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.990
 ok we have achieved our support 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.890
 for our camera 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.680
 or another falls into the first one below 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.740
 your camera is a 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.050
 fillet connection and you must insert 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.050
 this life of this threaded attachment 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:07.200
 well the structure could be 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:12.080
 ended here but I did at the beginning 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:17.910
 see this tube ok what was the turbo 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:22.640
 I would put it as a handle is a tube 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.850
 from 15 cm thread we will fit together 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.850
 in the t 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:40.550
 parallel post 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:43.759
 then we say we're going to add 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.500
 we cash in and how we can see the 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:51.590
 our culture you will see will yield 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:54.620
 our attack is fairly stable 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.800
 where the machine will be inserted 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.759
 photographic and this is ours 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.759
 handle 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:19.579
 no 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.780
 you have seen from the video text that precisely 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:32.680
 nothing special, nothing special 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:38.490
 but your filming is nevertheless many 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:41.139
 not stabilized than usual we say 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:44.319
 this range is, let's say it's done 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:51.220
 for people who want to do it again 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:53.860
 all the interviews or other things 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.430
 of this kind but it is a very good one 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:01.180
 stabilizer I hope he lived in denial 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:03.400
 commented sign up and let me know 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:08.099
 if you liked it let me know if you want 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:10.259
 other video tutorials for that is all 

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:13.620
 here from room on 

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:13.620
 hello everyone guys
