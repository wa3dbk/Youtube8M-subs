00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.920 
that long duration you can almost
predict<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.069> domains<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.970> sense<00:03:57.209> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
predict the domains in a sense the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.630 
predict the domains in a sense the
movements<00:03:58.260> will<00:03:58.380> always<00:03:58.560> be<00:03:58.709> varied<00:03:59.069> but<00:03:59.250> it's

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
movements will always be varied but it's

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.890 
movements will always be varied but it's
going<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.000> separate<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.540> know<00:04:00.630> it's<00:04:00.750> going<00:04:00.840> to

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
going to separate you know it's going to

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.530 
going to separate you know it's going to
be<00:04:01.020> a<00:04:01.050> lot<00:04:01.200> heavier<00:04:01.349> lot<00:04:02.099> stronger<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.330> feel

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
be a lot heavier lot stronger and I feel

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.699 
be a lot heavier lot stronger and I feel
like<00:04:03.569> when<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.900> get<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.230> games<00:04:04.440> it's

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
obviously a reward but it's a reward in

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.440 
obviously a reward but it's a reward in
the<00:04:07.319> sense<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.670> it's<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:08.940> fun<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.420> you
