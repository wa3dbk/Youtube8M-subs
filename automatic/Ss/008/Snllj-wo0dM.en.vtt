that way here is the RF receiver and now
the<00:02:21.870> great<00:02:22.080> part<00:02:22.319> about<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:22.620> headset<00:02:23.010> is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
the great part about this headset is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.300 
the great part about this headset is
actually<00:02:23.490> dual-band<00:02:23.850> five<00:02:24.600> point<00:02:24.900> 0<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.350> 2.4

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.400 
actually dual-band five point 0 and 2.4
gigahertz<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.970> most<00:02:27.569> interference<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.319> be

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
gigahertz so most interference will be

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.800 
gigahertz so most interference will be
eliminated<00:02:29.100> by<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:30.060> here<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.390> it

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.400 
see the case they didn't come with a
nice<00:06:35.030> little<00:06:35.240> carrying<00:06:35.630> case<00:06:35.720> like<00:06:36.080> the<00:06:36.170> last

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
nice little carrying case like the last

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.170 
nice little carrying case like the last
one<00:06:36.530> did<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:37.070> this<00:06:37.520> one<00:06:37.700> actually<00:06:37.850> came<00:06:38.150> with

one did and this one actually came with
a<00:06:38.420> carrying<00:06:38.660> case<00:06:38.960> I<00:06:39.700> actually<00:06:40.700> think<00:06:41.000> that

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
a carrying case I actually think that

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.030 
a carrying case I actually think that
that<00:06:41.450> was<00:06:41.660> really<00:06:42.230> nice<00:06:42.410> it<00:06:42.440> actually<00:06:42.920> came

that was really nice it actually came
with<00:06:43.220> a<00:06:43.280> case<00:06:43.310> it<00:06:43.910> was<00:06:44.180> actually<00:06:44.300> really<00:06:44.570> nice

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
with a case it was actually really nice

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.110 
with a case it was actually really nice

different<00:07:18.200> construction<00:07:18.710> it's<00:07:19.340> a<00:07:19.550> cloth<00:07:19.960> as

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 
different construction it's a cloth as

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.240 
different construction it's a cloth as
the<00:07:21.170> previous<00:07:21.350> one<00:07:21.650> it's<00:07:21.830> not<00:07:21.920> you<00:07:22.220> know

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.250 
the previous one it's not you know

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.230 
the previous one it's not you know
reflective<00:07:23.350> emblem<00:07:24.350> and<00:07:25.030> definitely<00:07:26.030> not<00:07:26.180> a

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
reflective emblem and definitely not a

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.540 
reflective emblem and definitely not a
broader<00:07:26.540> in<00:07:26.690> Mount<00:07:26.840> weather<00:07:26.900> and<00:07:27.490> it's<00:07:28.490> even

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
broader in Mount weather and it's even

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.190 
broader in Mount weather and it's even
says<00:07:28.820> call<00:07:29.000> of<00:07:29.090> duty<00:07:29.270> over<00:07:29.420> the<00:07:29.510> top<00:07:29.720> and<00:07:29.900> the

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200 
says call of duty over the top and the

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.660 
says call of duty over the top and the
other<00:07:30.320> one<00:07:30.470> does<00:07:30.650> as<00:07:30.800> well<00:07:30.950> and<00:07:31.220> the

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670 
other one does as well and the

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.430 
other one does as well and the
microphone<00:07:32.390> seems<00:07:32.630> just<00:07:32.810> a<00:07:32.900> little<00:07:32.930> bit<00:07:33.230> less

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 
microphone seems just a little bit less

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.740 
microphone seems just a little bit less
flimsy<00:07:33.950> as<00:07:34.070> the<00:07:34.250> last<00:07:34.460> one<00:07:34.730> so<00:07:35.360> this<00:07:35.570> one's

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:35.750 
flimsy as the last one so this one's

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.130 
flimsy as the last one so this one's
nice<00:07:35.870> but<00:07:36.170> plus<00:07:36.530> the<00:07:36.950> best<00:07:37.070> part<00:07:37.460> is<00:07:38.140> no

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.140 
nice but plus the best part is no

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.110 
nice but plus the best part is no
batteries<00:07:39.670> you<00:07:40.670> don't<00:07:40.790> have<00:07:40.880> to<00:07:41.000> use

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 
batteries you don't have to use

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.310 
batteries you don't have to use
rechargeable<00:07:41.240> batteries<00:07:41.900> that's<00:07:42.080> what<00:07:42.200> I<00:07:42.230> do

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.320 
rechargeable batteries that's what I do

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.510 
rechargeable batteries that's what I do
so<00:07:42.560> I<00:07:42.620> don't<00:07:42.770> have<00:07:42.830> to<00:07:42.920> keep<00:07:43.100> buying<00:07:43.370> batteries

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 
so I don't have to keep buying batteries

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.250 
so I don't have to keep buying batteries
all<00:07:43.820> the<00:07:43.910> time<00:07:44.090> but<00:07:44.780> these<00:07:44.930> are<00:07:45.080> the<00:07:45.140> two

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.260 
all the time but these are the two

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.190 
all the time but these are the two
headsets<00:07:45.680> your<00:07:46.520> force<00:07:46.760> Delta<00:07:47.030> your<00:07:47.930> force

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.200 
headsets your force Delta your force

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.240 
headsets your force Delta your force
tango<00:07:48.910> definitely<00:07:49.910> different<00:07:50.120> but<00:07:50.590> and<00:07:51.590> this

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.250 
tango definitely different but and this

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.700 
tango definitely different but and this
one<00:07:52.430> is<00:07:52.550> definitely<00:07:53.230> going<00:07:54.230> to<00:07:54.290> be<00:07:54.380> one<00:07:54.560> of<00:07:54.590> my

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:54.710 
one is definitely going to be one of my

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.900 
one is definitely going to be one of my
favorites<00:07:55.010> when<00:07:55.100> probably<00:07:55.280> can<00:07:55.520> we<00:07:55.640> just<00:07:55.820> can

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:55.910 
favorites when probably can we just can

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.700 
favorites when probably can we just can
keep<00:07:56.090> this<00:07:56.270> and<00:07:56.540> use<00:07:56.810> it<00:07:56.840> from<00:07:57.020> nostalgia<00:07:57.290> and

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:57.710 
keep this and use it from nostalgia and

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.620 
keep this and use it from nostalgia and
this<00:07:57.890> was<00:07:58.040> going<00:07:58.130> to<00:07:58.190> be<00:07:58.250> my<00:07:58.310> primary<00:07:58.610> and<00:07:59.210> I

00:07:59.620 --> 00:07:59.630 
this was going to be my primary and I

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.210 
this was going to be my primary and I
