00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.030
 It is Sunday as they are 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.110
 holly washa people good evening nights 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:24.029
 days as I know be galicia is already 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.029
 Sunday and it's time to upload video talk 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.029
 hurt 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.170
 good yes 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.649
 this time I'm going to talk from the subway 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.430
 because it does two months as muse 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.239
 three months 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.729
 notición I began to work there are not nine 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.559
 we all know what metro means 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.559
 the acronym of f 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:01.300
 of meaning 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.860
 and these are the acronym of this same I 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.479
 she always traveled in alabama not women 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.150
 but yourself if it passed this 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.170
 I think it broke down or something like that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.030
 then he fell late he did not go out and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.830
 it kept coming and coming and coming 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.110
 people but nobody left because the method 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.340
 of a functioning state then is the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.200
 at the moment in which it delivered the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.700
 stairs and between all that is the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.400
 space the scales to place the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.070
 things happen to turn until I was already 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.619
 full of people were standing and we passed 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.720
 all that and it was really full 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.220
 full when we get on the subway 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.100
 I really made myself one with all 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.290
 the people that one 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.530
 for the first time I felt what they 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.830
 they felt breathe at the same time and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.960
 I could also connect the system 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.690
 nervous with his beautiful one is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.299
 so nervous systems mixed the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.100
 subway still went off it took like 10 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.680
 minutes in advance we were ten 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.110
 minutes like this 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.030
 and not happy with that obviously between 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.590
 more time went by, more people came more 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.930
 people came to everyone was made 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.720
 late and everyone wanted to get in 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.460
 the same car at the same time all 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.460
 together we were all 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.780
 how to compress people and if that was how 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.910
 compress people point people talk happens 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.430
 the troops are returned to a station and 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.230
 they get off two hours they stay open 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 the doors are lowered two ladies 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:42.269
 shout went down two enter another ten 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.269
 they went down two among others 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.010
 I got the damn oxygen ok ok 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.750
 advanced advanced and they know that after their 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.320
 I passed the next station that was 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.940
 hidalgo hidalgo and verb is a station 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.920
 where a lot of people change that 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.890
 means that if in the other stations 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.710
 there were people in going something had more damn 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.600
 people and they know what happened relationships are 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.600

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.250
 I really swear to you at the door 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.380

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.110
 make your meetings here to be able to 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.660
 close the doors and there were people from 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.050
 outside that pushed us like this to 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.180
