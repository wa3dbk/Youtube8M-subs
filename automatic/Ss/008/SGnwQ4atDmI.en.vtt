now<00:02:36.950> while<00:02:37.950> we're<00:02:38.099> letting<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.430> upper<00:02:38.640> body

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
now while we're letting the upper body

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.390 
now while we're letting the upper body
kind<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.239> rest<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.659> bit<00:02:39.689> we're<00:02:40.560> super<00:02:41.010> setting

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
kind of rest a bit we're super setting

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.459 
kind of rest a bit we're super setting
this<00:02:41.549> with<00:02:41.819> walking<00:02:42.299> weighted<00:02:42.659> lunges<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
this with walking weighted lunges and

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.179 
this with walking weighted lunges and
we're<00:02:43.980> actually<00:02:44.129> going<00:02:44.489> down<00:02:44.870> about<00:02:45.870> 15<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
we're actually going down about 15 and

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.550 
we're actually going down about 15 and
then<00:02:47.879> we're<00:02:48.060> coming<00:02:48.420> back<00:02:48.569> 15<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.319> when<00:02:49.439> we

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
then we're coming back 15 and when we

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.220 
then we're coming back 15 and when we
come<00:02:49.829> back<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.730> gets<00:02:50.909> real<00:02:51.359> tricky<00:02:51.780> cuz<00:02:52.079> you're

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
come back it gets real tricky cuz you're

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.020 
come back it gets real tricky cuz you're
gonna<00:02:52.319> have<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.620> really<00:02:52.980> hold<00:02:53.340> your<00:02:53.549> balance

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
gonna have to really hold your balance

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.390 
gonna have to really hold your balance
and<00:02:54.299> again<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.349> gonna<00:02:55.500> cause<00:02:55.829> for<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.129> lot<00:02:56.280> of

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
and again it's gonna cause for a lot of

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.610 
and again it's gonna cause for a lot of
core<00:02:56.639> support<00:02:57.180> because<00:02:57.810> it'll<00:02:58.049> throw<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.379> off

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
core support because it'll throw you off

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.520 
core support because it'll throw you off
you<00:02:59.519> could<00:02:59.700> see<00:02:59.969> it's<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.269> lot<00:03:00.569> more<00:03:01.139> tricky

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
you could see it's a lot more tricky

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.429 
you could see it's a lot more tricky
he's<00:03:02.280> really<00:03:02.939> having<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.420> focus<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:04.079> not<00:03:04.260> as

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
he's really having to focus it's not as

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.080 
he's really having to focus it's not as
easy<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:04.739> stepping<00:03:05.219> forward<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.670> lunging

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
easy as stepping forward and lunging

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:19.959 
easy as stepping forward and lunging
down<00:03:15.470> or<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:16.709> coming<00:03:17.010> down<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.450> pressing<00:03:18.870> up

down or just coming down and pressing up

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.110 
down or just coming down and pressing up
is<00:03:20.969> a<00:03:21.169> lot<00:03:22.169> more<00:03:22.379> of<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.590> harder<00:03:23.310> exercise<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.000> be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
is a lot more of a harder exercise to be

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.119 
is a lot more of a harder exercise to be
performing<00:03:24.719> he's<00:03:25.049> got<00:03:25.230> his<00:03:25.379> feet<00:03:25.620> down<00:03:25.919> on<00:03:26.099> the

instability<00:03:29.159> with<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.299> exercise<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.049> you're

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
instability with this exercise so you're

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.470 
instability with this exercise so you're
having<00:03:31.379> to<00:03:31.439> keep<00:03:31.590> your<00:03:31.739> core<00:03:32.069> real<00:03:32.760> supportive

like pulling up on the handlebars it's a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.520 
like pulling up on the handlebars it's a
motion<00:04:13.450> that's<00:04:13.599> real<00:04:13.840> similar<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.260> what<00:04:14.409> you

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
motion that's real similar to what you

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.180 
motion that's real similar to what you
do<00:04:14.650> when<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:14.889> ride<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:16.209> give<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.720> one<00:04:16.750> more
