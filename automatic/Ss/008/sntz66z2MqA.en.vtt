you get two of those you get an install
card<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.990> get<00:01:55.140> dust<00:01:55.530> removal

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
card and then you get dust removal

take too much time getting all the dust

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.319 
take too much time getting all the dust
out<00:02:28.989> but<00:02:29.560> if<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:29.950> wipe<00:02:30.159> it<00:02:30.310> off<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:31.030> not<00:02:31.150> too

out but if I wipe it off it's not too
much<00:02:31.450> under<00:02:31.750> there<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.930> got<00:02:32.170> most<00:02:32.379> of<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.620> out

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
much under there I got most of it out

much under there I got most of it out
but<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.489> see<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.420> know<00:02:34.450> from<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
but you can see that you know from the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.839 
but you can see that you know from the
naked<00:02:35.230> eye<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.680> can<00:02:35.920> hardly<00:02:36.159> tell<00:02:36.310> there's<00:02:36.790> a

naked eye you can hardly tell there's a
screen<00:02:37.180> shield<00:02:37.390> on<00:02:37.690> there<00:02:37.930> as<00:02:38.319> far<00:02:38.500> as<00:02:38.620> the

screen shield on there as far as the

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.430 
screen shield on there as far as the
display<00:02:39.129> goes<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:40.030> looks<00:02:40.299> as<00:02:40.599> if<00:02:40.659> you<00:02:41.319> know

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
display goes it looks as if you know

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.170 
display goes it looks as if you know
there's<00:02:41.739> no<00:02:41.980> shield<00:02:42.250> on<00:02:42.459> there<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.879> retina

there's no shield on there the retina

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.360 
there's no shield on there the retina
display<00:02:43.480> looks<00:02:43.720> almost<00:02:44.190> let's<00:02:45.190> say

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
display looks almost let's say

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.270 
display looks almost let's say
ninety-nine<00:02:45.910> point<00:02:46.209> nine<00:02:46.329> percent<00:02:47.079> clear<00:02:47.739> you

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
ninety-nine point nine percent clear you

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.099 
ninety-nine point nine percent clear you
can't<00:02:48.579> tell<00:02:48.910> there's<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.269> shield<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.750> there<00:02:49.989> if

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
can't tell there's a shield on there if

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.960 
can't tell there's a shield on there if
you<00:02:50.230> install<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.829> these<00:02:50.920> ultra<00:02:51.459> crystals

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
you install one of these ultra crystals

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.030 
you install one of these ultra crystals
properly<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:53.109> can't<00:02:53.379> tell<00:02:53.530> there's<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.799> screen

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
properly you can't tell there's a screen

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.589 
properly you can't tell there's a screen
chilled<00:02:54.250> on<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.489> screen<00:02:54.730> now<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.299> only

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
chilled on your screen now the only

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.170 
chilled on your screen now the only
drawback<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:57.010> do<00:02:57.129> get<00:02:57.370> some<00:02:57.579> fingerprints

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
drawback is you do get some fingerprints

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.000 
drawback is you do get some fingerprints
if<00:02:58.299> I<00:02:58.359> were<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.629> use<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.959> for<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.260> while<00:02:59.409> you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
if I were to use this for a while you

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.890 
if I were to use this for a while you
know<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.220> swiping<00:03:00.519> around<00:03:00.819> you'll<00:03:01.329> get<00:03:01.480> some

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
know and swiping around you'll get some

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.839 
know and swiping around you'll get some
fingerprints<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.739> don't<00:03:02.890> get<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.069> ton<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
fingerprints you don't get a ton the

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.880 
fingerprints you don't get a ton the
sign<00:03:04.299> no<00:03:04.450> products<00:03:04.900> pretty<00:03:05.230> good<00:03:05.470> even<00:03:05.739> the

sign no products pretty good even the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.979 
sign no products pretty good even the
ultra<00:03:06.190> crystal<00:03:06.579> version<00:03:06.940> but<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.540> do<00:03:07.780> get

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
ultra crystal version but you do get

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.140 
ultra crystal version but you do get
some<00:03:08.230> fingerprints<00:03:09.159> that<00:03:09.549> will<00:03:09.790> end<00:03:10.000> up

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
some fingerprints that will end up

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.580 
some fingerprints that will end up

so<00:03:44.169> now<00:03:44.319> let's<00:03:44.560> take<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.799> look<00:03:44.889> at<00:03:45.190> the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
so now let's take a look at the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.330 
so now let's take a look at the
ultrafine<00:03:46.530> anti-fingerprint<00:03:47.530> installed<00:03:48.099> on

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
ultrafine anti-fingerprint installed on

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.270 
ultrafine anti-fingerprint installed on
the<00:03:48.790> iphone<00:03:48.819> 4<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:50.079> can<00:03:50.109> see<00:03:50.440> again<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:51.040> one

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
the iphone 4 you can see again this one

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.430 
the iphone 4 you can see again this one
I<00:03:51.310> think<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.730> cutouts<00:03:52.060> fit<00:03:52.389> even<00:03:52.750> better<00:03:52.900> this

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
I think the cutouts fit even better this

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.689 
I think the cutouts fit even better this
home<00:03:53.709> button<00:03:53.980> lines<00:03:54.220> up<00:03:54.459> absolutely

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
home button lines up absolutely

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.390 
home button lines up absolutely
perfectly<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:56.230> cutouts<00:03:56.620> at<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.889> top<00:03:57.129> are

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
perfectly the cutouts at the top are

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.220 
perfectly the cutouts at the top are
individual<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.299> have<00:03:58.419> an<00:03:58.510> individual<00:03:59.019> cut

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
individual so you have an individual cut

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.409 
individual so you have an individual cut
out<00:03:59.349> for<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.799> camera<00:04:00.760> lens<00:04:00.879> and<00:04:01.209> an

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
out for the camera lens and an

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.990 
out for the camera lens and an
individual<00:04:01.870> cut<00:04:02.049> out<00:04:02.169> for<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.620> earpiece<00:04:03.400> you

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
individual cut out for the earpiece you

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.670 
individual cut out for the earpiece you
can<00:04:04.180> see<00:04:04.389> that<00:04:04.599> the<00:04:04.780> anti-fingerprint

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
can see that the anti-fingerprint

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.189 
can see that the anti-fingerprint
doesn't<00:04:06.129> show<00:04:06.250> any<00:04:06.400> fingerprints<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.930> not

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
doesn't show any fingerprints it's not

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.470 
doesn't show any fingerprints it's not
again<00:04:08.709> you<00:04:08.949> lose<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.190> little<00:04:09.519> bit<00:04:09.669> of<00:04:09.819> display

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
again you lose a little bit of display

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.629 
again you lose a little bit of display
it<00:04:10.780> dulls<00:04:11.169> the<00:04:11.379> retina<00:04:11.769> display<00:04:12.129> just<00:04:12.430> a

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
it dulls the retina display just a

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.159 
it dulls the retina display just a
little<00:04:12.879> bit<00:04:13.030> but<00:04:13.540> if<00:04:13.690> you're<00:04:13.840> someone<00:04:14.109> that

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
little bit but if you're someone that

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.720 
little bit but if you're someone that
doesn't<00:04:14.530> like<00:04:14.590> fingerprints<00:04:15.220> on<00:04:15.310> your<00:04:15.400> iphone

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
doesn't like fingerprints on your iphone

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.699 
doesn't like fingerprints on your iphone
4<00:04:15.970> you're<00:04:16.120> probably<00:04:16.359> willing<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.780> exchange<00:04:17.109> a

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
4 you're probably willing to exchange a

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.740 
4 you're probably willing to exchange a
little<00:04:18.250> bit<00:04:18.370> of<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:19.120> know<00:04:19.209> colorfulness

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
little bit of the you know colorfulness

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.990 
little bit of the you know colorfulness
of<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.139> retina<00:04:20.410> display<00:04:20.739> for<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.340> screen<00:04:21.849> show

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
of the retina display for a screen show

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.149 
of the retina display for a screen show
that<00:04:22.240> shows<00:04:22.510> virtually<00:04:23.050> no<00:04:23.260> fingerprints<00:04:24.070> I

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
that shows virtually no fingerprints I

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.159 
that shows virtually no fingerprints I
mean<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.520> thing<00:04:24.760> chose<00:04:25.030> none<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.539> can<00:04:25.960> rub

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
mean and this thing chose none I can rub

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.840 
mean and this thing chose none I can rub
my<00:04:26.349> oily<00:04:26.740> fingers<00:04:26.919> all<00:04:27.340> over

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
my oily fingers all over

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.660 
my oily fingers all over
and<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.570> doesn't<00:04:28.750> show<00:04:29.050> anything<00:04:29.470> at<00:04:29.830> all<00:04:29.980> the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
and it doesn't show anything at all the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.730 
and it doesn't show anything at all the
other<00:04:30.790> nice<00:04:31.000> thing<00:04:31.240> about<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
other nice thing about the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.620 
other nice thing about the
anti-fingerprint<00:04:32.740> one<00:04:32.980> is<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.880> kind<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.450> has<00:04:34.600> a

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
anti-fingerprint one is it kind of has a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.180 
anti-fingerprint one is it kind of has a
different<00:04:34.990> texture<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.010> little

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
different texture to it it's a little

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.720 
different texture to it it's a little
bit<00:04:36.310> rougher<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:38.140> like<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.680> some<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.610> the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
bit rougher and I like that some of the

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.640 
bit rougher and I like that some of the
crystal<00:04:40.240> clear<00:04:40.570> shields<00:04:41.230> are<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.380> little<00:04:41.470> bit

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
crystal clear shields are a little bit

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.560 
crystal clear shields are a little bit
slick<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.280> find<00:04:42.520> my<00:04:42.640> finger<00:04:42.940> slides<00:04:43.240> across

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
slick and I find my finger slides across

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.480 
slick and I find my finger slides across
the<00:04:43.810> screen<00:04:43.990> too<00:04:44.260> easily<00:04:44.440> this<00:04:45.130> one<00:04:45.370> just

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
the screen too easily this one just

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.490 
the screen too easily this one just
gives<00:04:45.730> you<00:04:45.820> enough<00:04:46.180> resistance<00:04:46.570> that<00:04:47.050> you

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
gives you enough resistance that you

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.690 
gives you enough resistance that you
know<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.680> know<00:04:47.950> what<00:04:48.100> you're<00:04:48.220> doing<00:04:48.550> when

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
know you know what you're doing when

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.310 
know you know what you're doing when
you're<00:04:48.820> sliding<00:04:49.180> your<00:04:49.450> hands<00:04:49.810> all<00:04:49.960> over<00:04:49.990> the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
you're sliding your hands all over the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.070 
you're sliding your hands all over the
screen<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.860> again<00:04:51.700> lack<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.240> fingerprints<00:04:52.810> in

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
screen and again lack of fingerprints in

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.340 
screen and again lack of fingerprints in
my<00:04:53.320> opinion<00:04:53.620> is<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.890> really<00:04:54.580> nice<00:04:54.730> added<00:04:55.090> bonus

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
my opinion is a really nice added bonus

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.470 
my opinion is a really nice added bonus
so<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.860> ultrafine

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
so that is the ultrafine

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.880 
so that is the ultrafine
anti-fingerprint<00:04:58.480> these<00:04:58.900> will<00:04:59.080> cost<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.470> 15

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
anti-fingerprint these will cost you 15

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.760 
anti-fingerprint these will cost you 15
99<00:05:00.370> for<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:00.790> two<00:05:00.970> pack<00:05:01.330> last<00:05:02.290> but<00:05:02.590> not<00:05:02.710> least

99 for a two pack last but not least

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.290 
99 for a two pack last but not least
we'll<00:05:03.250> take<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.430> look<00:05:03.610> at<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:03.850> ultra

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
we'll take a look at the ultra

stein hill protectors the reason why i

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.170 
stein hill protectors the reason why i
like<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:35.890> so<00:05:35.920> much<00:05:36.100> is<00:05:36.400> it<00:05:36.550> really<00:05:36.790> combines

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
like it so much is it really combines

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.610 
like it so much is it really combines
the<00:05:37.600> both<00:05:38.020> aspects<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.950> ultra<00:05:39.790> clear<00:05:40.060> &amp;

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
the both aspects of ultra clear &amp;

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.930 
the both aspects of ultra clear &amp;
anti-fingerprint<00:05:41.620> it's<00:05:42.070> not<00:05:42.280> 100%

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
anti-fingerprint it's not 100%

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.550 
anti-fingerprint it's not 100%
anti-fingerprint<00:05:43.630> like<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:43.960> previous<00:05:44.170> one

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
anti-fingerprint like the previous one

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.740 
anti-fingerprint like the previous one
but<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:45.250> oil<00:05:45.460> resistant<00:05:46.120> coating<00:05:46.540> really

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
but the oil resistant coating really

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.870 
but the oil resistant coating really
does<00:05:46.900> a<00:05:46.930> nice<00:05:47.140> job<00:05:47.200> of<00:05:47.740> cutting<00:05:48.130> down<00:05:48.400> on<00:05:48.640> the

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
does a nice job of cutting down on the

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.490 
does a nice job of cutting down on the
fingerprints<00:05:49.450> and<00:05:49.570> you<00:05:49.990> don't<00:05:50.200> have<00:05:50.320> to

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
fingerprints and you don't have to

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.310 
fingerprints and you don't have to
sacrifice<00:05:50.680> any<00:05:51.250> of<00:05:51.670> the<00:05:52.060> retina<00:05:52.810> display<00:05:53.140> in

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
sacrifice any of the retina display in

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.350 
sacrifice any of the retina display in
order<00:05:53.530> to<00:05:53.650> do<00:05:53.800> so<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.250> you<00:05:54.580> can<00:05:54.700> see<00:05:54.880> how<00:05:54.910> clear

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
order to do so so you can see how clear

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.420 
order to do so so you can see how clear
that<00:05:55.390> is<00:05:55.630> you<00:05:56.380> know<00:05:56.410> again<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:57.220> know<00:05:57.310> it

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
that is you know again you know it

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.610 
that is you know again you know it
doesn't<00:05:57.610> take<00:05:57.970> away<00:05:58.810> all<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:59.200> fingerprints

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
doesn't take away all the fingerprints

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.470 
doesn't take away all the fingerprints
or<00:05:59.830> prevent<00:06:00.100> all<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.400> fingerprints<00:06:00.790> but<00:06:01.030> it

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
or prevent all the fingerprints but it

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.180 
or prevent all the fingerprints but it
does<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.720> better<00:06:01.930> job<00:06:02.080> than<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.590> crystal<00:06:02.980> clear

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
does a better job than the crystal clear

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.430 
does a better job than the crystal clear
and<00:06:03.400> again<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.240> like<00:06:04.450> showing<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.230> know<00:06:05.320> the

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
and again I like showing you know the

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.140 
and again I like showing you know the
beautifulness<00:06:05.890> of<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:06.490> retina<00:06:06.730> display<00:06:07.000> nye

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
beautifulness of the retina display nye

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.090 
beautifulness of the retina display nye
think<00:06:07.390> this<00:06:07.600> allows<00:06:08.200> you<00:06:08.410> to<00:06:08.500> do<00:06:08.620> so<00:06:08.830> with

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
think this allows you to do so with

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.460 
think this allows you to do so with
again<00:06:09.490> minimizing<00:06:10.450> the<00:06:10.540> amount<00:06:10.750> of<00:06:10.960> smudges

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
again minimizing the amount of smudges

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.240 
again minimizing the amount of smudges
you<00:06:11.590> get<00:06:11.740> on<00:06:11.890> your<00:06:11.950> iPhone<00:06:12.700> 4<00:06:14.040> alright<00:06:15.040> so<00:06:15.190> just

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
you get on your iPhone 4 alright so just

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.580 
you get on your iPhone 4 alright so just
to<00:06:15.700> recap<00:06:15.850> we<00:06:16.270> looked<00:06:16.450> at<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.660> ultra<00:06:17.020> crystal

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
to recap we looked at the ultra crystal

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.520 
to recap we looked at the ultra crystal
clear<00:06:17.950> that<00:06:18.250> gives<00:06:18.850> you<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.000> clearest<00:06:19.840> of<00:06:20.050> the

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
clear that gives you the clearest of the

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.730 
clear that gives you the clearest of the
bunch<00:06:20.710> clearest<00:06:21.610> display<00:06:22.110> 1399<00:06:23.110> for<00:06:23.620> the

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
bunch clearest display 1399 for the

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.760 
bunch clearest display 1399 for the
2-pack<00:06:24.130> we<00:06:24.700> looked<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:25.060> ultrafine

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
2-pack we looked the ultrafine

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.900 
2-pack we looked the ultrafine
anti-fingerprint<00:06:26.770> which<00:06:27.310> helps<00:06:27.640> greatly

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
anti-fingerprint which helps greatly

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.370 
anti-fingerprint which helps greatly
reduce<00:06:28.420> the<00:06:28.660> amount<00:06:28.780> of<00:06:28.930> smudges<00:06:29.350> and

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
reduce the amount of smudges and

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.320 
reduce the amount of smudges and
fingerprints<00:06:29.920> you<00:06:30.070> get<00:06:30.220> on<00:06:30.310> your<00:06:30.340> screen<00:06:30.760> but

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
fingerprints you get on your screen but

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.270 
fingerprints you get on your screen but
does<00:06:31.660> dull<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.230> screen<00:06:32.500> just<00:06:32.710> a<00:06:32.860> little<00:06:33.100> bit

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
does dull the screen just a little bit

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.610 
does dull the screen just a little bit
it's<00:06:33.760> also<00:06:33.970> a<00:06:34.150> little<00:06:34.450> bit<00:06:34.570> thinner<00:06:34.930> than<00:06:35.320> the

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
it's also a little bit thinner than the

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.190 
it's also a little bit thinner than the
regular<00:06:35.940> anti-fingerprint<00:06:36.940> so<00:06:37.210> if<00:06:37.630> you<00:06:37.870> you

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
regular anti-fingerprint so if you you

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.320 
regular anti-fingerprint so if you you
know<00:06:38.229> our<00:06:38.530> fan<00:06:38.860> of<00:06:39.040> anti<00:06:39.310> fingerprint<00:06:39.790> but

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
know our fan of anti fingerprint but

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.129 
know our fan of anti fingerprint but
don't<00:06:40.660> want<00:06:40.810> to<00:06:40.840> lose

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
don't want to lose

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.959 
don't want to lose
all<00:06:41.289> of<00:06:41.680> the<00:06:41.830> beautifulness<00:06:42.249> of<00:06:42.550> your<00:06:42.699> display

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
you may want to check the anti
