00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.320 
think making them on parchment paper it
makes<00:02:11.739> it<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.040> little<00:02:12.280> easier<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.940> clean<00:02:13.150> up

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
makes it a little easier to clean up

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.880 
makes it a little easier to clean up
this<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.590> baking<00:02:14.920> sheets<00:02:15.160> afterwards<00:02:16.890> all

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
this the baking sheets afterwards all

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.830 
this the baking sheets afterwards all
right<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.280> was<00:02:18.489> just<00:02:18.760> three<00:02:19.030> tablespoons<00:02:19.660> of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
right this was just three tablespoons of

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.570 
right this was just three tablespoons of
canola<00:02:20.019> oil<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.650> let<00:02:20.769> me<00:02:20.860> tell<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.400> goes<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
canola oil and let me tell you it goes a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.680 
canola oil and let me tell you it goes a
long<00:02:21.880> way<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.599> it'll<00:02:22.900> keep<00:02:23.019> your<00:02:23.170> potatoes

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
long way and it'll keep your potatoes

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.720

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
it'd be also a good time when you start
