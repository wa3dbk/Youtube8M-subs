00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:38.450
 from from wait to release many players 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.930
 believed that assassin's creed rock 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.120
 doomed and they could understand well where 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.780
 one more game on assassins universe 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.870
 creed 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.150
 coming out simultaneously with unity everything was 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.489
 it is clear which of the two sisters will give 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.059
 consumers and their money 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.730
 Frankly, I also thought that Rogue is a game. 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.339
 checkpoint need yubisoft only for 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.860
 how to please those who are not 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.650
 switched to a new generation console like 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.810
 it is often true is somewhere 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.760
 in the middle we will talk about it 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.780
 assassin's video review creed roug on 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.780
 playground.ru 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.600
 new story revolves around the neck 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.390
 Patrick Kormak talented assassin 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.490
 not losing shiva remnants of humanity he 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.170
 ready to fight the Knights Templar 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.640
 but it does not consider correct 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.040
 use their own methods 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.130
 for him human life is not empty 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.920
 sound and in the order of the assassins freethinkers 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.930
 don't support here either in the army either 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.000
 do you carry out the order either becomes 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.660
 ballast and soon disappear from the radar 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.720
 Diet practically it happened but his 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.460
 finds an elderly couple 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.370
 nurses and returns to the world again 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.460
 living necks goes to the side of the sworn 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.620
 enemy and declares war on people whom 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.900
 more recently he called brothers 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.580
 course of course banal but the writers 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.920
 coped perfectly 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.590
 neck motives are clear and good 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.990
 argued he is ready to support that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.300
 side of the conflict that will provide 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.850
 safety of ordinary people and if 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.980
 the templar capitalists are ready to enrich 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.090
 without mass stripping 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.790
 among the population 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.320
 then the neck will be on their side to better 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.660
 understand what i'm talking about look at 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.930
 what is happening now on your screen 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.930
 monitor 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.730
 ok this is not the madmen Templars 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.310
 we are used to seeing them and 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.680
 innocent ladybug Assassins 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.989
 after this scene it becomes clear why 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.880
 ears made just such a choice 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.700
 accordingly, now our main 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.440
 enemies experienced assassins to whom just 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.470
 so it will not work out 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.720
 they can sit for hours waiting for ambush 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.519
 the appearance of the neck as the only feeling hero 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.660
 approaching assassins he starts 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.390
 hear a quiet whisper 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.280
 and the image turns yellow at this moment 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.560
 you can turn on eagle vision 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.580
 There will be a special compass which 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.900
 previously attended 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.640
 multiuser mode 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.310
 compass shows which side 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.470
 move closer to an assassin so 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.470
 louder whisper as soon as the target is detected 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.540
 she needs to be killed and here the assassin is creed 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.790
 roug provide a wide choice 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.170
 various improvised tools first you 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.180
 can use explosive grenades 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.310
 just throw her in a taxi on and 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.890
 look at what your enemy will turn into 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.049
 in the second with the help of pump-action rifles we 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.630
 we can put the enemy to sleep with special darts 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.760
 and then finish it in third you can 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.630
 use classic barrel methods 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.359
 with explosives 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.130
 as well as the novelty of the season gas choking 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.620
 which send the enemy to 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.049
 Kormak has a long knockout 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.750
 special mask protecting it from 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.650
 poisonous fumes in general the appearance of an assassin 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.170
 as enemies 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.329
 played into the hands of roug if earlier we 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.430
 must have been in the mess of the crowd of ordinary soldiers 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.130
 while remaining the wrong 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.200
 now we are increasingly forced to leave 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.930
 homeland for example to catch up 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.269
 runaway assassin believe he will 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.519
 rush so to attract someone attention 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.260
 as many people as possible in such 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.359
 case only smoke bombs are saved 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.430
 that allow you to quickly go into the shadows 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.250
 obviously the find of the game has become a pump 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.380
 rifle namely darts berserkers 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.510
 if you shoot such a dart at the enemy 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.460
 then he goes crazy in a few minutes 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.590
 and begin to attack their own 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.960
 before my eyes such a madman cut out 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.180
 almost a whole street filled 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.580
 people and if earlier we would be for it 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.100
 punished and forced to pass a mission 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.720
 again now the developers are looking at 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.870
 civilian casualties 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.270
 through the fingers we're templar us 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.580
 supposed to be vile and unpleasant 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.100
 more precisely it nobody condemns us that already 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.110
 nice exactly the same situation with 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.210
 order and sea 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.550
 battles for the Templar 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.380
 The most powerful and effective weapon of the era 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.410
 so on the destruction of the enemy 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.480
 ship takes an average of 1 2 minutes and this 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.250
 if the ship is high level so for 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.020
 low minutes usually stoked two three 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.690
 medium vessel and this is in my opinion 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 A big plus of the game as already in black 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.940
 flag many complained about endless 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.530
 sea ​​battles of the same type followed 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.350
 boarding apparently developers 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.330
 listened to the players on sensations even 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.610
 travel speed with full sails 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.620
 increased add to this point 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.750
 fast moving by sea and even those 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.090
 who doesn't really like this part of the game 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.630
 only one will be satisfied 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.730
 the problem of all this does not make sign significant 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.470
 a game that absolutely must 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.090
 have your collections every player 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.310
 it is primarily aimed at 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.650
 fans of the series which without any 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.720
 advertising activity and so would bring 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.730
 your money shop and everything else 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.100
 I'm afraid she will show a rather a secondary 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.160
 if only because represented in the game 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.260
 the world is anyway compilation already 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.840
 familiar locations with some 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.210
 additions and maybe if there were no 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.680
 black flag the rock could 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.620
 interest a wider audience 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.730
 but alas, now it's just another game 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.500
 about the opposition of the asasins and the Templars 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.600
 the latter just swapped for 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.440
 that's all good luck and see you on 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.440
