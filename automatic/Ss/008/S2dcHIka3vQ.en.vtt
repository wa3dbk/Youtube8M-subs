00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
in the end so now let's get to this so

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.799 
in the end so now let's get to this so
basically<00:00:49.910> they're<00:00:50.210> not<00:00:50.329> really<00:00:50.450> changing

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
basically they're not really changing

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.690 
basically they're not really changing
Sagittario<00:00:51.590> too<00:00:51.770> much<00:00:51.950> but<00:00:52.160> is<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.430> spark

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
Sagittario too much but is the spark

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.299 
Sagittario too much but is the spark
effects<00:00:53.030> version<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:54.290> only<00:00:54.770> real<00:00:55.040> difference

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
effects version the only real difference

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.850 
effects version the only real difference
the<00:00:56.090> touch<00:00:56.300> of<00:00:56.510> face<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.320> energy<00:00:57.559> right

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
the touch of face and the energy right

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.920 
the touch of face and the energy right
color<00:00:58.100> but<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.969> them<00:00:59.090> that's<00:00:59.360> not<00:00:59.690> really<00:00:59.899> that

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
color but of them that's not really that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.340 
color but of them that's not really that
different<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.730> now<00:01:01.940> let's<00:01:02.270> turn<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.050> side

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
different so now let's turn to the side

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.279 
different so now let's turn to the side
and<00:01:03.770> now<00:01:04.759> we<00:01:04.940> depart<00:01:05.330> my<00:01:05.449> parts<00:01:06.670> yep<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:09.170> now

faithful it's kind of changed and I got
the<00:01:15.229> energy<00:01:15.380> besides<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.100> stereo<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.610> second

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
the energy besides a stereo the second

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.870 
the energy besides a stereo the second
because<00:01:18.259> it<00:01:18.500> shows<00:01:18.680> like<00:01:18.860> two<00:01:19.039> ones<00:01:19.340> which<00:01:19.670> is

there<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.399> go<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:16.460> save<00:02:17.460> launcher<00:02:17.970> maybe<00:02:18.570> I

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
there we go and save launcher maybe I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.290 
there we go and save launcher maybe I
will<00:02:18.960> maybe<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:20.520> we<00:02:20.610> go<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.030> code

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
will maybe and here we go is the code

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.240 
will maybe and here we go is the code

to the energy ring they've only changed

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.400 
to the energy ring they've only changed
like<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> little<00:03:08.670> part<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.300> they<00:03:09.870> using<00:03:10.260> like

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
test launches i keep on forgetting at

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.920 
test launches i keep on forgetting at
the<00:04:27.350> wrong<00:04:27.530> launcher<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.970> now<00:04:29.180> test<00:04:29.660> launch

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
the wrong launcher so now test launch

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:38.350 
the wrong launcher so now test launch
number<00:04:30.200> one<00:04:34.660> so<00:04:36.070> apparently<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.730> Moto<00:04:38.030> mixed

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
number one so apparently the Moto mixed

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.810 
number one so apparently the Moto mixed
up<00:04:38.480> i<00:04:38.630> think<00:04:38.660> but<00:04:39.080> um<00:04:39.490> apparently<00:04:40.490> that's

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
up i think but um apparently that's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.060 
up i think but um apparently that's
attack<00:04:41.120> mode<00:04:41.419> either<00:04:41.600> one<00:04:41.900> stamina<00:04:42.320> mode<00:04:42.470> so

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
attack mode either one stamina mode so

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.510 
attack mode either one stamina mode so
now<00:04:43.220> in<00:04:43.340> attack<00:04:43.639> mode<00:04:45.010> but<00:04:46.010> that's<00:04:46.220> nice<00:04:46.370> to

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
now in attack mode but that's nice to

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.040
