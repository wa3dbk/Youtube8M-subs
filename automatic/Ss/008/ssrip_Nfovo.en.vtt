00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.210
 Hello everyone after the release of our program 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.010
 about the pioneers of the hole from you 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.830
 offer to test another controller 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.340
 from the company and the pioneer of the DJ's son Well 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340
 go 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.090
 pioneer dj sex announced in 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.129
 October 2012 and this is 1 4 channel 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 controller for the orphan program at the entrance 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 This controller has two pairs of rcf 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
 online two pair rza sit 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 1 to the microphone input jacks and one 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.010
 combined xlr jack input 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.620
 there is a pair of rc pair jacks and a pair 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.160
 xlr well and of course the exit to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.290
 headphones 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 on top of that he has one very 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.070
 useful feature it works like 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.290
 standalone 4 channel mixer 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.940
 so what about the price in our market 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.240
 times is about forty three thousand 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.240
 rubles 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.400
 pioneer company added 8 each 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.170
 performance pads for each deck 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.160
 they provide four different 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.660
 functions goers roll slicer and sampler they 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.360
 are highlighted in blue and 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.310
 sensitive to force and velocity 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.350
 there is also a touch strip not 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.380
 led search for faster and more convenient 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.750
 track search feature the slip allows 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.780
 perform actions like scratch 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.610
 reverse loop while track 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.680
 continues to play background soundless 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.760
 mode and when you say your finished 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.470
 scratch you can continue 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.340
 play the track from the present 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.440
 moment in addition to the four channel 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.390
 fader this controller has 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.500
 separate sample fader 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.900
 by jogi mechanics remind 850000 j 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.430
 but at the same time has a softer move 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.500
 the controller is made durable 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.690
 aluminum case with consistently high 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.690
 quality inherent to the company pioneer 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.670
 so controller pioneer deh dj sx 4 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.100
 channel controller in my opinion 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.680
 I personally am one of the most sophisticated 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.470
 control in which you can well find 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.350
 there is absolutely everything on the market 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.380
 you can make pads on it 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.050
 there is a shorter bunch of function for me so this 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.850
 maxi sleeves what can i think of 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.220
 I like the fact that 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.810
 it connects to an orphan connects 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.650
 absolutely fast and easy no 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.030
 difficulties with this did not happen 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.890
 functions so much that it can 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.380
 study very long very much like that 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.480
 there is a separate level on the samples this 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.450
 really worthy normal master 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.360
 the level is not a curve that is, well, that's all 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.170
 very happy a bunch of inputs and outputs well all 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.920
 yes, that's your opinion, I think it's 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.260
 this can already be called a crowbar 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.890
 really absorbed all the achievements then 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.660
 have a full network sit with you 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.269
 full remote control is the same as in 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.799
 clubs stand up separately you get 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.510
 rebuilt in one single package 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.090
 absolutely not necessary if you are familiar with 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.250
 pioneer equipment will be very clear 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.739
 intuitively we already talked about what 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.600
 generally pioneer on but support this 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.459
 a story that fulfills all its 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.260
 devices in a certain single 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.870
 architecture and 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.790
 no these difficulties with adjustment 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.590
 one device from one to another 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.840
 yes that story is very much a turn which 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.840
 long used products for him not 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.329
 will it be some kind of vascular greed 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.030
 trying to add some new ones 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.730
 features are added new chips yes but 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.379
 while all the main remains on its 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.629
 places and do not need every time 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.950
 the product itself to understand not to say 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.230
 it does not seem to you that it is more to 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.230
 conservative because pioneer for me 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.230
 Well yes it is like a card sidyuk bodies 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.230
 always been the best yes but honestly 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.810
 there up 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.280
 in terms of this controller, it is very 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.340
 that is good inside him to find fault 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.349
 practically no but basically here here 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.490
 they are many very many that how would they 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.590
 repeated for 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.900
 behind the controller now but driving with 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:25.320
 the fourth 4 channels here are flesh to the handles 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.060
 down to the pens which are well when pressed 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.730
 cleaned in the case too TV channel 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.350
 agree that this is a natural evolution 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.560
 its natural evolution yes as a dish 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.090
 I'm just talking about what he is 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.860
 Well, not first not first not first 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.840
 year made the first who made for 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.090
 programs orphan is a novelty yes because 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.070
 that we rule an orphan is a huge plus then 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.930
 that it is free it is free 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.930
 updated and so on add doctors 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.990
 retro then year update there 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.390
 free and then where is the update 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.210
 design bat but here, of course 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.280
 called with the fourth jogi of course on 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.440
 level because they just goal joker i 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.670
 better at DJs yes well so they 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.850
 certainly better 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.460
 you can not like 14 and word 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.890
 but they are not good vibrations and the way yes 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.610
 one more thing about his similarity with 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.530
 philip answered yes what he 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.629
 can work as standalone 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.379
 Four-so now they are the first that 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.750
 have implemented 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.379
 and here implemented it implemented 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.729
 good because you can connect here 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.889
 you two turntables there two yourself 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.759
 that is, if you bought this machine 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:35.039
 for hooked up vasiluk turntables and 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.050
 some come DJs top 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.930
 yes without any problems will not be anywhere 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.689
 how easy it is to boil on and headed 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.699
 yes yes yes it is very cool but also to me 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.319
 It seems to be honest my opinion powder 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.650
 the only drawback is that it hangs 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:51.689
 on very big and heavy and he to me 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.189
 it seems more stationary then 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:55.229
 there is a pioneer 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:58.020
 leads to what it means to put clubs 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.419
 such devices are from youtube Danis me to 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.340
 more expensive for Satan Siddiks to find more crowns 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.620
 up but I think that this sort of 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.419
 is coming because tivoli is dreamy 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.270
 let me give you an example recently 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.520
 were in frankfurt legion 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.910
 at the event was a local dj 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.520
 German where exactly do you pay attention 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.440
 brought such a cusick from which he took off 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.440
 top cap put your then 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.040
 max and the whole evening played on this 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.980
 amazingly so the controller 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.800
 I think this is one of the options 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.600
 quality apparatus for trips well and 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.620
 who just dj who 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.210
 professionally 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.070
 fits its activities which 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.840
 different it seems it's more here 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.130
 precisely professional history that again 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.210
 young guy de jasmin post 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.770
 new guy dj 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.260
 surely you will not buy is not difficult 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.560
 allow and not know in our time but 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:59.660
 where it may be necessary to still 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.370
 on will work well let's say 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.060
 yes that price 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.890
 she must be justified all her 40 s 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.420
 a little thou works and and 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.730
 functional which is in it is it 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.680
 really that money but now i think 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.840
 that is normal and the completion of our 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.090
 of today's review 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.800
 really like a controller not like 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.290
 standalone device exactly how 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.570
 the controller is full it is very 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:27.070
 functional and he by and large 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.070
 justify their means 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:31.209
 everyone is watching us today 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.800
 youtube channel add our 

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:36.089
 Facebook and VKontakte groups 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.089
 thumbs up bye
