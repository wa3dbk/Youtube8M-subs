00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.570
 my name is redhead i am the director 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.610
 artistic of the brands lucero 1 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.500
 stylist and good as you have seen 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.139
 developed a technique work of 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.349
 color and once made we went to the 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.779
 cut for this season in blue 01 what 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.440
 we put on long hair manes 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.570
 which 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.510
 the tips are very deteriorated and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.930
 had been very very scaled and with 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.000
 peak shape on this occasion we propose 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.520
 hair straighter at its base in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.270
 all that is the perimeter of the hair 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.800
 and then a smooth climb to get 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.490
 generalized volume in all 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.500
 hair 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.290
 then we will go on to define what is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.870
 the front depending on a little 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.100
 of the form 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.100
 of the mystical model 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.300
 first of all as I said 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.280
 we will lower all the layers 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.990
 totally horizontal and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.990
 we will select the cutting measure 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.970
 depending on the thickness we will make more layers 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.420
 or less broad in this case is a 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.420
 thin hair 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.400
 an abundant quantity then the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 layers can be a certain thickness 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.300
 allows us to see the base cut line 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.170
 after having done the back 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.210
 we went to join with the sides 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.210
 always the base horizontally 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.180
 is that the front area the short measure 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.119
 it's smaller because before this hair 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.230
 I was excessively scaled in 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.060
 peak then 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.480
 there are always too many less in the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.480
 zone 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.850
 well once the base is done, let's 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.390
 select on the front 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.840
 the fringe and the lateral areas what 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.120
 type of scaling in this case by the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.450
 face type of the model we are going to make 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.950
 a hair a bang pulling thick 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.320
 but very paraded of tips 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.930
 getting it to be dense but at the same 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.510
 time do not weigh so much to get 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.840
 then at the time of finishes ease in 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.840
 the hairstyle 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.800
 with gentle pecking of the scissors on 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.800
 the hair 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.840
 join with the lateral 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.530
 letting slip the scissors to not eat 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.250
 less much 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.250
 thickness 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.920
 likewise with part d 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.069
 side 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.290
 we paraded from the guide wick we have 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.090
 created in the area of fringes 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.230
 always as we said by sliding the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.230
 scissors with all its length 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.900
 good once the contours are finished 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.819
 we have made the base subsequently all 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.010
 the contours of the face now 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.530
 we proceed to scale all the hair 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.349
 always in a vertical way and 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.140
 ascending points upwards with 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.990
 this will get 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.660
 in the area of ​​points we weigh little but 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.660
 Do not lose density and keep your hair 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.830
 very poor in points things that happens if 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.830
 the scaling is inverse 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.300
 as you see we started 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.909
 under the whole 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.580
 we cut and we go ascending 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:39.250
 progressively to create an arc 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.250
 perfect to the crown area 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.580
 as you can see 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.320
 the last centimeters this zone low 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.080
 it is totally distilled without losing 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.419
 yes 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.000
 the thickness let's say its thickness in the 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.580
 area of the tip and this at the same time 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.889
 having made that gentle distillate makes 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.430
 that higher areas get more 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.840
 volume without losing or of 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.750
 have to go with the super poor hair 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.330
 in tips area 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.850
 this will allow us multiple finishes 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.160
 as you will see later this change can go 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.289
 totally smooth ironing can go with 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.070
 super soft waves 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.960
 finished with iron 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.960
 that is, any finish is possible
