00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
okay this video is going to split into

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.210 
okay this video is going to split into
three<00:01:51.910> main<00:01:52.210> areas<00:01:52.450> where<00:01:53.290> I<00:01:53.320> made<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.920> change

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
three main areas where I made the change

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.830 
three main areas where I made the change
or<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.520> changes<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.180> enable<00:01:55.450> me<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.570> break<00:01:55.780> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
or the changes to enable me to break the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.350 
or the changes to enable me to break the
plateau<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:57.009> first<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.520> which<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.910> my

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
plateau the first of which is my

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.990 
plateau the first of which is my
frequency<00:01:58.960> now<00:01:59.590> this<00:01:59.800> is<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.009> pretty<00:02:00.340> hot<00:02:00.640> topic

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
frequency now this is a pretty hot topic

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.060 
frequency now this is a pretty hot topic
and<00:02:01.450> training<00:02:01.840> in<00:02:01.900> general<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.380> for<00:02:02.830> me<00:02:02.979> it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
and training in general and for me it

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.560 
and training in general and for me it
took<00:02:03.220> me<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> long<00:02:03.700> while<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.970> kind<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.360> figure

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
took me a long while to kind of figure

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.300 
took me a long while to kind of figure
out<00:02:04.810> because<00:02:05.140> with<00:02:05.289> my<00:02:05.440> squats<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:05.950> my<00:02:06.100> bench

out because with my squats and my bench

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.669 
out because with my squats and my bench
press<00:02:06.550> when<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.090> increased<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.899> frequency<00:02:08.259> of

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
press when I increased the frequency of

around a trainer cycle with us at it
kind<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:45.940> changes<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> added<00:02:46.720> frequency

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
kind of changes in the added frequency

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.380 
kind of changes in the added frequency
test<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.310> end<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.670> i<00:02:48.790> might<00:02:49.209> then

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
test is at the end of it i might then

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.420 
test is at the end of it i might then
let<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.569> actually<00:02:49.990> gone<00:02:50.140> down<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.980> I've<00:02:51.190> now

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
once a week and it's around sets of

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.280 
once a week and it's around sets of
three<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.190> may<00:02:57.940> even<00:02:58.150> drop<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.810> where<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:58.990> go

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
three I may even drop it to where I go

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.260 
three I may even drop it to where I go
heavy<00:02:59.590> one<00:02:59.860> week<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.790> next<00:03:01.120> week

heavy one week and like the next week
but<00:03:01.780> for<00:03:01.959> me<00:03:02.050> personally<00:03:02.080> dropping<00:03:03.010> that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
but for me personally dropping that

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.160 
but for me personally dropping that
frequency<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.790> once<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.180> week<00:03:04.209> made<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.569> big<00:03:04.959> big

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
frequency to once a week made a big big

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.900 
frequency to once a week made a big big
difference<00:03:05.380> with<00:03:05.740> my<00:03:05.860> deadlift<00:03:06.160> okay<00:03:06.700> number

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
difference with my deadlift okay number

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.649 
difference with my deadlift okay number
two<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.480> my<00:03:07.780> technique<00:03:08.319> off<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.680> floor<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.280> um

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
two is my technique off the floor so um

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.559 
two is my technique off the floor so um

talking either basically i've always
been<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.989> very<00:03:15.319> very<00:03:15.409> weak<00:03:15.739> off<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.040> floor<00:03:16.280> my

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
been a very very weak off the floor my

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.619 
been a very very weak off the floor my
speed<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:16.939> floor<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:17.239> always<00:03:17.450> being

speed of the floor is always being

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.360 
speed of the floor is always being
terrible<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.230> always<00:03:18.650> find<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:18.950> soon<00:03:19.219> as<00:03:19.310> I

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
terrible I always find that soon as I

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.979 
terrible I always find that soon as I
break<00:03:19.579> before<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.909> bar<00:03:20.180> moves<00:03:20.420> quickly<00:03:20.659> bits

break before the bar moves quickly bits

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.899 
break before the bar moves quickly bits
always<00:03:21.409> the<00:03:21.590> initial<00:03:22.040> part<00:03:22.280> where<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.489> were<00:03:22.760> off

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.009 
depressing to get really G dug up to the
bar<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.950> not<00:03:34.459> even<00:03:34.700> break<00:03:34.879> the<00:03:34.909> floor<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:35.750> the

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
bar and not even break the floor so the

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.899 
bar and not even break the floor so the
biggest<00:03:36.260> change<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.829> made<00:03:37.069> in<00:03:37.189> that<00:03:37.280> respect<00:03:37.700> is

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
biggest change I made in that respect is

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.300 
biggest change I made in that respect is
that<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.389> started<00:03:38.900> just<00:03:39.139> trying<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.739> rip<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.159> off

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
that I started just trying to rip it off

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.360 
that I started just trying to rip it off
the<00:03:40.519> floor<00:03:40.760> now<00:03:40.999> I<00:03:41.209> bought<00:03:41.870> sumo<00:03:42.159> which<00:03:43.159> is<00:03:43.280> an

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
the floor now I bought sumo which is an

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.190 
the floor now I bought sumo which is an
option<00:03:43.760> not<00:03:43.790> conducive<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.629> people<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.049> are

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
option not conducive to people that are

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.349 
option not conducive to people that are
weak<00:03:45.469> off<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.769> floor<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.159> where<00:03:46.939> I<00:03:46.969> was<00:03:47.209> so

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
weak off the floor and where I was so

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.300 
weak off the floor and where I was so
conscious<00:03:47.900> of<00:03:47.989> my<00:03:48.169> form<00:03:48.469> I<00:03:48.680> was<00:03:49.099> getting

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
conscious of my form I was getting

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.189 
conscious of my form I was getting
really<00:03:49.699> trying<00:03:50.299> to<00:03:50.329> get<00:03:50.449> really<00:03:50.750> tough<00:03:50.989> at<00:03:51.139> the

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
really trying to get really tough at the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.899 
really trying to get really tough at the
bottom<00:03:51.469> while<00:03:51.620> spending<00:03:51.949> a<00:03:52.159> long<00:03:52.310> time<00:03:52.370> down

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
bottom while spending a long time down

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.849 
bottom while spending a long time down
there<00:03:53.120> getting<00:03:53.359> set<00:03:53.719> and<00:03:54.169> I<00:03:54.230> was<00:03:54.349> gradually

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
there getting set and I was gradually

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.530 
there getting set and I was gradually
kind<00:03:55.159> of<00:03:55.280> get<00:03:55.489> everything<00:03:55.790> engaged<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.329> then

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
kind of get everything engaged and then

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.420 
kind of get everything engaged and then
starting<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.079> pool<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.799> what<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.069> found<00:03:58.280> was

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
starting the pool and what I found was

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.800 
starting the pool and what I found was
that<00:03:58.549> it<00:03:58.760> was<00:03:58.879> just<00:03:59.030> kind<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.239> exacerbating

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
that it was just kind of exacerbating

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.240 
that it was just kind of exacerbating
the<00:03:59.930> problem<00:03:59.989> I<00:04:00.290> felt<00:04:00.500> even<00:04:00.739> week<00:04:00.949> off<00:04:01.159> the

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
the problem I felt even week off the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.129 
the problem I felt even week off the
floor<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.790> like<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.120> said<00:04:02.269> very<00:04:02.629> frequently<00:04:03.079> I

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
floor and like I said very frequently I

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.020 
floor and like I said very frequently I
would<00:04:03.439> fail<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.949> break<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.310> floor<00:04:04.549> on<00:04:04.699> a<00:04:04.730> wreck

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
would fail to break the floor on a wreck

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.449 
would fail to break the floor on a wreck
so<00:04:05.719> what<00:04:05.930> started<00:04:06.139> doing<00:04:06.469> now<00:04:06.620> is<00:04:06.889> literally

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
so what started doing now is literally

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.089 
so what started doing now is literally
getting<00:04:08.209> sick<00:04:08.510> getting<00:04:08.780> my<00:04:08.870> grip<00:04:09.049> set<00:04:09.349> doing<00:04:10.040> a

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
getting sick getting my grip set doing a

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.789 
getting sick getting my grip set doing a
couple<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.719> almost<00:04:11.719> kind<00:04:11.959> of<00:04:12.049> bounces<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.620> try

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
couple of almost kind of bounces to try

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.800 
couple of almost kind of bounces to try
and<00:04:12.919> get<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.040> bit<00:04:13.219> of<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.370> stretch<00:04:13.579> reflex<00:04:14.030> right

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
and get a bit of a stretch reflex right

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.719 
and get a bit of a stretch reflex right
because<00:04:15.049> I<00:04:15.199> do<00:04:15.260> believe<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.739> can<00:04:16.009> get<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.430> bit

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
because I do believe you can get a bit

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.060 
because I do believe you can get a bit
of<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.970> stretch<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.209> river<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.659> deadlift<00:04:18.070> and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
of a stretch of river to a deadlift and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.310 
of a stretch of river to a deadlift and
then<00:04:19.430> literally<00:04:19.820> when<00:04:20.269> I'm<00:04:20.389> set<00:04:20.659> just<00:04:20.900> ripping

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
then literally when I'm set just ripping

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.930 
then literally when I'm set just ripping
it<00:04:21.409> off<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.620> floor<00:04:21.829> not<00:04:22.130> spending<00:04:22.669> any<00:04:22.849> time

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
it off the floor not spending any time

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.149 
it off the floor not spending any time
down<00:04:23.389> there<00:04:23.630> thinking<00:04:24.020> about<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.380> approaching

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
down there thinking about it approaching

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.010 
down there thinking about it approaching
the<00:04:25.190> bar<00:04:25.370> getting<00:04:25.699> my<00:04:25.849> feet<00:04:26.060> set<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.509> just

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
the bar getting my feet set and just

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.960 
the bar getting my feet set and just
ripping<00:04:27.409> it<00:04:27.530> as<00:04:27.680> hard<00:04:27.949> as<00:04:28.130> I<00:04:28.250> physically<00:04:28.699> care

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
ripping it as hard as I physically care

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.659 
ripping it as hard as I physically care
off<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.330> bottle<00:04:29.630> off<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.870> floor<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:31.070> for<00:04:31.550> me

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
off the bottle off the floor and for me

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.399 
off the bottle off the floor and for me
it's<00:04:31.820> just<00:04:31.849> made<00:04:32.150> me<00:04:32.180> feel<00:04:32.330> literally<00:04:33.080> 10

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
it's just made me feel literally 10

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.620 
it's just made me feel literally 10
times<00:04:33.440> stronger<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.310> floor<00:04:34.520> look<00:04:35.180> at<00:04:35.270> my<00:04:35.419> most

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
times stronger the floor look at my most

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.870 
times stronger the floor look at my most
recent<00:04:35.870> lifts<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.740> bar<00:04:36.949> is<00:04:37.130> moving<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:37.849> much

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
recent lifts the bar is moving so much

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.520 
recent lifts the bar is moving so much
better<00:04:38.419> off<00:04:38.599> the<00:04:38.750> floor<00:04:38.930> than<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.169> ever<00:04:39.289> has

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
better off the floor than it ever has

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.499 
better off the floor than it ever has
done<00:04:39.710> before<00:04:39.830> for<00:04:40.789> me<00:04:40.940> personally<00:04:41.120> that's

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
done before for me personally that's

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.540 
done before for me personally that's
made<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.810> massive<00:04:42.110> difference<00:04:42.289> so<00:04:42.800> now<00:04:43.280> I'm

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
made a massive difference so now I'm

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.920 
made a massive difference so now I'm
confident<00:04:44.030> in<00:04:44.150> my<00:04:44.180> technique<00:04:44.630> I'm<00:04:44.750> not

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
confident in my technique I'm not

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.149 
confident in my technique I'm not
stressing<00:04:45.229> about<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.500> i'm<00:04:45.710> not<00:04:45.740> you<00:04:46.130> know

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
stressing about it i'm not you know

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.800 
stressing about it i'm not you know
really<00:04:46.550> over<00:04:46.729> thinking<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.150> i'm<00:04:47.419> approaching

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
really over thinking it i'm approaching

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.379 
really over thinking it i'm approaching
the<00:04:48.080> bar<00:04:48.199> getting<00:04:48.500> sit<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:48.979> then<00:04:49.099> absolutely

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
the bar getting sit and then absolutely

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.640 
the bar getting sit and then absolutely
pulling<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.479> with<00:04:50.599> everything<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:51.110> have<00:04:51.409> and

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
pulling it with everything I have and

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.230 
pulling it with everything I have and
thirdly<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.669> probably<00:04:53.060> most

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
thirdly and probably most

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.779 
thirdly and probably most
controversially<00:04:53.780> um<00:04:54.280> amongst<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.520> kind<00:04:55.699> of

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
controversially um amongst the kind of

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.370 
controversially um amongst the kind of
changes<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.210> I've<00:04:56.360> made<00:04:56.389> that<00:04:57.020> is<00:04:57.199> my

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
changes that I've made that is my

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.909 
changes that I've made that is my
general<00:04:57.909> technique<00:04:58.909> now<00:04:59.150> up<00:04:59.930> until<00:05:00.229> again

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
general technique now up until again

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.529 
general technique now up until again
fairly<00:05:01.280> recently<00:05:01.729> I<00:05:01.969> was<00:05:02.270> under<00:05:02.509> the

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
fairly recently I was under the

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.270 
fairly recently I was under the
impression<00:05:02.630> that<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.199> had<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.800> maintain<00:05:03.979> a

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
impression that you had to maintain a

with that weakness with the floor it's

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.470 
with that weakness with the floor it's
made<00:06:03.950> a<00:06:03.980> big<00:06:04.280> big<00:06:04.490> difference<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:05.360> other

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
improvements that you've seen in my

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.980 
improvements that you've seen in my
deadlift<00:06:37.220> peel<00:06:37.430> so<00:06:37.730> for<00:06:38.330> me<00:06:38.420> Percy<00:06:38.810> that's

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
deadlift peel so for me Percy that's

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.480 
deadlift peel so for me Percy that's
what's<00:06:39.170> work<00:06:39.380> so<00:06:39.560> yeah<00:06:39.860> I<00:06:39.890> didn't<00:06:40.220> want<00:06:40.340> to<00:06:40.400> go

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
what's work so yeah I didn't want to go

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.340 
what's work so yeah I didn't want to go
on<00:06:40.520> about<00:06:40.640> it<00:06:40.850> too<00:06:41.000> much<00:06:41.030> there<00:06:41.480> the<00:06:41.660> three<00:06:41.900> big

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
on about it too much there the three big

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.530 
on about it too much there the three big
area<00:06:42.740> so<00:06:42.980> the<00:06:43.490> the<00:06:43.880> reduced<00:06:44.270> frequency

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
area so the the reduced frequency

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.300 
area so the the reduced frequency
because<00:06:45.260> obviously<00:06:45.410> dead<00:06:45.710> lifting<00:06:45.950> is<00:06:46.100> very

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
because obviously dead lifting is very

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.330 
because obviously dead lifting is very
CNS<00:06:46.790> heavy<00:06:47.030> you<00:06:47.510> don't<00:06:47.750> do<00:06:47.990> it<00:06:48.050> too<00:06:48.170> often<00:06:48.350> they

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
CNS heavy you don't do it too often they

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.790 
CNS heavy you don't do it too often they
were<00:06:49.780> that<00:06:50.780> kind<00:06:50.960> of<00:06:51.080> ripping<00:06:51.440> it<00:06:51.530> off<00:06:51.620> the

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
were that kind of ripping it off the

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.520 
were that kind of ripping it off the
floor<00:06:52.070> just<00:06:52.910> you<00:06:53.180> basically<00:06:53.570> you<00:06:53.780> know<00:06:53.900> grab

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
floor just you basically you know grab

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.530 
floor just you basically you know grab
it<00:06:54.710> and<00:06:54.830> rip<00:06:55.220> it<00:06:55.280> and<00:06:55.520> then<00:06:56.120> the<00:06:56.300> third<00:06:56.480> thing

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
it and rip it and then the third thing

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.330 
it and rip it and then the third thing
is<00:06:56.780> a<00:06:57.020> little<00:06:57.440> bit<00:06:57.590> of<00:06:57.680> thoracic<00:06:57.920> spine

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
is a little bit of thoracic spine

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.220 
is a little bit of thoracic spine
bending<00:06:58.820> now<00:06:58.970> I<00:06:59.000> wouldn't<00:06:59.390> recommend<00:06:59.810> that<00:07:00.020> to
