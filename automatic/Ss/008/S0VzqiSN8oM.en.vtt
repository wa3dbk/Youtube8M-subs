00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
two apps that will be used to display

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
two apps that will be used to display
the<00:00:58.480> message<00:00:59.070> why<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.130> this<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.960> message<00:01:01.960> app

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
the message why is this a message app

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.130 
the message why is this a message app
which<00:01:02.650> are<00:01:02.770> provided<00:01:03.250> by<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.520> Android<00:01:04.330> and<00:01:04.570> so

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
which are provided by the Android and so

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.580 
which are provided by the Android and so
this<00:01:05.409> app<00:01:05.679> is<00:01:06.329> written<00:01:07.329> in<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.899> native

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
this app is written in the native

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.639 
this app is written in the native
program<00:01:09.039> language<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.789> Java<00:01:10.149> so<00:01:10.869> this<00:01:11.200> one<00:01:11.500> is

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
program language in Java so this one is

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.270 
program language in Java so this one is
immune<00:01:12.039> to<00:01:12.310> our<00:01:12.429> attack<00:01:13.109> okay<00:01:14.109> so<00:01:14.679> we're<00:01:15.130> going

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
immune to our attack okay so we're going

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.539 
immune to our attack okay so we're going
to<00:01:15.369> shoot<00:01:15.579> the<00:01:16.240> outcome<00:01:16.899> of<00:01:17.109> this<00:01:17.439> and<00:01:17.950> and

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
to shoot the outcome of this and and

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.300 
to shoot the outcome of this and and
then<00:01:18.939> there's<00:01:19.240> another<00:01:19.329> app<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.770> one<00:01:21.100> is

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
then there's another app and this one is

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.069 
then there's another app and this one is
html5<00:01:21.820> based<00:01:22.979> okay<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.189> this<00:01:24.999> one<00:01:25.299> using

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
html5 based okay and this one using

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.620 
html5 based okay and this one using
html5<00:01:26.530> technology<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.549> develop<00:01:27.999> the<00:01:28.149> app<00:01:28.329> and

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
html5 technology to develop the app and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.080 
html5 technology to develop the app and
this<00:01:28.990> is<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.289> one<00:01:29.499> that<00:01:29.799> is<00:01:30.340> likely<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.880> have<00:01:31.060> a

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
this is the one that is likely to have a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.870 
this is the one that is likely to have a
problems<00:01:31.600> okay<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:33.039> we're<00:01:33.429> going<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:33.640> see<00:01:33.789> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
problems okay so we're going to see the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:45.180 
problems okay so we're going to see the
demo<00:01:35.159> let's<00:01:36.159> hit<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.460> button

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.400 

okay<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:46.250> can<00:01:46.550> see<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.500> message<00:01:48.500> has<00:01:49.310> already

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
okay you can see the message has already

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.260 
okay you can see the message has already
arrived<00:01:51.410> in<00:01:51.650> this<00:01:51.890> smartphone<00:01:52.250> okay<00:01:52.910> so<00:01:52.970> now

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
arrived in this smartphone okay so now

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.830 
arrived in this smartphone okay so now
we're<00:01:53.420> going<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.630> use<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.080> app<00:01:54.230> to<00:01:54.590> open<00:01:54.620> it

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.859 

and<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.979> can<00:02:04.159> see<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.659> everything<00:02:05.659> is

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
and you can see the everything is

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.850 
and you can see the everything is
actually<00:02:06.320> displayed<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.939> our<00:02:08.479> code<00:02:09.020> they

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
actually displayed so the our code they

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.550 
actually displayed so the our code they
are<00:02:10.039> warm<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.670> actually<00:02:11.030> displayed<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:11.810> not

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
are warm is actually displayed it's not

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.250 
are warm is actually displayed it's not
triggered<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:14.060> that's<00:02:14.239> why<00:02:14.450> nothing<00:02:15.050> is

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
triggered and so that's why nothing is

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.160 
triggered and so that's why nothing is
going<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.709> actually<00:02:16.130> happen<00:02:17.000> okay<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.989> is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
going to actually happen okay so this is

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.949 
going to actually happen okay so this is
safe<00:02:18.430> okay<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.880> now<00:02:20.150> let's<00:02:20.480> use<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> different

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
safe okay so now let's use a different

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:33.490 
safe okay so now let's use a different
app<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.769> display<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.340> same<00:02:22.610> message

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.060 

okay<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:34.580> what<00:02:35.360> do<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.510> see<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.380> we're

okay now what do you see is and we're

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.130 
okay now what do you see is and we're
going<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.060> actually<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.600> alert

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
going to see this actually the alert

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.440 
going to see this actually the alert
window<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.280> that's<00:02:40.580> actually<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.000> triggered

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
window and that's actually is triggered

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.900 
window and that's actually is triggered
by<00:02:41.480> our<00:02:41.660> code<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:43.220> we<00:02:43.430> actually<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
by our code and so we actually the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.030 
by our code and so we actually the
pop-up<00:02:44.240> window<00:02:44.270> just<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.080> demonstrate<00:02:45.440> that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
pop-up window just to demonstrate that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.640 
pop-up window just to demonstrate that
attack<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.640> successful<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.990> real<00:02:48.170> attack<00:02:48.470> of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
attack is successful in a real attack of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.640 
attack is successful in a real attack of
course<00:02:48.920> we<00:02:49.220> will<00:02:49.460> not<00:02:49.760> pop<00:02:50.300> up<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.570> window<00:02:50.900> so

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
course we will not pop up the window so

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.540 
course we will not pop up the window so
and<00:02:51.860> this<00:02:52.190> one<00:02:52.430> basically<00:02:52.790> tell<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:54.550> not

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
and this one basically tell you that not

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.330 
and this one basically tell you that not
only<00:02:55.940> this<00:02:56.240> active<00:02:56.600> code<00:02:56.840> gets<00:02:57.200> triggered<00:02:57.710> it

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
only this active code gets triggered it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.560 
only this active code gets triggered it
also<00:02:59.000> send<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.750> copy<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.500> itself<00:03:00.980> okay<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.120> to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
also send a copy of itself okay and to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.470 
also send a copy of itself okay and to
another<00:03:02.900> number<00:03:03.370> okay<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.850> this<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.330> a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
another number okay so and this is a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.990 
another number okay so and this is a
number<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.990> actually<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.920> malicious<00:03:07.760> code

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
number that actually this malicious code

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.990 
number that actually this malicious code
get<00:03:08.360> from<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.900> person's<00:03:09.530> contact<00:03:10.520> list<00:03:10.790> so

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
get from this person's contact list so

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.690 
get from this person's contact list so
what<00:03:11.810> this<00:03:11.959> code<00:03:12.290> does<00:03:12.320> is<00:03:12.800> is<00:03:13.010> actually<00:03:13.220> look

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
what this code does is is actually look

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.630 
what this code does is is actually look
at<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.910> contact<00:03:14.420> list<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.750> find<00:03:15.530> out<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.130> all

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
at a contact list and find out and all

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.290 
at a contact list and find out and all
the<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:18.100> phone<00:03:19.100> numbers<00:03:19.550> from<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.880> contact

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
the the phone numbers from the contact

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.050 
the the phone numbers from the contact
list<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.959> send<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.530> their<00:03:21.709> friends<00:03:22.100> so

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
list and the send to their friends so

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.690 
list and the send to their friends so
but<00:03:23.480> in<00:03:23.660> this<00:03:23.810> demo<00:03:24.110> we<00:03:24.380> only<00:03:24.560> pick<00:03:24.890> one<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.459> we

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
but in this demo we only pick one and we

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.690 
but in this demo we only pick one and we
send<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.050> one<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.980> friends<00:03:28.370> which<00:03:28.550> is

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
send to the one of the friends which is

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
send to the one of the friends which is
this<00:03:28.880> one<00:03:29.150> okay<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.020> and<00:03:30.940> obviously<00:03:31.940> for<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
this one okay so and obviously for the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.460 
this one okay so and obviously for the
demonstration<00:03:33.320> purpose<00:03:34.180> we<00:03:35.180> actually<00:03:35.540> have

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
demonstration purpose we actually have

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.979 
demonstration purpose we actually have
this<00:03:36.620> button<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.340> if<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:37.910> click<00:03:38.570> this<00:03:38.750> part

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
this button so if you click this part

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.290 
this button so if you click this part
and<00:03:39.170> then<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:40.100> will<00:03:40.310> continue<00:03:40.519> in<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
and then and that will continue in the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.910 
and then and that will continue in the
real<00:03:41.480> attack<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.110> we<00:03:42.320> are<00:03:42.410> not<00:03:42.560> going<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.769> wait

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
real attack and we are not going to wait

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:52.980 
real attack and we are not going to wait
for<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.280> user<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.610> click<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.090> button

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.240 

okay<00:03:53.740> so<00:03:53.800> now<00:03:54.240> this<00:03:55.240> has<00:03:55.510> arrived<00:03:56.200> in<00:03:56.560> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
okay so now this has arrived in the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:05.770 
okay so now this has arrived in the
victim<00:03:57.640> -<00:03:58.020> okay

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.370 

so<00:04:06.380> if<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:06.650> look<00:04:06.890> at<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.660> message<00:04:08.660> using<00:04:09.080> the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
so if you look at the message using the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.650 
so if you look at the message using the
actually<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.070> safe<00:04:10.370> app<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.180> you're<00:04:11.420> going

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
actually the safe app and you're going

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.360 
actually the safe app and you're going
to<00:04:11.750> see<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.020> same<00:04:12.230> thing<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.740> it<00:04:12.980> nothing

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
to see the same thing and it nothing

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.530 
to see the same thing and it nothing
happens<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.859> if<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.160> use<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.549> html5<00:04:19.730> based

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
happens but if you use the html5 based

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.500 
happens but if you use the html5 based
app<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.590> is<00:04:21.920> what<00:04:22.670> is<00:04:22.790> going<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.030> see<00:04:23.240> and

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
app and this is what is going to see and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.940 
app and this is what is going to see and
in<00:04:24.290> this<00:04:24.770> case<00:04:25.070> this<00:04:25.850> exactly<00:04:26.480> send<00:04:26.780> like<00:04:27.740> what

in this case this exactly send like what
happened<00:04:28.280> in<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.520> previous<00:04:28.670> case<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.480> the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
happened in the previous case and the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.530 
happened in the previous case and the
warm<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:31.160> we<00:04:31.340> actually<00:04:31.550> embedded<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.450> the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
warm that we actually embedded in the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.780 
warm that we actually embedded in the
text<00:04:32.810> message<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.230> get<00:04:33.380> triggered<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.070> it's
