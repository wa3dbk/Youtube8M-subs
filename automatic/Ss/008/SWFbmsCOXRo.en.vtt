00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to have to compromise we're not going to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.740

get entitlement reform without the two

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.080 
get entitlement reform without the two
sides<00:01:01.050> working<00:01:01.350> together<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.550> compromise

has become a dirty word in the country
and<00:01:05.100> without<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.910> I<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.300> think<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> big

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and without it I don't think the big

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.480 
and without it I don't think the big
things<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.200> get<00:01:07.380> fixed<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.210> fewer

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
said she wasn't running again because

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.649 
said she wasn't running again because
she<00:01:26.189> felt<00:01:26.430> she<00:01:26.640> couldn't<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> job<00:01:27.390> done

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because there was no room for compromise

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.380 
because there was no room for compromise
and<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.650> um<00:01:31.830> without<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and I think that um without it the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.570 
and I think that um without it the
country's<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.710> big<00:01:34.920> trouble<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.369> need

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
country's in is in big trouble we need

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.219 
country's in is in big trouble we need
to<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> situation<00:01:36.509> where<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.049> can

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to get back to a situation where we can

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.929 
to get back to a situation where we can
compromise<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.009> fear<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.340> some<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
compromise and I fear that some of the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.940 
compromise and I fear that some of the
responsibility<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.960> comes<00:01:40.619> from<00:01:40.829> my

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
responsibility for that comes from my

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
responsibility for that comes from my
profession<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> media<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.140> is

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
profession that we have a media that is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.819 
profession that we have a media that is
so<00:01:43.530> partisan<00:01:44.070> at<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.400> moment<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
so partisan at the moment that

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.749 
so partisan at the moment that
everything<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> seen<00:01:47.189> through<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.490> political

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
everything is seen through a political

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.480 
everything is seen through a political
prism<00:01:48.350> whether<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.650> abortion<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.280> gun

extent they're not news channels and I
think<00:02:29.200> people<00:02:29.440> need<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.710> get<00:02:29.920> back<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.280> an

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
think people need to get back to an

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.550 
think people need to get back to an
old-fashioned<00:02:31.000> space<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.290> where<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
old-fashioned space it's is where the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.380 
old-fashioned space it's is where the
BBC<00:02:33.010> starts<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.820> they're<00:02:33.910> shining<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.270> light

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
BBC starts and they're shining a light

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.560 
BBC starts and they're shining a light
on<00:02:34.450> me<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:36.310> my<00:02:36.430> bosses<00:02:36.670> start<00:02:37.090> patting<00:02:37.300> me<00:02:37.540> on

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
on me and my bosses start patting me on

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.200 
on me and my bosses start patting me on
the<00:02:37.660> head<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.500> true<00:02:38.770> we<00:02:39.040> need<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.490> forum

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
the head but it is true we need a forum

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.670 
the head but it is true we need a forum
where<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.540> go<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.110> listen<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.650> news

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
where you can go and listen to the news

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.830 
where you can go and listen to the news
and<00:02:41.950> then<00:02:42.340> go<00:02:42.580> away<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.030> form<00:02:43.240> your<00:02:43.390> opinions

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
and then go away and form your opinions

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.470 
and then go away and form your opinions
and<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:45.190> think<00:02:45.400> then<00:02:45.640> we<00:02:45.820> would<00:02:45.970> be<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:46.210> a<00:02:46.300> space

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
and I think then we would be in a space

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.760 
and I think then we would be in a space
where<00:02:46.720> we<00:02:46.810> could<00:02:46.900> start<00:02:47.170> talking<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.680> each

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
where we could start talking to each

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.380 
where we could start talking to each
other<00:02:47.920> again<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:48.580> when<00:02:48.820> America<00:02:48.910> can

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
other again and that's when America can

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.650 
other again and that's when America can
start<00:02:49.630> getting<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.960> big<00:02:50.110> things<00:02:50.380> done
