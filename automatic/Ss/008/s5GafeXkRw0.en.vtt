00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.240
 the watch we can really see what we 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.340
 done in real time so it helps to 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.320
 just changed the angles to the last 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.300
 moment while being at the center of 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.050
 the action and then that's a novelty 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.050
 which is really appreciable 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.940
 65 kilometers / hour and then problem 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.300
 we all forgot to start 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.300
 our kids 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.870
 gilles will arrive in wheeling going on the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.220
 watch it go and hop it goes after 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.150
 as if the as if he was starting over again 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.920
 prosecution in fact as if he 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.480
 allowed some sort of game on in the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.190
 continue to stop a moment from the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.239
 watch and after had to continue after 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.410
 since we know they are not the same 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.100
 race speed and I think that 's 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.150
 will give a little side a little 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.620
 humorous to few of them 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:06.610
 for whom there too we have fun when we 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.020
 look at the top ranked top that's it 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.060
 not easy to coordinate a cyclist 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.590
 on a wheel at 60 per hour and an eagle 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.229
 who has not seen registering on the water since 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.229
 all that said so do not stay perfect 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.270
 I was disturbed by the shadow of the ex 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.310
 it was a lot of span meters 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.310
 did not it's just above me 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.950
 and 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.329
 this was our super end shot 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.760
 nice race gilles has been to the top 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.739
 the bird if everything was perfect I think 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.560
 it's a beautiful experience to redo 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.560
 thank you gilles thank you
