00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
hidden blade the hidden blade uses this

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.990 
hidden blade the hidden blade uses this
wheel<00:00:31.920> here<00:00:33.739> this<00:00:34.739> top<00:00:35.100> part<00:00:35.340> isn't<00:00:35.640> quite

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
wheel here this top part isn't quite

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.500 
wheel here this top part isn't quite
done<00:00:36.239> yet<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.690> still<00:00:37.110> need<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.559> add<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:38.480> one<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
done yet I still need to add on one of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.530 
done yet I still need to add on one of
these<00:00:39.860> onto<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.920> top<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:42.149> that's<00:00:42.450> not

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
these onto the top of that so that's not

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.959 
these onto the top of that so that's not
done<00:00:42.840> yet<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.710> their<00:00:43.969> hidden

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
done yet but that's what their hidden

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
done yet but that's what their hidden
blades<00:00:45.360> mechanism<00:00:46.140> uses<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.920> is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
blades mechanism uses so this one is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.189 
blades mechanism uses so this one is
basically<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:52.039> assassin's<00:00:53.039> creed<00:00:53.340> style

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
basically just a assassin's creed style

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
basically just a assassin's creed style
ODF<00:00:55.199> knife<00:00:57.649> yeah<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.219> use<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> same

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
ODF knife yeah so we use the same

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.889 
ODF knife yeah so we use the same
mechanism<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.050> hidden<00:01:01.620> blade<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.899> yeah

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
mechanism as the hidden blade but yeah

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.950 
mechanism as the hidden blade but yeah
it's<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.640> doesn't<00:01:05.970> use<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.360> whole<00:01:06.659> ring

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it's just it doesn't use the whole ring

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.560 
it's just it doesn't use the whole ring
system<00:01:07.500> even<00:01:08.369> though<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> could<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
system even though I could do that if I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.080 
system even though I could do that if I
wanted<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.250> all<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.939> you're

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
wanted to all right so if you're

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
wanted to all right so if you're
wondering<00:01:12.270> why<00:01:12.570> these<00:01:12.810> rubber<00:01:13.049> bands<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.590> on

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
wondering why these rubber bands are on

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.460 
wondering why these rubber bands are on
here<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.119> I'm<00:01:15.750> still<00:01:16.020> waiting<00:01:16.439> for

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
here it's because I'm still waiting for

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.460 
here it's because I'm still waiting for
the<00:01:16.890> glue<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:18.030> those<00:01:18.900> cracks<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.920> dry<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
the glue in those cracks to dry so that

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.050 
the glue in those cracks to dry so that
the<00:01:22.470> top<00:01:22.770> will<00:01:22.950> stay<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:23.850> just

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the top will stay on but I'm just

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.550 
the top will stay on but I'm just
leaving<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> rubber<00:01:24.689> bands<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.380> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
leaving the rubber bands on there to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.730 
leaving the rubber bands on there to
hold<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.009> whilst<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.299> glue<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.290> still<00:01:28.970> setting

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
hold it whilst the glue is still setting

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.140 
hold it whilst the glue is still setting
so<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.189> finished<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.640> today<00:01:32.939> pretty

much give you a good close-up you can
see<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> detail<00:01:41.659> start<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.750> peel<00:01:43.070> nice

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
see all the detail start at peel nice

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.310 
see all the detail start at peel nice
assassin<00:01:44.700> symbol<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:46.130> back<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> front

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
assassin symbol there back to the front

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.110 
assassin symbol there back to the front
back<00:01:52.320> there

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
back there

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.980 
back there
bottom<00:01:55.910> front<00:01:56.910> it's<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.510> messy<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.900> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
bottom front it's kind of messy at the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740 
bottom front it's kind of messy at the
front<00:01:58.230> in<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.500> back<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.480> you<00:02:00.480> don't<00:02:00.630> really

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
front in the back but you don't really

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.470 
front in the back but you don't really
see<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> pot<00:02:01.410> anyway<00:02:02.990> certainly<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
see that pot anyway certainly like that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.940 
see that pot anyway certainly like that
because<00:02:06.480> there's<00:02:07.020> lots<00:02:07.260> of<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.500> bits<00:02:07.800> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
because there's lots of little bits that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.200 
because there's lots of little bits that
you<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.490> put<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.170> hold<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:11.210> mechanism

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
you have to put in to hold the mechanism

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.190 
you have to put in to hold the mechanism
bit<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.710> on<00:02:13.710> top<00:02:14.270> alright<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.170> can

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
bit on on top alright so you can

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.670 
bit on on top alright so you can
basically<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:18.210> slider<00:02:18.690> here<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.530> I'm

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
basically see the slider here and so I'm

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.360 
basically see the slider here and so I'm
just<00:02:22.710> going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> show<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.400> watching<00:02:25.370> you

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370

I'm pretty happy with this it's turned
out<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:51.330> nicely<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.930> looks<00:02:52.110> pretty<00:02:52.380> good

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
out really nicely it looks pretty good

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.290 
out really nicely it looks pretty good
I'll<00:02:52.950> be<00:02:53.070> able<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.220> take<00:02:53.400> these<00:02:53.550> rubber<00:02:53.850> bands

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
I'll be able to take these rubber bands

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.940 
I'll be able to take these rubber bands
on<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:54.840> they<00:02:55.050> kind<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.320> add<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> bit<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.860> an

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
on but they kind of add a bit of an

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.130 
on but they kind of add a bit of an
effect<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:57.030> don't<00:02:57.630> really<00:02:57.720> know<00:02:57.900> what's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
effect so I don't really know what's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.580
