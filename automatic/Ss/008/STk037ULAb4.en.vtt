00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 hey people today i show you because that 

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:13.410
 is a big problem in all 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.660
 and so on where you stencils 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.500
 for any bond her gets quite 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.869
 easy to print and that's it 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.610
 I say now as we have to get up here 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.760
 go a page that is in the powder guide 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.900
 forum once really good then then 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.880
 you can not find that either 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 I'll just write you the link in 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.579
 the infobox 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.440
 and here we have all ties 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.120
 This simply gives as we have atomic 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:50.399
 fritschi dynafit g3 headlock brand max 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.929
 flower rossignol salomon and so on as 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.289
 we would all be bonds and 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:58.379
 I have a new bond now 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.670
 salomon dahlias and sometimes 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.530
 second example as we go there 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.659
 then to guarantee room then to open 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.610
 new tab yes my internet says 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.880
 just because I just download something 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.100
 got to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.620
 and now it should open like this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.890
 pdf windows and easy to save file 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.200
 or you can open it immediately 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.680
 desktop we celebrate and now go 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.900
 we double click on it and then 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.450
 Now we have a pdf file here 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.070
 but we have to threaten them now 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.550
 really there you have to be careful 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.950
 because we do not want to print most of the time 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:41.730
 it will thus displayed on city Print 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:44.070
 then we mostly go here 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.740
 actually set in automatically 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.200
 Fit pressure range and that is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 wrong because then we only have 97 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 percent size and we do not want that 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.110
 That's why we just do not do that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.610
 This is called 100 percent and go up 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:05.250
 ok so we have the binding template 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.789
 but we still exist now 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.550
 to pay attention to a few points and there we 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.819
 a few tips for you because there you can 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.530
 but still do some wrong so as 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.990
 First of all we have to look 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.150
 whether the binding city wages are correct 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.280
 the size we have the check of 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.040
 scale that's a cm 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.540
 we'll just go because it's at 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.400
 exactly one centimeter fits me 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.550
 we'll tell you this on two pages 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.080
 is printed on one side but the so 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.030
 Of course it does not fit so we can 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.290
 do not stick on the ski then 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.000
 we have here now that is the act 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.069
 we have this stitch here and now 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.730
 at the ready, we have two here 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.440
 stroke once for s and once for l 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.940
 So if you have a bond in the size 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.280
 s then you take her if you have one 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.019
 tie the size l have this 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.050
 I would not go now 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.900
 simply cut across, but as 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.590
 first of all the templates in the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.590
 to divide in the middle 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.340
 and just now across here 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.100
 it was now for example 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.410
 how to give you a good one here 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.850
 tip exactly how it all exactly 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.130
 because you can already make mistakes 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.500
 The problem is , if I am now 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.200
 just cut it off and then 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.730
 over here also in distance on 2 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.530
 then it can not be that completely 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.870
 straight but slightly wrong 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.329
 is related and we avoid it 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.170
 Just take us in now 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:44.370
 take geodesic triangle and then pin and 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.130
 then do just about the lot 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.290
 fall on this line 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.880
 and right now someone through a line 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.570
 would also come again the angle here 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.570
 check 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:00.859
 90 degrees angle wonderful and here but 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.560
 also 90 degrees angle exactly the same 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:09.000
 we'll do it here too 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.280
 easy again fell into the lot and so 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.340
 do not cut it off right now 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.549
 but we cut a bit now 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.549
 too far inside and cut out pieces 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.180
 then I would go straight to the bottom 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.180
 cut line 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:35.070
 So in the middle then we go 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:43.080
 go a little too far out to me 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:47.730
 Listen again that it will end so 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.840
 looks like and do exactly the same thing 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.090
 we just here now 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.540
 that means we just catch somehow 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.070
 that does not matter 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.350
 now we have that is now the 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.300
 good because we bring that together 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:06.570
 and then practically all of this 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.760
 draw a line here so we have 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.260
 now here are the different strokes and 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.360
 if we hold them together now 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.520
 then they have to be a straight line 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.220
 arise and if that is the case then 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.970
 you can now check here for example 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:24.150
 if that is the case then we know yes 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.220
 probably that's exactly a straight line 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.170
 and it fits that what you do 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.150
 Educational check is worthwhile if you see 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.340
 want to like their bond generally mounted 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.040
 and then there is this 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.440
 to assemble video and here is the video 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.540
 to adjust so until next time 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.740
 leave with freeskier woman but if 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.100
 you want to see more until the 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.100
 next time
