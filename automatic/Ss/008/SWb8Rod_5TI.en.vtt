00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
little move there did ya yes so in my

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
little move there did ya yes so in my
opinion<00:02:04.680> there's<00:02:05.100> no<00:02:05.130> wait<00:02:05.399> oh<00:02:05.640> well

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
opinion there's no wait oh well

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.639 
opinion there's no wait oh well
obviously<00:02:06.630> there's<00:02:06.899> still<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> chance<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
obviously there's still a chance but I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.930 
obviously there's still a chance but I
really<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.250> capital<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.819> win

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
