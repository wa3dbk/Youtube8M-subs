00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 launched the alvinegro also we go with more 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.070
 a video there on November 20, 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.890
 2012 This Tuesday the holiday here 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.369
 I 'm going to take a spin here in 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:27.870
 where is your parking lot? 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:30.570
 west building and so we can see 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.780
 broadly all this space here 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.780
 huh 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:44.600
 first without use then I'll approach 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.530
 So we can capture the details for 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.530
 you ok 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.300
 now I'm going to continue in the 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.300
 facade of the west building 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.940
 I'll zoom in on the bottom of 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.170
 the entire building is if after the part 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.650
 top 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.650
 Look 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.080
 using the underside 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.110
 the white part and are all structures 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 where are we going to have 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.550
 the main entrance here we can already 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:57.230
 see the stairs there will serve as escape 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.230
 the eventual worker exit going up already 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.460
 it was part of the environment where we will find 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.460
 the escalator 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.500
 we have some workers there 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.500
 working apart from the structure 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.760
 this white structure that increasingly 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.480
 complete we can also observe in the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.480
 upside 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.640
 Look 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.459
 the workers there 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.800
 the detail for you the structure 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.580
 the workers there 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.600
 and the other end of the west building 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.380
 now part a little more up 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.890
 in particular for you 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.430
 Ok, people, we'll be running with 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:37.449
 more videos with more news for you 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.430
 one big hug tion go with another video 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.479
 For you, we are here now. 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.810
 where we are going to have is the construction of the surroundings 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:50.800
 where you will pass an avenue that will 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.289
 connect the other side there above the radial 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.970
 east will have a viaduct 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.449
 we can see some people and some 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.449
 workers 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.910
 and it's more or less where everything goes 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:11.640
 change in question from some of some 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:15.810
 avenues viaduct part of the radial east 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:19.590
 let's also enjoy prega 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.570
 get an overview of the west building 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.610
 Where's your parking lot going? 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:30.590
 exactly here a space a point in the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:36.560
 a little closer to accompanying 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:39.800
 there from the end of its facade 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.800
 until here 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.800
 another video I already approached enough to 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:49.980
 You'll get something. 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:54.930
 interesting and approach the great 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:06:00.210
 difference here suddenly is 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:02.960
 the part of the trusses we can see a 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.960
 few of them 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.720
 a different angle 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.229
 part of radial 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.229
 the subway 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.910
 look how cool 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:54.250
 now I'm up a little there from the other 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:56.580
 side will get pictures there said hawke is 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.580
 more
