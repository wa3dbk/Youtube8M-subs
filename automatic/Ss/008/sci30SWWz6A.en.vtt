00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
to be silky and smooth then you can

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.160 
to be silky and smooth then you can
start<00:02:46.330> putting<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.660> through<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.870> Machine

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
start putting it through the Machine

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.890 
start putting it through the Machine
again<00:02:47.819> gradually<00:02:48.819> reducing<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.510> settings

thickness if it becomes too long or if

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.530 
thickness if it becomes too long or if

folding<00:02:58.840> over<00:02:59.170> onto<00:02:59.799> itself<00:03:00.100> just<00:03:00.940> cut<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.209> in

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
folding over onto itself just cut it in

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.970 
folding over onto itself just cut it in
half<00:03:01.540> or<00:03:01.840> thirds<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.440> feed<00:03:02.680> them<00:03:02.830> through

half or thirds and feed them through
separately<00:03:03.519> it's<00:03:03.940> gonna<00:03:04.090> be<00:03:04.239> fine

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
or something like that here you can see

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.630 
or something like that here you can see
how<00:03:15.790> long<00:03:16.209> insanely<00:03:17.049> long<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.680> will<00:03:17.769> get<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.400> I

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
how long insanely long it will get so I

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.960 
how long insanely long it will get so I
think<00:03:18.700> I'll<00:03:18.970> cut<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:20.070> after<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.160> pasta<00:03:21.579> has

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
think I'll cut this after the pasta has

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.370 
think I'll cut this after the pasta has
gotten<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.390> thickness<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:22.930> want<00:03:23.049> it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
gotten the thickness that you want it

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.199 
gotten the thickness that you want it
and<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.920> feeling<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.579> texture<00:03:25.030> just

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
and the feeling and the texture just

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.390 
and the feeling and the texture just
dust<00:03:26.079> it<00:03:26.200> with<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.350> little<00:03:26.590> flour<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:26.980> put<00:03:27.280> it

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
dust it with a little flour and put it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.370 
dust it with a little flour and put it
