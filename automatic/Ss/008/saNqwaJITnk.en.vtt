and we thought it would be really great

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.490 
and we thought it would be really great
to<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:20.939> something<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.750> kind<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> motif

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to do something with that kind of motif

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.920 
to do something with that kind of motif
as<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.430> demonstration<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.869> think

to<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.070> not<00:00:29.310> an<00:00:29.460> actual<00:00:29.699> pumpkin

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
to have here it's not an actual pumpkin

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.359 
to have here it's not an actual pumpkin
it's<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.960> ceramic<00:00:31.289> container<00:00:32.009> but

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it's kind of a ceramic container but

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.060 
it's kind of a ceramic container but
it's<00:00:32.669> made<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.059> feel<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> pumpkin<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
it's made to feel like a pumpkin and I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.560 
it's made to feel like a pumpkin and I
like<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.430> container<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.360> nice

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.959 
like this container because it's nice
and<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.380> think<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.250> advantage<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.879> this

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and I think that the advantage of this

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.430 
and I think that the advantage of this
kind<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.329> container<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.140> come<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.410> with

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
kind of container is we can come up with

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290 
kind of container is we can come up with
something<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.129> definitely<00:00:41.489> has<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> holiday

over here into the front and then how

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.099 
over here into the front and then how

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
about one maybe coming over on this side

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.089 
about one maybe coming over on this side
here<00:04:04.579> on<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:06.299> side<00:04:06.540> there<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:08.010> know

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
here on the side there and you know

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.589 
here on the side there and you know
we've<00:04:08.340> got<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.579> spot<00:04:08.910> here<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.299> middle

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
we've got a spot here in the middle

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.659 
we've got a spot here in the middle
let's<00:04:10.139> take<00:04:10.379> another<00:04:10.500> one<00:04:12.919> and<00:04:13.919> pardon<00:04:14.400> me<00:04:14.489> my

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
let's take another one and pardon me my

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.310 
let's take another one and pardon me my
viewer<00:04:14.910> while<00:04:15.060> I'm<00:04:15.180> cutting<00:04:15.389> my<00:04:15.690> flower<00:04:15.959> stem

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
viewer while I'm cutting my flower stem

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.599 
viewer while I'm cutting my flower stem
someplace<00:04:16.769> one<00:04:16.979> over<00:04:17.220> there

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
someplace one over there

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.270 
someplace one over there
and<00:04:17.699> then<00:04:18.269> we<00:04:18.720> can<00:04:18.930> place<00:04:19.199> another<00:04:19.620> one<00:04:19.829> over

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
and then we can place another one over

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.700 
and then we can place another one over
here<00:04:20.880> which<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.719> think<00:04:21.750> will<00:04:22.169> give<00:04:22.349> us<00:04:22.530> an

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
here which I think will give us an

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.440 
here which I think will give us an
interesting<00:04:23.310> effect<00:04:23.669> so<00:04:23.849> we're<00:04:24.030> gradually

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
interesting effect so we're gradually

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.960 
interesting effect so we're gradually
scattering<00:04:25.169> some

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
scattering some

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.170 
scattering some
our<00:04:26.060> palms<00:04:26.530> through<00:04:27.530> our<00:04:27.830> design<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.520> that's

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
our palms through our design and that's

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540 
our palms through our design and that's
giving<00:04:29.600> us<00:04:29.720> an<00:04:29.930> interesting<00:04:30.170> effect<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:31.220> still

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
giving us an interesting effect it still

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.130 
giving us an interesting effect it still
though<00:04:31.730> needs<00:04:31.970> something<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.480> little<00:04:32.720> bit<00:04:32.840> more

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
though needs something a little bit more

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.080 
though needs something a little bit more
and<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.830> give<00:04:33.980> us<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.250> little<00:04:34.370> bit<00:04:34.520> more<00:04:34.790> again

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
and to give us a little bit more again

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.700 
and to give us a little bit more again
let's<00:04:35.360> play<00:04:35.570> with<00:04:35.780> some<00:04:35.810> of<00:04:36.020> these<00:04:36.200> holiday

punchy and I think it's going to do just
exactly<00:04:57.680> what<00:04:58.220> we<00:04:58.250> want<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.670> intend<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.120> do<00:04:59.240> to

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
exactly what we want to intend to do to

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.330 
exactly what we want to intend to do to
come<00:04:59.510> up<00:04:59.660> with<00:04:59.810> a<00:04:59.870> design<00:05:00.290> that's<00:05:00.950> pretty

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
come up with a design that's pretty

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.440 
come up with a design that's pretty
interesting

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
interesting

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.080 
interesting
cheerful<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.530> gives<00:05:04.100> a<00:05:04.250> really<00:05:04.610> really<00:05:04.910> nice

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
cheerful and gives a really really nice

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.120 
cheerful and gives a really really nice
effect<00:05:05.570> so<00:05:06.230> I'm<00:05:06.350> taking<00:05:06.560> some<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:07.010> my

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
effect so I'm taking some of my

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.820 
effect so I'm taking some of my
carnations<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.150> working<00:05:08.960> them<00:05:09.140> working<00:05:09.530> my

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
carnations and working them working my

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.070 
carnations and working them working my
way<00:05:09.860> around<00:05:10.270> let's<00:05:11.270> see<00:05:11.480> I<00:05:11.510> think<00:05:11.810> we<00:05:11.930> could

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
way around let's see I think we could

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.110 
way around let's see I think we could
use<00:05:12.110> another<00:05:12.440> one<00:05:12.680> kind<00:05:12.950> of<00:05:13.100> in<00:05:13.250> here<00:05:13.610> towards

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
use another one kind of in here towards

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.300 
use another one kind of in here towards
the<00:05:14.240> front<00:05:14.770> towards<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.860> front<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.190> our

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
the front towards the front of our

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.980 
the front towards the front of our
design<00:05:16.730> and<00:05:18.310> let's<00:05:19.310> see<00:05:19.550> how<00:05:19.760> about<00:05:20.030> something

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
design and let's see how about something

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.659 
design and let's see how about something
perhaps<00:05:21.910> angled<00:05:22.910> over<00:05:23.150> on<00:05:23.510> this<00:05:23.780> side<00:05:23.840> so

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
perhaps angled over on this side so

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.159 
perhaps angled over on this side so
let's<00:05:25.669> take<00:05:25.910> one<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.330> place<00:05:26.510> it<00:05:26.750> here<00:05:26.780> and

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
let's take one and place it here and

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.230 
let's take one and place it here and
have<00:05:27.290> it<00:05:27.410> kind<00:05:27.590> of<00:05:27.710> tucked<00:05:28.010> in<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:28.880> it's<00:05:29.000> kind

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
have it kind of tucked in so it's kind

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.450 
have it kind of tucked in so it's kind
of<00:05:29.300> peeking<00:05:29.720> through<00:05:29.750> over<00:05:30.380> there<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.860> then

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
of peeking through over there and then

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.520 
of peeking through over there and then
of<00:05:31.550> course<00:05:31.580> we<00:05:32.360> do<00:05:32.540> want<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.810> work<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.200> few<00:05:33.380> of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
of course we do want to work a few of

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.290 
of course we do want to work a few of
our<00:05:33.680> flowers<00:05:34.100> coming<00:05:34.490> in<00:05:34.640> towards<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.120> back

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
our flowers coming in towards the back

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.360 
our flowers coming in towards the back
side<00:05:35.600> of<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.810> design<00:05:36.169> here's<00:05:36.470> one<00:05:36.680> over<00:05:37.070> there

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
side of the design here's one over there

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.170 
side of the design here's one over there
and<00:05:37.610> then<00:05:38.570> we<00:05:39.440> can<00:05:39.650> place<00:05:39.890> another<00:05:40.310> one<00:05:40.550> here

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
and then we can place another one here

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.270 
and then we can place another one here
tucking<00:05:42.140> it<00:05:42.229> in<00:05:42.350> deeper<00:05:42.740> notice<00:05:43.070> how<00:05:43.220> the

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
tucking it in deeper notice how the

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.150 
tucking it in deeper notice how the
design<00:05:43.820> is<00:05:44.000> bulking<00:05:44.360> up<00:05:44.479> now<00:05:44.750> from<00:05:45.650> something

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
design is bulking up now from something

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.920 
design is bulking up now from something
that<00:05:46.190> felt<00:05:46.520> very<00:05:46.729> very<00:05:46.940> air<00:05:47.180> conditioning<00:05:47.810> I

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
that felt very very air conditioning I

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.450 
that felt very very air conditioning I
know<00:05:47.990> my<00:05:48.260> viewer<00:05:48.530> you<00:05:48.650> probably<00:05:48.979> had<00:05:49.160> some<00:05:49.340> of

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
know my viewer you probably had some of

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.000 
know my viewer you probably had some of
your<00:05:49.640> doubts<00:05:49.850> when<00:05:50.479> you<00:05:50.660> first<00:05:50.930> saw<00:05:51.260> me<00:05:51.560> taking

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
your doubts when you first saw me taking

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.280 
your doubts when you first saw me taking
a<00:05:52.220> few<00:05:52.430> of<00:05:52.550> my<00:05:52.700> li--<00:05:53.180> after<00:05:53.510> so<00:05:53.660> blazing<00:05:54.050> star

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
a few of my li-- after so blazing star

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.900 
a few of my li-- after so blazing star
but<00:05:54.500> notice<00:05:54.740> how<00:05:54.860> this<00:05:55.040> is<00:05:55.160> developing<00:05:55.669> very

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
but notice how this is developing very

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.969 
but notice how this is developing very
nicely<00:05:56.180> let's<00:05:56.990> take<00:05:57.260> a<00:05:57.290> few<00:05:57.560> more<00:05:57.770> of<00:05:57.830> our

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
nicely let's take a few more of our

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.920 
nicely let's take a few more of our
acquisition<00:05:58.190> ow<00:05:58.760> and<00:05:59.000> work<00:05:59.479> some<00:05:59.690> of<00:05:59.810> our

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
acquisition ow and work some of our

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.710 
acquisition ow and work some of our
equity<00:06:00.140> them<00:06:00.650> through<00:06:01.040> I'm<00:06:01.550> taking<00:06:02.030> one<00:06:02.180> here

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
equity them through I'm taking one here

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.930 
equity them through I'm taking one here
placing<00:06:03.560> another<00:06:03.740> one<00:06:03.950> here<00:06:04.460> in<00:06:04.610> other<00:06:04.729> words

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
placing another one here in other words

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.610 
placing another one here in other words
we're<00:06:05.180> using<00:06:05.450> our<00:06:05.840> equity<00:06:06.260> time<00:06:06.410> now<00:06:06.560> to

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
we're using our equity time now to

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.010 
we're using our equity time now to
radiate<00:06:06.950> out<00:06:07.220> through<00:06:07.669> the<00:06:07.850> design<00:06:08.210> and<00:06:08.479> this

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
radiate out through the design and this

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.920 
radiate out through the design and this
gives<00:06:09.320> added<00:06:09.800> interest<00:06:10.100> to<00:06:10.910> our<00:06:10.940> composition

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
gives added interest to our composition

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.950 
gives added interest to our composition
and<00:06:12.500> makes<00:06:13.160> it<00:06:13.370> feel<00:06:13.610> all<00:06:13.910> that<00:06:14.090> more<00:06:14.690> much

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
and makes it feel all that more much

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.740 
and makes it feel all that more much
more<00:06:15.229> with<00:06:15.890> depth<00:06:16.190> and<00:06:16.460> dimension<00:06:16.700> so<00:06:17.660> I'm

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
more with depth and dimension so I'm

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.930 
more with depth and dimension so I'm
taking<00:06:18.229> a<00:06:18.260> piece<00:06:18.530> here<00:06:18.890> piece<00:06:19.370> here<00:06:19.640> notice

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
taking a piece here piece here notice

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.940 
taking a piece here piece here notice
how<00:06:20.150> this<00:06:20.300> is<00:06:20.360> coming<00:06:20.780> out<00:06:20.960> it's<00:06:21.440> radiating

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
how this is coming out it's radiating

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.110 
how this is coming out it's radiating
out<00:06:22.280> almost<00:06:22.610> similar<00:06:23.620> to<00:06:24.620> my<00:06:25.010> by<00:06:25.460> actress<00:06:25.820> or

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
out almost similar to my by actress or

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.320 
out almost similar to my by actress or
blazing<00:06:26.660> star<00:06:26.960> and<00:06:27.610> working<00:06:28.610> some<00:06:28.880> here<00:06:29.210> and

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
blazing star and working some here and

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.300 
blazing star and working some here and
there<00:06:29.419> let's<00:06:29.810> put<00:06:30.050> one<00:06:30.229> over<00:06:30.260> in<00:06:30.710> here<00:06:31.070> into

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
there let's put one over in here into

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.400 
there let's put one over in here into
the<00:06:31.430> middle<00:06:31.729> so<00:06:32.450> you<00:06:32.540> can<00:06:32.780> see<00:06:33.020> how<00:06:33.169> this<00:06:33.350> is

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
the middle so you can see how this is

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.440 
the middle so you can see how this is
really<00:06:33.890> coming<00:06:34.220> together<00:06:34.340> very<00:06:34.880> very<00:06:34.970> nicely

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
really coming together very very nicely

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.560 
really coming together very very nicely
and<00:06:35.870> giving<00:06:36.560> us<00:06:36.740> a<00:06:36.890> very<00:06:37.070> very<00:06:37.370> pretty

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
and giving us a very very pretty

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.790 
and giving us a very very pretty
composition<00:06:39.400> for<00:06:40.400> something<00:06:40.910> for<00:06:41.270> Halloween

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
composition for something for Halloween

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.970 
composition for something for Halloween
now<00:06:42.970> my<00:06:43.970> mechanics<00:06:44.480> are<00:06:44.630> pretty<00:06:44.840> well<00:06:45.410> covered

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
now my mechanics are pretty well covered

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.190 
now my mechanics are pretty well covered
by<00:06:46.010> my<00:06:46.430> flowers<00:06:46.940> but<00:06:47.450> let's<00:06:47.660> take<00:06:47.870> a<00:06:47.930> little

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
by my flowers but let's take a little

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.310 
by my flowers but let's take a little
bit<00:06:48.470> of<00:06:48.740> our<00:06:49.300> our<00:06:50.300> leaves<00:06:50.540> are<00:06:50.900> preserved
