House<00:00:27.720> Jenkins<00:00:28.320> yeah<00:00:30.019> but<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
House Jenkins yeah but it is kind of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.160 
House Jenkins yeah but it is kind of
tempting<00:00:32.340> me<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.700> make<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> character<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
tempting me to make a character with the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.040 
tempting me to make a character with the
name<00:00:34.350> Leroy<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.160> then<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.540> name<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
name Leroy and then get that name for it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.000 
name Leroy and then get that name for it
so<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.320> kind<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> would<00:00:37.620> make<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.860> lot<00:00:37.950> more

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
so it kind of would make a lot more

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.979
