Bush<00:00:11.390> actually<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:11.990> should<00:00:12.200> give<00:00:12.350> them<00:00:12.530> a<00:00:12.770> size

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:13.640 
Bush actually so should give them a size

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.179 
Bush actually so should give them a size
ratio<00:00:14.420> of<00:00:14.480> about<00:00:14.750> two<00:00:14.960> by<00:00:15.260> two<00:00:15.320> meters<00:00:15.950> in

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
ratio of about two by two meters in

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.509 
ratio of about two by two meters in
order<00:00:16.460> to<00:00:16.669> grow<00:00:16.939> like<00:00:17.300> get<00:00:17.599> a<00:00:17.630> good<00:00:17.900> size<00:00:18.519> the

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
order to grow like get a good size the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.329 
order to grow like get a good size the
gooseberries<00:00:19.910> actually<00:00:20.240> come<00:00:20.419> out<00:00:20.449> in<00:00:20.810> summer

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:21.339 
gooseberries actually come out in summer

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.859 
gooseberries actually come out in summer
so<00:00:22.339> they're<00:00:22.820> deciduous<00:00:23.359> bushes

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
so they're deciduous bushes

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.179 
so they're deciduous bushes
it's<00:00:24.199> obviously<00:00:24.560> they<00:00:24.679> drop<00:00:24.919> all<00:00:25.070> their

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
it's obviously they drop all their

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
leaves and everything like that and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.729 
leaves and everything like that and
they're<00:00:26.570> very<00:00:26.689> fine<00:00:27.279> almost<00:00:29.079> varnish<00:00:30.079> type

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739

at the moment so I'm just going to pop

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.029 
at the moment so I'm just going to pop
mine<00:00:50.179> up<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:50.480> a<00:00:50.539> good-sized<00:00:50.899> pot<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.769> I'll

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
mine up in a good-sized pot and I'll

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.680 
mine up in a good-sized pot and I'll
keep<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.399> there<00:00:52.550> just<00:00:52.760> for<00:00:52.879> one<00:00:53.000> season<00:00:53.329> and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
keep it there just for one season and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.750 
keep it there just for one season and
then<00:00:54.079> next<00:00:54.289> year<00:00:54.530> hopefully<00:00:54.649> or<00:00:55.219> in<00:00:55.609> the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
then next year hopefully or in the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.939 
then next year hopefully or in the
interim<00:00:56.120> period<00:00:56.329> if<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:56.660> can<00:00:56.960> get<00:00:57.739> something

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
interim period if I can get something

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.829 
interim period if I can get something
more<00:00:58.219> appropriate<00:00:58.339> for<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:59.179> and<00:00:59.300> it<00:00:59.570> should<00:00:59.690> be

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
more appropriate for it and it should be

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.810 
more appropriate for it and it should be
fine<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:00.620> I'll<00:01:00.710> just<00:01:00.859> go<00:01:01.010> through<00:01:01.039> putting<00:01:01.640> it

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
fine so I'll just go through putting it

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.260 
fine so I'll just go through putting it
up<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.440> I'll<00:01:03.440> grab<00:01:03.800> everything<00:01:06.939> okay

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
up and I'll grab everything okay

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.880

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.350 
so I've got my pot got my gooseberry now
you<00:01:12.950> can<00:01:13.159> see<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.400> root<00:01:13.579> system<00:01:13.970> on<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.210> is

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
you can see the root system on this is

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.889 
you can see the root system on this is
fairly<00:01:14.630> long<00:01:15.409> now<00:01:16.310> if<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.240> put<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:17.720> this

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
fairly long now if I put this in this

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.170 
fairly long now if I put this in this
pot<00:01:18.110> chances<00:01:19.100> are<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:19.460> root<00:01:19.759> is<00:01:19.909> going<00:01:20.119> to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
pot chances are this root is going to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.819 
pot chances are this root is going to
just<00:01:20.329> go<00:01:20.450> round<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:20.930> round<00:01:20.990> around<00:01:21.439> I<00:01:21.619> don't

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
just go round and round around I don't

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.830 
just go round and round around I don't
really<00:01:21.979> want<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.399> happen<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.540> can

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
really want that to happen so you can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.679 
really want that to happen so you can
prune<00:01:24.170> roots<00:01:25.060> it's<00:01:26.060> got<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.270> be<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.390> little<00:01:26.509> bit

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
prune roots it's got to be a little bit

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.539 
prune roots it's got to be a little bit
careful<00:01:27.140> with<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:27.409> that's<00:01:27.530> all<00:01:27.740> don't<00:01:28.369> go<00:01:28.490> to

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
careful with it that's all don't go to

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.940 
careful with it that's all don't go to

hammer and tong so I'm just going to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.260 
hammer and tong so I'm just going to
knock<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:32.140> just<00:01:33.140> back<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.439> there

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270

alright<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.600> just<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.439> little<00:01:36.500> bit<00:01:36.710> more<00:01:36.920> even

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
alright so just a little bit more even

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.310 
alright so just a little bit more even
I<00:01:37.490> have<00:01:37.969> pruned<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.479> back<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.719> was<00:01:38.840> quite<00:01:39.110> long

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
I have pruned it back it was quite long

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.530 
I have pruned it back it was quite long
when<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:39.979> pick<00:01:40.219> it<00:01:40.369> up<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.030> I've<00:01:41.119> just<00:01:41.299> knocked

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
when I pick it up and I've just knocked

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.770 
when I pick it up and I've just knocked
it<00:01:41.689> back<00:01:41.719> a<00:01:41.869> bit<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:42.079> might<00:01:42.350> even<00:01:42.619> just<00:01:43.659> take<00:01:44.659> it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
it back a bit I might even just take it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.210 
it back a bit I might even just take it
back<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> little<00:01:45.079> bit<00:01:45.530> more

and then we should be right all right so
I've<00:01:55.360> got<00:01:55.510> my<00:01:55.630> pot<00:01:55.840> now<00:01:56.590> I've<00:01:56.800> got<00:01:56.979> some<00:01:57.100> soil

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
I've got my pot now I've got some soil

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.670 
I've got my pot now I've got some soil
here<00:01:57.729> it's<00:01:58.000> just<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.300> mixture<00:01:58.690> of<00:01:58.840> some<00:01:59.350> potting

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
here it's just a mixture of some potting

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.520 
here it's just a mixture of some potting
mix<00:01:59.860> some<00:02:00.610> regular<00:02:00.970> garden<00:02:01.300> soil<00:02:01.570> mix<00:02:02.050> there

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
mix some regular garden soil mix there

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.250 
mix some regular garden soil mix there
isn't<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.950> straw<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.790> hadn't<00:02:04.090> had<00:02:05.080> it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
isn't a straw that I hadn't had it

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.650 
isn't a straw that I hadn't had it
clipped<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.530> shapes<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.979> got<00:02:06.729> manure<00:02:07.450> and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
clipped the shapes I got manure and

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.940 
clipped the shapes I got manure and
everything<00:02:07.990> through<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.320> so<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.590> should<00:02:08.830> be

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
everything through it so it should be

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.360 
everything through it so it should be
pretty<00:02:09.160> right<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.530> we'll<00:02:12.190> put<00:02:12.340> a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
pretty right with that so we'll put a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:34.860 
pretty right with that so we'll put a
bit<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:12.610> first<00:02:30.900> all<00:02:31.900> right<00:02:32.110> like<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:34.630> let

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
bit in first all right like so just let

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.920 
bit in first all right like so just let
me<00:02:34.989> sit<00:02:35.170> up<00:02:36.120> now<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.390> get<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> root<00:02:37.780> system

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
me sit up now if you get a root system

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.100 
me sit up now if you get a root system
on<00:02:38.200> something<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.739> kind<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.010> pans<00:02:39.310> out<00:02:40.110> just

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.449 
build a little mound in the dirt and fit
that<00:02:43.870> on<00:02:43.930> top<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.260> then<00:02:44.620> backfill<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.310> from

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
that on top and then backfill it from

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.009 
that on top and then backfill it from
they<00:02:45.580> say<00:02:45.760> don't<00:02:45.910> get<00:02:46.060> any<00:02:46.300> air<00:02:46.450> pockets<00:02:46.660> or

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
and central make sure the root system is

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.490 
and central make sure the root system is
nice<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.860> spread<00:02:54.160> out<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:56.049> one's<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.350> bit

just push down nice and light even all
right<00:03:52.049> there<00:03:53.049> we<00:03:53.140> go

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
right there we go

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.589 
right there we go
easy<00:03:53.890> now<00:03:54.760> even<00:03:55.450> though<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:55.780> winter<00:03:56.170> all

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
chuckle a little bit of food on there

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.280 
chuckle a little bit of food on there
the<00:04:03.610> pea<00:04:03.790> straw<00:04:04.030> in<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.299> mix<00:04:04.599> with<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.110> soil

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
the pea straw in the mix with the soil

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.780 
the pea straw in the mix with the soil
should<00:04:05.560> give<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.860> good<00:04:06.010> source<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.400> nitrogen

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
should give it a good source of nitrogen

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.850 
should give it a good source of nitrogen
as<00:04:07.090> well<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.870> like<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.170> said<00:04:08.230> this<00:04:08.440> pot<00:04:08.680> should

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
as well so like I said this pot should

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.550 
as well so like I said this pot should
be<00:04:08.950> ample<00:04:09.310> for<00:04:09.489> one<00:04:09.610> season<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.450> I'll<00:04:11.079> repot

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
be ample for one season and I'll repot

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.890 
be ample for one season and I'll repot
it<00:04:11.590> well<00:04:12.579> actually<00:04:12.790> I'll<00:04:13.090> try<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.390> plant<00:04:13.630> it

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
it well actually I'll try and plant it

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.930 
it well actually I'll try and plant it
in<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.380> next<00:04:14.590> season<00:04:14.769> as<00:04:15.069> well<00:04:15.220> too<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:15.700> I'll

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
in the next season as well too so I'll

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.969 
in the next season as well too so I'll
come<00:04:16.180> back<00:04:16.359> over<00:04:16.959> some<00:04:17.260> on<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.590> next<00:04:17.799> few

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
come back over some on the next few

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.129 
come back over some on the next few
months<00:04:18.130> I'll<00:04:19.000> show<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.299> how<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.479> grow<00:04:19.750> scummy

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
months I'll show you how to grow scummy

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.129 
months I'll show you how to grow scummy
you<00:04:20.769> can<00:04:20.950> see<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.280> quite<00:04:21.430> spindly<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.930> it

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
you can see it is quite spindly so it

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.070 
you can see it is quite spindly so it
will<00:04:23.320> just<00:04:23.530> stand<00:04:23.860> out<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:25.419> gooseberries<00:04:25.990> are

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
will just stand out and gooseberries are

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.620 
will just stand out and gooseberries are
quite<00:04:26.880> bitter<00:04:27.880> or<00:04:28.660> sour<00:04:29.340> as<00:04:30.340> raw<00:04:30.760> like<00:04:31.180> just

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
quite bitter or sour as raw like just

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.360 
quite bitter or sour as raw like just
straight<00:04:31.900> from<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.200> tree<00:04:32.410> but<00:04:32.620> they<00:04:33.130> really

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
straight from the tree but they really

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.010 
straight from the tree but they really
get<00:04:33.520> transformed<00:04:34.120> quite<00:04:34.330> nicely<00:04:34.570> through

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
get transformed quite nicely through

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.190 
get transformed quite nicely through
cooking<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.680> like<00:04:36.460> rhubarb<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.330> hold<00:04:38.050> the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
cooking so like rhubarb and hold the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.080 
cooking so like rhubarb and hold the
berries<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.530> things<00:04:38.860> like<00:04:39.010> that<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.910> cook

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
berries and things like that you cook

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.760 
berries and things like that you cook
them<00:04:40.240> with<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.630> few<00:04:41.050> other<00:04:41.200> things<00:04:41.289> bit<00:04:41.680> of

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
them with a few other things bit of
