already done my base and my eyebrows

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.590 
already done my base and my eyebrows
just<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.949> speed<00:00:20.369> things<00:00:20.580> up<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.029> little<00:00:21.210> bit<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
just to speed things up a little bit and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.769 
just to speed things up a little bit and
I'm<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:23.010> dark<00:00:23.640> blue<00:00:23.939> pencil<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
I'm going in with a dark blue pencil and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.080 
I'm going in with a dark blue pencil and
I'm<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.560> over<00:00:25.680> my<00:00:25.920> whole<00:00:26.220> eyelid<00:00:26.730> this

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I'm just going over my whole eyelid this

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.179 
I'm just going over my whole eyelid this
is<00:00:27.210> basically<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.630> creating<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> base<00:00:28.380> for

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
is basically just creating a base for

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.370 
is basically just creating a base for
the<00:00:29.460> eye<00:00:29.490> shadow<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> becomes<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> lot<00:00:31.230> more

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the eye shadow so it becomes a lot more

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.229 
the eye shadow so it becomes a lot more
blue<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.189> smudging<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.700> out<00:00:33.000> with

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
blue and I'm just smudging that out with

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.139 
blue and I'm just smudging that out with
a<00:00:33.270> smudging<00:00:34.020> brush<00:00:34.370> not<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.640> quite<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
a smudging brush not going quite up to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.190 
a smudging brush not going quite up to
the<00:00:36.270> crease<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> lid<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:40.140> then

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the crease but just on the lid and then

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.680 
the crease but just on the lid and then
going<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.820> bright<00:00:42.030> blue<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.600> I'm

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
going with a very bright blue and I'm

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.600 
going with a very bright blue and I'm
just<00:00:42.840> using<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.170> tissue<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.739> catch<00:00:43.950> any<00:00:44.160> fallout

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
just using a tissue to catch any fallout

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.090 
just using a tissue to catch any fallout
because<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:46.079> would<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.649> hard<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.950> get

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
because this would be really hard to get

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.119 
because this would be really hard to get
off<00:00:47.219> my<00:00:47.370> face<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.329> yeah<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.350> putting<00:00:49.980> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
over where I put the bloob then going in

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
over where I put the bloob then going in
