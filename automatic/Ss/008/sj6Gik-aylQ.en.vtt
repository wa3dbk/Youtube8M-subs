00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.770
 in lides by ecuador presents a 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.649
 test 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.630
 two brands of gloves one that is in the 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.519
 market 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.410
 and the idh sport 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.410
 who will soon arrive in the country 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.460
 these gloves 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.120
 they work with water 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.810
 or in dry weather 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.949
 can not see no 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.949
 a little camera 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.870
 and we are going to verify the adherence of the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.870
 gloves one by one 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.110
 the manufacturer says that the glove when 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.580
 it's wet has better grip 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.580
 and more adherence to the ball 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.780
 if we are going to help you a little the gloves 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.780
 so that they adhere to the ball 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.820
 they did not give up we're going to do the test with 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.820
 the live aqua 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.230
 the gloves have nothing 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.750
 nothing that holds 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.479
 Y 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.670
 in the same way we help you to 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.530
 give the ball a little 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.130
 and how can you see the answer is very 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.200
 different 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.440
 the gloves adhere perfectly to 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.440
 ball 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.340
 in wet conditions of the gloves 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.020
 as you can see normal water 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.209
 that's what elite sport presents 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.750
 with the comparison 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.530
 of two known brands of gloves 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.530
 soon they will reach the equator
