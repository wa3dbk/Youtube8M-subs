00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.530 

is<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.989> front<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> spoiler<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.939> that

is the front of the spoiler and that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:16.800 
is the front of the spoiler and that
won't<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> back<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.050 

so<00:01:17.409> we're<00:01:17.619> gonna<00:01:17.799> go<00:01:18.040> get<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.400> installed<00:01:18.909> in

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
so we're gonna go get it installed in

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.880 
so we're gonna go get it installed in
the<00:01:19.180> car<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:20.940> hopefully<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:23.200> going<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.740> look

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
the car and hopefully it's going to look

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.649 
the car and hopefully it's going to look
good<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:27.460> just<00:01:27.790> doing<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.119> quick<00:01:28.150> mock-up

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
good I'm just doing a quick mock-up

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.609 
good I'm just doing a quick mock-up
right<00:01:29.140> now

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
right now

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.899 
right now
but<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.640> think<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.540> made<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> mistake<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:32.909> maybe

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
but I think I made a mistake I maybe

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.370 
but I think I made a mistake I maybe
should<00:01:34.270> have<00:01:34.360> bought<00:01:34.600> either<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.560> 55<00:01:36.399> or<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.420> 56

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
should have bought either a 55 or a 56

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:47.870 
should have bought either a 55 or a 56
inch<00:01:42.149> spoiler<00:01:43.149> but<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:43.780> bought<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.140> 57<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
inch spoiler but I bought a 57 and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880 
inch spoiler but I bought a 57 and
thinking<00:01:48.929> see<00:01:49.929> as<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.289> see<00:01:50.440> right<00:01:50.560> here

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
thinking see as you can see right here

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.190 
thinking see as you can see right here
let's<00:01:51.490> write<00:01:51.789> it<00:01:51.820> up<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.690> edge<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.780> on<00:01:55.960> the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
let's write it up to the edge but on the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.719 
let's write it up to the edge but on the
other<00:01:56.320> side

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.550 

it's<00:02:03.880> about<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.939> quarter<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.450> an<00:02:05.810> inch<00:02:06.700> longer

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
it's about a quarter of an inch longer

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:22.540 
it's about a quarter of an inch longer
so<00:02:09.560> I'm<00:02:09.860> not<00:02:10.190> sure<00:02:10.250> what<00:02:10.789> I'm<00:02:10.910> gonna<00:02:11.060> do

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.580 

okay<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.790> figured<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.660> what<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:24.990> going<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.320> do

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
okay I figured out what I'm going to do

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:34.850 
okay I figured out what I'm going to do
I<00:02:28.100> got<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:31.190> spoiler<00:02:32.190> centered<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:34.650> what

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
I got the spoiler centered and then what

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.400 
I got the spoiler centered and then what
I'm<00:02:34.980> gonna<00:02:35.100> do

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
I'm gonna do

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.620 
I'm gonna do
it's<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:37.710> here<00:02:38.040> since<00:02:38.490> it's<00:02:38.700> overlapping<00:02:39.300> a

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
it's right here since it's overlapping a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.250 
it's right here since it's overlapping a
little<00:02:39.660> bit<00:02:39.990> I'm<00:02:40.440> just<00:02:40.800> gonna<00:02:41.190> curve<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.670> up

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
little bit I'm just gonna curve it up

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.160 
little bit I'm just gonna curve it up
just<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.620> clears<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.190> edge<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:46.050> it's

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
just so that it clears the edge and it's

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.760 
just so that it clears the edge and it's
gonna<00:02:46.320> have<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> nice<00:02:46.880> curb<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:49.110> it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
gonna have a nice curb to it and it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.740 
gonna have a nice curb to it and it
should<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.130> fine

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.190 

and<00:02:55.850> finally<00:02:57.620> after<00:02:58.820> probably<00:02:59.820> about<00:03:00.200> thirty

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
and finally after probably about thirty

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.310 
and finally after probably about thirty
to<00:03:01.470> forty<00:03:01.800> minutes<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.959> trying<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.080> take

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
to forty minutes of trying to take

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.630 
to forty minutes of trying to take
measurements<00:03:05.540> from<00:03:06.540> right<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.130> edge<00:03:08.310> of

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
measurements from right here the edge of

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.210 
measurements from right here the edge of
the<00:03:08.760> trunk<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.830> lip<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.260> top<00:03:13.800> of

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the trunk to the lip and to the top of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.490 
the trunk to the lip and to the top of
this<00:03:16.010> roundel<00:03:17.010> here<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:19.520> pretty<00:03:20.520> much<00:03:20.640> got<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.209> I

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
this roundel here I pretty much got it I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.270 
this roundel here I pretty much got it I
think<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:23.070> came<00:03:23.880> out<00:03:24.090> pretty<00:03:24.330> straight<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:25.320> was

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
think it came out pretty straight I was

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.720 
think it came out pretty straight I was
trying<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.670> curve<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.440> ends<00:03:28.890> up<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.370> little<00:03:29.519> bit

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
trying to curve the ends up a little bit

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.199 
trying to curve the ends up a little bit
so<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.780> wouldn't<00:03:31.049> overhang<00:03:31.590> but<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.820> wasn't

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
so it wouldn't overhang but that wasn't

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.440 
so it wouldn't overhang but that wasn't
looking<00:03:33.959> too<00:03:34.230> great<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> what<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.910> ended<00:03:36.330> up

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
looking too great so what I ended up

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.310 
looking too great so what I ended up
doing<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:37.730> putting<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.970> mounting<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.720> straight

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
doing is putting it mounting it straight

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.789 
doing is putting it mounting it straight
on<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.730> trunk<00:03:42.090> well<00:03:42.780> at<00:03:42.900> least<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.470> think<00:03:43.500> it

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
on the trunk well at least I think it

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.949 
on the trunk well at least I think it
looks<00:03:44.010> pretty<00:03:44.160> straight<00:03:46.790> maybe<00:03:47.870> there's<00:03:48.870> a

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
looks pretty straight maybe there's a

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.890 
looks pretty straight maybe there's a
difference<00:03:49.470> within<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:50.420> 1/16<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.600> an<00:03:51.750> inch

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
difference within a 1/16 of an inch

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
difference within a 1/16 of an inch
maybe<00:03:52.560> even<00:03:52.890> less<00:03:53.450> but<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.750> still<00:03:55.410> had<00:03:55.680> an

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
maybe even less but I still had an

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.650 
maybe even less but I still had an
overhang<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.989> sides<00:03:58.260> here<00:03:59.090> that<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.120> had<00:04:00.420> to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
overhang on the sides here that I had to

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.190 
overhang on the sides here that I had to
get<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:00.959> razor<00:04:01.200> blade<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.560> cut<00:04:01.769> off<00:04:02.959> it<00:04:03.959> doesn't

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
get a razor blade and cut off it doesn't

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.320 
get a razor blade and cut off it doesn't
look<00:04:04.530> professional<00:04:06.140> but<00:04:07.730> can't<00:04:08.730> really<00:04:09.060> tell

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
look professional but can't really tell

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.110 
look professional but can't really tell
unless<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:10.560> get<00:04:10.709> up<00:04:10.830> close<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:14.670> it

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
unless you get up close but it

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.840 
unless you get up close but it
definitely<00:04:15.950> served<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.130> purpose<00:04:17.580> that<00:04:17.820> I

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
definitely served the purpose that I

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.460 
definitely served the purpose that I
wanted<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:19.500> break<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.459> slope<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:21.470> the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
wanted it to to break the slope of the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.310 
wanted it to to break the slope of the
trunk<00:04:22.800> lid<00:04:23.210> so<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.390> looks<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.690> little<00:04:24.810> different

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
trunk lid so it looks a little different

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.060 
trunk lid so it looks a little different
now<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:26.010> I'm<00:04:26.700> liking<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.150> very<00:04:27.360> much<00:04:28.070> let's

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
now and I'm liking it very much let's

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.110 
now and I'm liking it very much let's
see<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.700> you<00:04:29.760> see<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.210> from<00:04:30.390> oh<00:04:30.750> yeah<00:04:31.500> yeah

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.760 

the<00:04:36.120> shadow<00:04:36.450> from<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.780> garage<00:04:37.080> door<00:04:37.500> doesn't

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
the shadow from the garage door doesn't

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.270 
the shadow from the garage door doesn't
let<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.250> appreciate<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.880> as<00:04:39.180> well<00:04:40.100> but<00:04:41.100> you

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
let you appreciate it as well but you

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.030 
let you appreciate it as well but you
can<00:04:41.430> definitely<00:04:41.550> see<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.060> from<00:04:42.300> in<00:04:42.450> here

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
can definitely see it from in here

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.270 
can definitely see it from in here
and<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.280> think<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.700> looks<00:04:45.360> good<00:04:46.100> matches<00:04:47.100> with

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
and I think it looks good matches with

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.160 
and I think it looks good matches with
all<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.850> rest<00:04:48.840> of<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.170> black<00:04:49.380> trim<00:04:50.090> well
