00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.989
 with the makeup as you can see already 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.760
 I bring I'm makeup can see 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.980
 that that combination of 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.930
 colors on this occasion I already bring a 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.660
 first shadows all over my eyelid 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.390
 also applies a little bit of concealer 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.379
 tone of the eyelet that I put under my 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.659
 bow in this part to highlight more my 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.180
 sg and the first thing I will do will be 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.850
 take this super intense blue tone with 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.700
 this brush and what I will do is create a 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.930
 kind of guide that will go from the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.580
 corner of my eye towards the basin and there 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 I'm going to put this line 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.230
 in this way 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.329
 I'm going to apply it in the bottom part 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.190
 to unite and I'll leave it more or less to the 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.680
 half 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.410
 now I'm going to take a white concealer 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.610
 with a synthetic brush and I'm going 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.610
 apply it here 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.439
 and I'm going to take this tone here that as 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.140
 can see is a very light yellow it 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.979
 note a little greenish I'm going to apply it to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.979
 pats 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.880
 and on top of this color I'm going to apply 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.880
 this mate mate 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.710
 my next color will be this pink tone 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.780
 for me this is the amount that I am 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.550
 taking we are going to apply it after 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.550
 blue tone that I already applied 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.080
 and I will return with my blue tone that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.130
 apply first and I will highlight this 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.130
 line that I made 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.700
 here if you realize I'm rounding 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.190
 a little bit I'm going to take this brush for 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.970
 blur and well let's integrate the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.180
 colors 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.880
 that is not noticeable in lines to illuminate 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.780
 I'm going to take this tone from here and I'm 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.780
 spreading 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.480
 I'm also going to take some of this 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.970
 color and it will be to join both colors 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.970
 I'm applying skin tone in this area 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.390
 to illuminate work of my eyebrows I'm going to 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.739
 take this all in white with enough 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.739

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.520

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.620
 be applying this black with a 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.560
 beveled type brush let's make a 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.180
 pretty long delineated not so thick 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.180
 but if it's long enough 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.959
 and I'm going to apply a little bit for the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.390
 part of here below to darken the and 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.340

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.510

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.090
