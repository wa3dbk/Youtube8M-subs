00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 to the girls as they are now I am 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.919
 doing you on nails extremely 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.500
 short here and progress as you can see 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.950
 I finished the weaving nothing else is for 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.010
 can show them and this is a problem 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.650
 very common and I wanted to show you now that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.530
 I can do with my example here 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.510
 my client and then 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.300
 nothing, I'm going to show you how I do it 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.630
 with shapes but in the end I'm going to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.370
 do 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.650
 to regret as I did in the 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.340
 other little fingers elongating a little bit of 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.230
 the almond ok and I'll leave the camera 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.970
 a little to show you how to prepare 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.970
 I join 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.590
 Nail shape for the short bed 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.700
 that here just take the scissors and a 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.700
 stroke 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.490
 depending how short the nail is 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.490
 does the extension of 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.690
 shape 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.260
 then if so, we're going to 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.860
 do here you can already extend it up 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.660
 where is the nail up and here and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.350
 you can build an almond not them 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.830
 I show that close 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.320
 I'm going to withdraw the truth 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.080
 and I show you there they are and that's how 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.770
 extend ok 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.130
 and nothing but I'm going to do it with type 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.329
 because she preferred tip 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.329
 so we're going to work 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.880
 not only that to extend snow 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:00.050
 and spade rescue ford in the formed 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.910
 in des arts extend how much in the web of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:08.179
 the rich in serving in the south and not 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.510
 ends the tournaments in question rich of 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.550
 neil in an extension of the toast that 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.480
 they are the win and they are formed yellow now 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:22.430
 tips and seeing the existing wild 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.190
 neuer to join chip ok after 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.510
 michael turner is preferred only 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.700
 I'm going to measure the tip 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.090
 and anyway it seems to me that 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.640
 written are others so I'm going to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.780
 give a little pass 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.780
 to the corners 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.360
 until it is side by side and not 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.650
 not even stuck to the skins for 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.650
 that there is no uprising 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.810
 and this almost always has to be done 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.120
 it does not matter what type of nail always 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.170
 have to do because the tips do not 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.989
 come measured exactly she can 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.569
 still use tip there are a lot more 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.560
 short that you can not plane 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.460
 you have to use the extension in the form 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.310
 of the nail and make the sculptural 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.630
 but she does not have so short then 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.630
 let's apply the type 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.990
 if there are residues left below glue 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.870
 it's fine anyway whatever it is with 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.910
 the skin when washing hands 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.130
 must be eliminated 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.980
 because sometimes that happens when the 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.060
 nails are very short 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.950
 so here I am going to 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.540
 portaltic dehydrate 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.540
 and I will apply driver 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.090
 and I'm going to use a skin color that is the one 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.390
 I'm using in this set 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.180
 I prepared it with my face to ccoo 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.360
 but nothing else that can be dull rice 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.280
 you have to like pearl and pink and these and 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.140
 these others there are because any 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.140
 mark the most damaged 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.740
 a little bit of yellow 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.740
 spread the almond 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.479
 that if it can be extended with you 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.949
 If it is crystalline 7 color you will have to 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.380
 spread the almond first then 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.800
 you put the type because if it is not going to 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.800
 make itself transparent 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.390
 with a single pearl I will do the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.390
 almond 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.889
 and he does not like the very pronounced smile 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.960
 if I will not do it 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.500
 because I have the ability to pronounce 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.390
 a lot of smiles 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.390
 because it's my preference but she does not 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.710
 like if we are going to do it more 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.710
 less pronounced 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.470
 that the elongated almond above the type 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.230
 ok now I'm going to apply a mixture with 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.150
 silver colors 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.150
 and they make their stars that they chose 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.130
 ok once finished already applied in the 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.920
 I'm going to encapsulate it with 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.850
 crystal acrylic 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.660
 and it's still you have a short nail with 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.100
 almond 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.100
 extended with type 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.180
 although ready here we no longer go to 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.120
 file and apply although girls here already 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.580
 I finished polishing and no longer 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.250
 I'm going to clean the nail 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.470
 and how can you see if the 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.430
 almond and also I'm going to apply a 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.289
 little bit of ultraviolet gel I hope that 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.379
 have served this tutorial and then 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:41.680
 nothing I upload photos to you here had them 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:44.580
 little pictures better said even if they happen 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.580
 good afternoon nothing
