00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.539 
really good to have the Sun especially
coming<00:01:30.680> from<00:01:30.740> support<00:01:31.159> because<00:01:31.250> you're<00:01:31.490> not

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
coming from support because you're not

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.580 
coming from support because you're not
really<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.789> damage<00:01:32.149> output<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:33.170> I<00:01:33.200> think<00:01:33.289> those

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
really a damage output so I think those

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.819 
really a damage output so I think those
champions<00:01:34.070> fit<00:01:34.280> everything<00:01:34.609> pretty<00:01:34.880> well

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
champions fit everything pretty well

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.990 
champions fit everything pretty well
recently<00:01:36.829> I<00:01:37.130> mean<00:01:37.430> it's<00:01:37.579> been<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.729> really<00:01:37.880> long

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
recently I mean it's been a really long

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.060 
recently I mean it's been a really long
time<00:01:38.149> since<00:01:38.570> there's<00:01:38.899> been<00:01:38.960> another<00:01:39.439> support

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
time since there's been another support

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.590 
time since there's been another support
champion<00:01:40.399> that<00:01:40.490> came<00:01:40.670> out<00:01:40.789> and<00:01:40.969> bard<00:01:41.210> came<00:01:41.420> out

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
champion that came out and bard came out

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.209 
champion that came out and bard came out
do<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.469> think<00:01:42.619> that<00:01:42.710> he's<00:01:42.859> good<00:01:43.039> enough<00:01:43.070> for

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
do you think that he's good enough for

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.709 
do you think that he's good enough for
competitive<00:01:43.789> play<00:01:43.969> yet<00:01:44.149> do<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.420> think<00:01:44.570> he's

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
competitive play yet do you think he's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.139 
competitive play yet do you think he's
super<00:01:45.049> o<00:01:45.109> peor<00:01:45.409> super<00:01:45.859> weak<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.250> if<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:46.640> then

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
super o peor super weak and if so then

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.550 
super o peor super weak and if so then
what<00:01:47.420> do<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:47.539> think<00:01:47.719> needs<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:48.049> be<00:01:48.109> changed<00:01:48.320> by

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
what do you think needs to be changed by

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.840 
what do you think needs to be changed by
him<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.829> make<00:01:48.950> him<00:01:49.070> good<00:01:49.189> for<00:01:49.399> competitive

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
him to make him good for competitive

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.109 
him to make him good for competitive
play<00:01:50.229> um<00:01:51.229> my<00:01:51.649> initial<00:01:52.039> thoughts<00:01:52.250> like<00:01:52.729> messing

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
play um my initial thoughts like messing

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.279 
play um my initial thoughts like messing
around<00:01:53.179> with<00:01:53.390> him<00:01:53.539> in<00:01:53.630> Salt<00:01:53.810> Lake<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.049> and

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
around with him in Salt Lake you and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.749 
around with him in Salt Lake you and
normals<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.740> stuff<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:55.250> just<00:01:55.670> he's<00:01:56.359> terrible

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
normals and stuff is just he's terrible

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.690 
normals and stuff is just he's terrible
but<00:01:58.759> I<00:01:59.359> think<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.619> competitor<00:02:01.100> vironment<00:02:01.280> he

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
but I think in a competitor vironment he

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.580 
but I think in a competitor vironment he
could<00:02:02.119> be<00:02:02.270> better<00:02:02.509> just<00:02:03.140> because<00:02:03.289> how<00:02:03.439> it's

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
could be better just because how it's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.260 
could be better just because how it's
kid<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.070> like<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:04.310> whole<00:02:04.429> roaming<00:02:04.820> old

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
kid is like the whole roaming old

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.749 
kid is like the whole roaming old
synergy<00:02:06.079> stuff<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.499> mean<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.280> could<00:02:07.460> be<00:02:07.609> better

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
synergy stuff I mean it could be better

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.820 
synergy stuff I mean it could be better
in<00:02:07.939> five<00:02:08.600> so<00:02:09.020> we'll<00:02:09.229> have<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.440> try<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.619> out<00:02:09.710> in

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
in five so we'll have to try it out in

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.440 
in five so we'll have to try it out in
some<00:02:09.950> scrims<00:02:10.280> maybe<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:12.410> i<00:02:12.440> guess<00:02:12.740> like

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
some scrims maybe and the i guess like

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.119 
some scrims maybe and the i guess like
one<00:02:14.450> thing<00:02:14.659> that's<00:02:14.870> really<00:02:15.170> hard<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.620> see

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
one thing that's really hard to see

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.040 
one thing that's really hard to see
right<00:02:16.310> now<00:02:16.459> on<00:02:16.849> how<00:02:17.000> good<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.629> his<00:02:17.780> ult

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
right now on how good it is is his ult

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.560 
right now on how good it is is his ult
because

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
because

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.090 
because
like<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.810> haven't<00:02:20.960> like<00:02:21.140> i'll<00:02:21.530> have<00:02:21.710> some<00:02:21.890> molds

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
like I haven't like i'll have some molds

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.350
