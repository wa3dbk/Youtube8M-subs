00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.930
 hi how are you have only one core 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.490
 and we are again with a new drawing 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.540
 this time I'm drawing the new 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.980
 character of final alfred and 3 good not 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.900
 I know if it's new I do not know if it's good and I do not know 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.099
 what character will be but is the character 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.380
 mysterious that appears at the end of 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.329
 official trailer that many people 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.119
 they are saying that it is golden 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:34.579
 good and good I do not know I do not know good but it's a 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.280
 character that has a very green color 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.350
 particular is a dry green color is a 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.210
 green color of a withered leaf 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.570
 a dry leaf is a pretty green color 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.430
 I would say scary and then 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.930
 what I did was try to get 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.670
 that tone because I do not have that tone 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.110
 so what I did was combine and 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.690
 combine and match colors a bit of 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.700
 gray a little bit of cuttlefish and a little 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.590
 green the greens that I have are pretty 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.440
 alive then it did not have that gray color 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.009
 dry and combine it to achieve darken 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.530
 a little to take a little life away from 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.359
 that green did not get exactly the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.800
 same tone but good here this is what 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.700
 What I got 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.430
 it's tomos I managed to take a little bit of 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.870
 shine to that tone and do it a little more 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.670
 more opaque 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.320
 the same combining combining colors 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.280
 combining colors trying to get 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.840
 that hue and also with colors 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.659
 prismacolor 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.380
 and then doing all the drawing 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.210
 with the black color for the finish on the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.280
 back of the character there is another 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.319
 character I did not draw it but I think it 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.539
 Freddy's about the only strange thing is that 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:48.469
 put on his ears true then 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.840
 is without his ears and in the part of 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.789
 behind there is also the box where they are 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.250
 all the heads of the characters are 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.250
 see that they are the heads of all of them 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.709
 in the toy version then well no 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.260
 I know if it will be that the 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.870
 costumes removed their outer shape 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.080
 well let's hope it comes out and we'll give 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:14.280
 Similarly this account you 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.430
