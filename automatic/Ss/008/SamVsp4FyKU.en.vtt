smartphone and the question is arisen
lately<00:00:12.650> is<00:00:13.650> there<00:00:14.070> room<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.150> third

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
lately is there room for a third

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.580 
lately is there room for a third
category<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.529> device<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.640> middle

category of device in the middle

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
category of device in the middle
something<00:00:19.590> that's<00:00:19.740> between<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.220> laptop<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
smartphone and of course we've pondered

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.810 
smartphone and of course we've pondered
this<00:00:23.730> question<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.420> years<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.580> bar

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
this question for years as well the bar

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630 
this question for years as well the bar
is<00:00:26.849> pretty<00:00:27.150> high<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.859> order<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.250> create

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
is pretty high in order to really create

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.179 
is pretty high in order to really create
a<00:00:29.760> new<00:00:29.970> category<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.539> devices<00:00:31.080> those<00:00:31.830> devices

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
a new category of devices those devices

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
a new category of devices those devices
are<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.090> far<00:00:33.510> better<00:00:33.870> at

it's going to have to be better at these

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.410 
it's going to have to be better at these
kinds<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.320> tasks<00:01:22.560> than<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.610> laptop<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
kinds of tasks than a laptop or a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420 
kinds of tasks than a laptop or a
smartphone<00:01:24.780> otherwise<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.710> has<00:01:25.770> no<00:01:25.920> reason

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
smartphone otherwise it has no reason

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.969 
smartphone otherwise it has no reason
for<00:01:26.610> being<00:01:27.320> now<00:01:28.700> some<00:01:29.700> people<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.240> thought

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
for being now some people have thought

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.480 
for being now some people have thought
that<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> netbook<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.680> problem<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that that's a netbook the problem is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.680 
that that's a netbook the problem is
netbooks<00:01:36.270> aren't<00:01:36.540> better<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:37.049> anything<00:01:39.170> they

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.890 

they're<00:01:43.470> slow<00:01:44.120> they<00:01:45.120> have<00:01:45.300> low<00:01:45.570> quality

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
they're slow they have low quality

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.380 
they're slow they have low quality
displays<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.310> run<00:01:47.520> clunky<00:01:47.940> old<00:01:47.970> pc

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
displays and they run clunky old pc

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.710 
displays and they run clunky old pc
software<00:01:48.900> so<00:01:49.940> they're<00:01:50.940> not<00:01:51.090> better<00:01:51.420> than<00:01:51.660> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
software so they're not better than a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.810 
software so they're not better than a
laptop<00:01:52.080> at<00:01:52.530> anything<00:01:52.950> they're<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.130> cheaper

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
laptop at anything they're just cheaper

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.170 
laptop at anything they're just cheaper
they're<00:01:54.300> just<00:01:54.330> cheap<00:01:54.930> laptops<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:57.030> don't

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
they're just cheap laptops and we don't

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.940 
they're just cheap laptops and we don't
think<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:58.260> they're<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.500> third<00:01:58.770> category<00:01:59.010> device

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
think if they're a third category device

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.100 
think if they're a third category device
but<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.250> we've<00:02:02.490> got<00:02:02.730> something<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.870> is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
but we think we've got something that is

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.340 
but we think we've got something that is
and<00:02:04.580> we'd<00:02:05.580> like<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.120> show<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.200> today

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and we'd like to show it to you today

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
for the first time and we call it the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:20.570 
for the first time and we call it the
iPad

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.020 

let<00:02:21.510> me<00:02:21.630> show<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.880> what
