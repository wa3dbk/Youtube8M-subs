00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
great show so with the 8-bit animation

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.539 
great show so with the 8-bit animation
like<00:01:36.820> did<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.150> do<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.229> use<00:01:38.500> certain<00:01:38.920> like

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
like did you do you use certain like

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.300 
like did you do you use certain like
pre-established<00:01:40.420> video<00:01:40.930> games<00:01:41.200> for<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.590> no<00:01:42.040> we

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
pre-established video games for it no we

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.740 
pre-established video games for it no we
actually<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.909> way<00:01:43.030> we<00:01:43.150> designed<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.630> we

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
actually the way we designed it we

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.109 
actually the way we designed it we
designed<00:01:44.110> up<00:01:44.320> all<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:45.010> animation<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.030> all

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
designed up all the animation and all

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.460 
designed up all the animation and all
the<00:01:46.240> characters<00:01:46.570> line<00:01:46.689> is<00:01:46.810> like<00:01:46.960> original

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
the characters line is like original

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.149 
the characters line is like original
design<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.869> thing<00:01:50.380> we<00:01:50.500> really<00:01:50.710> use<00:01:50.979> is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
design and the thing we really use is

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.620 
design and the thing we really use is
how<00:01:51.280> video<00:01:51.490> games<00:01:51.610> move<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.330> help<00:01:52.450> tell

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
how video games move and help tell

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.969 
how video games move and help tell
stories<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:53.170> like<00:01:53.290> we<00:01:53.409> have<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.619> top<00:01:53.799> and

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
stories so like we have the top and
