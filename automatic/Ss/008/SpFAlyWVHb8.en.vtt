Korea<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:46.110> may<00:00:46.350> well<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.620> north<00:00:47.039> though<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
Korea it may well be north though it is

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.810 
Korea it may well be north though it is
a<00:00:48.090> career<00:00:48.510> though<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.440> sure<00:00:49.820> so

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
a career though that is for sure so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.689 
a career though that is for sure so
anyway<00:00:51.059> we'll<00:00:51.270> slowly<00:00:51.570> explain<00:00:52.020> pana<00:00:52.699> there

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

anyway we'll slowly explain pana there
isn't<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.059> much<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.879> but<00:00:56.879> yeah

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
isn't really much to it but but yeah

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.150 
isn't really much to it but but yeah
basically<00:00:57.289> you<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.410> two<00:00:58.590> players<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.039> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
so you like rainbow flickr more flick

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.690 
so you like rainbow flickr more flick
over<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> head<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.240> plus<00:01:18.869> two<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.700> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
over the head it's plus two and you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.870 
over the head it's plus two and you
could<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:21.390> instance<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:23.490> could<00:01:23.640> get

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
could get for instance you could get

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.499 
could get for instance you could get
three<00:01:24.210> panners<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.580> without<00:01:26.580> scoring<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
three panners and without scoring and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
three panners and without scoring and
then<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.990> obviously<00:01:28.290> adds<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.619> nine<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
then that obviously adds up to nine and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
then that obviously adds up to nine and
the<00:01:29.610> points<00:01:29.970> only<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.420> banked<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.079> you

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the points only get banked when you

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.580 
the points only get banked when you
score<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:33.180> makes<00:01:33.420> sense<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.020> should<00:01:34.320> well

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
score if that makes sense it should well

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.580 
score if that makes sense it should well
do<00:01:35.180> on<00:01:36.180> top<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> other<00:01:37.110> team<00:01:37.380> have

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
do on top of that if the other team have

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.399 
do on top of that if the other team have
points<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.520> score<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.750> lose<00:01:40.079> those

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
points when you score they lose those

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
points when you score they lose those
points<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.689> very<00:01:42.720> effective<00:01:43.880> just

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
points so it can be very effective just

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.760 
points so it can be very effective just
if<00:01:45.180> you're<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:45.450> yards<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:45.930> open<00:01:46.320> goal<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
if you're two yards out open goal and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
if you're two yards out open goal and
they've<00:01:46.920> got<00:01:46.979> 10<00:01:47.340> points<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.299> score

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
they've got 10 points you can just score

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.319 
they've got 10 points you can just score
and<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.110> rid<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.290> them<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.729> will<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
and get rid of them and that will do a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.380 
and get rid of them and that will do a
job<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.130> now<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.189> same<00:01:53.700> does<00:01:53.970> apply<00:01:54.149> for

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
job for you now the same does apply for

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.520 
job for you now the same does apply for
the<00:01:54.450> other<00:01:54.600> team<00:01:54.780> however<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.409> was

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the other team however and I was

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.399 
the other team however and I was
actually<00:01:55.680> losing<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> lot<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.090> game

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
actually losing for a lot of this game

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.569 
actually losing for a lot of this game
until<00:01:58.409> right<00:01:58.649> later<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.009> when<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> pulled<00:01:59.490> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
until right later on when I pulled it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.270 
until right later on when I pulled it
out<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> bag<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.270> some<00:02:00.390> big<00:02:00.710> point<00:02:01.710> combos

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
out the bag with some big point combos

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.240 
out the bag with some big point combos
and<00:02:02.570> my<00:02:03.570> art<00:02:03.750> my<00:02:03.810> recommendation<00:02:04.740> would<00:02:05.009> be

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
and my art my recommendation would be

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.800 
and my art my recommendation would be
probably<00:02:06.240> too

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
probably too

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.510 
probably too
get<00:02:07.930> one<00:02:08.200> panner<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:08.920> try<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.160> score

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
get one panner and then try and score

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.000 
get one panner and then try and score
because<00:02:09.759> otherwise<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.420> risk<00:02:10.630> losing<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
because otherwise you risk losing the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
recommendation for trying to win this

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.970 
recommendation for trying to win this
game<00:02:48.010> mode<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:49.600> far<00:02:49.989> as<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.470> goes<00:02:50.680> at<00:02:50.890> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
game mode as far as it goes at the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.140 
game mode as far as it goes at the
moment<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.400> can't<00:02:51.610> actually<00:02:51.700> play<00:02:51.970> this

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
moment you can't actually play this

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.330 
moment you can't actually play this
online<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.780> strategy<00:02:53.349> can't<00:02:53.709> be<00:02:53.950> used

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
online so that strategy can't be used

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.509 
online so that strategy can't be used
but<00:02:55.180> um<00:02:55.690> if<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.470> ever<00:02:56.560> does<00:02:56.769> become<00:02:57.010> an<00:02:57.250> online

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
but um if it ever does become an online

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.190 
but um if it ever does become an online
game<00:02:57.700> mode<00:02:57.970> which<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.269> would<00:02:58.390> love<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.569> see<00:02:58.959> I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
game mode which I would love to see I

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.690 
game mode which I would love to see I
would<00:02:59.890> definitely<00:03:00.370> recommend<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:03.670> use

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
would definitely recommend that you use

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.240 
would definitely recommend that you use
that<00:03:04.090> exact<00:03:04.299> strategy<00:03:04.840> as<00:03:05.650> far<00:03:05.860> as<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> team's

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
that exact strategy as far as the team's

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.470 
favorite team to use so far and nod
enough<00:03:11.319> that's<00:03:11.530> because<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.519> my<00:03:12.790> minds<00:03:13.329> they

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
enough that's because in my minds they

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.080 
enough that's because in my minds they
should<00:03:13.810> be<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.019> really<00:03:14.380> good<00:03:14.530> team<00:03:14.910> because<00:03:15.910> of

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
should be a really good team because of

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.680 
should be a really good team because of
their<00:03:16.359> sort<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:16.930> futsal<00:03:17.579> culture<00:03:18.579> or<00:03:18.850> is
