00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.110 
hey this is Chris Velasco at TechCrunch
and<00:00:04.740> I've<00:00:05.100> always<00:00:05.370> thought<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.640> myself<00:00:05.759> as<00:00:06.060> a

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
and I've always thought of myself as a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.360 
and I've always thought of myself as a
pretty<00:00:06.509> good<00:00:06.600> driver<00:00:07.230> maybe<00:00:08.040> not<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.340> best

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
pretty good driver maybe not the best

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.310 
pretty good driver maybe not the best
sometimes<00:00:08.940> they<00:00:09.269> look<00:00:09.420> at<00:00:09.570> speed<00:00:09.870> limit<00:00:10.110> signs

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
sometimes they look at speed limit signs

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.020 
sometimes they look at speed limit signs
as<00:00:10.559> suggestions<00:00:11.010> instead<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.519> limits<00:00:11.849> but

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
as suggestions instead of limits but

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.330 
as suggestions instead of limits but
really<00:00:12.269> who<00:00:12.389> hasn't<00:00:12.719> done<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.040> all<00:00:14.040> those

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
really who hasn't done that all those

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.609 
really who hasn't done that all those
hard<00:00:14.670> stops<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.330> quick<00:00:15.690> starts<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.289> kind<00:00:16.590> of

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
hard stops and quick starts do kind of

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.990 
hard stops and quick starts do kind of

aforementioned link dongle runs off a
Bluetooth<00:00:42.329> fairly<00:00:43.200> straightforward<00:00:43.620> stuff

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
Bluetooth fairly straightforward stuff

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.040 
Bluetooth fairly straightforward stuff
here's<00:00:44.280> where<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> punch<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.149> security<00:00:45.899> pin

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
here's where you punch in a security pin

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.510 
here's where you punch in a security pin
that's<00:00:46.289> located<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> back<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> your

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that's located on the back of your

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.950 
that's located on the back of your
dongle<00:00:47.700> now<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> give<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
dongle now I'm not going to give you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.389 
dongle now I'm not going to give you
mine<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.680> mine<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> keep<00:00:50.100> working

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
mine because I want mine to keep working

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.360 
mine because I want mine to keep working
so<00:00:50.640> I've<00:00:50.730> punched<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.239> dummy<00:00:52.219> once<00:00:53.219> we

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so I've punched in a dummy once we

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
so I've punched in a dummy once we
finish<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.239> fun<00:00:54.480> stuff<00:00:54.660> begins<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.469> we

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
finish that the fun stuff begins now we

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.830 
finish that the fun stuff begins now we
have<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.949> find<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> ODB<00:00:56.760> port<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.420> car<00:00:57.629> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
have to find the ODB port in your car so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
have to find the ODB port in your car so
let's<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.109> try<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:59.489> mileage<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.910> going

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
let's go try that your mileage is going

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
let's go try that your mileage is going
to<00:01:00.120> vary<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.530> ODB<00:01:01.980> port<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to vary but I like that my ODB port is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
to vary but I like that my ODB port is
right<00:01:02.399> under<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.210> steering<00:01:03.600> wheel<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
right under my steering wheel in to the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
right under my steering wheel in to the
left<00:01:04.439> right<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.640> I've<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.090> Lincoln

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
left right here so I've got the Lincoln

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
left right here so I've got the Lincoln
dongle<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.710> pop<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.760> you'll

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
dongle just pop it in like so and you'll

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.130 
dongle just pop it in like so and you'll
get<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> beep<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> confirm<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> did<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
get a beep to confirm that you did it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.450 
get a beep to confirm that you did it
right<00:01:10.290> perfect

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
right perfect

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770 
right perfect

you are a lead foot you're probably

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.730 
you are a lead foot you're probably
going<00:01:56.160> to<00:01:56.250> notice<00:01:56.580> this<00:01:57.060> first<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
going to notice this first when you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.550 
going to notice this first when you
start<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.280> over<00:01:59.790> 70<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.960> automatic<00:02:01.470> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
start going over 70 the automatic is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
start going over 70 the automatic is
going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.980> play<00:02:02.340> some<00:02:02.550> audio<00:02:02.670> notifications

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450

to let you know that you probably should

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.010 
to let you know that you probably should
me<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> fast<00:02:05.370> just<00:02:06.330> cross<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.720> 70

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
me go on that fast just cross the 70

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.620 
me go on that fast just cross the 70
barrier<00:02:07.320> let's<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.830> can<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> go

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
barrier let's see if we can get it to go

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.170 
barrier let's see if we can get it to go
there's<00:02:09.630> number<00:02:09.930> one<00:02:09.990> so<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.460> over<00:02:11.670> 70

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
there's number one so you going over 70

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.979 
there's number one so you going over 70
number<00:02:13.750> two<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.730> there's<00:02:16.450> number<00:02:16.720> three<00:02:16.750> and

number two and there's number three and

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.479 
number two and there's number three and
that<00:02:17.019> is<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.319> last<00:02:17.650> notification<00:02:18.370> you're

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
there we go that's the acceleration on

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.960 
there we go that's the acceleration on
notification<00:02:48.069> now<00:02:48.220> we're<00:02:48.640> going<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.819> see<00:02:48.910> if

spent at the pump this past week now all
of<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:31.810> gets<00:03:32.049> boiled<00:03:32.410> down<00:03:32.530> into<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> weekly

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
of that gets boiled down into a weekly

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
a nice touch instead of having to track

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.330 
a nice touch instead of having to track
multiple<00:03:37.660> metrics<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.169> get<00:03:38.319> one<00:03:38.709> score<00:03:39.130> so

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
multiple metrics you get one score so

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.589 
multiple metrics you get one score so
you<00:03:39.400> can<00:03:39.549> more<00:03:39.700> easily<00:03:39.880> track<00:03:40.569> your
