thing<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> adjust<00:00:30.390> those<00:00:30.660> down

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.729 
thing to do we want to adjust those down
so<00:00:31.859> grabs<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.880> bit<00:00:33.030> take<00:00:33.270> its<00:00:34.110> name<00:00:34.290> will<00:00:34.649> be

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so grabs a bit take its name will be

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.610 
so grabs a bit take its name will be

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the other one as well I'm just going to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
the other one as well I'm just going to
do<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.500> they<00:00:43.710> move<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> tape<00:00:44.219> right

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
do one at time they move the tape right
and<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:45.989> down<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.829> end

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and then you got go down to this end

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.049 
and then you got go down to this end
here<00:00:48.680> but<00:00:49.680> let's<00:00:49.950> believe<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:50.879> bit

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
here but let's believe this little bit

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.060 
here but let's believe this little bit
here<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.930> cover<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.120> need<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> push<00:00:54.660> up

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
here is cover so you need to push up

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
here is cover so you need to push up
from<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.270> go

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
from here we go

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.950 
from here we go
the<00:00:58.320> bottom<00:01:00.379> which<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:02.070> tricky<00:01:02.960> do

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the bottom which is a really tricky do

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.070 
the bottom which is a really tricky do
you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:05.240> that<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.750> easy

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
you know what that is going to be easy

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.179 
you know what that is going to be easy
on<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.290> side<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> bonnet<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:10.159> shut<00:01:11.159> up

itself<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.709> now<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.160> just<00:03:49.220> pulls<00:03:59.170> right<00:04:01.060> okay

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
itself and now it just pulls right okay

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.400 
itself and now it just pulls right okay
so<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.810> can<00:04:02.989> see<00:04:03.200> you've<00:04:04.010> got<00:04:04.099> the<00:04:04.340> splines

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
so you can see you've got the splines

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.640 
so you can see you've got the splines
and<00:04:06.410> afraid<00:04:06.859> and<00:04:07.819> inside<00:04:08.239> there<00:04:08.530> it's<00:04:09.530> going

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650

and afraid and inside there it's going
to<00:04:09.709> be<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.950> spline<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.489> I'm<00:04:10.760> going<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:10.970> spray

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
to be the spline so I'm going to spray

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.599 
to be the spline so I'm going to spray
now<00:04:11.480> give<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.840> clean<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:13.280> then<00:04:13.400> when<00:04:13.519> you
