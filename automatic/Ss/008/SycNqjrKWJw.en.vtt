00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.309
 take this topic back 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.730
 presentation of the new opel corsa 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.719
 fifth generation and there is one 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.090
 sees a model the first 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.280
 generation makes it a model that dates back to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.370
 1990 it still allows to see 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.000
 really the evolution compared to 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.050
 especially in terms of dimensions 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.330
 that's a lot a lot a lot 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.330
 shorter nothing to see 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.440
 this fund is also significantly more 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:43.840
 beefy we go for example with the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:50.470
 stuffed doors while here 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.850
 slap a calming effect at the level of 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.480
 wheels 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:05.130
 if we believe that 165 165 on 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:10.500
 rims in 14 while the cdu 17 and the 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:12.340
 215 he still goes the rims alu here 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.960
 when it was still rather 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.960
 sheet metal rims with hubcaps 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.110
 then the chest 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.340
 which is my faith big enough by cons it 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.500
 is not protected at all by the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.460
 flatteries nova bus any case among 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.270
 wheel arches are not at all 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.270
 hidden by felts in 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.130
 still black is not doing it either a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.490
 very very dull noise you'll be available 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.600
 in 3 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.720
 and five doors of you even this logo 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.630
 turbo sasac laquerre are some 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.920
 years now it has become common 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:02.500
 all vehicles are almost 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.500
 team is obviously the kof 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.340
 with now this double system 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.060
 floor saves a few 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.060
 cubic decimetres
