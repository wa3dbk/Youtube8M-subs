now<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.840> ton<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.349> people<00:00:13.650> including<00:00:13.799> myself

completely<00:00:14.639> blew<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.599> proportion

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
completely blew this out of proportion

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.380 
completely blew this out of proportion
in<00:00:16.410> many<00:00:16.710> ways<00:00:16.949> by<00:00:17.580> saying<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.090> know<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
in many ways by saying you know it's a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.910 
in many ways by saying you know it's a
way<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.539> get<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.869> another<00:00:19.050> map<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.560> know<00:00:19.680> just

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
way to get to another map you know just

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.439 
way to get to another map you know just
all<00:00:20.070> theories<00:00:20.490> all<00:00:20.670> good<00:00:20.850> ideas<00:00:21.210> all

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

all theories all good ideas all
something<00:00:21.750> fun<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.080> play<00:00:22.230> around<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.710> really

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
something fun to play around with really

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.310 
something fun to play around with really
but<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.939> terms<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:24.960> has<00:00:25.109> been

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
but in terms this is what has been

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.109 
but in terms this is what has been
identified<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.369> escape<00:00:26.670> pod<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
identified as the escape pod the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.200 
identified as the escape pod the
starting<00:00:27.539> elevator<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.680> go<00:00:29.460> into<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
starting elevator that you go into and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.820 
starting elevator that you go into and
what<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:30.929> obviously<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.710> what

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
what you know obviously you know what

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.290 
what you know obviously you know what
this<00:00:31.920> does<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.520> takes<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> down<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
this does it just takes you down to the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.760 
this does it just takes you down to the
room<00:00:33.480> there's<00:00:33.780> only<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.140> ways<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.469> go

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
room there's only two ways you can go

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
room there's only two ways you can go
either<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> first<00:00:36.270> door<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.780> into<00:00:37.230> this

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
either out the first door or into this

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.740 
either out the first door or into this
escape<00:00:37.890> pod<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.610> that's<00:00:38.940> basically<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
escape pod so that's basically what is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.660 
escape pod so that's basically what is
it's<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.739> special<00:00:41.190> thing<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> get

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
it's not some special thing to get

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.910 
it's not some special thing to get
outside<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> map<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> new<00:00:43.290> map<00:00:43.530> or

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
outside the map or get to a new map or

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.610 
outside the map or get to a new map or
you<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> any<00:00:45.390> sort<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.809> duress<00:00:46.289> or

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you know get to any sort of duress or

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.709 
you know get to any sort of duress or
whatever<00:00:46.980> any<00:00:47.340> ideas<00:00:47.820> anyone<00:00:48.059> came<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.539> with

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
whatever any ideas anyone came up with

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
whatever any ideas anyone came up with
it's<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.649> simply<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> elevator<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it's just simply the elevator just a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
it's just simply the elevator just a
fancy<00:00:51.329> name<00:00:51.510> people<00:00:51.930> gave<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.949> guess

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
fancy name people gave for it or I guess

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.580 
fancy name people gave for it or I guess
you<00:00:53.309> could<00:00:53.370> say<00:00:53.610> trailer<00:00:53.879> called<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.539> mean<00:00:55.140> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you could say trailer called it I mean I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.200 
you could say trailer called it I mean I
guess<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.039> could<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.309> only<00:00:56.460> expected<00:00:57.059> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
guess you could have only expected this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.510 
guess you could have only expected this
the<00:00:57.570> called<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.199> skate<00:00:58.500> pad<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.949> our<00:00:59.309> escape

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the called a skate pad for our escape

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
the called a skate pad for our escape
pod<00:00:59.850> sorry<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.750> people<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.079> blow<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.469> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
pod sorry for people to blow it out of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.529 
pod sorry for people to blow it out of
proportion<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.190> yep<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.579> solved<00:01:03.120> it's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
proportion but yep it is solved it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
proportion but yep it is solved it's
just<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> fix<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.439> zombies<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> two

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
just to fix it so zombies in the two

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
just to fix it so zombies in the two
plus<00:01:05.519> player<00:01:05.760> game<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.210> can't<00:01:06.450> spawn<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
plus player game they can't spawn in the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.740 
plus player game they can't spawn in the
escape<00:01:07.500> pod<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.979> screw<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> over<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.060> stuff

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
escape pod and screw you over and stuff

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
escape pod and screw you over and stuff
like<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.680> basically<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
like that so that's basically what the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.130 
like that so that's basically what the
patch<00:01:11.729> notes<00:01:11.760> said<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.630> wasn't<00:01:12.960> anything

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
patch notes said it wasn't anything

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
patch notes said it wasn't anything
special<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.979> want<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> clear<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
I guess we could say we solved what the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.740 
I guess we could say we solved what the
escape<00:01:17.130> pod<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.909> anyway<00:01:18.540> guys<00:01:18.689> that's

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
escape pod really is anyway guys that's

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.330 
escape pod really is anyway guys that's
been<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.590> video<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.009> could<00:01:20.220> get
