00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.759
 account but you should see the dt claude turns where you have serious videos 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.799
 and some for me are 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.740
 in addition to that the ramstein armed potas marked him his videos with 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.140

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.279
 video 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.279
 let us begin 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.980
 hello explained 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.520
 welcome to the plate 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.230
 hello balmelli then here wanting Spanish in the channel of 2 or 0 8 the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.420
 most classic question of all how are you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.410
 Well, it's about time I interviewed, it's because death metal angel has not yet 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.220
 Send the prizes first place is very fucking 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.410
 the first question that overwhelms you as it was so you started on it and what 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.290
 story 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.850
 how is it that you suddenly started in this office ad honorem xd 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.040
 I had an account before they closed me that I only used to score 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.090
 you will subscribe and see so much asshole believing everything a plus for 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.520
 throwing bullshit shit that children from 8 years old listen to down like 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.990
 would be the metal corferias corín govern 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.090
 It made me want to fight assholes with that and pass myself off as a spokesperson for 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 those who criticize so much only to receive insults and assholes that are made 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.119
 the euro and what 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.259
 wales by copying five paragraphs of wikipedia as you can see in my 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.450
 videos of the best and the worst bands also in which he spoke pure 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.790
 blowjobs of metal and clear in my second criticism nirvana 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.010
 there is demonstrated what he experienced these are some of them, although the title 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.230
 little word criticize something that they like I do not understand because they see it they justify with 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.930
 nine who believe it is constructive criticism but when in the title 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.910
 says something like criticism to the shit wrapped in sheets obviously not 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.720
 it will be a constructive criticism but there they go from massó home to see the video and 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.010
 end with a vaginal burning and the big hahaha 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.840
 question number two will be what it is that inspires you did not inspire you 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.259
 to do this 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.859
 It's hard to say but Uncle Tantrism object is like a god hahaha 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:18.189
 the worst what you intend to your trial on youtube there are bad what whole and for 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.150
 everywhere 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.509
 for you which is pop who would be 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:25.759
 because the neutrals do not bother me much because as I told him so the fed left 19 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:30.779
 once all of us ever were better faxing the worst what dogs are the ones that 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.889
 have been in this for a while and continue to behave like everyone likes me 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.769
 just like the general turn and all that kind of assholes who think they can 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.829
 change the world by making videos on the internet instead of taking this as a 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.839
 pastime that ball of assholes who want to impose their ideas on 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:50.319
 others and who think that if you agree with what they say is that 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.659
 you're retarded that kind of assholes I feel sorry for that is that I enjoy 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.119
 doing the shit 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:03:00.919
 it is true those moments of the thinking army only serve to burst of 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.090
 Spain to the server 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.950
 since we argue that none of these pathologies would dare to give 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.590
 punch 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.680
 or a slammer in the face a reggaeton telmo phuket or whoever 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.589
 and there in some videos to put mega man songs so that 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:16.389
 I ask you 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.519
 which are series animals or favorite cartoons 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.090
 well you will see x-men I am not very given to the trifle in fact I think the only ones 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.370
 that I have seen are the knights of the armpit and shit zeta goal so according to 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.419
 the law of the almighty suzhou shit I do not know what the hell did not qualify to be 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.689
 jq face bining the eye 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.639
 but when I was a child there in the nineties I liked series like 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.309
 animated series of exams which came out after exams flip 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.669
 also what was the league of justice and batman and of course my 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.449
 superhero favorite of childhood the spectacular spiderman 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.119
 he also likes the comics of defour and of course the movies and comics 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:57.029
 of the raven especially the film made in memory of brandon reads that in 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.319
 peace, rest 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.169
 as for series I like series like 24 prison brick duran has claimed 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.680
 doctor jara bush 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.420
 and one that looked like being a kid called is that it was from a hospital and 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.309
 doctors and all that work 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:14.449
 of course many of us grew up with some good marvel hero 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.030
 changing the subject as many of us are habits 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.790
 inveterate to metal you could tell me what your favorite bands are 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:27.639
 I like very much vital remains the director you go persia starbucks saratoga 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.840
 immortal megadeth special metallica 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.040
 sodano bancard 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.039
 lucas country 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.280
 gil engine panther of the chosen press the fat manns dyn 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.880
 avalanche a lot of bands more than if I continue in this interview not 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.240
 it would never end hahaha clarified and that the maximum exponent of metal live as 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.559
 it is more distracted hahahahaha 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:48.640
 we are already standing 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.700
 the 2011 and with all this you think that the story is a fashion or just a 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.840
 hobby 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.040
 it's just a hobby, a way to entertain yourself in free time 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.180
 has one and in my case fuck assholes who take this as a serious business 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.160
 some take it as a means to express their opinions about something 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.440
 some contacts mostly 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.559
 use this to try to be funny I just want to have fun 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:16.469
 I think that because of the last video, I spent a little bit and one last 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:19.169
 thing that has us worried 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.380
 many of those we met a few months ago, nothing more 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.030
 because he believes that that supposes stutes mocsai míster spaghetti 96 left you 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.819
 tube 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.419
 the box will most likely have achieved capita social life showing 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.139
 penalty on the mister exposer 96 is more than obvious that the kid could not stand 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.440
 that they fucked and humiliated as did the user pru metallero I think 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.229
 Maybe it will come back to the tube but it will take longer to return than to start the 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.919
 better for everyone to know that it is him and end up throwing it again 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:49.879
 Hahaha 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.939
 could you say something to everyone who is watching this video 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.199
 melissa sons I love you so much you are my life for you is that I make these videos
