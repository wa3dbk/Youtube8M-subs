Milan GA my friend I met him and

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.450 
Milan GA my friend I met him and
definitely<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:44.540> discussed<00:05:45.260> the<00:05:45.560> point<00:05:45.920> I<00:05:46.160> made

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
definitely I discussed the point I made

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.100 
definitely I discussed the point I made
them<00:05:46.700> that<00:05:47.480> how<00:05:48.020> we<00:05:48.770> should<00:05:49.040> graduate<00:05:50.110> from

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
them that how we should graduate from

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.340 
them that how we should graduate from
the<00:05:51.670> energy<00:05:52.670> security<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.870> energy

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
the energy security to energy

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.830 
the energy security to energy
independence<00:05:54.670> this<00:05:55.670> is<00:05:55.760> going<00:05:55.970> to<00:05:56.060> help<00:05:56.180> this

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
independence this is going to help this

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.280 
independence this is going to help this
nuclear<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:58.160> energy<00:05:58.970> waiver<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.630> the

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
nuclear the energy waiver and the

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.070 
nuclear the energy waiver and the
nuclear<00:06:00.710> pact<00:06:01.130> is<00:06:01.700> going<00:06:02.090> to<00:06:02.180> help<00:06:02.390> us<00:06:02.630> to

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
nuclear pact is going to help us to

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.540 
nuclear pact is going to help us to
graduate<00:06:03.890> from<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:05.140> Nuclear<00:06:06.140> Security<00:06:06.590> to

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
graduate from the Nuclear Security to

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.220 
graduate from the Nuclear Security to
nuclear<00:06:08.060> independence<00:06:08.690> you<00:06:08.810> know<00:06:08.840> what<00:06:09.110> it

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
nuclear independence you know what it

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.680 
nuclear independence you know what it
means<00:06:09.470> so<00:06:09.620> how<00:06:10.160> will<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:10.850> help<00:06:11.000> us<00:06:11.180> graduate

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
means so how will it help us graduate

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.770 
means so how will it help us graduate
because<00:06:12.050> nuclear<00:06:12.670> independence<00:06:13.670> or<00:06:13.940> energy

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
because nuclear independence or energy

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.810 
because nuclear independence or energy
independence<00:06:15.380> will<00:06:15.530> come<00:06:15.770> when<00:06:16.310> we<00:06:16.460> can<00:06:16.610> draw

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
independence will come when we can draw

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.790 
independence will come when we can draw
energy<00:06:17.030> from<00:06:17.300> our<00:06:17.660> own<00:06:17.840> borders<00:06:18.320> right<00:06:18.560> now

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
energy from our own borders right now

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.950 
energy from our own borders right now
with<00:06:19.280> this<00:06:19.460> pact<00:06:19.790> as<00:06:20.030> you<00:06:20.390> rightly<00:06:20.630> said

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
with this pact as you rightly said

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.260 
with this pact as you rightly said
earlier<00:06:21.260> we<00:06:21.650> can<00:06:21.800> import<00:06:22.190> uranium<00:06:22.730> if<00:06:22.850> you<00:06:23.210> are

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
earlier we can import uranium if you are

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.450 
earlier we can import uranium if you are
dependent<00:06:23.690> on<00:06:23.810> imports<00:06:24.320> how<00:06:24.920> does<00:06:25.130> it<00:06:25.250> help

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
dependent on imports how does it help

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.300 
dependent on imports how does it help
energy<00:06:26.120> independence<00:06:26.720> no<00:06:26.960> uranium<00:06:27.770> we<00:06:28.070> have

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
energy independence no uranium we have

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.030 
energy independence no uranium we have
certain<00:06:29.120> already<00:06:29.900> ate<00:06:29.990> only<00:06:30.200> certain<00:06:30.680> reserve

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
certain already ate only certain reserve

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.190 
certain already ate only certain reserve
and<00:06:31.720> this<00:06:32.720> will<00:06:33.020> be<00:06:33.230> this<00:06:34.010> will<00:06:34.070> be<00:06:34.550> the<00:06:35.200> power

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
and this will be this will be the power

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.610 
and this will be this will be the power

our nuclear reactors all the future
nuclear<00:06:39.800> reactors<00:06:40.400> also<00:06:40.640> but<00:06:41.570> I<00:06:41.600> am<00:06:42.020> pushing

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
nuclear reactors also but I am pushing

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.580 
nuclear reactors also but I am pushing
our<00:06:43.580> nuclear<00:06:44.030> scientists<00:06:44.690> are<00:06:44.810> working<00:06:45.560> very

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
our nuclear scientists are working very

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.340 
our nuclear scientists are working very
hard<00:06:45.920> and<00:06:46.370> thorium-based<00:06:47.150> nuclear<00:06:47.350> reactors

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
hard and thorium-based nuclear reactors

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.400 
hard and thorium-based nuclear reactors
even<00:06:48.920> then<00:06:49.100> we<00:06:49.280> need<00:06:49.460> some<00:06:49.700> some<00:06:50.360> uranium<00:06:50.600> even

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
even then we need some some uranium even

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.500 
even then we need some some uranium even
then<00:06:51.650> even<00:06:52.310> thoroughly<00:06:52.850> base<00:06:53.060> nuclear

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
then even thoroughly base nuclear

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.170 
then even thoroughly base nuclear
reactors<00:06:53.990> that<00:06:54.590> uranium<00:06:55.070> what<00:06:55.520> we<00:06:55.700> have<00:06:55.940> it

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
reactors that uranium what we have it

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.240 
reactors that uranium what we have it
become<00:06:56.720> a<00:06:56.750> result<00:06:57.290> till<00:06:57.500> then<00:06:57.710> we<00:06:57.830> have<00:06:57.920> to<00:06:58.040> buy

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
become a result till then we have to buy

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.270 
become a result till then we have to buy
so<00:06:59.180> normally<00:06:59.660> presidents<00:07:00.350> and<00:07:00.440> ex-presidents

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
so normally presidents and ex-presidents

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.630 
so normally presidents and ex-presidents
are<00:07:01.790> a<00:07:02.360> political<00:07:02.990> people<00:07:03.550> when<00:07:04.550> you

are a political people when you

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.330 
are a political people when you
