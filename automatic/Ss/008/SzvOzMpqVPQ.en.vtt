00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 I believe that if civilization has already left 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.900
 beyond your planet or even 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:15.269
 has its own solar system 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.670
 tremendous moral power and she 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 has the ability to interact with 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.949
 other civilizations and common 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 moral general arrangements and of course 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.789
 no 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.210
 in it safely and from our point 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.550
 civilization who solved the problem with 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.420
 economy with its moral society 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.829
 your warrior you they long forgotten and maybe 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.750
 be and there was no meek 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.700
 now if we talk about this 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.010
 state of society and speaking of 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.289
 relationship of our society with those 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.660
 whom we call here alien 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.329
 civilizations are the biggest threat 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.510
 comes of course not from alien 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.000
 no civilizations aliens from us 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.949
 the strength of the imperfections of our society and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.619
 moral excellence and lack 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.950
 a serious culture system that would 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.229
 was given a man and education of course 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.640
 very young developing civilization 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.100
 by cosmic standards i think thats 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.259
 observes us and does not interfere especially 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.689
 here they are wondering how he goes 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.570
 its development in its own way 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.220
 therefore no intervention possible 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.590
 intervening well then probably when 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.230
 here are some critical things to eat here 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 on earth but now overall i think that 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.400
 the earth is not coping with global 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.820
 disasters that's the main catastrophes 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.820
 actually she's here in our head 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.810
 apocalypse something that man-made 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.150
 here are things ahead of the spiritual state of 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.240
 and human development is too little 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.970
 humanitarian is given in school institutes 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.760
 as a major you grew I would attribute to 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.820
 the first is climate change on 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.540
 the planet is going very actively I would 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.500
 said well, almost exponentially, ice melts 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.020
 in greenland the ice is melting and in antarctica 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.940
 antarctica appeared first appeared 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.140
 here during the observation appeared 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.790
 a colony of crabs over a million crabs this 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.650
 It suggests that there is a sharp 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.260
 warming that leading 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.939
 redistribution of pressure on 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.180
 soil bottom of the world ocean and 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.549
 Consequently 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.250
 tectonic layers which are so 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.530
 movement may receive additional 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.329
 pulse 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.549
 what impulse will the starters get? 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.319
 the consequences can only assume i 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.620
 would say that this is possible 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.500
 saw a tsunami to intensify commercial 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.230
 earthquake activity so far 2 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.420
 the threat is lack of drinking water she 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.790
 there is water in the world today 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.480
 expensive 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:11.400
 if i import that and i think wrestling 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.659
 for sources already started here and there will be 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.970
 continue on the third threat this 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:21.000
 meteoric and meteoric danger but I 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.230
 I think after the recent events and scientists 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.079
 here are the rulers 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.120
 different countries will sit round the table and 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.650
 will discuss this problem is we 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.650
 here just find a solution
