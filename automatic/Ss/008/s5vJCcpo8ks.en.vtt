00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
like this and this angle it will still

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.930 
like this and this angle it will still
be<00:00:59.820> capable<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.859> using<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> webcam<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.760> to

capacitive<00:01:48.990> multi-touch<00:01:49.770> screen<00:01:50.430> let's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
capacitive multi-touch screen let's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
capacitive multi-touch screen let's
check<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
check this because I think this is a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.250 
check this because I think this is a
very<00:01:52.979> accurate<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.729> screen

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
very accurate as screen

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.850 
very accurate as screen
start<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:57.170> talking<00:01:58.170> about<00:01:58.260> accurate

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
start of you I talking about accurate

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.860 
start of you I talking about accurate
screen<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.340> all<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> can't<00:01:59.910> even<00:02:00.360> hit<00:02:00.510> anything

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
screen and all I can't even hit anything

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.370 
screen and all I can't even hit anything
here<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:02.370> just<00:02:02.580> needs<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.210> D<00:02:03.630> calibrated

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
here it just needs to get D calibrated

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.630 
here it just needs to get D calibrated
oh<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.500> called<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> accelerometer

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
oh this is called the accelerometer

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.380 
oh this is called the accelerometer
cards<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:10.110> pretty<00:02:10.350> quick<00:02:12.110> not<00:02:13.110> too<00:02:13.290> bad

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
cards and it's pretty quick not too bad

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.700 
cards and it's pretty quick not too bad
okay<00:02:15.390> let<00:02:15.570> me<00:02:15.600> show<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.530> really

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
okay let me show you that this is really

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.600 
okay let me show you that this is really
a<00:02:16.920> multi-touch<00:02:17.550> screen<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:19.610> definitely

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
a multi-touch screen and definitely
