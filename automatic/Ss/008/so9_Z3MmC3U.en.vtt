00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.620
 youtube welcome about people from 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.840
 world clash of land situation let's 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.220
 see attacks of the critical series my 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.130
 attacks but good this time not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.740
 they are going to be children but they are going to be the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.350
 dark sang good now is in this 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.480
 Clan I hope you can do what comes to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.180
 be and then nothing and subsequently in a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.930
 next video maybe we will see for 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.700
 stop it 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.220
 for which he was invited practically 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.590
 here then taking advantage of this we are going to 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.079
 these two attacks of the dark hero and by 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.660
 good you are going to say in 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.540
 comments to rate from 1 to 5 as 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.490
 we have always done it and it was the 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.580
 final grade that you are going to 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.710
 give these attacks that I really 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.380
 I saw pretty good enough 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.350
 It is worth mentioning that this is a clan 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.750
 and quite pretty strong that really 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.850
 the wars so they take it very 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.300
 Seriously and it's pretty good because 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.100
 here you know you're going to attack or not elderly 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.340
 idiot you have to know how to attack for 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 be able to be here because otherwise 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 well you have nothing to do for these 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 directions realize a pretty attack 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.550
 peculiar because it comes through practically 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.740
 all the flanks little by little goes 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.380
 destroying defenses that are 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.090
 on the sides by the center for all 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.299
 sides that can find it and good 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.490
 he quickly cleans the defenses and 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.530
 that what remains in buildings itself 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.470
 that we will be able to destroy easily 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.850
 with the same balloons that you have and 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.970
 end of accounts with the toilets that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.909
 come out there are you do not carry 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.890
 Donkeys do not want new troops 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.340
 reinforcement extras but simply 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.310
 lava hounds and soccer globes see 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.780
 nothing more and one and the spells there is no 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.580
 practically nothing more 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.650
 these are city councils 9 attacking 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.610
 city ​​councils 9 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.380
 so that's how easy to say that if not 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.039
 has the difficulty of the towers 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.739
 hell but good 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.239
 I do not know I do not know from my point of view I 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.909
 I really saw it quite peculiar 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.579
 pretty good in the type of attack the 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:21.000
 only problem is that for example in 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:24.209
 these attacks as well as in this case what 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.980
 ideal would be that you destroy the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.659
 machine guns made more lava 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.959
 for example like this because if 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.970
 They do enough and can go destroy you 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.040
 a little bit faster the village while 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.959
 that if the hounds are the hounds 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.519
 of the hole I think I do not know if they have the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.530
 attack or a little less I'm not 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.599
 sure you find them a bit more 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.459
 slow health destroyed that would be a 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.049
 while if they were in this case they go 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.700
 like two or three two I think so much of 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.799
 videos in which if they were all those 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.200
 small fields of his in pretty fast 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.930
 things are among so many have 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.549
 quite attack in all together but 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.889
 well here was not the case 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.889
 I think he ravaged this building of these 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:04.889
 three buildings are left and right are 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.290
 100% more than more than sure and quite 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.840
 quite well really won the attack 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.730
 remember in comments decide how much you 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040
 they put this first attack and well we go and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.230
 quickly to see the second attack 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.939
 and later you also note 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.200
 put it in the description of the video what 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.180
 it was what failed what it was that made 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.280
 well or what did everyone do wrong and good 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.439
 gives its conclusions that at the end of 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.260
 accounts are what I always always 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.760
 I read and I think that in a next episode 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.640
 let's take the comments more 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.049
 important are those who see more 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.640
 peculiar we're going to try to put it 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.290
 always at the end of each of these 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.659
 videos let's say the comments of the video 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.420
 earlier then they realize that 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.579
 loose by a simple zone 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.040
 sorry for one of by a loose corner 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.389
 a lava hound is playing a 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.120
 little bit with the balloons taking out the 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:55.349
 castle seems to me because this castle 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.939
 if it is a little bit complicated 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.459
 for so much truth they are just archers 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:04.189
 sorry are a witch that what is nothing 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.189
 more and a few magicians answer accounts 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.710
 what matters most to kill would be the witch 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.390
 that does not generate skeletons 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.760
 later at the time of throwing your 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.659
 your heroes 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.419
 this then it would have to be fine 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.609
 destroys what would be the troops of the 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.580
 castle and good enough pretty 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.560
 interesting this already in a next me 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.080
 I think we're going to see something pretty 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.400
 interesting I think that everyone is going to 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.889
 like but good let's concentrate on 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.410
 this with her cleaning the castle and 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.760
 cleaning an area of ​​antiaircraft and that 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.919
 he would have three antiaircraft per 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.100
 destroy if they realize already practically 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.550
 I'm going to destroy and destroyed one right now 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.190
 this is not just destroy the second not 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.080
 I know if he is named by another hound below 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.600
 more balloons that are studying the 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.910
 defenses very well 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.460
 really have to know how to do the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.710
 attacks because let's be realistic you look 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.010
 easy enough I look at it easy enough 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.400
 but do it or see it and take it to 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.800
 out and do it yes yes you have to know 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.330
 do these types of attacks I do not know 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.650
 really you who think are already given 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.270
 realize that there is practically only one 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.400
 defense two defenses of all countries 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.050
 you're more in the archery queen than 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.930
 I would be bothering but good the lava 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.510
 for really in a matter of nothing they kill 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.310
 what would be which any defense or 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.020
 any building that is out there 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.030
 fences are pretty fast enough 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.800
 you can upload everything and it really is 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.260
 quite interesting this guy 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.290
 of attacks I do not know I will try to 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.240
 practice it and for good if he managed to master 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.920
 ok the technique possibly in the channel 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.260
 they will be seeing some kind of 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.880
 strategy of how to go using more than 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.960
 all these kinds of attacks in war that 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.640
 it would be basically balloons and hounds nothing 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.930
 more is quite interesting enough 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.060
 the truth I will try to use it in 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.460
 the next war we do in phoenix 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.800
 top so let's see what if such 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.970
 we are going into an upcoming war let's see 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.930
 how 100% good then nothing arrived 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.210
