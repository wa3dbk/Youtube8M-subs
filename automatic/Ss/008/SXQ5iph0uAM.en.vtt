00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
variations we do kind of one of the big

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.350 
variations we do kind of one of the big
things<00:00:28.160> is<00:00:28.310> we<00:00:28.460> were<00:00:28.550> actually<00:00:28.939> you<00:00:29.180> know<00:00:29.270> I've

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
things is we were actually you know I've

just basically a bunch of different

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.500 
just basically a bunch of different
movements<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:37.489> help<00:00:37.699> kind<00:00:37.969> of<00:00:38.090> make<00:00:38.210> them<00:00:38.329> more

difference<00:01:57.409> with<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.920> grip<00:01:58.130> force<00:01:58.399> that

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
difference with the grip force that

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.819 
difference with the grip force that
makes<00:01:58.909> them<00:01:59.180> better<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.109> work<00:02:00.320> in<00:02:00.530> certain

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
makes them better and work in certain

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.609 
makes them better and work in certain
situations<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.759> lot<00:02:01.909> more<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:02.420> these<00:02:03.350> do<00:02:03.590> not

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
situations a lot more is these do not

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.510 
situations a lot more is these do not
stay<00:02:04.219> on<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:05.780> actually<00:02:05.960> have<00:02:06.469> to<00:02:06.740> force<00:02:07.219> and

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
stay on you actually have to force and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.940 
stay on you actually have to force and
work<00:02:08.119> your<00:02:08.360> hand<00:02:08.570> by<00:02:08.780> closing<00:02:09.140> them<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:09.860> you

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
work your hand by closing them so you

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.500 
work your hand by closing them so you
have<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.190> apply<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.640> extra<00:02:10.970> pressure<00:02:11.150> and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
have to apply that extra pressure and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.720 
have to apply that extra pressure and
work<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.260> develop<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:12.800> extra<00:02:13.190> strength<00:02:13.490> of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
work and develop that extra strength of

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.940 
work and develop that extra strength of
the<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.880> crush<00:02:14.390> grip<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:15.320> make<00:02:15.560> sure<00:02:15.770> that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the the crush grip to make sure that

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.550 
the the crush grip to make sure that
they<00:02:16.160> stay<00:02:16.460> on<00:02:16.490> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
they stay on the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.470 
they stay on the
equipment<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.190> put<00:02:18.370> them<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.700> both<00:02:19.060> types<00:02:19.300> of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
equipment you put them on both types of

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.410 
equipment you put them on both types of
these<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:19.930> really<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.380> used<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:21.010> any<00:02:21.489> piece<00:02:22.390> of

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
these can really be used on any piece of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.280 
these can really be used on any piece of
equipment<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.140> gym<00:02:23.940> when<00:02:24.940> we<00:02:25.270> use<00:02:25.569> fat

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
equipment in the gym when we use fat

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.710 
equipment in the gym when we use fat
gripz<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.950> use<00:02:27.130> them<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.400> lot<00:02:27.550> for<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.480> things

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
gripz we use them a lot for for things

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.720 
gripz we use them a lot for for things
like<00:02:28.840> rose<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.450> know<00:02:31.569> rose<00:02:31.810> pull-ups

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
like rose and you know rose pull-ups

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.920 
like rose and you know rose pull-ups
just<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.790> lot<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.330> lot<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.540> our<00:02:34.690> pulling

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
just a lot of a lot of our pulling

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.589 
just a lot of a lot of our pulling
motions<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:35.650> use<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> lot<00:02:36.160> use<00:02:37.000> more<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.360> fat

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
motions we use a lot use more of the fat

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.070 
motions we use a lot use more of the fat
gripz

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
gripz

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.410 
gripz
for<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> lot<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:38.980> our<00:02:39.099> presses<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.030> pushing

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
for a lot of our presses and pushing

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.180 
for a lot of our presses and pushing
movements<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.739> use<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.860> lot<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
movements we like to use a lot of the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.920 
movements we like to use a lot of the
grip<00:02:42.400> force<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.209> forces<00:02:43.480> them<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.720> do

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
grip force because it forces them to do

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.170 
grip force because it forces them to do
that<00:02:44.080> extra<00:02:44.380> work<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.890> stay<00:02:45.700> tight<00:02:45.940> and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
that extra work and stay tight and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.630 
that extra work and stay tight and
squeeze<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.660> entire<00:02:46.959> time<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:48.280> thing<00:02:48.489> that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
squeeze the entire time one thing that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.729 
squeeze the entire time one thing that
we've<00:02:48.730> kind<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.090> noticed<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.780> when<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.410> use<00:02:50.590> the

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
we've kind of noticed is when we use the

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.309 
we've kind of noticed is when we use the
grip<00:02:50.980> force<00:02:51.310> for<00:02:52.030> things<00:02:52.390> like<00:02:52.480> rose<00:02:52.930> bent

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
grip force for things like rose bent

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.850 
grip force for things like rose bent
over<00:02:53.410> rows<00:02:54.299> blaster<00:02:55.299> afros<00:02:55.630> pull-ups<00:02:56.140> the

over rows blaster afros pull-ups the
thing<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.310> really<00:02:57.519> seems<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:57.970> fatigue<00:02:58.390> the

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
thing that really seems to fatigue the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.259 
thing that really seems to fatigue the
firt<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.230> fastest<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.519> grip<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.120> that

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
firt the fastest is the grip and that

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.979 
firt the fastest is the grip and that
unfortunately<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:02.260> know<00:03:02.380> doesn't<00:03:03.340> allow

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
unfortunately you know doesn't allow

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.509 
unfortunately you know doesn't allow
them<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.290> maximal<00:03:05.860> work<00:03:06.040> on<00:03:06.220> their<00:03:06.340> back

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
if I only had one pair to really choose

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.270 
if I only had one pair to really choose
I<00:03:58.660> would<00:03:58.959> actually<00:03:59.109> choose<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.769> grip<00:03:59.980> force

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
I would actually choose the grip force

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.640 
I would actually choose the grip force
just<00:04:00.940> because<00:04:01.329> they<00:04:01.510> worked<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.200> much<00:04:02.380> better

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
just because they worked so much better

on<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.549> pressing<00:04:04.060> movements<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.690> they<00:04:05.170> can

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
on the pressing movements and they can

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.270 
on the pressing movements and they can
be<00:04:05.650> set<00:04:05.950> up<00:04:05.980> for<00:04:06.760> rowing<00:04:07.120> motions<00:04:07.799> with<00:04:08.799> a<00:04:08.829> with
