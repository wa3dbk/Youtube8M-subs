00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.090
 tension good morning, andromon 2 months correspond to eye spending 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.419
 feel about it 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.099
 it is said that milk 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.329
 in short it does its duty and also our 10 lire when the conditions 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.789
 climatic conditions are optimal now we all know we have passed 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 for it was not good 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.099
 a very hot summer 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.359
 penta emilia. climate influenced this on crop 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.950
 dream of this year we win 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.470
 hahaha let's say right away a reactive thing they process on all the planets are 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.890
 therefore used to working even in extreme climatic conditions 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.300
 this year a special year but because the whole earth and wings are hurting 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.030
 they are a testimony 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.810
 you are beautiful the state of health of a territory and environment in which we live 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.560
 this year if I find anyway they are good for luck if not for the heat but for 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.190
 others 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.980
 environmental pollution factors environmental pollution the heat that 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.890
 modifies the biological cycles of the blooms. so much on the other 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.800
 of the hive and then anyway a series of problems that are the cigars the truth 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.660
 beehive example of globalization of rowing boats as they are 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.369
 globalized human diseases are becoming club alize year than those of the alps 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.159
 metals us 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.140
 now our consumers go up 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 but perfectly that there are two big families of tvd honey in fact we have them 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.400
 just divided 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.460
 my and my say good fora 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.500
 and wildflower honey 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.590
 of course you have also heard the queen bee from the interview 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.490
 honey 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.080
 millefiori aquerò ah. done 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.540
 it is worthy of pecking, the typical specificity has gone to so many flowers at the flora pier 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.450
 of just one more 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.080
 I wanted to ask for action 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.100
 ken difference there is organoleptic taste but also of agrimonia 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.060
 nutritionally between one and the other 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.149
 hahaha photos meanwhile say something that is the pride of Italian beekeeping 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.219
 hence of our mai stau queen 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.020
 and we are in the condition italy in the same way in which we 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.010
 we organize the breeding of the Alps but for the type of our environment 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.290
 of our agriculture to do. NIERLE 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.860
 Peroni specific flowering that's why Italy is famous in the world 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.210
 for its 30 and more different monoflora the differences are substantially of 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.340
 organoleptic character we can imagine what to say if a little 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.410
 the equivalent of wine today and therefore with the violin exactly one 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.710
 donkey for each culinary combination gastronomic hours uniweb for each 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.600
 culinary gastronomic combination an example for all 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.359
 dark honey with cheeses 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.359
 in Rome it seems that death on 4 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:44.879
 is here we have 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.759
 on an encounter 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:52.349
 exposure cholo of some sun because you would not have been enough 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.220
 all ours 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.379
 banquet exhibitors to put the a 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.369
 very wide range of honey and good flora here we see at the beginning 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.710
 millefiori then we have chestnut acacia honey 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.650
 warranty 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.529
 lemon eucalyptus 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:12.379
 you have some woods to get to organic honey 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.669
 now tv 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:18.579
 cheap boots and fork is between 4 and 6 euros 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.579
 in the biological daniele sl 80 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.289
 in consideration of the fact 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:27.529
 and yours 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:32.799
 authoritative and well-founded premise, namely that of environmental pollution 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.729
 of Czech climatic situations 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.280
 but because one must not be dlvo but because the other is not 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.299
 biological in the sense 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.299
 the flowers that have been touched you 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.319
 ballads are not 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.020
 I'm in first of the others 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.499
 those of the god no cocaine as a yahoo honey is born 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:57.269
 in bio it comes from a European regulation that introduces a series of distinctions from the 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.629
 own point of view of the production regulation 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.970
 and we say that when the visual arts 1 an environment 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.720
 where certain products are not used for the activities 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.850
 agricultural we can distinguish this promotion as organic production 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.260
 but I would like to say that consumers are certainly worth buying god 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.650
 then spend a 10 15% more on a jar of honey 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.940
 but it is certainly worthwhile to continue to buy Italian honey in 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.040
 especially for us who boast of the special excellence quality 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.950
 our savona give to live in general samuela as if more 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:37.599
 by the way 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.909
 here in red cross 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:45.199
 we find the dreams and shelves of supermarkets in specialized shops 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.549
 in short, like herbalism, we find honey just escaping 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.729
 roughly in one big pack the one kilo 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.599
 beautiful for a pound 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.170
 is the 250 gram one 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.550
 how are you going to see again 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.610
 olive prices € 9 per kilo € 5 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.410
 half a kilo 2 80 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.770
 2 50 and how it really is much cheaper to take barter from a 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.310
 kilo 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.509
 from a point of view 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.559
 exclusively economic 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:17.669
 but we have also seen it is full of I want to show that they are wonderful 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.449
 also considered infiorata that I keep lit by the epidemic of very valuable 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.950
 very unique like thistle honey for example 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.520
 you thought photo hello the thorny carbonara arouses wonder so 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.300
 sweet 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.930
 strawberry tree offers and honey 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.889
 is the question is this but how is it that my somewhat so singular 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.010
 are only from pack of 2 50 airing a kilo in the meantime you have 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.640
 perfectly represented that of what the market trend of war 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.500
 of Milan in recent years in Italian say in Europe in the world - function 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.770
 we say that we also put the beekeepers in the euro lira pass 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.030
 you consumers in general accept and therefore and while they did before 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.530
 big stocks buying packs down a kilo the big villas we passed 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.470
 gradually to 500 grams and today especially for the single-head ferrari feet 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.949
 the tendency to choose the most packaging on the market is more difficult 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.030
 small pustule 250 for accessible I call the unit cost e 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.300
 lowest consumption pack where it answers maybe choosing a 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.669
 wider assortment 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.979
 I buy 3 jars of different honey, it has a similar opinion to the celio 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:27.750
 to the government
