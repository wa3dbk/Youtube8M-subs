00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
throughout so the root is dark and for

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.120 
throughout so the root is dark and for
those<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.959> individuals<00:02:40.650> who<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:41.099> to

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
blend that in so it doesn't necessarily

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.270 
blend that in so it doesn't necessarily
stick<00:03:15.599> out<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:16.440> because<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.069> layer

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
because of the style of the curl that's

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.280 
because of the style of the curl that's
basically<00:03:20.370> what<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.670> does<00:03:20.790> some<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.049> are
