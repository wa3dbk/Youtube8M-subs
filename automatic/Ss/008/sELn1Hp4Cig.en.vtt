tap on home calculator works just great

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
tap on home calculator works just great
and<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.640> does<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> all<00:01:42.090> automatically<00:01:42.990> right

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and it does this all automatically right

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.859 
and it does this all automatically right
when<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.890> enter<00:01:44.220> into<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.640> application<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
when you enter into the application it

works<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:46.770> well<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.329> shows

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
works really really well so now it shows

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.120 
works really really well so now it shows
up<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.960> keyboard<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.409> enabled<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.070> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
up if your keyboard is enabled but I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.330 
up if your keyboard is enabled but I
believe<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.909> go<00:01:51.119> ahead<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.100> push<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> away

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
believe if you go ahead and push it away

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.580 
believe if you go ahead and push it away
tap<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.030> maybe<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.140> not<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.500> away

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
tap it maybe it's not going to go away

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.340 
tap it maybe it's not going to go away
but<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> status<00:01:56.549> bar<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:56.969> away

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
but you see the status bar to go away

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.810 
but you see the status bar to go away
probably<00:01:58.350> after<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.770> gotta<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.369> rid<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.640> this

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
probably after you gotta get rid of this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.899 
probably after you gotta get rid of this
sign<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.570> it'll<00:02:01.049> go<00:02:01.170> away<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.920> fine<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.820> it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
sign in it'll go away just fine but it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.459 
sign in it'll go away just fine but it
works<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.149> well<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.229> see<00:02:04.380> I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
works really well as you can see I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.039 
works really well as you can see I
enabled<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.979> quite<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> few<00:02:05.880> applications<00:02:06.060> okay

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
enabled it quite a few applications okay

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.719 
enabled it quite a few applications okay
so<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.290> doesn't<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.770> does<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.700> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so it doesn't it does I don't think I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
so it doesn't it does I don't think I
nailed<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.300> application<00:02:10.020> now<00:02:10.229> let's

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
nailed it on that application now let's

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.430 
nailed it on that application now let's
go<00:02:10.440> ahead<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.770> check<00:02:10.890> out<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> same<00:02:11.629> exact<00:02:12.629> my

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
go ahead and check out the same exact my

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.920 
go ahead and check out the same exact my
and<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.160> Galaxy<00:02:14.640> s5<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.180> show<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.690> it's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and the Galaxy s5 and show you that it's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.570 
and the Galaxy s5 and show you that it's
not<00:02:16.140> as<00:02:16.320> practical<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:17.010> still<00:02:17.310> doesn't<00:02:17.520> work

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
not as practical but still doesn't work

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.610 
not as practical but still doesn't work
I<00:02:17.820> just<00:02:18.000> want<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> show<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.410> we'll<00:02:19.530> go

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
I just want to show you that so we'll go

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.800 
I just want to show you that so we'll go

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.860 
ahead and do that so let's say I want to
go<00:02:21.960> on<00:02:22.170> let<00:02:22.530> me<00:02:22.560> go<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.800> turn<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.100> Wi-Fi<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.390> we

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
go on let me go and turn my Wi-Fi so we

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.260 
go on let me go and turn my Wi-Fi so we
can<00:02:25.080> actually<00:02:25.200> go<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.470> use<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.740> application

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
can actually go and use the application

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.060 
can actually go and use the application
so<00:02:27.270> give<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> few<00:02:27.960> seconds<00:02:28.440> there<00:02:28.710> we<00:02:28.770> go

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
so give it a few seconds there we go

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.740 
so give it a few seconds there we go
so<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.970> one<00:02:30.300> we're<00:02:30.450> gonna<00:02:30.510> be<00:02:30.660> using

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
so in this one we're gonna be using

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.690 
so in this one we're gonna be using
bacon<00:02:31.230> reader<00:02:31.380> that's<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.800> reddit<00:02:32.190> application

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
bacon reader that's a reddit application

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880 
bacon reader that's a reddit application
we'll<00:02:33.060> go<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.300> refresh<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.690> um<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.590> here's<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
we'll go and refresh it um so here's the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.740 
we'll go and refresh it um so here's the
front<00:02:35.040> page<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.670> as<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.120> see<00:02:36.180> now<00:02:36.600> it's

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
front page and as you can see now it's

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.410 
front page and as you can see now it's
full<00:02:36.990> screen<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.730> really<00:02:38.940> can't<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
full screen now you really can't see the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.810 
full screen now you really can't see the
difference<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:39.930> because<00:02:40.500> only<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.670> only

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
difference is just because only the only

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.310 
difference is just because only the only
thing<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.060> disappeared<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> status<00:02:43.110> bar

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
thing that disappeared is the status bar

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.500 
thing that disappeared is the status bar
since<00:02:43.830> there's<00:02:44.070> no<00:02:44.160> software<00:02:44.550> keys<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:45.150> not

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
since there's no software keys it's not

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.320 
since there's no software keys it's not
