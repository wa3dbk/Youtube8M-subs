good<00:00:32.160> bounces<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.690> tank<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> couple

good bounces the tank has a couple

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.470 
good bounces the tank has a couple
limitations<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.399> mindful<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.329> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
limitations to be mindful of one is that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
limitations to be mindful of one is that
the<00:00:36.570> silver<00:00:36.809> penetration<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.070> bit<00:00:38.280> low<00:00:38.460> at

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the silver penetration is a bit low at

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.970 
the silver penetration is a bit low at
220<00:00:39.210> although<00:00:39.899> I've<00:00:40.020> noticed<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.829> gun

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
220 although I've noticed that the gun

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.770 
220 although I've noticed that the gun
is<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.280> accurate<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.239> hit<00:00:42.570> weak

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is so accurate that you can hit weak

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
is so accurate that you can hit weak
spots<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.230> range<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.910> despite<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> low

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
spots from range so despite the low

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.540 
spots from range so despite the low
penetration<00:00:45.570> silver<00:00:46.020> ammo<00:00:46.320> still<00:00:46.530> works<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
penetration silver ammo still works the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
penetration silver ammo still works the
second<00:00:47.940> more<00:00:48.629> important<00:00:49.140> limitation<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
second more important limitation is the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
second more important limitation is the
lack<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> gun<00:00:50.969> depression<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:51.960> as

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
lack of gun depression so you can see as

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
lack of gun depression so you can see as
I<00:00:52.140> come<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.590> over<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.160> slight<00:00:53.399> inclines<00:00:53.910> my

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
I come up over these slight inclines my

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
I come up over these slight inclines my
gun<00:00:54.390> tends<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> aim<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.289> high<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.129> gun

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
gun tends to aim pretty high the gun

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520 
gun tends to aim pretty high the gun
depression<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.730> only<00:00:56.910> six<00:00:57.239> degrees<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.930> you'll

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
depression is only six degrees so you'll

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.799 
depression is only six degrees so you'll
have<00:00:58.710> trouble<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.399> cresting<00:01:00.210> Rises<00:01:00.660> or

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
have trouble when cresting Rises or

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.599 
have trouble when cresting Rises or
slopes<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.129> gun<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
slopes to get your gun down on the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.310 
slopes to get your gun down on the
target<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.629> therefore<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> be

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
target so therefore you have to be

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960 
target so therefore you have to be
mindful<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.220> train<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> fight<00:01:05.790> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
mindful of the train that you fight in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.780 
mindful of the train that you fight in
this<00:01:06.240> tank<00:01:06.540> thrives<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.350> flat<00:01:07.740> land<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.250> it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
this tank thrives on flat land and it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.460 
this tank thrives on flat land and it
also<00:01:08.939> does<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.479> when<00:01:09.900> you're<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> valley

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
otter platoon a few battles back and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.210 
otter platoon a few battles back and
they<00:02:31.720> beat<00:02:31.900> our<00:02:32.109> team<00:02:32.439> pretty<00:02:32.680> sadly<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.159> a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
they beat our team pretty sadly like a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.119 
they beat our team pretty sadly like a
spy<00:02:33.549> score<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:33.939> 15<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.420> 7<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.890> actually

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
spy score of 15 to 7 so I actually

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.160 
spy score of 15 to 7 so I actually
picked<00:02:36.609> just<00:02:36.819> out<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> map<00:02:37.329> my<00:02:37.689> guess<00:02:37.930> was

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
picked just out of the map my guess was

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.080 
picked just out of the map my guess was
that<00:02:38.230> they<00:02:38.590> were<00:02:38.650> gonna<00:02:38.889> make<00:02:39.129> their<00:02:39.430> push<00:02:39.700> on

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
a mistake here I'm aiming too much to

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.890 
a mistake here I'm aiming too much to
the<00:03:59.680> front<00:03:59.949> of<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:00.129> is<00:04:00.370> three<00:04:01.030> D<00:04:01.209> backs<00:04:01.449> up<00:04:01.750> I

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
the front of this is three D backs up I

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.469 
the front of this is three D backs up I
should<00:04:02.049> have<00:04:02.139> been<00:04:02.260> aiming<00:04:02.799> more<00:04:02.919> center<00:04:03.250> mass

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
should have been aiming more center mass

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.849 
should have been aiming more center mass
just<00:04:04.479> to<00:04:04.810> account<00:04:05.019> for<00:04:05.109> his<00:04:05.290> movement<00:04:05.739> so<00:04:05.829> I

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
just to account for his movement so I

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:06.590 
just to account for his movement so I
don't<00:04:06.069> end<00:04:06.189> up

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
don't end up

don't end up
his<00:04:07.080> armor<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.370> tracked<00:04:08.730> him<00:04:08.880> there<00:04:09.030> and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
his armor and I tracked him there and

his armor and I tracked him there and
delivered<00:04:09.480> over<00:04:10.050> 400<00:04:10.470> damage<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:11.070> he<00:04:11.610> should

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
delivered over 400 damage and he should

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.220 
delivered over 400 damage and he should
already<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.210> dead<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.570> I<00:04:12.690> had<00:04:12.840> landed<00:04:13.080> both

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
already be dead if I had landed both

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.810 
already be dead if I had landed both
shots<00:04:13.500> which<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:13.710> really<00:04:13.950> should<00:04:14.130> have<00:04:14.160> it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
shots which I really should have it

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.699 
shots which I really should have it
would<00:04:14.910> have<00:04:15.000> been<00:04:15.090> finished<00:04:15.270> off<00:04:15.510> but<00:04:15.840> another

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
would have been finished off but another

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.710 
would have been finished off but another
friendly<00:04:16.980> teammate<00:04:17.340> gets<00:04:17.520> him<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.300> you<00:04:18.600> can

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
friendly teammate gets him so you can

toward<00:04:44.580> me<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:44.970> then<00:04:45.030> offers<00:04:45.690> him<00:04:45.810> some

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
toward me and then offers him some

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.360 
toward me and then offers him some
pretty<00:04:46.110> good<00:04:46.230> protection<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:46.890> I<00:04:46.950> go<00:04:47.100> ahead<00:04:47.250> and

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
pretty good protection so I go ahead and

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.080 
pretty good protection so I go ahead and
pass<00:04:47.520> on<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.820> shot<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.710> hit<00:04:49.710> WT<00:04:50.280> from<00:04:50.460> range<00:04:50.700> and

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
pass on the shot I hit WT from range and

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.910 
pass on the shot I hit WT from range and
then<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.300> otter<00:04:51.510> player<00:04:51.810> responds<00:04:52.800> by

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
then that otter player responds by

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.580 
then that otter player responds by
hitting<00:04:53.190> me<00:04:53.340> nailing<00:04:54.270> me<00:04:54.390> for<00:04:54.570> over<00:04:54.750> 700<00:04:55.050> alpha

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
hitting me nailing me for over 700 alpha

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.460 
hitting me nailing me for over 700 alpha

bounced some of the shots from them

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.570 
bounced some of the shots from them
earlier<00:05:01.350> but<00:05:01.950> that's<00:05:02.070> what<00:05:02.160> I<00:05:02.190> meant<00:05:02.340> by<00:05:02.460> you

earlier but that's what I meant by you

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.460 
earlier but that's what I meant by you

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
know the armor on this tank works it is

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.690 
know the armor on this tank works it is
kind<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.160> like<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.520> pocket<00:05:05.940> heavy<00:05:06.150> in<00:05:07.050> terms<00:05:07.110> of

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
kind of like a pocket heavy in terms of

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.250 
kind of like a pocket heavy in terms of
you<00:05:08.700> know<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.060> thickness<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.080> armor

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
you know the the thickness of the armor

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.170 
you know the the thickness of the armor
it<00:05:10.560> does<00:05:10.710> have<00:05:10.890> really<00:05:11.280> noticeable<00:05:11.670> weak<00:05:11.910> spot

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
it does have really noticeable weak spot

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.510 
it does have really noticeable weak spot
on<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.870> lower<00:05:13.020> funk<00:05:13.290> but<00:05:13.920> you<00:05:14.100> can<00:05:14.220> protect

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
on the lower funk but you can protect

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.760 
on the lower funk but you can protect
that<00:05:14.670> by<00:05:14.820> angling<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.240> tank<00:05:15.570> or<00:05:15.810> by<00:05:16.110> you<00:05:16.680> know

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
that by angling the tank or by you know

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.920 
that by angling the tank or by you know
sidescraping<00:05:17.300> you<00:05:18.300> do<00:05:18.420> have<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.690> be<00:05:18.780> careful

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
sidescraping you do have to be careful

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.080 
sidescraping you do have to be careful
about<00:05:19.290> you<00:05:19.620> know<00:05:19.710> angling<00:05:20.130> in<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.580> open<00:05:20.970> or

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
about you know angling in the open or

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.250 
about you know angling in the open or
sighs<00:05:21.240> clicking<00:05:21.630> you<00:05:21.690> really<00:05:21.720> don't<00:05:22.050> want<00:05:22.200> to

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
sighs clicking you really don't want to

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.230 
sighs clicking you really don't want to
expose<00:05:22.560> your<00:05:22.800> side<00:05:23.010> more<00:05:23.310> than<00:05:23.520> twenty

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
expose your side more than twenty

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.060 
expose your side more than twenty
degrees<00:05:24.540> probably<00:05:24.750> 1520<00:05:25.470> is<00:05:25.500> about<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.860> right

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
degrees probably 1520 is about the right

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.980 
degrees probably 1520 is about the right
things<00:05:26.700> so<00:05:26.910> check<00:05:27.210> this<00:05:27.360> out<00:05:27.600> right<00:05:27.810> here

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
things so check this out right here

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.620 
things so check this out right here
before<00:05:28.200> this<00:05:28.700> t-64<00:05:29.700> efore<00:05:30.090> is<00:05:30.180> shooting<00:05:30.480> me<00:05:30.600> I

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
before this t-64 efore is shooting me I

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.360 
before this t-64 efore is shooting me I
noticed<00:05:31.140> that<00:05:31.260> I'm<00:05:31.350> a<00:05:31.410> little<00:05:31.500> too<00:05:31.620> angled<00:05:32.100> so

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
noticed that I'm a little too angled so

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.430 
noticed that I'm a little too angled so
I<00:05:32.610> sharpen<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.600> angle<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.050> turn<00:05:34.200> to<00:05:34.380> the

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
I sharpen the angle and turn to the

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.470 
I sharpen the angle and turn to the
right<00:05:34.530> my<00:05:35.010> hole<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.250> little<00:05:35.520> bit<00:05:35.820> and<00:05:36.030> then<00:05:36.390> I

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
right my hole a little bit and then I

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.600 
right my hole a little bit and then I
bounce<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:37.170> shot<00:05:37.350> off<00:05:37.500> of<00:05:37.620> my<00:05:37.740> tracks<00:05:38.070> so<00:05:38.430> you

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
bounce that shot off of my tracks so you

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.670 
bounce that shot off of my tracks so you
know<00:05:38.940> but<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.150> armors<00:05:39.450> is<00:05:39.660> thankfully<00:05:40.440> you

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
know but the armors is thankfully you

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.990 
know but the armors is thankfully you
don't<00:05:40.830> really<00:05:41.010> function<00:05:41.460> on<00:05:41.550> this<00:05:41.640> tank<00:05:41.880> it

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
don't really function on this tank it

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.480 
don't really function on this tank it
makes<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.300> big<00:05:42.450> difference<00:05:43.070> so<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:44.100> end<00:05:44.430> up

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
makes a big difference so I end up

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.030 
makes a big difference so I end up
getting<00:05:44.640> a<00:05:45.120> first<00:05:45.720> class<00:05:45.870> mastery<00:05:46.620> badge<00:05:46.830> I

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
getting a first class mastery badge I

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.920 
getting a first class mastery badge I
don't<00:05:47.190> get<00:05:47.310> my<00:05:47.430> ace<00:05:47.580> tanker<00:05:47.820> this<00:05:48.570> is<00:05:48.690> one<00:05:48.840> of

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
don't get my ace tanker this is one of

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.540 
don't get my ace tanker this is one of
those<00:05:48.990> tanks<00:05:49.320> where<00:05:49.470> I<00:05:49.500> think<00:05:49.830> because<00:05:50.310> the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
those tanks where I think because the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.700 
those tanks where I think because the
tank<00:05:51.060> is<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:51.720> strong<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.230> has<00:05:52.320> such<00:05:52.500> good

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
tank is so strong it has such good

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.560 
tank is so strong it has such good
carrying<00:05:53.490> capacity<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:54.000> probably<00:05:54.210> have<00:05:54.450> to

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
carrying capacity I probably have to

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.120 
carrying capacity I probably have to
have<00:05:54.660> an<00:05:54.810> absolutely<00:05:55.080> monster<00:05:55.590> game<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:56.010> get

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
have an absolutely monster game to get

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.770 
have an absolutely monster game to get
my<00:05:56.280> ACE<00:05:56.430> tanker<00:05:56.670> you<00:05:57.030> know<00:05:57.270> even<00:05:57.480> though<00:05:57.540> I<00:05:57.570> did

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
destroyed a few tanks you know it wasn't

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.760

enough<00:06:02.340> but<00:06:03.180> this<00:06:03.480> video<00:06:03.750> really<00:06:03.930> shows<00:06:04.050> how

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
enough but this video really shows how

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.980 
enough but this video really shows how
strong<00:06:05.040> the<00:06:05.220> e-50<00:06:05.700> is<00:06:05.880> you<00:06:06.600> know<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:06.840> main

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
strong the e-50 is you know the main

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.300 
strong the e-50 is you know the main
thing<00:06:07.200> is<00:06:07.290> to<00:06:07.320> be<00:06:07.500> mindful<00:06:07.860> of<00:06:07.980> that<00:06:08.040> gun
