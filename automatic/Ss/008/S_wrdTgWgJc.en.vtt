00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
braking and that is if you're going at

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.939 
braking and that is if you're going at
speeds<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:01.419> break<00:06:01.630> it<00:06:01.870> breaks<00:06:02.320> very<00:06:02.620> fast

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
speeds and you break it breaks very fast

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.370 
speeds and you break it breaks very fast
but<00:06:03.430> it<00:06:03.580> does<00:06:03.820> wobble<00:06:04.360> a<00:06:04.449> little<00:06:04.479> bit<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.050> the

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
vehicle does feel kind of heavy that

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.269 
vehicle does feel kind of heavy that
comes<00:06:07.360> down<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:07.900> body<00:06:08.169> weight<00:06:08.409> versus<00:06:09.130> the

comes down to the body weight versus the
engine<00:06:09.699> size<00:06:09.969> but<00:06:10.479> overall<00:06:10.840> I<00:06:11.169> would<00:06:11.409> say<00:06:11.680> a
