00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:11.400
 how is your existence going 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.080
 you are satisfied not so much and then see 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.010
 you'll find solutions 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.779
 now you live your life as you deserve and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.189
 how can the quality of your life 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.910
 it depends on the choices you make 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 like when you travel 6 on a road 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.570
 because you want to get somewhere 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.860
 at some point you understand and 6 on one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.850
 street even if you didn't know it as a child 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.809
 they had sent you to something you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.910
 had obeyed you had approved and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.350
 so you received candy diplomas 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.090
 caresses for your body 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.410
 and since you appreciate the sensations of the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.860
 your body then let it go 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.799
 you didn't know airis a road but 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 they caressed your body and you liked it 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.909
 they gave you candy and you liked it 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.640
 they gave diplomas and you did not like them 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:24.259
 you knew what you were doing but you liked it 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:29.700
 in order to have other candy diplomas 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:34.040
 caresses to the obeyed you committed you have 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:38.220
 commuter signed the mortgage 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.710
 made the face of the body look like that 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 use take a severe expression 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.070
 or sad as many moles like 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.700
 difficult moments 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.049
 and so you have conformed 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.049
 then one day 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.200
 no you understand that you don't care about anything 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.940
 let's say about all those holidays in 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.709
 costumes and other people's problems you 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:19.050
 you are tired of hearing bad things 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:23.850
 you told yourself you wanted to live better but 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:28.450
 but you have discovered that you were not prepared 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.200
 so many diplomas so many approvals that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.200
 had accumulated they did not teach you 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.600
 to live 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.840
 and then what are you doing now? 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.870
 disillusioned and lost now that you have 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.240
 understood that you were on a road and that 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.010
 that road has nothing to do with you 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:03:00.920
 what do you do now that you're disillusioned e 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:05.540
 lost when you understand that you are not 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.780
 the body you use and therefore that 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:13.050
 satisfactions of your body are you 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.990
 distracting and stealing energy 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.960
 you could figure it out when your body 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.330
 dies but it would be better if you did it 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.360
 understand first 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.800
 when you realize that you don't like how 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.900
 alive 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:36.330
 then start to live listen in 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:41.160
 silence your dissatisfaction feel 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:44.790
 what inspires you pay attention to 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:50.420
 dreams that you don't realize what they want 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:55.860
 make you and you want to be 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:00.660
 what wonders do you want to accomplish in which 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:04.340
 reality you want to live for anyway 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.830
 accumulated a wealth of knowledge 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.800
 even when he was traveling to one 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.390
 direction that you weren't in and didn't understand 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.950

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.789
