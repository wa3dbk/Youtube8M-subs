00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.160 
Fit and the first thing to do is locate
the<00:00:08.220> fuse<00:00:08.490> panel<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> driver<00:00:09.840> side

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170

we're<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> deal<00:00:10.830> with<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> interior

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
we're going to deal with the interior

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.520 
we're going to deal with the interior
fuses<00:00:11.880> only<00:00:12.210> there's<00:00:12.389> also<00:00:12.599> some<00:00:13.019> under<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
fuses only there's also some under the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.289 
fuses only there's also some under the
hood<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:14.639> not<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.940> deal<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.179> that

these clips will disengage sometimes

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.849 
these clips will disengage sometimes
this<00:00:26.430> little<00:00:26.880> piece<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.539> will<00:00:27.779> pull<00:00:28.019> out<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this little piece here will pull out it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.150 
this little piece here will pull out it
will<00:00:29.010> snap<00:00:29.310> right<00:00:29.550> back<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> does<00:00:31.160> fuse

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
will snap right back in it it does fuse

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.840 
will snap right back in it it does fuse
panel<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.700> right<00:00:33.000> under<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:34.579> those<00:00:35.579> little

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
panel it's right under here those little

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.380 
panel it's right under here those little
micro<00:00:36.059> fuses<00:00:37.160> are<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.700> hard<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
micro fuses are really hard to get a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.500 
micro fuses are really hard to get a
hold<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> few<00:00:43.469> spoiler<00:00:44.510> once

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
hold of but there is a few spoiler once

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.010 
hold of but there is a few spoiler once
you<00:00:45.660> find<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.739> white<00:00:47.360> blends<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you find it it's white blends in with a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.010 
you find it it's white blends in with a
fuse<00:00:49.410> panel<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.180> white<00:00:51.480> piece<00:00:51.780> right

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
fuse panel this is white piece right

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.000 
fuse panel this is white piece right
here<00:00:53.570> this<00:00:54.570> goes<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> same

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
here this goes right back in the same

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.470 
here this goes right back in the same
location<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:59.430> pull<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> fuse<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.359> simply

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
location and to pull a fuse it simply

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.149 
location and to pull a fuse it simply
attach<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.830> squeeze<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
attach that on there and it squeeze it

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.109 
attach that on there and it squeeze it
down<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
down so you can see it's on there and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
down so you can see it's on there and
you<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:09.600> pull<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> pull

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you would pull I'm not going to pull

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.109 
you would pull I'm not going to pull
that<00:01:11.400> fuse<00:01:11.790> piece<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> good<00:01:12.540> fuse<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:14.119> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that fuse piece it's a good fuse and the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
that fuse piece it's a good fuse and the
little<00:01:15.420> spacers<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:16.049> kind<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.439> hard<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> get

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
little spacers are kind of hard to get

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.450 
little spacers are kind of hard to get
back<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.119> don't<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
back in and I really don't want to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.429 
back in and I really don't want to
hassle<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> moment<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> I'm

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
hassle with that at the moment so I'm

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.179 
hassle with that at the moment so I'm
going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.619> take<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.950> fuse<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:24.890> put<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.979> back

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
going to take my fuse for put it back

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.149 
going to take my fuse for put it back
where<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.520> belongs<00:01:26.850> right<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.710> we're

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
where it belongs right there and we're

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.940 
where it belongs right there and we're
going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> pull<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> larger<00:01:30.570> fuses<00:01:31.079> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
going to pull one of the larger fuses so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
going to pull one of the larger fuses so
I<00:01:31.979> may<00:01:32.159> need<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> check<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.299> that's<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
I may need to check and see if that's a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.609 
I may need to check and see if that's a
problem<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.520> I'm<00:01:35.520> having<00:01:36.140> but<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.530> the

problem that I'm having but now for the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.810 
problem that I'm having but now for the
larger<00:01:38.070> fuses<00:01:39.500> larger<00:01:40.500> pieces<00:01:40.799> are<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.640> up

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
larger fuses larger pieces are right up

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.910 
larger fuses larger pieces are right up
here<00:01:43.640> those<00:01:44.640> larger<00:01:45.149> fuses<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.619> get

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
here those larger fuses do not get

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.120 
here those larger fuses do not get
pulled<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.380> fuse<00:01:49.380> puller

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
pulled with the fuse puller

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.359 
pulled with the fuse puller
instead<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.180> need<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> pair<00:01:51.659> of

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
instead you're going to need a pair of

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.910 
instead you're going to need a pair of
needlenose<00:01:53.369> pliers<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> we're<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> take

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
needlenose pliers so we're going to take

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.149 
needlenose pliers so we're going to take
our<00:01:56.100> needle<00:01:56.250> nose<00:01:56.549> pliers

end I'm going to come in here and it's
going<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.479> be<00:02:08.569> difficult<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:09.289> see<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.769> get<00:02:10.009> the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
going to be difficult to see and get the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.050 
going to be difficult to see and get the
pliers<00:02:10.759> on<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:12.190> but<00:02:13.190> we'll<00:02:13.400> get<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.910> pliers<00:02:14.450> on

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
pliers on it but we'll get the pliers on

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.699 
pliers on it but we'll get the pliers on
the<00:02:17.060> fuse<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:18.290> we'll<00:02:18.950> pull<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.930> while<00:02:21.560> off

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the fuse and we'll pull and while off

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:31.120 
the fuse and we'll pull and while off
there<00:02:22.099> is<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.310> fuse<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:28.489> 20<00:02:28.849> amp<00:02:29.060> fuse<00:02:30.130> fairly

having problems with that component and
I<00:02:37.190> am<00:02:37.690> hoping<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.750> we're<00:02:39.560> missing<00:02:39.980> something

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250

that's<00:02:40.819> in<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> fuse<00:02:41.450> because<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.810> fuse<00:02:42.110> is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
that's in the fuse because the fuse is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.100 
that's in the fuse because the fuse is
going<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.650> be<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.769> lot<00:02:43.010> cheaper<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.640> replace

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
going to be a lot cheaper to replace

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.559 
going to be a lot cheaper to replace
then<00:02:45.580> going<00:02:46.580> through<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:47.030> troubleshooting

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569

the rear defogger

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.640 
the rear defogger

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
and that happens to be the rear defogger

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.539 
and that happens to be the rear defogger
