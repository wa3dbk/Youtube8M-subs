00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
foundations which I love in the

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.830 
foundations which I love in the
wintertime<00:02:55.489> um<00:02:56.489> actually<00:02:56.730> didn't<00:02:57.450> match<00:02:57.810> my

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
wintertime um actually didn't match my

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.589 
wintertime um actually didn't match my
skin<00:02:58.200> as<00:02:58.680> well<00:02:58.860> as<00:02:59.099> I<00:02:59.250> thought<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.730> did<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.180> I

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
skin as well as I thought it did and I

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.839 
skin as well as I thought it did and I
think<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.930> issue<00:03:01.079> is<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.890> Canada<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.400> get

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
think the issue is that in Canada we get

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.059 
think the issue is that in Canada we get
much<00:03:03.150> gloomier<00:03:04.019> weather<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> winter<00:03:04.829> it's

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
much gloomier weather in the winter it's

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.819 
much gloomier weather in the winter it's
cloudier<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> summer<00:03:07.049> we<00:03:07.440> get<00:03:07.620> tons

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
cloudier and in the summer we get tons

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.740 
cloudier and in the summer we get tons
of<00:03:08.040> Sun<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:08.910> when<00:03:09.120> you're<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.480> direct

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
of Sun and so when you're in the direct

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.360 
of Sun and so when you're in the direct
sunlight<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.230> could<00:03:10.379> really<00:03:10.620> tell<00:03:10.739> when<00:03:11.250> your

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
sunlight you could really tell when your

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.860 
sunlight you could really tell when your
foundation<00:03:11.849> is<00:03:11.970> matching<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> rest<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.810> your

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
foundation is matching the rest of your

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.930

they feel heavy this one's not like that
at<00:03:30.780> all<00:03:30.930> it's<00:03:31.170> actually<00:03:31.530> water-based<00:03:32.160> and

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
at all it's actually water-based and

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.280 
at all it's actually water-based and
water<00:03:32.880> resistant<00:03:33.480> which<00:03:33.599> is<00:03:33.780> why<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.170> go

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
water resistant which is why it can go

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.539 
water resistant which is why it can go
on<00:03:34.319> your<00:03:34.500> body<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:36.810> feels<00:03:37.769> kind<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.430> a

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
on your body and it feels kind of like a

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.400 
on your body and it feels kind of like a
thin<00:03:39.000> veil<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:39.900> you're<00:03:40.079> kind<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.260> putting

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
thin veil like you're kind of putting

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.190 
thin veil like you're kind of putting
water<00:03:40.799> on<00:03:40.950> your<00:03:41.220> face<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.599> was<00:03:42.900> actually

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
water on your face so I was actually

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.110 
water on your face so I was actually
finding<00:03:43.859> this<00:03:43.980> really<00:03:44.370> difficult<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.880> apply

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
finding this really difficult to apply

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.370 
finding this really difficult to apply
at<00:03:45.359> first<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.750> didn't<00:03:45.930> know<00:03:46.019> what<00:03:46.109> to<00:03:46.230> do<00:03:46.349> I

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
at first I didn't know what to do I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.809 
at first I didn't know what to do I
tried<00:03:46.769> applying<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.099> with<00:03:47.130> my<00:03:47.280> fingers<00:03:47.669> and

that it made it it made the foundation

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.400 
that it made it it made the foundation
look<00:03:53.790> like<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.269> thin<00:03:54.599> veil<00:03:54.900> over<00:03:54.959> my

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
look like it was a thin veil over my

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.339 
look like it was a thin veil over my
skin<00:03:55.470> as<00:03:55.889> opposed<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.340> being<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:57.349> natural
