00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
frying pan on medium heat and I just

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.340 
frying pan on medium heat and I just

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
thick and remember this is going in soup

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.630 
thick and remember this is going in soup
so<00:02:36.130> it's<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.430> little<00:02:36.670> thicker<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.270> as<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.350> said

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
so it's a little thicker and as I said

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.860

everything else you will only need about

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.170 
everything else you will only need about
