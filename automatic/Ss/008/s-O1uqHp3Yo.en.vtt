we realized where are where our

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.249 
we realized where are where our
membership<00:01:51.789> was<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.329> we<00:01:52.450> aimed<00:01:52.659> into<00:01:52.899> one

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
membership was so we aimed into one

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.139 
membership was so we aimed into one
specific<00:01:53.979> direction<00:01:54.369> that<00:01:54.939> would<00:01:55.060> be

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
specific direction that would be

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.999 
specific direction that would be
slightly<00:01:55.899> towards<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.229> southeast<00:01:56.710> we've

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
slightly towards the southeast we've

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.679 
slightly towards the southeast we've
started<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.789> Berwyn<00:01:58.149> so<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.389> were<00:01:58.509> looking

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
started in Berwyn so we were looking

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.410 
started in Berwyn so we were looking
there<00:01:59.139> we<00:01:59.920> knew<00:02:00.100> right<00:02:00.130> away<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.149> only

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
there we knew right away that the only

every<00:02:23.920> every<00:02:24.700> big<00:02:25.060> club<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.990> you've<00:02:26.170> seen<00:02:26.800> or

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
every every big club that you've seen or

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.730 
every every big club that you've seen or
heard<00:02:27.580> about<00:02:27.780> ends<00:02:28.780> up<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.170> same<00:02:29.200> story

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
heard about ends up with the same story

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.650 
heard about ends up with the same story
so<00:02:30.460> we<00:02:30.550> figured<00:02:30.880> we're<00:02:31.120> not<00:02:31.270> gonna<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.630> that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
so we figured we're not gonna have that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.110 
so we figured we're not gonna have that
problem<00:02:31.870> if<00:02:32.290> we<00:02:32.440> own<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.770> building<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.820> ours

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
problem if we own the building it's ours

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.930 
problem if we own the building it's ours
so<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:35.170> decided<00:02:36.010> we're<00:02:36.340> gonna<00:02:36.460> buy<00:02:36.700> it

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
so we decided we're gonna buy it

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.870 
so we decided we're gonna buy it
we<00:02:37.570> had<00:02:38.080> fundraisers<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:39.040> did<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:39.580> that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
we had fundraisers we did this that

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.550 
we had fundraisers we did this that
everything<00:02:40.270> else<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.810> was<00:02:40.930> possibly<00:02:41.380> to

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
everything else that was possibly to

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.740 
everything else that was possibly to
raise<00:02:41.740> money<00:02:42.010> for<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.610> then<00:02:43.270> we<00:02:43.360> talked<00:02:43.600> to

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
raise money for it and then we talked to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.790 
raise money for it and then we talked to
some<00:02:43.900> friendly<00:02:44.260> bankers<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:46.120> are<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.720> far<00:02:47.470> as<00:02:47.620> I

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
some friendly bankers we are as far as I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.190 
some friendly bankers we are as far as I
know<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.460> Chicago<00:02:48.970> area<00:02:49.000> we<00:02:49.780> are<00:02:49.930> probably

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
know in the Chicago area we are probably

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.320 
know in the Chicago area we are probably
the<00:02:50.380> only<00:02:50.500> ones<00:02:50.830> who<00:02:51.220> actually<00:02:51.460> own<00:02:51.790> our<00:02:52.210> own

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
the only ones who actually own our own

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.510 
the only ones who actually own our own
building<00:02:53.050> which<00:02:53.260> means<00:02:53.530> we're<00:02:53.860> here<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.400> the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
building which means we're here for the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.270 
building which means we're here for the
long<00:02:54.550> haul<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.330> know<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.350> many<00:02:56.680> other<00:02:56.920> clubs

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
long haul I know of many other clubs

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.960 
long haul I know of many other clubs
that<00:02:58.090> rent<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.110> I've<00:02:59.980> seen<00:03:00.340> them<00:03:00.550> come<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.880> go

that rent and I've seen them come and go

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.330 
that rent and I've seen them come and go
I've<00:03:01.300> seen<00:03:01.660> one<00:03:01.960> club<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.530> was<00:03:02.740> moved<00:03:02.980> five

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
I've seen one club that was moved five

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.940 
I've seen one club that was moved five
times<00:03:03.370> in<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:03.970> last<00:03:04.090> 12<00:03:04.660> years<00:03:05.020> because

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
times in the last 12 years because

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.430 
times in the last 12 years because
they've<00:03:06.670> rent<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.360> there's<00:03:07.870> no<00:03:08.080> way<00:03:08.290> of

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
goal is to keep improving and that's the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.820 
goal is to keep improving and that's the
one<00:03:19.420> thing<00:03:19.600> we<00:03:19.720> can<00:03:19.900> do<00:03:20.020> because<00:03:20.230> we<00:03:20.410> don't

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
one thing we can do because we don't

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.650 
one thing we can do because we don't
have<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.190> worry<00:03:21.370> about<00:03:21.490> where<00:03:22.030> we're<00:03:22.300> gonna<00:03:22.420> be

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
have to worry about where we're gonna be

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.810 
have to worry about where we're gonna be
next<00:03:22.900> year<00:03:23.290> we<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:23.860> three<00:03:24.130> loops<00:03:24.280> right<00:03:24.610> now

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
next year we have three loops right now

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.050 
next year we have three loops right now
that<00:03:25.300> we<00:03:25.780> are<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:27.280> we<00:03:27.400> have<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.700> at<00:03:27.910> our

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
that we are that we have it at our

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.290 
that we are that we have it at our
disposal<00:03:28.630> in<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.440> future<00:03:29.890> we're<00:03:30.820> going<00:03:31.060> to

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
disposal in the future we're going to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.570 
disposal in the future we're going to
we're<00:03:31.510> going<00:03:32.440> from<00:03:32.620> what<00:03:32.860> we<00:03:32.980> call<00:03:33.340> our

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
we're going from what we call our

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.190 
we're going from what we call our
traveling<00:03:34.060> layout<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.480> permanent<00:03:34.780> layout

but with our traveling layout in the
three<00:03:37.000> loops<00:03:37.290> because<00:03:38.290> we<00:03:38.440> use<00:03:38.650> digital

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
three loops because we use digital

engines we can put something like ten

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.710 
engines we can put something like ten
