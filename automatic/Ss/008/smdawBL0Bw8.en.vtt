controller when it lights up yellow

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.050 
controller when it lights up yellow
check<00:01:53.619> it<00:01:53.710> out<00:01:53.829> now<00:01:53.979> as<00:01:54.219> I<00:01:54.460> play<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> couple<00:01:54.909> of

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
check it out now as I play a couple of

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.380 
check it out now as I play a couple of
notes<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:56.560> move<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.219> fader<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.880> can<00:01:58.060> see<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
notes or move a fader you can see the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.039 
notes or move a fader you can see the
little<00:01:58.539> yellow<00:01:58.869> light<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.289> now<00:01:59.619> lighting<00:01:59.950> up

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
little yellow light is now lighting up

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.660 
little yellow light is now lighting up
so<00:02:02.049> we<00:02:02.170> know<00:02:02.320> now<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.560> our<00:02:02.979> midi<00:02:03.189> controllers

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
so we know now that our midi controllers

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.789 
so we know now that our midi controllers

working correctly with live next step is

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.410 
working correctly with live next step is
to<00:02:06.009> tell<00:02:06.189> our<00:02:06.310> drum<00:02:06.609> rack<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:07.090> properly

track that contains our drum rack and we

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.530 
track that contains our drum rack and we
can<00:02:13.629> do<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.140> two<00:02:14.260> ways

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540

appropriate if you plan on recording the
MIDI<00:03:44.010> information<00:03:44.190> coming<00:03:44.849> from<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.329> MPD<00:03:45.569> 32

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
MIDI information coming from the MPD 32

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.670 
MIDI information coming from the MPD 32
testing<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.019> out<00:03:49.139> we're<00:03:49.470> definitely

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
testing it out we're definitely

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.309 
testing it out we're definitely
receiving<00:03:50.370> MIDI<00:03:50.549> information<00:03:51.109> so<00:03:52.109> now<00:03:52.260> you

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
receiving MIDI information so now you

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.369 
receiving MIDI information so now you
can<00:03:52.590> see<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.280> four<00:03:53.549> bottom<00:03:53.849> pads<00:03:54.379> are

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
can see that the four bottom pads are

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.439 
can see that the four bottom pads are
mapped<00:03:55.650> perfectly<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.459> four<00:03:56.729> bottom<00:03:57.090> pads

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
mapped perfectly to the four bottom pads

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.520 
mapped perfectly to the four bottom pads
on<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.930> MPD<00:03:58.199> 32<00:03:58.849> with<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.879> kick<00:04:00.209> with<00:04:01.139> a<00:04:01.169> snare

we<00:04:02.220> closed<00:04:02.639> hi-hat<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.239> an<00:04:03.629> open<00:04:03.900> hi-hat<00:04:04.019> and

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
we closed hi-hat and an open hi-hat and

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.199 
we closed hi-hat and an open hi-hat and
we<00:04:04.680> can<00:04:04.829> play<00:04:04.949> each<00:04:05.129> one<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.400> them<00:04:05.489> freely<00:04:08.209> so

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
we can play each one of them freely so

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.089 
we can play each one of them freely so
