00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.670 

now<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.630> reason<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.049> want<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.289> take<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
sausage out of the casing is because it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.830 
sausage out of the casing is because it
cooks<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:37.039> so<00:01:38.039> much<00:01:38.219> nicer<00:01:38.789> when<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.659> meat

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
cooks up so much nicer when the meat

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.319
