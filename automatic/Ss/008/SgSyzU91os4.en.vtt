00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 I would like to try out how wide it will be. 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.810
 First, attach this step up ring to the camera 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.680
 Is 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.280
 As lens protector of ne is attached now, we remove this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 And this 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.090
 Step up ring 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:34.350
 Of course customer you'd have with the other step-up ring at this point is arrived 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.579
 There is no chance that the edge of the ring will come in and the vignetting will come out 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.290
 And this 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.690
 Please remember this angle of view for a moment 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.690
 Now it's about this by putting money 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:53.239
 Yes, it's about this wall that hasn't entered so much now 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:59.239
 So it's about self-portrait with my hand 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 Than roughly enter When I view a lot of that amount around so you get in so much of the price 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 I think this is good and above all in this Waikon 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.829
 It is light because the water is thin 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.509
 Usually good practice heavily weighted told scary co-Ntte to items in the video camera is lighter on the lens 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.840
 I say becomes 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.340
 I can think of things, but this is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:30.340
 It is light and this weight is 38 g whopping 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:33.789
 Even if you think that you are going to put on because it's so light, you 're not tired at all . 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.090
 Because video cameras are originally light pumice lenses 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:44.330
 I think that I want to go to io from now on 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.630
 Sony wide conversion lens vcl hg 08 b introduced by 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.530
 The 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.530
 Big
