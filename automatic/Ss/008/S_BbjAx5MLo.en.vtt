not the same just doesn't work the same
way

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
way

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.309 
way
it's<00:03:36.769> like<00:03:37.400> neoprene<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:38.120> think<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:38.569> okay<00:03:39.139> so

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
it's like neoprene I think it is okay so

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.409 
it's like neoprene I think it is okay so
it's<00:03:39.590> got<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:39.829> bit<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.069> resist<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.359> you

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
it's got a bit of resist to it so you

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.349 
it's got a bit of resist to it so you
just<00:03:41.690> lay<00:03:41.900> your<00:03:42.079> leaves<00:03:42.319> on<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:44.120> take

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
just lay your leaves on and you take

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.059 
just lay your leaves on and you take
your<00:03:44.389> ball<00:03:44.750> stylus<00:03:45.169> and<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.410> same<00:03:45.709> applies

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
your ball stylus and the same applies

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.430 
your ball stylus and the same applies
for<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.340> flowers<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.599> basically<00:03:47.840> just

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
for the flowers and you basically just

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.190 
for the flowers and you basically just
do<00:03:48.859> a<00:03:49.099> circular<00:03:49.669> motion<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.870> can<00:03:51.019> see

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
do a circular motion and you can see

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.470 
do a circular motion and you can see
that<00:03:51.380> little<00:03:51.530> it's<00:03:51.739> already<00:03:52.190> curling<00:03:52.609> up<00:03:52.760> you

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
that little it's already curling up you

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.349 
that little it's already curling up you
can<00:03:53.660> flip<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.019> over<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.829> just<00:03:55.250> work<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.269> little

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
can flip it over and just work a little

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.129 
can flip it over and just work a little
bit<00:03:56.569> at<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.750> back<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:56.959> it<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.669> there's<00:03:58.669> a

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
bit at the back of it and there's a

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.930 
bit at the back of it and there's a
beautiful<00:04:00.139> leaf<00:04:00.380> if<00:04:00.739> you<00:04:01.280> want<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.609> do<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
beautiful leaf if you want to do the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.729 
beautiful leaf if you want to do the
veining<00:04:02.510> like<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.810> lot<00:04:03.019> of<00:04:03.109> leaves<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.500> veins

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
veining like a lot of leaves have veins

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.199 
veining like a lot of leaves have veins
running<00:04:04.010> down<00:04:04.190> them<00:04:04.370> like<00:04:04.549> this<00:04:04.700> one<00:04:04.910> here<00:04:05.180> I

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
running down them like this one here I

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.150 
running down them like this one here I
don't<00:04:05.299> know<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:05.690> can<00:04:05.900> pick<00:04:06.349> up<00:04:06.500> yes<00:04:06.980> like

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
don't know if you can pick up yes like

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.390 
don't know if you can pick up yes like
the<00:04:07.310> vein<00:04:07.579> on<00:04:07.819> that<00:04:08.030> one<00:04:08.209> yeah<00:04:08.599> I<00:04:08.900> use<00:04:09.319> our<00:04:09.829> 10

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
the vein on that one yeah I use our 10

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.800 
the vein on that one yeah I use our 10
minutes<00:04:10.819> because<00:04:10.940> it's<00:04:11.269> got<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.480> little<00:04:11.720> bit

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
minutes because it's got a little bit

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.360 
minutes because it's got a little bit
more<00:04:11.840> resist<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.709> can<00:04:12.859> just<00:04:13.040> set<00:04:13.220> the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
more resist and you can just set the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.490 
more resist and you can just set the
stylus<00:04:13.819> on<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.420> run<00:04:14.629> it<00:04:14.750> down<00:04:14.930> if<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.260> do<00:04:15.379> this

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
stylus on and run it down if you do this

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.710 
stylus on and run it down if you do this
on<00:04:15.680> too<00:04:15.890> softer<00:04:16.370> met<00:04:16.549> what<00:04:16.760> will<00:04:16.909> happen

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
on too softer met what will happen

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.380 
on too softer met what will happen
you'll<00:04:17.989> let<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.380> split<00:04:18.650> your<00:04:18.860> leaf<00:04:19.150> so<00:04:20.150> that's

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
you'll let you split your leaf so that's

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.720 
you'll let you split your leaf so that's
why<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.630> do<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> veining<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.620> like<00:04:21.860> a<00:04:22.070> slightly

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
why to do the veining I like a slightly

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.210 
why to do the veining I like a slightly
firmer<00:04:23.210> met<00:04:23.420> and<00:04:23.660> our<00:04:24.080> our<00:04:24.440> 10<00:04:24.740> mats<00:04:24.950> worked

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
firmer met and our our 10 mats worked

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.670 
firmer met and our our 10 mats worked
really<00:04:25.550> really<00:04:25.700> well<00:04:25.940> for<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.480> then<00:04:27.470> once

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
really really well for it then once

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.040 
really really well for it then once
you've<00:04:27.860> done<00:04:27.890> your<00:04:28.070> veining<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:29.510> can<00:04:29.690> encoder

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
you've done your veining you can encoder

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.110 
you've done your veining you can encoder
this<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:31.010> does<00:04:31.280> doesn't<00:04:31.580> it

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
this it does doesn't it

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.120 
this it does doesn't it
you<00:04:32.450> can<00:04:32.600> also<00:04:32.750> then<00:04:33.050> just<00:04:33.350> put<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.710> onto<00:04:33.920> your

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
you can also then just put it onto your

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.490 
you can also then just put it onto your
soft<00:04:34.400> net<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.940> just<00:04:35.270> crimp<00:04:35.780> around<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.170> edges

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
soft net and just crimp around the edges

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.380 
soft net and just crimp around the edges
a<00:04:36.530> little<00:04:36.620> which<00:04:36.980> you'll<00:04:37.130> give<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.640> leaf

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
a little which you'll give it that leaf

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.550 
a little which you'll give it that leaf
rely<00:04:39.350> real<00:04:39.800> life<00:04:40.130> look<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.150> leaf<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:42.140> and

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
rely real life look to the leaf so and

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.350 
rely real life look to the leaf so and
then<00:04:42.950> it's<00:04:43.280> really<00:04:43.490> just<00:04:43.730> to<00:04:43.850> be<00:04:43.970> tucked<00:04:44.210> in

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
then it's really just to be tucked in

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.820 
then it's really just to be tucked in
and<00:04:44.570> do<00:04:44.660> your<00:04:44.690> design<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.290> all<00:04:45.470> your<00:04:45.650> rose

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
and do your design so all your rose

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.550 
and do your design so all your rose
petals<00:04:46.310> all<00:04:46.520> your<00:04:46.670> flower<00:04:46.910> petals<00:04:47.380> sculpt<00:04:48.380> on

distress inks to ink the edges and also
if<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.920> go<00:05:04.070> over<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.490> top<00:05:04.700> with<00:05:04.910> it<00:05:05.120> what'll

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
if you go over the top with it what'll

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.270 
if you go over the top with it what'll
happen<00:05:05.570> is<00:05:05.990> you'll<00:05:06.020> get<00:05:06.500> tight<00:05:06.860> on<00:05:06.890> time

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
happen is you'll get tight on time

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.310 
happen is you'll get tight on time
because<00:05:07.670> we<00:05:07.820> you've<00:05:08.030> used<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.660> stylus<00:05:09.080> it's

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
because we you've used the stylus it's

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.580 
because we you've used the stylus it's
that's<00:05:10.010> usually<00:05:10.400> lower<00:05:10.760> down<00:05:11.320> we'll<00:05:12.320> hit<00:05:12.470> the

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
that's usually lower down we'll hit the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.890 
that's usually lower down we'll hit the
-<00:05:12.980> a<00:05:13.280> little<00:05:13.460> shadows<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.330> then<00:05:14.570> to<00:05:14.690> do<00:05:14.870> the

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
- a little shadows and then to do the
