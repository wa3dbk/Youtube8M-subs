00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
ones are two pieces right and then each

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.359 
ones are two pieces right and then each
one<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> spines<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.170> separate<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.099> yeah

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
one of the spines is separate so yeah

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.189 
one of the spines is separate so yeah
you're<00:00:29.519> looking<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> lot<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.210> pieces<00:00:30.510> yeah

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you're looking at a lot of pieces yeah

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.139 
you're looking at a lot of pieces yeah
but<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.920> fun<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.189> does<00:00:32.520> make<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.030> easy

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
but it is fun it does make it very easy

but it is fun it does make it very easy
to<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:34.050> make<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.410> look<00:00:34.590> fluid<00:00:35.070> coming<00:00:35.280> out<00:00:35.489> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
to to make it look fluid coming out you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.010 
to to make it look fluid coming out you
know<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:35.940> got<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.329> least<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.780> hundred

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
know it's got to be at least a hundred

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260 
know it's got to be at least a hundred
pieces<00:00:37.380> right<00:00:37.890> there's<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.489> one's<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.090> then

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
pieces right there's this one's and then

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
pieces right there's this one's and then
I'm<00:00:39.989> almost<00:00:40.350> done<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.040> he<00:00:41.160> is

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
I'm almost done with this one he is

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.970 
I'm almost done with this one he is
coming<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> building<00:00:42.360> right<00:00:42.980> now

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
coming up on the building right now

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.440 
coming up on the building right now
that's<00:00:44.160> interesting<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.879> even<00:00:45.360> though

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that's interesting because even though

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.810 
that's interesting because even though
it's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> fairly<00:00:45.870> large<00:00:46.230> figure<00:00:46.950> they're

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it's a fairly large figure they're

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.610 
it's a fairly large figure they're
really<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.149> duplicating<00:00:49.079> certain<00:00:49.410> pieces

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
really just duplicating certain pieces

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.029 
really just duplicating certain pieces
yes<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.250> lot<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.760> times<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.480> fact<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.530> legs

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
yes a lot of times in fact the the legs

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
yes a lot of times in fact the the legs
if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.730> close<00:00:54.090> they're<00:00:54.449> squared

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
if you look really close they're squared

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.770 
if you look really close they're squared
off<00:00:55.699> necron<00:00:56.699> warrior<00:00:57.059> legs<00:00:57.300> they're<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
off necron warrior legs they're the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
off necron warrior legs they're the
exact<00:00:58.079> same<00:00:58.140> size<00:00:58.520> totally<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.699> you're

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
exact same size totally if you're

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
exact same size totally if you're
working<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.289> happen<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.829> some<00:01:02.070> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
are messed up you can replace the the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.840 
are messed up you can replace the the
legs<00:01:04.559> fairly<00:01:04.949> easily<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> claws<00:01:05.820> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
legs fairly easily it's the claws that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
legs fairly easily it's the claws that
you<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.479> worry<00:01:06.630> about<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.140> interesting

you have to worry about so interesting
that's<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> great<00:01:08.610> figure<00:01:08.970> yeah<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.570> actually

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that's a great figure yeah it's actually

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690 
that's a great figure yeah it's actually
larger<00:01:10.409> than<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.619> thought<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.920> would<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.280> yes

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
larger than I thought it would be yes

larger than I thought it would be yes
and<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.150> some<00:01:12.330> very<00:01:12.390> odd<00:01:12.810> things<00:01:13.320> and
