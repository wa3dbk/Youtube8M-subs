00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.740
 in the last decade of December the weather will be 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.530
 different in the first part of the warm overcast and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.269
 windy temperature readings in these 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.310
 days will stay near zero 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 marks both by day and night 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.199
 but the end of the decade is a thermometer and confident 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.350
 will go down and can reach values 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.810
 minus 15 20 degrees at this time 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.390
 clear cold weather is predicted 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 besides with the arrival of frost the wind to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.410
 Sorry unflappable so fishing in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.899
 this time will not be easy 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.390
 uncomfortable and likely to be 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.520
 check anglers for exposure to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.620
 new year for all indicators we have 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.559
 the whole territory will begin time which 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.809
 anglers called perv o so so 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.910
 how to do popper Valerku knows everyone and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.610
 especially residents of northern areas 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.629
 who in the previous decade opened 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.879
 hard water fishing season as usual 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.829
 first ice q &amp; fishing with bloodworm 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.379
 and go without a fog 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.479
 good side of the first to be hit 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.040
 experience which under such conditions will get 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.490
 must take active and greedy when fishing 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.619
 perch 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.020
 do not be lazy to lift the jig to the height 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.090
 up to a meter above the bottom of the windows is now extremely 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.820
 active and often haunts her 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.770
 almost to the hole 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.619
 bite at this time sure bite 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.590
 greedy fish itself actually sits on 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.240
 hook 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.939
 prikormka on fishing on the first ice not 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.799
 need a game can be both active and 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.320
 smoothly and as if guilt boards 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.210
 so catch enjoy and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.549
 try not to exceed the rate of failure 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.250
 because on the first ice it is often 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.290
 happens as if by itself and real 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.720
 the weight of the catch you start to feel only 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.520
 then when the box becomes just 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.259
 very heavy 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.210
 but fish of record sizes do not expect 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.320
 worth it because you have to fish in 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.870
 coastal zone 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.000
 After all, go far on the ice, especially on 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.080
 rivers and reservoirs in this decade is not 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 recommended but all this is just up 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.050
 mid-decade last of the month 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.900
 the pressure will rise and the wind does not abate 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.180
 and this is a serious reason to go for 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.520
 white which under such conditions should 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.440
 peck very well at this time for 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.480
 in order to understand white is not required 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.140
 no prikormki no serious effort 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.570
 and such conditions require the right 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.720
 warm clothes because if at a temperature 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.570
 minus 15 degrees and wind 5-7 meters 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.760
 second angler grandfather wrong no 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.410
 positive emotions fishing will not bring 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.600
 since the weather is not like that 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.600
 treat this matter casually 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.530
 at the end of the decade in the bays and lakes already 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.460
 it will be possible to catch the predator freely 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.980
 toes 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.990
 and fishing is going to be successful and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.390
 it was an amazing time 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.940
 before do not forget that practically 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.140
 all the Dnieper free of ice well 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.550
 work and circles and spinning gear 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.410
 so if winter fishing is not yours 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.690
 element nothing can stop you 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.550
 catch predator by trolling or surrogate 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.230
 the predator is now leaving the shoals and will 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.080
 keep on deep enough 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.840
 sections of the channel with depths from 6 to 12 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.209
 meters also saved a large 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.820
 probability of catching predatory fish tired 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.870
 white fish which although moved to 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.040
 wintering pits 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.709
 but not all and not everywhere therefore such have become 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.290
 can still be easily detected on the bed or 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.310
 at the entrances to the quiet calm Dnieper 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.870
 Bay but also a separate forecast for 31 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.670
 December 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.330
 whatever the weather turns off 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.610
 television 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.549
 go out on the ice and celebrate the new year 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.340
 just like us and not to see you in 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.560
 New Year neither tail nor scales with 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.040
 upcoming holiday see you 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.040
