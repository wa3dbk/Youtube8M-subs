okay<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.530> one<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.570> table<00:00:03.570> legs<00:00:03.780> it

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
okay this is one of the table legs it

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.889 
okay this is one of the table legs it
you<00:00:05.040> know<00:00:05.160> it<00:00:05.430> will<00:00:05.640> fit<00:00:05.910> on<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.600> end<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
you know it will fit on the end of the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.810 
you know it will fit on the end of the
table<00:00:07.080> right<00:00:07.350> here<00:00:07.400> here's<00:00:08.400> what<00:00:08.550> i<00:00:08.610> want<00:00:08.639> to

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
table right here here's what i want to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.049 
table right here here's what i want to
show<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.170> we<00:00:10.280> would<00:00:11.280> run<00:00:11.429> out<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.759> center

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
show you we would run out the center

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.410 
show you we would run out the center
hole<00:00:12.380> this<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.530> where<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> bearing<00:00:14.219> will<00:00:15.089> go<00:00:15.240> in

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
hole this is where a bearing will go in

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.480 
hole this is where a bearing will go in
the<00:00:16.080> lead<00:00:16.289> screw<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> go<00:00:17.070> through<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
the lead screw is going to go through it

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.660 
the lead screw is going to go through it
you<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:21.199> bearing<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.400> hole<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
you do the the bearing if this hole is

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.429 
you do the the bearing if this hole is
drilled<00:00:23.820> straight<00:00:24.029> through<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:25.080> would<00:00:25.260> just

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
drilled straight through it would just

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.929 
drilled straight through it would just
fall<00:00:25.590> through<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.859> hole<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.760> see

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
fall through the hole so you can see

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.089 
fall through the hole so you can see
inside<00:00:27.300> there<00:00:27.510> there's<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.750> shoulder<00:00:28.199> now<00:00:28.949> how

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
inside there there's a shoulder now how

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.700 
inside there there's a shoulder now how
we<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.490> plans<00:00:29.820> call<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.019> 18<00:00:31.349> inch

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
we the plans call for a one in 18 inch

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.580 
we the plans call for a one in 18 inch
larger<00:00:32.250> hole<00:00:32.700> here's<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.870> Forstner<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.320> we

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
larger hole here's the Forstner bit we

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.790 
larger hole here's the Forstner bit we
used<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> drill<00:00:36.719> press

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
used to do that we use the drill press

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.709 
used to do that we use the drill press
right<00:00:37.800> here<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.570> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
right here but if you don't have that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
right here but if you don't have that
you<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.350> by<00:00:40.469> hand<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.340> very

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
you can do it by hand just be very

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.790 
you can do it by hand just be very
careful<00:00:41.640> make<00:00:42.239> sure<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:42.660> make<00:00:43.620> sure

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
careful make sure it's very make sure

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.610 
careful make sure it's very make sure
its<00:00:43.920> vertical<00:00:44.309> center<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.780> went<00:00:45.930> down<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
its vertical center we went down the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.479 
its vertical center we went down the
depth<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.690> of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.260> bearing<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.340> make

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
depth of of the bearing you can make

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.970 
depth of of the bearing you can make
that<00:00:50.640> mark<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> side<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.629> want<00:00:51.980> now

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that mark on the side if you want now

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.240 
that mark on the side if you want now
the<00:00:53.039> plans<00:00:53.489> also<00:00:53.789> call<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.420> an<00:00:54.629> inner

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
the plans also call for an inner

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.810 
the plans also call for an inner
diameter<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.719> 1<00:00:57.719> inch<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:59.190> fine<00:00:59.520> um

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
diameter of 1 inch and that's fine um

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
diameter of 1 inch and that's fine um
let<00:01:00.570> me<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.350> test<00:01:01.680> piece<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
let me see if I have the test piece I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.960 
let me see if I have the test piece I
don't<00:01:02.989> when<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.110> did<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> test<00:01:05.189> piece<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
don't when we did a test piece and the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.830 
don't when we did a test piece and the
inner<00:01:06.740> lip<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> shoulder<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
inner lip or the shoulder right here it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500 
inner lip or the shoulder right here it
was<00:01:10.170> um<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:11.490> sufficient<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> bearing

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
was um it was sufficient the bearing

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.010 
was um it was sufficient the bearing
would<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.780> fall<00:01:12.990> through<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.420> we<00:01:15.420> decided<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
would not fall through but we decided to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.310 
would not fall through but we decided to
go<00:01:16.170> instead<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.460> slightly<00:01:17.909> smaller<00:01:18.320> force

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
go instead with a slightly smaller force

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.749 
go instead with a slightly smaller force
forbid<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:19.950> size<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.930> 78<00:01:21.930> 78<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.040> what

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
forbid what size was this 78 78 and what

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.929 
forbid what size was this 78 78 and what
that<00:01:23.909> did<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> gave<00:01:24.479> us<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.750> larger<00:01:25.939> smaller

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that did was it gave us a larger smaller

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
that did was it gave us a larger smaller
inner<00:01:27.420> circle<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> larger<00:01:28.560> shoulder<00:01:29.460> as

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
inner circle but a larger shoulder as

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.030 
inner circle but a larger shoulder as
you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.780> gives<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you can see it just gives the the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.300 
you can see it just gives the the
bearing<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.670> support<00:01:33.180> here's<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.079> test<00:01:34.350> let

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
bearing more support here's the test let

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.130 
bearing more support here's the test let
me<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
me see if I can get this for you and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.429 
me see if I can get this for you and
then<00:01:37.439> only<00:01:37.530> has<00:01:37.829> an<00:01:38.009> eighth<00:01:38.850> inch<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> 88

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
then only has an eighth inch see the 88

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
then only has an eighth inch see the 88
vent<00:01:40.799> shoulder<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.880> much<00:01:42.150> it's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
vent shoulder it's it's not much it's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
vent shoulder it's it's not much it's
enough<00:01:42.810> it'll<00:01:42.990> support<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> Baron<00:01:43.860> but

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
enough it'll support the Baron but

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.520 
enough it'll support the Baron but
notice<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> size<00:01:44.939> difference<00:01:45.240> between<00:01:46.200> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
notice the size difference between this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.310 
notice the size difference between this
which<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:47.009> our<00:01:47.130> test<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.200> an

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
which was our test and this it's just an

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
which was our test and this it's just an
option<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
option for you if you have the the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.969 
option for you if you have the the
different<00:01:51.299> size<00:01:51.450> forstner<00:01:51.899> bits<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.740> go

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
different size forstner bits you can go

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
different size forstner bits you can go
with<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> smaller<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.210> only<00:01:54.390> thing<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
with a smaller one the only thing you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.090 
with a smaller one the only thing you
got<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> do<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.259> can't<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.770> smaller

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
got to do is you just can't go smaller

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
got to do is you just can't go smaller
