00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
now of course I got nothing so I am

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
now of course I got nothing so I am
basically<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.990> running<00:01:36.990> through<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
basically just running through the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.679 
basically just running through the
forest<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.740> can't<00:01:38.159> spot<00:01:38.369> any<00:01:38.520> some<00:01:38.759> bees<00:01:38.939> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
forest I can't spot any some bees so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.510 
forest I can't spot any some bees so
that<00:01:40.439> makes<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.770> heck<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.040> lot<00:01:41.070> easier<00:01:41.280> for

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that makes it a heck of a lot easier for

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.330 
that makes it a heck of a lot easier for
me<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.600> that's<00:01:42.750> building<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.340> really

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
me and I think that's building I really

know<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.960> force<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.409> pretty<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.740> place<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
know the force is a pretty good place to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.740
