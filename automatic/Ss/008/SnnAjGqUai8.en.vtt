00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.650
 very good gather before today I bring you the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.680
 new balance 1,085 arriving with light 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.950
 changes mainly in its design but 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.320
 as usual in the brand 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.090
 American are spectacular so much that 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 it's a pity to use them even to run 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.960
 in terms of changes in technology and 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.480
 typology of ryanair there is no there is no 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.550
 too much change but it's that 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.180
 the reality is that you do not need it either 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.370
 the new balance 1080 v 4 were one of 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.920
 the best running shoes 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.920
 2014 and v 5 have been exceeded 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.770
 what we liked most is without a doubt the 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.470
 combination between its lightness the model 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.410
 of 2014 it was somewhat lighter but this 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.920
 model barely exceeds 300 grams in 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.260
 a size 9 with 5 uses and its excellent 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.380
 cushioning worthy of a range stop 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.440
 in the upper almost disappears in all 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.260
 seams we have a new design that 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.420
 also fits better to the foot and also 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.370
 now it 's more breathable has also 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.470
 there were changes in the laces and laces 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.700
 that was one of the weak points of the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.729
 2014 sneakers his drop drops very 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.860
 little happens to the trend of the brand 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.990
 American that is to say 8 millimeters 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.119
 with 30 mm in the heel part 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.119
 and 22 millimeters in the area of the toe 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.310
 the runner of the ruminant guy would be 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.079
 medium or medium high athlete 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.990
 looking for a shoe for 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.000
 trainings and long runs at rhythms 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.850
 means but you can also use 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.330
 to compete in half marathons and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.330
 marathons 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.560
