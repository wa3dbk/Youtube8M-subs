00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 he is a TV host and plays comedy 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.359
 or rather he's an actor and is doing 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.040
 TV is even doing magic and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.690
 sang of the music hall mauss our 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.889
 invited to more than one trick in his bag he 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.480
 we prove it once again in 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.400
 amount on stage with perfumes 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.830
 of intimacy a piece of michel tremblay 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.490
 adopted by christian bordeleau laurent 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 artufel and on the set of live thank you 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.500
 to welcome me is the good mood on 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.140
 our plateau I see that but I would say 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.269
 even to sow chaos 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 finished the week is not it 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.250
 but it's hard a laugh in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.690
 direct 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.680
 but hey we'll talk about your news 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.140
 so this play that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.239
 is called perfumes of intimacy in which 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 you play a character 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.039
 and then the two themes finally you you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 are to make TV star TV 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.239
 I do not, but yes, it's funny because 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 that in fact the luc the character that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.780
 i actually embody is a real star 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 TV but but it's not his dream 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.989
 in the end because they him when we 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.219
 recognizes in the street people think 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.079
 that he's like he's on TV then 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.670
 he has a life and he would like us to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.629
 recognize how he really is in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.210
 life so it's funny 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 so there you leave more or less the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.270
 little screen to go back on sajoo you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.450
 go back to my first love exactly 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.470
 so it's nice to be able to 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.960
 feel the Seine on board really the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.729
 public nearby there in front so that's 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.049
 a piece that I already played at the festival 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.430
 of Avignon last year the recovery 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.290
 appears with many dates in France 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.250
 so it's a real pleasure because 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.630
 you mostly know to be 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.950
 the TV host but actually what we 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.240
 do not know is what you put in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.560
 before including in your record of 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.299
 press is that you are first a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.650
 child of comedy finally you 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.630
 do some TV next door 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.860
 but of course b so yes because 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.100
 when one is a comedian must eat well 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.500
 and it's true that I did a lot of 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.750
 odd jobs to con the first 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.190
 years later came the radio and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.510
 and then the TV and then this past 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.400
 he came to pick you up 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.840
 yes when I was on the radio and then that 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.640
 worked here so obviously I 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.810
 prefer to go on TV because 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.970
 it's a job that comes closer 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.700
 comedy and theater 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.180
 rather than going to pick up my 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.790
 phone 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.170
 good yes no I thought that like like 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.430
 we absolutely wanted to know what 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.740
 looked like your job especially 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.119
 this room we had concocted a small 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.320
 anthology of the best healthy extracts 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.330
 some snippets from the TV but good 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:28.120
 you have to know how to support this 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:29.590
 left then I have the impression that the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.790
 task is on all fours their ecot on 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.580
 floor of the living room to listen to everything 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.640
 we say and projection 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.800
 you would have done that I shouted 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.900
 deeply boring and especially to 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.430
 people means useless it takes off 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.650
 never is it content to say what it is 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.910
 says it depends who chose there I am 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.250
 on the verge of cracking public including 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.420
 I can not 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.880
 August 4th General I like my city to 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.920
 19:10 hurt to be of this answer 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.840
 it resists and clearly visible and 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.720
 discover seduction it's me they 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.840
 do not try stature very difficult because 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.200
 that when they want they see there I 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.160
 have no regret to parties 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.709
 so far have asked for the time that 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.030
 I was the happiest in my city 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.680
 I have the time we are preparing musset 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.060
 to make conservatory I had counted 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.209
 it's not very delicate things to his 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.209
 easy 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.150
 laurent you did not look at how he 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.320
 would not you be telling me that 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.700
 it's true that theater is 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.030
 difficult to transpose on TV 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.130
 to understand a little the pitch of the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.230
 scene I think of the room the better 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.200
 it is that constant behind closed two 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.989
 luc characters so young star of the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.390
 TV actually star of a sitcom and that's it 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.950
 and who returns to see his ex then his ex 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.900
 and his ex with whom he lived 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.220
 but it's mostly his ex mentor it's up to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.110
 ie it is a little the guy who guided 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.880
 who is older than him and who is a 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.709
 teacher of help that always has him 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.440
 dreamed of being a great writer who is 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.670
 played by renato ribeiro super actor 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.560
 theater so that I have the chance to play 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.850
 with him and in fact he returns to a 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.140
 crucial moment of his life ie 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.269
 his father is dying of whom 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.150
 not very funny and there it will be 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.739
 a conversation really like 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.530
 people finally anyone can have 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.570
 this conversation we come back on on 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.510
 questions about his own life on the 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.070
 relationship with an ex and then also on the 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.180
 disappearance of a loved one there is my 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.620
 father but it can be 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.570
 that's maybe it's a mother that's 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.100
 the adaptation of a pre-existing room 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.800
 what are the differences between that 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.870
 ci and the one who makes the adaptation 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.610
 old smells of michel tremblay 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.169
 the difference is precisely in the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.060
 teeth expressions because if he 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.030
 had to play the whole room with the 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.210
 Quebec expressions 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.590
 it would be difficult and but otherwise we 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.750
 still keep things like 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.930
 as can not be geographical with the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.460
 river saint-laurent where montreal where the 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.180
 montreal gardens so here we stay 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.860
 in Canada 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.970
 the theater in which you play this 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.650
 theater and in the fifth row but 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.850
 got rich new pace pretty well 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.380
 for viewers because that's 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.790
 really a whole new theater that 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.010
 has just opened in the fifth to 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.570
 paris 2-2 saturday saint michel 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.920
 comedy saint-michel or four hours 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.680
 boulevard saint jean is a saint 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.780
 michel metro luxembourg rer and so 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.910
 after I imagine that after the play 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.110
 you go to dine in small restaurants 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.620
 nice neighborhood you have good 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.100
 Address 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.360
 oh no there I am in the neighborhood as 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.820
 I'm not long for this 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.720
 I do not know the neighborhood well 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.220
 but hey, I trust you 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.920
 stephanie to find good 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.820
 Address 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.870
 just one last question regarding 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.760
 television because you're too 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.660
 TV host will tidy your room 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.180
 stop at the end of the year 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.520
 even if you say that finally 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.930
 so maybe not have to stop because 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.940
 than in terms of audience with marilou had 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.380
 stop then we were leader on 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.390
 Saturday morning in front of big machines 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.710
 as the star academy leader on 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.120
 young people no longer brought the housewife 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.220
 so not only did we reach my goal 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.550
 that we went beyond as well as if he 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.650
 past 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.660
 maybe a problem of two boxes 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.610
 because at the base you change your room 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.140
 it was out of youth so I know that 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.850
 there on Saturday we had to return the box to 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.800
 the French games then play after 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.270
 game happened but we are heard 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.500
 when we get on well with management 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.090
 she is thinking about a 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.410
 more musical show we'll say 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.650
 okay so you do not lose hope 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.850
 to stay on TV I stay ok on 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.500
 is very happy to have you as the 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.750
 competitor from that I use 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.630
 always thanks at the same time but good 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.100
 here I am just recalling your 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.630
 news is a play that 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.760
 is called perfumes of intimacy that is 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.760
 signed by michel tremblay in all
