baseball but his passion for hockey and
recently<00:02:28.870> didn't<00:02:29.110> make<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.350> team

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
recently didn't make the team

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.270 
recently didn't make the team
kept<00:02:29.970> him<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.330> hockey<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.959> let<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.769> not<00:02:32.040> have

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
kept him in hockey and let it not have

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.270 
kept him in hockey and let it not have
to<00:02:32.430> play<00:02:32.580> baseball<00:02:33.049> so<00:02:34.049> do<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.230> think<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.799> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
to play baseball so do you think it it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.100 
to play baseball so do you think it it
wasn't<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:36.120> think<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.599> wasn't<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
wasn't you think if it wasn't for the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.479 
wasn't you think if it wasn't for the
injuries<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.590> would<00:02:37.799> have<00:02:37.920> played<00:02:38.159> baseball

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
injuries you would have played baseball

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.759 
injuries you would have played baseball
instead<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.150> hockey<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.720> think<00:02:40.260> Irene<00:02:40.590> would

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
instead of hockey I think Irene would

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.339 
instead of hockey I think Irene would
have<00:02:40.890> pursued<00:02:41.310> his<00:02:41.790> hockey<00:02:42.030> career<00:02:42.360> because

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
have pursued his hockey career because

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.530 
have pursued his hockey career because
he<00:02:43.560> had<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> great<00:02:44.159> passion<00:02:44.519> for<00:02:44.940> hockey<00:02:45.299> there

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
he had a great passion for hockey there

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.600 
he had a great passion for hockey there
was<00:02:45.659> much<00:02:45.900> more<00:02:46.200> than<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> love<00:02:47.160> for<00:02:47.430> baseball

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
was much more than a love for baseball

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.020 
was much more than a love for baseball
no<00:02:48.540> Willie<00:02:48.810> O'Ree<00:02:49.019> was<00:02:50.010> not<00:02:50.310> exactly<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.879> most

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
no Willie O'Ree was not exactly the most
