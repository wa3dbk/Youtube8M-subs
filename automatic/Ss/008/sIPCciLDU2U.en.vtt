00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
dried again because that is not what

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.119 
dried again because that is not what
happens<00:03:56.609> when<00:03:57.209> fleece<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.720> ready<00:03:57.930> when<00:03:58.739> fleece

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
for it to soak in that's why it's safe

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.349
