00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 Ok, so continuing here is a niche 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.370
 market that thinks that a large area 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.490
 there will be another dalton wing 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.710
 that will map the birds that are not 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.160
 exactly confined there right 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.160
 an area larger than the fight already a number 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 largest bird 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:39.149
 here we have old ladies over there on the other side 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.329
 the well- shaded chamber that is important 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:51.719
 also as always saying there are several 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:54.530
 small and we put 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.809
 I do not know if it will happen when trying to get the ldu 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.379
 the water or food all from the outside 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.379
 around here 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.739
 encouraged 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.430
 the passage leave in this water 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 distilled that is behind this nothing to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.500
 to see 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 but you did with me, right? 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:48.650
 the toninho the vehicle the white branch ac 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:59.280
 can also be used later to 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:02:02.340
 People do but it's a father coming out here. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.729
 Let's find it on this side, not the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:18.500
 end of those others, right? 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:18.500
 here's a month-old daughter reported here 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.370
 at 0 we 'll do the same thing as 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:44.930
 did next door right? 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:44.930
 fed on the birds was that the birds 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.980
 it seemed to me like type cross 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:04:19.410
 zezÃ© polessa dourada won by second 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.790
 time to camera him and scene 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.250
 in another study done with the sun in all 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.250
 the extension 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:51.640
 the user does not have powers too 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:21.520
 bought an overview of the whole trip 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.639
 see where you can do site 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:54.800
 he always has access to this area with 90 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.800
 shadow back 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:23.330
 the idea is basically this
