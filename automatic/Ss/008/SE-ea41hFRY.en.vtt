the latest handsets this one is the LG

the latest handsets this one is the LG
spirit<00:00:14.320> it's<00:00:14.980> a<00:00:15.250> mid-range<00:00:15.880> phone<00:00:16.240> one<00:00:16.660> step

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
spirit it's a mid-range phone one step

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.200 
spirit it's a mid-range phone one step
down<00:00:17.230> from<00:00:17.290> the<00:00:17.680> LG<00:00:18.040> Magna<00:00:18.550> which<00:00:19.029> we've

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
down from the LG Magna which we've

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.050 
down from the LG Magna which we've
already<00:00:19.330> shot<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.720> video<00:00:19.869> of<00:00:20.200> this<00:00:20.770> is<00:00:20.980> a<00:00:21.060> 4.7

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
already shot a video of this is a 4.7

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.999 
already shot a video of this is a 4.7
inch<00:00:22.180> model<00:00:22.509> instead<00:00:22.840> of<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.050> 5<00:00:23.290> inch<00:00:23.349> as<00:00:23.800> seen

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
inch model instead of the 5 inch as seen

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.040 
inch model instead of the 5 inch as seen
on<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.279> Magna<00:00:24.700> but<00:00:25.390> don't<00:00:25.570> let<00:00:25.869> that<00:00:25.900> worry

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
on the Magna but don't let that worry

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.710 
on the Magna but don't let that worry
you<00:00:26.259> too<00:00:26.560> much<00:00:26.739> it<00:00:26.919> runs<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.279> same<00:00:27.720> 720p

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
you too much it runs the same 720p

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.650 
you too much it runs the same 720p
resolution<00:00:28.930> as<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:30.160> Magna<00:00:30.550> and<00:00:30.730> because<00:00:31.509> it's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
resolution as the Magna and because it's

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.660 
resolution as the Magna and because it's
smaller<00:00:32.020> those<00:00:32.590> pixels<00:00:32.950> are<00:00:33.130> more<00:00:33.250> densely

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
smaller those pixels are more densely

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.130 
smaller those pixels are more densely
packed<00:00:33.970> together<00:00:34.270> so<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.750> screen<00:00:34.930> is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
packed together so the screen is

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.950 
packed together so the screen is
actually<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.440> little<00:00:35.560> bit<00:00:35.800> sharper<00:00:36.250> it's<00:00:36.730> got<00:00:36.910> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
actually a little bit sharper it's got a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.920 
actually a little bit sharper it's got a
312<00:00:37.960> pixels<00:00:38.440> per<00:00:38.590> inch<00:00:38.769> pixel<00:00:39.760> density<00:00:40.180> in

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
312 pixels per inch pixel density in

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.990 
312 pixels per inch pixel density in
terms<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.350> screen<00:00:41.620> quality<00:00:41.859> well<00:00:42.460> it's<00:00:42.760> pretty

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
terms of screen quality well it's pretty

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.729 
terms of screen quality well it's pretty
reasonable<00:00:43.210> actually<00:00:43.809> and<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.410> colors

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
reasonable actually and the colors

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.040 
reasonable actually and the colors
really<00:00:45.039> pop<00:00:45.219> it's<00:00:45.609> um<00:00:45.850> it's<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.480> lovely<00:00:46.719> display

make a quick shopping list as for the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.000 
make a quick shopping list as for the
design<00:01:10.540> itself<00:01:10.690> it's<00:01:11.140> quite<00:01:11.320> a<00:01:11.350> chunky<00:01:11.770> check

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
design itself it's quite a chunky check

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.220 
design itself it's quite a chunky check
not<00:01:12.670> one<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.850> these<00:01:13.000> super<00:01:13.450> sleek<00:01:13.720> handsets

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
not one of these super sleek handsets

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.500 
not one of these super sleek handsets
but<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.830> is<00:01:15.040> a<00:01:15.070> mid-range<00:01:15.520> phone<00:01:15.850> like<00:01:16.120> we<00:01:16.270> say

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
but it is a mid-range phone like we say

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.750 
but it is a mid-range phone like we say
and<00:01:16.720> so<00:01:17.710> that's<00:01:17.980> kind<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.280> par<00:01:18.490> for<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.700> course

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
and so that's kind of par for the course

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.550 
and so that's kind of par for the course
really<00:01:19.240> around<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:19.780> back<00:01:19.960> it's<00:01:20.200> made<00:01:20.410> of

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
really around the back it's made of

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.070 
really around the back it's made of
plastic<00:01:21.010> rather<00:01:21.280> than<00:01:21.490> metal<00:01:21.790> arguably<00:01:22.780> more

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
plastic rather than metal arguably more

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.630 
plastic rather than metal arguably more
importantly<00:01:23.620> that<00:01:23.830> any<00:01:23.980> of<00:01:24.160> that<00:01:24.190> stuff<00:01:24.400> is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
importantly that any of that stuff is

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.010 
importantly that any of that stuff is
the<00:01:24.730> fact<00:01:24.940> that<00:01:24.970> it's<00:01:25.150> nice<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.360> light<00:01:25.780> and

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
the fact that it's nice and light and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.780 
the fact that it's nice and light and
you<00:01:26.200> can<00:01:26.350> use<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.770> one<00:01:26.950> hand<00:01:26.980> on<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.580> back

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
you can use it in one hand on the back

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.890 
you can use it in one hand on the back
you'll<00:01:28.000> see<00:01:28.090> you've<00:01:28.300> got<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.480> usual<00:01:28.600> power

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
you'll see you've got the usual power

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.200 
you'll see you've got the usual power
button<00:01:29.230> and<00:01:29.410> the<00:01:29.500> volume<00:01:29.710> controls<00:01:30.580> now<00:01:31.150> the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
button and the volume controls now the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.760 
button and the volume controls now the
fact<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.540> power<00:01:31.720> buttons<00:01:32.050> position<00:01:32.500> there<00:01:32.680> is

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
fact the power buttons position there is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.020 
fact the power buttons position there is
actually<00:01:33.040> quite<00:01:33.160> useful<00:01:33.610> because<00:01:33.730> it<00:01:33.820> means

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
actually quite useful because it means

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.540 
actually quite useful because it means
you<00:01:34.210> can<00:01:34.360> turn<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.080> phone<00:01:35.260> screen<00:01:36.040> on<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.460> off

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
you can turn the phone screen on and off

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.100 
you can turn the phone screen on and off
really<00:01:36.880> really<00:01:37.000> quickly<00:01:37.270> without<00:01:37.600> fumbling

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
really really quickly without fumbling

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.380 
really really quickly without fumbling
around<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.650> sides<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.160> screen<00:01:39.370> on<00:01:39.730> the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
around the sides of the screen on the
