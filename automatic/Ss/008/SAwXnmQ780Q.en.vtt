00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
events it's going to be high jump and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.490 
events it's going to be high jump and
long<00:00:17.970> jump<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.720> two<00:00:18.869> events<00:00:19.170> because

long jump and it's two events because

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.849 
long jump and it's two events because
they're<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.570> bit<00:00:21.570> simpler<00:00:22.020> there's<00:00:22.470> not<00:00:22.680> much

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
they're a bit simpler there's not much

they're a bit simpler there's not much
redstone<00:00:23.340> involved<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:25.199> that

redstone involved and it's not that

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.179 
redstone involved and it's not that
complicated

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189

it<00:00:44.340> can<00:00:44.640> vary<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.390> event<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> event<00:00:45.960> where

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
it can vary from event to event where

the bar starts out I'm just going to put

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.729 
the bar starts out I'm just going to put
it<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.260> lowest<00:00:49.800> height<00:00:50.010> right<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
it at this lowest height right here and

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.760 
it at this lowest height right here and
as<00:00:53.390> participants<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.020> event<00:00:55.289> moves<00:00:55.559> on

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
as participants as the event moves on

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.439 
as participants as the event moves on
the<00:00:56.579> bar<00:00:56.760> gets<00:00:57.120> moved<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.250> as

participants fail to clear the bar they

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.950 
participants fail to clear the bar they

want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:10.320> your<00:01:10.470> own<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.770> could

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
want to do this on your own you could

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.039 
want to do this on your own you could
start<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.400> wherever<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.850> wanted<00:01:12.150> but

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
start it out wherever you wanted but
let's<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.560> start<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.729> for

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
let's just start it out here for

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.840 
let's just start it out here for
demonstration<00:01:15.600> sake<00:01:15.890> it's<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.100> simple<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
demonstration sake it's very simple to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
demonstration sake it's very simple to
actually<00:01:18.420> execute<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> high<00:01:19.140> jump<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.650> just

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
actually execute the high jump you just

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.149 
actually execute the high jump you just
do<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:22.189> sort<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> high<00:01:23.820> jump<00:01:24.060> approach<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
do this sort of high jump approach and I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.190 
do this sort of high jump approach and I
actually<00:01:26.369> messed<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.930> wasn't

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
actually messed up because I wasn't

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.760 
actually messed up because I wasn't
really<00:01:28.920> concentrating<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> hit<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.619> hit

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
really concentrating so I hit the I hit

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
really concentrating so I hit the I hit
the<00:01:32.100> string<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.850> saw<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.619> lamps

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the string here and you saw the lamps

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.469 
the string here and you saw the lamps
lit<00:01:34.799> up<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.159> any<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> lamps<00:01:35.909> ever<00:01:36.060> light<00:01:36.329> up

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
lit up if any of the lamps ever light up

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.660 
lit up if any of the lamps ever light up
that<00:01:36.509> means<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> didn't<00:01:37.290> clear<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.590> jump<00:01:37.920> let

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that means you didn't clear the jump let

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
that means you didn't clear the jump let
me<00:01:38.729> try<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.909> again<00:01:39.180> actually<00:01:39.500> paying

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
me try it again actually paying

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.050 
me try it again actually paying
attention<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.250> count<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.640> blinks<00:01:41.970> on

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
attention I have to count the blinks on

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.859 
attention I have to count the blinks on
the<00:01:42.150> TNT<00:01:43.009> one<00:01:44.009> two<00:01:44.610> three<00:01:47.090> all<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.149> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the TNT one two three all right that

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.120 
the TNT one two three all right that
cleared<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.409> easily<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.479> actually<00:01:52.130> so

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
cleared it easily I'm gonna actually so

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.450 
cleared it easily I'm gonna actually so
as<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.540> clear<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> jumps<00:01:55.560> you'll

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
as you as you clear the jumps you'll

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.389 
as you as you clear the jumps you'll
want<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> add<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.659> new<00:01:58.259> layer<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:59.280> leave

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
want to add a new layer on just leave

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.639 
want to add a new layer on just leave
the<00:01:59.520> one<00:01:59.670> down<00:01:59.880> below<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.360> helps<00:02:00.659> detecting<00:02:01.439> if

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the one down below it helps detecting if

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.280 
the one down below it helps detecting if
a<00:02:02.310> player<00:02:02.610> gets<00:02:03.000> under<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> bar<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.909> way

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
a player gets under the bar and the way

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.050 
a player gets under the bar and the way
the<00:02:07.290> way<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.439> high<00:02:07.680> jump<00:02:07.740> competition<00:02:08.399> works

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the way the high jump competition works

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.110 
the way the high jump competition works
is<00:02:09.679> that

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
is that

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.289 
is that
you<00:02:11.780> can<00:02:12.159> decide<00:02:13.159> to<00:02:13.190> jump<00:02:13.580> whenever<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.030> want

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
you can decide to jump whenever you want

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.020 
you can decide to jump whenever you want
at<00:02:14.870> any<00:02:15.290> height<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:16.099> say<00:02:16.670> I'm<00:02:16.849> going<00:02:16.970> to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
at any height you can say I'm going to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.699 
at any height you can say I'm going to
jump<00:02:17.239> now<00:02:17.269> or<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.750> don't<00:02:17.930> want<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.230> jump<00:02:18.379> anymore

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
jump now or I don't want to jump anymore

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.470 
jump now or I don't want to jump anymore
at<00:02:18.799> this<00:02:18.890> height<00:02:19.099> if<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.819> ever<00:02:19.940> miss<00:02:20.180> three

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
at this height if you ever miss three

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.869 
at this height if you ever miss three
times<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:21.019> row<00:02:21.049> then<00:02:22.010> you're<00:02:22.489> out<00:02:22.519> of<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
times in a row then you're out of the

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.820 
times in a row then you're out of the
competition<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.810> can't<00:02:24.019> jump<00:02:24.230> anymore<00:02:24.319> and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
competition you can't jump anymore and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.410 
competition you can't jump anymore and
whatever<00:02:24.950> your<00:02:25.220> highest<00:02:25.430> cleared<00:02:26.000> height<00:02:26.239> is

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
whatever your highest cleared height is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.930 
whatever your highest cleared height is
that's<00:02:27.080> your<00:02:27.349> sort<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.950> score<00:02:28.280> all<00:02:28.670> right<00:02:28.790> let

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
that's your sort of score all right let

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.800 
that's your sort of score all right let
me<00:02:28.970> try<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.209> again<00:02:34.420> all<00:02:35.420> right<00:02:35.540> well<00:02:35.750> I'm

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
me try this again all right well I'm

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.100 
me try this again all right well I'm
clearing<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.349> much<00:02:37.099> higher<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.730> if<00:02:38.629> I<00:02:38.810> was<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:38.989> a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
clearing it much higher so if I was in a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.930 
clearing it much higher so if I was in a
competition<00:02:39.290> with<00:02:39.590> somebody<00:02:39.950> else<00:02:40.159> we<00:02:40.730> might

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
competition with somebody else we might

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.059 
competition with somebody else we might
you<00:02:41.629> know<00:02:41.750> have<00:02:41.780> him<00:02:42.230> try<00:02:42.590> at<00:02:42.769> different

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
you know have him try at different

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.610 
you know have him try at different
heights<00:02:43.280> I'm<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.299> going<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.480> add<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.230> bunch

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
heights I'm just going to add in a bunch

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.940 
heights I'm just going to add in a bunch
more<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.250> these<00:02:46.760> get<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.840> get<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.470> bar<00:02:48.650> up<00:02:48.680> a

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
more of these get the get the bar up a

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.610 
more of these get the get the bar up a
fair<00:02:49.190> amount<00:02:49.310> higher<00:02:50.079> you<00:02:51.079> can<00:02:51.200> actually<00:02:51.349> get

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
fair amount higher you can actually get

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.530 
fair amount higher you can actually get
pretty<00:02:52.340> high<00:02:52.609> this<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.970> obviously<00:02:53.359> much

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
pretty high this is obviously much

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.330 
pretty high this is obviously much
higher<00:02:53.750> than<00:02:53.959> somebody<00:02:54.709> could<00:02:54.829> jump<00:02:55.010> in<00:02:55.160> real

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
higher than somebody could jump in real

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.360 
higher than somebody could jump in real
life<00:02:55.609> all<00:02:56.510> right<00:02:56.629> let's<00:02:56.840> try<00:02:57.049> it's<00:02:57.500> at<00:02:58.310> a

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
life all right let's try it's at a

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.890 
life all right let's try it's at a
height<00:02:58.670> like<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.239> I<00:02:59.420> think<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.690> should<00:02:59.870> be

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
height like this I think I should be

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.399 
height like this I think I should be
let's<00:03:00.470> let<00:03:00.680> me<00:03:00.769> add<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> couple<00:03:01.040> more<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.519> guess

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
let's let me add a couple more I guess

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.770 
let's let me add a couple more I guess
you<00:03:03.409> got<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.620> make<00:03:03.739> sure<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.760> trip<00:03:05.599> wire

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
you got to make sure that the trip wire

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.080 
you got to make sure that the trip wire
gets<00:03:06.049> pulled<00:03:06.319> tight<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:07.280> course<00:03:07.549> this<00:03:07.819> is<00:03:08.060> a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
gets pulled tight of course this is a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.490 
gets pulled tight of course this is a
feature<00:03:08.599> in<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:10.269> snapshots<00:03:11.269> 41.3<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.409> you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
feature in the snapshots 41.3 so you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.780 
feature in the snapshots 41.3 so you
will<00:03:12.650> need<00:03:12.799> that<00:03:12.980> if<00:03:13.129> you<00:03:13.159> want<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.430> run<00:03:13.549> this

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
will need that if you want to run this

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.400 
will need that if you want to run this
all<00:03:14.450> right<00:03:14.569> that<00:03:14.720> is<00:03:14.810> actually<00:03:15.079> pretty<00:03:15.230> high

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
all right that is actually pretty high

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.750 
all right that is actually pretty high
let's<00:03:15.680> see<00:03:15.919> let's<00:03:16.099> see<00:03:16.160> if<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.430> make<00:03:16.549> it

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
let's see let's see if I can make it

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.009 
let's see let's see if I can make it
alright<00:03:17.599> here<00:03:17.780> we<00:03:17.840> go

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
alright here we go

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:25.870 
alright here we go
oh<00:03:22.930> not<00:03:23.930> quite<00:03:24.260> well<00:03:24.889> I<00:03:24.919> was<00:03:25.040> my<00:03:25.160> first<00:03:25.400> attempt

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
oh not quite well I was my first attempt

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.729 
oh not quite well I was my first attempt
of<00:03:26.389> course<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.019> fail<00:03:27.260> three<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.709> row

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
of course I have to fail three in a row

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.069 
of course I have to fail three in a row
in<00:03:28.099> order<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.549> fail<00:03:28.819> just<00:03:29.599> got<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.840> put<00:03:29.930> back

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
in order to fail just got to put back

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.199 
in order to fail just got to put back
the<00:03:30.200> TNT<00:03:30.739> obviously<00:03:31.459> don't<00:03:31.669> put<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.030> where<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
the TNT obviously don't put it where the

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.509 
the TNT obviously don't put it where the
lily<00:03:32.599> pad<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.019> Lee<00:03:33.650> pad<00:03:33.829> is<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.010> there<00:03:34.370> to

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
lily pad is Lee pad is just there to

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.589 
lily pad is Lee pad is just there to
prevent<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.849> from<00:03:34.879> putting<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.209> tee<00:03:35.359> down

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
prevent you from putting the tee down

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.330 
prevent you from putting the tee down
T&amp;T<00:03:36.109> down<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:36.769> can<00:03:36.919> actually<00:03:37.129> stand

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
T&amp;T down and so you can actually stand

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.150 
T&amp;T down and so you can actually stand
on<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.579> oh<00:03:42.760> just<00:03:43.760> barely<00:03:43.879> made<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.209> okay

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
on that oh just barely made it okay

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.650 
on that oh just barely made it okay
anyway<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:46.190> that's<00:03:46.519> that's<00:03:47.000> pretty<00:03:47.150> much<00:03:47.419> how

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
anyway so that's that's pretty much how

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.270 
anyway so that's that's pretty much how
the<00:03:47.720> high<00:03:47.959> jump<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.379> done<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.829> keep<00:03:49.040> raising

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
the high jump is done you keep raising

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.280 
the high jump is done you keep raising
the<00:03:49.489> bar<00:03:49.579> if<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.269> want<00:03:50.449> to<00:03:50.629> actually<00:03:50.780> look<00:03:51.139> up

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
the bar if you want to actually look up

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.830 
the bar if you want to actually look up
the<00:03:51.500> Official<00:03:51.980> Rules<00:03:52.010> for<00:03:52.400> high<00:03:52.579> jump<00:03:52.840> go

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
the Official Rules for high jump go

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.349 
the Official Rules for high jump go
ahead<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.139> do<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.730> because<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.150> can

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
ahead and do that because you can

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.400 
ahead and do that because you can
probably<00:03:56.599> read<00:03:56.840> more<00:03:56.870> about<00:03:57.230> how<00:03:57.349> the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
probably read more about how the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.069 
probably read more about how the
competitions<00:03:58.010> run<00:03:58.220> if<00:03:58.549> anything<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.299> not<00:03:59.840> very

clear<00:04:00.440> from<00:04:00.919> my<00:04:01.250> description<00:04:01.870> its<00:04:02.870> high<00:04:03.049> jump

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
clear from my description its high jump

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.839 
clear from my description its high jump
there's<00:04:03.620> like<00:04:03.889> just<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.310> redstone<00:04:04.669> wire

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
there's like just a redstone wire

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.580 
there's like just a redstone wire
running<00:04:05.120> underground<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.989> triggers<00:04:06.440> the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
running underground that triggers the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.680 
running underground that triggers the
two<00:04:06.709> TMT<00:04:07.190> down<00:04:07.370> here<00:04:07.730> it's<00:04:08.480> very<00:04:08.510> simple

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
two TMT down here it's very simple

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.250 
two TMT down here it's very simple
there's<00:04:09.440> not<00:04:09.560> much<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.859> it<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.780> long<00:04:12.230> jump

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
there's not much to it and the long jump

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.979 
there's not much to it and the long jump
over<00:04:12.739> here<00:04:12.949> is<00:04:13.190> also<00:04:13.579> very<00:04:13.790> simple<00:04:14.449> there<00:04:14.959> is

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
over here is also very simple there is

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.199 
over here is also very simple there is
there's<00:04:15.980> pressure<00:04:16.280> plates<00:04:16.519> here<00:04:16.849> that<00:04:17.150> you

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
there's pressure plates here that you

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.110 
there's pressure plates here that you
trigger<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.750> TNT<00:04:18.229> over<00:04:18.709> here<00:04:19.070> try<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:19.880> jump

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
trigger the TNT over here try and jump

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.800 
trigger the TNT over here try and jump
as<00:04:20.239> far<00:04:20.269> as<00:04:20.570> possible<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.640> whichever<00:04:22.810> you'll

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
as far as possible and whichever you'll

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.000 
as far as possible and whichever you'll
obviously<00:04:23.960> light<00:04:24.469> up<00:04:24.650> the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
obviously light up the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.460 
obviously light up the
the<00:04:25.130> lamps<00:04:26.090> on<00:04:26.240> here<00:04:26.660> when<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:26.990> trip<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.230> trip

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
the lamps on here when you trip the trip

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.250 
the lamps on here when you trip the trip
wires<00:04:27.710> down<00:04:28.070> here<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.910> whichever<00:04:29.690> one<00:04:30.020> is<00:04:30.170> the

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
wires down here and whichever one is the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.800 
wires down here and whichever one is the
farthest<00:04:30.590> one<00:04:30.740> back<00:04:30.980> is<00:04:31.310> your<00:04:32.000> score<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:34.810> well

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
farthest one back is your score and well

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.300 
farthest one back is your score and well
let<00:04:35.960> me<00:04:35.990> just<00:04:36.200> do<00:04:36.290> it<00:04:36.320> first<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:36.950> I'll<00:04:37.040> explain

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
let me just do it first and I'll explain

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:45.130 
let me just do it first and I'll explain
a<00:04:37.370> bit<00:04:42.580> there<00:04:43.580> we<00:04:43.670> go<00:04:43.790> okay<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.180> then<00:04:44.510> this<00:04:44.930> is

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
a bit there we go okay so then this is

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.870 
a bit there we go okay so then this is
the<00:04:45.260> one<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.620> farthest<00:04:45.950> one<00:04:46.100> back<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.730> lit

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
the one the farthest one back that lit

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.200 
the one the farthest one back that lit
up<00:04:46.910> so<00:04:47.830> I'll<00:04:48.830> just<00:04:48.950> put<00:04:49.580> something<00:04:49.820> there<00:04:50.030> to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
up so I'll just put something there to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.830 
up so I'll just put something there to
mark<00:04:50.390> it<00:04:51.700> you'll<00:04:52.700> notice<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:53.060> had<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.270> stop<00:04:53.570> a

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
mark it you'll notice I had to stop a

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.020 
mark it you'll notice I had to stop a
little<00:04:54.260> bit<00:04:54.350> in<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.620> middle<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.070> that's

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
little bit in the middle and that's

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.090 
little bit in the middle and that's
because<00:04:56.420> I<00:04:56.450> purposely<00:04:57.170> place<00:04:57.530> these<00:04:57.770> pressure

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
because I purposely place these pressure

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.220 
because I purposely place these pressure
plates<00:04:58.520> there<00:04:59.240> was<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.390> lot<00:04:59.540> of<00:04:59.570> alliteration

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
plates there was a lot of alliteration

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.110 
plates there was a lot of alliteration
there<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.680> purposely<00:05:01.370> placed<00:05:01.640> these<00:05:01.880> pressure

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
there I purposely placed these pressure

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.750 
there I purposely placed these pressure
plates<00:05:02.450> so<00:05:02.810> that<00:05:03.110> it's<00:05:03.950> sort<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.250> awkward<00:05:04.460> you

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
plates so that it's sort of awkward you

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.670 
plates so that it's sort of awkward you
can't<00:05:04.970> just<00:05:05.180> sprint<00:05:05.510> in<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:05.840> jump<00:05:06.140> you<00:05:06.650> have

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
can't just sprint in and jump you have

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.430 
can't just sprint in and jump you have
to<00:05:07.090> try<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.270> time<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.750> bit<00:05:08.930> better<00:05:09.140> than

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
to try and time it a bit better than

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.260 
to try and time it a bit better than
that<00:05:09.470> if<00:05:10.040> you<00:05:10.160> do<00:05:10.310> just<00:05:10.610> try<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:10.850> sprint<00:05:11.180> and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
that if you do just try and sprint and

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.400 
that if you do just try and sprint and
then<00:05:11.330> jump<00:05:11.600> you're<00:05:11.780> actually<00:05:12.080> just<00:05:12.200> going<00:05:12.350> to

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
then jump you're actually just going to

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.560 
then jump you're actually just going to
run<00:05:12.680> right<00:05:12.920> into<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:14.180> tripwire<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:16.340> my<00:05:17.240> it

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
run right into the tripwire and my it

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.370 
run right into the tripwire and my it
actually<00:05:17.960> landed<00:05:18.380> right<00:05:18.470> here<00:05:19.510> an<00:05:20.510> unassisted

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
actually landed right here an unassisted

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.730 
actually landed right here an unassisted
high<00:05:21.740> jump<00:05:22.040> is<00:05:22.190> not<00:05:22.220> very<00:05:22.520> good<00:05:22.730> so<00:05:23.440> yeah<00:05:24.440> so

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
high jump is not very good so yeah so

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.170 
high jump is not very good so yeah so
you<00:05:24.830> have<00:05:24.980> to<00:05:25.100> actually<00:05:25.250> slow<00:05:25.610> down<00:05:25.640> and<00:05:25.940> stop

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
you have to actually slow down and stop

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.630 
you have to actually slow down and stop
and<00:05:26.540> that<00:05:26.660> adds<00:05:26.900> a<00:05:27.110> lot<00:05:27.590> of<00:05:27.650> a<00:05:27.920> lot<00:05:28.130> more<00:05:28.280> skill

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
and that adds a lot of a lot more skill

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.740 
and that adds a lot of a lot more skill
to<00:05:28.670> the<00:05:29.450> jump<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:30.040> try<00:05:31.040> it<00:05:31.100> again<00:05:31.220> I<00:05:31.610> know<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.510> can

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
to the jump I try it again I know I can

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.650 
to the jump I try it again I know I can
do<00:05:32.840> better<00:05:33.020> than<00:05:33.140> I<00:05:33.440> did<00:05:33.770> yeah<00:05:34.400> there<00:05:34.550> we<00:05:34.610> go

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
do better than I did yeah there we go

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.810 
do better than I did yeah there we go
all<00:05:35.660> right<00:05:35.720> so<00:05:36.680> that<00:05:36.800> was<00:05:36.980> where<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.250> got<00:05:37.460> it<00:05:37.640> and

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
all right so that was where I got it and

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.970 
all right so that was where I got it and
then<00:05:38.570> I've<00:05:38.750> done<00:05:38.960> better<00:05:39.200> than<00:05:39.470> that<00:05:39.590> before<00:05:39.770> I

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
then I've done better than that before I

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.800 
then I've done better than that before I
think<00:05:40.160> my<00:05:40.220> records<00:05:40.550> like<00:05:40.760> 11<00:05:41.270> meters<00:05:41.600> or

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
think my records like 11 meters or

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.650 
think my records like 11 meters or
something<00:05:41.960> but<00:05:42.800> yeah<00:05:43.610> so<00:05:43.850> you<00:05:43.940> just<00:05:44.120> you<00:05:44.480> just

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
something but yeah so you just you just

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.030 
something but yeah so you just you just
take<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:44.840> look<00:05:45.050> at<00:05:45.230> whichever<00:05:45.470> lamp<00:05:45.800> is<00:05:46.010> the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
take a look at whichever lamp is the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.280 
take a look at whichever lamp is the
farthest<00:05:46.490> one<00:05:46.520> back<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:47.720> gets<00:05:47.870> lit<00:05:48.140> up

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
farthest one back that gets lit up

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.140 
farthest one back that gets lit up
during<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.800> jump<00:05:49.010> that's<00:05:49.490> it<00:05:49.730> there's<00:05:50.060> very

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
during the jump that's it there's very

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.720 
during the jump that's it there's very
little<00:05:50.420> redstone<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.370> again<00:05:52.370> I<00:05:52.400> just<00:05:52.610> use

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
little redstone to it again I just use

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.190 
little redstone to it again I just use
these<00:05:52.850> lily<00:05:53.090> pads<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.510> block<00:05:53.690> off<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:54.020> water

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
these lily pads to block off the water

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.840 
these lily pads to block off the water
source<00:05:54.470> block<00:05:54.740> so<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:54.980> don't<00:05:55.160> accidentally

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
source block so you don't accidentally

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.320 
source block so you don't accidentally
put<00:05:56.840> TNT<00:05:57.680> there<00:05:57.860> there's<00:05:58.730> just<00:05:58.850> a<00:05:59.120> single

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
put TNT there there's just a single

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.630 
put TNT there there's just a single
redstone<00:05:59.900> wire<00:06:00.080> running<00:06:00.410> underground<00:06:00.640> to

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
redstone wire running underground to

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.120 
redstone wire running underground to
activate<00:06:02.150> this<00:06:02.390> T<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:02.990> T<00:06:03.200> that's<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:04.100> very

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
activate this T and T that's it very

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.720 
activate this T and T that's it very
simple<00:06:04.990> that's<00:06:05.990> why<00:06:06.110> I<00:06:06.140> put<00:06:06.380> these<00:06:06.950> two<00:06:07.190> events

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
simple that's why I put these two events

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.280 
simple that's why I put these two events
together<00:06:08.360> in<00:06:08.540> a<00:06:08.600> single<00:06:08.870> episode<00:06:08.930> they're

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
together in a single episode they're

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.660 
together in a single episode they're
very<00:06:09.410> similar<00:06:09.620> events<00:06:10.070> obviously<00:06:10.550> they're

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
very similar events obviously they're

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.900 
very similar events obviously they're
jump<00:06:10.910> events<00:06:11.300> but<00:06:11.480> also<00:06:11.650> they<00:06:12.650> are<00:06:13.490> just<00:06:13.760> very

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
jump events but also they are just very

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.200 
jump events but also they are just very
they're<00:06:14.690> simple<00:06:15.230> and<00:06:15.850> so<00:06:16.850> I<00:06:16.910> didn't<00:06:17.090> think

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
they're simple and so I didn't think

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.230 
they're simple and so I didn't think
each<00:06:17.420> one<00:06:17.450> required<00:06:18.080> its<00:06:18.320> own<00:06:18.530> video<00:06:19.090> well<00:06:20.090> as

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
each one required its own video well as

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.780 
each one required its own video well as
