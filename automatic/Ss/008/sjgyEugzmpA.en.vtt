00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050

with diagnosed terminal skin cancer and

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.990 
with diagnosed terminal skin cancer and
I<00:00:29.650> kind<00:00:29.859> of<00:00:29.920> felt<00:00:30.100> I'd<00:00:30.220> like<00:00:30.400> to<00:00:30.520> do<00:00:30.640> something

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
I kind of felt I'd like to do something

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.970 
I kind of felt I'd like to do something
to<00:00:31.060> help<00:00:31.150> raise<00:00:31.420> money<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:31.960> I'd<00:00:32.529> only<00:00:32.680> taken

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
to help raise money and I'd only taken

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.700 
to help raise money and I'd only taken
up<00:00:33.190> cycling<00:00:33.460> last<00:00:33.879> year<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.870> had<00:00:35.080> loved<00:00:35.350> the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
up cycling last year and had loved the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.080 
up cycling last year and had loved the
actual<00:00:36.040> cycling<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.640> competitive

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
actual cycling and the competitive

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.850 
actual cycling and the competitive
nature<00:00:37.120> other<00:00:37.600> than<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.930> physical<00:00:38.230> exertion

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
nature other than the physical exertion

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.439 
nature other than the physical exertion
so<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:39.250> said<00:00:39.730> we<00:00:39.940> might<00:00:40.059> as<00:00:40.210> well<00:00:40.300> do<00:00:40.420> something

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
so I said we might as well do something

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.259 
so I said we might as well do something
to<00:00:40.840> fundraising<00:00:41.230> true<00:00:41.530> cycling<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.580> then<00:00:43.150> the

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
to fundraising true cycling and then the

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.520 
to fundraising true cycling and then the
idea<00:00:43.480> came<00:00:43.629> into<00:00:43.809> my<00:00:43.900> head<00:00:43.989> why<00:00:44.170> don't<00:00:44.350> we<00:00:44.410> try

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
idea came into my head why don't we try

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.649 
idea came into my head why don't we try
and<00:00:44.739> complete<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.160> route<00:00:45.309> of<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.489> Ross<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:46.629> I

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
and complete the route of the Ross so I

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.210 
and complete the route of the Ross so I
made<00:00:46.960> contact<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.470> would<00:00:47.559> feel<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.799> Cassidy

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
made contact and would feel of Cassidy

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.530 
made contact and would feel of Cassidy
initially<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:48.850> he<00:00:49.180> taught<00:00:49.330> it<00:00:49.420> was<00:00:49.510> a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
initially and he taught it was a

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.570 
initially and he taught it was a
fantastic<00:00:49.809> idea<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.890> suggested<00:00:51.370> that<00:00:51.460> we

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
fantastic idea and suggested that we

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.219 
fantastic idea and suggested that we
actually<00:00:51.760> do<00:00:52.030> diluted<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.690> Ross<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:53.049> same

day<00:00:53.440> as<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.589> actual<00:00:53.769> Ross<00:00:54.040> itself<00:00:54.489> but<00:00:55.059> head

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
day as the actual Ross itself but head

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.430
