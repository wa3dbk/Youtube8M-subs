been a 2 to 3 days anyway so it's great

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
in the the rank up guide and it's just

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
in the the rank up guide and it's just
it's<00:00:50.399> terrible<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> try<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.329> back

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it's terrible when you try and get back

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.600 
it's terrible when you try and get back
on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> sticks<00:00:51.960> after<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> few<00:00:53.010> days<00:00:53.190> off<00:00:53.399> I'm

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
on the sticks after a few days off I'm

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.490 
on the sticks after a few days off I'm
gonna<00:00:53.760> play<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.390> sensitivity<00:00:54.899> which<00:00:55.260> ends

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
gonna play on for sensitivity which ends

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.360 
gonna play on for sensitivity which ends
up<00:00:55.559> feeling<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.899> slow

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
up feeling really you know really slow

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.950 
up feeling really you know really slow
but<00:00:59.370> then<00:00:59.520> when<00:00:59.670> you've<00:00:59.789> got<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.180> we've<00:01:00.690> taken

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
but then when you've got to we've taken

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080 
but then when you've got to we've taken
a<00:01:01.079> few<00:01:01.109> days<00:01:01.410> off<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.890> try<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.789> back<00:01:02.910> on

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a few days off you try and get back on

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.359 
a few days off you try and get back on
it<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.359> suddenly<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.470> sensitivity<00:01:04.979> feels

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it and suddenly for sensitivity feels

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.840 
it and suddenly for sensitivity feels
like<00:01:05.610> tender<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:07.409> takes<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> while<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.490> get

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
like tender it takes a while to get get

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.490 
like tender it takes a while to get get
by<00:01:08.970> used<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.229> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
by used to it and I think you can see in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.730 
by used to it and I think you can see in
this<00:01:10.619> game<00:01:10.860> I've<00:01:11.250> kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> fail<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> few<00:01:12.510> times

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
this game I've kind of fail a few times

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.960 
this game I've kind of fail a few times
particularly<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> throwing<00:01:14.460> knives<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
particularly with the throwing knives I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.600 
particularly with the throwing knives I
think<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.240> try<00:01:15.450> getting<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.409> 83<00:01:17.040> knife<00:01:17.310> kills

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
think I try getting about 83 knife kills

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
think I try getting about 83 knife kills
and<00:01:17.850> don't<00:01:18.000> much<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> get<00:01:18.479> any<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> them

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
and don't much to get any one of them

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130 
and don't much to get any one of them
and<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.549> setup<00:01:20.909> I'm<00:01:21.030> using<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> mp5<00:01:21.930> in

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and the setup I'm using for the mp5 in

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.030 
and the setup I'm using for the mp5 in
this<00:01:22.259> particular<00:01:22.500> game<00:01:22.830> was<00:01:23.159> rapid<00:01:24.000> fire<00:01:24.210> +

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
this particular game was rapid fire +

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.100 
this particular game was rapid fire +
silencer<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> two<00:01:26.610> attachments

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
silencer with the two attachments

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
silencer with the two attachments
proficiency<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.310> good<00:01:29.490> really

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
proficiency this is a really good really

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.990 
proficiency this is a really good really
good<00:01:30.299> setup<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.829> really<00:01:32.009> increases<00:01:32.729> or

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
good setup it like really increases or

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.649 
good setup it like really increases or
decreases<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:35.220> might<00:01:35.460> improves<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.210> time<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
decreases it might improves the time to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
decreases it might improves the time to
kill<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.619> people<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
kill so you can take people out in a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.850 
kill so you can take people out in a
split<00:01:38.430> second<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.990> only<00:01:40.110> downside<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
split second but the only downside is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.700 
split second but the only downside is
obviously<00:01:41.220> without<00:01:41.490> using<00:01:42.000> kick<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:43.320> did

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
obviously without using kick they did

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
obviously without using kick they did
quite<00:01:43.920> moderate<00:01:44.369> recoil<00:01:44.640> they've<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
quite moderate recoil they've got on the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.980 
quite moderate recoil they've got on the
mp5<00:01:46.020> anyway<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.970> is<00:01:47.970> pretty<00:01:48.540> no<00:01:48.840> have

mp5 anyway is is pretty no have
something<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> can't<00:01:49.860> even<00:01:49.979> name<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
something so they I can't even name that

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.399 
something so they I can't even name that
that<00:01:50.850> little<00:01:51.149> let<00:01:51.420> bouncing<00:01:51.780> betty<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.229> got<00:01:52.380> a

that little let bouncing betty and got a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
that little let bouncing betty and got a
bit<00:01:52.530> bit<00:01:53.009> frustrated<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:53.909> started

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
bit bit frustrated and just started

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.520 
bit bit frustrated and just started
shooting<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> air<00:01:54.960> you'll<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> couple

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
shooting in the air you'll see a couple

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.039 
shooting in the air you'll see a couple
of<00:01:55.590> those<00:01:55.740> moments<00:01:55.950> where<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.520> kind<00:01:56.729> of

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
of those moments where I was kind of

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.109 
of those moments where I was kind of
standstill<00:01:58.049> after<00:01:58.200> her<00:01:58.409> death<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.860> just

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
standstill after her death and just

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
standstill after her death and just
think<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> myself<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.899> take<00:02:01.380> some<00:02:01.530> deep

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
think to myself and take some deep

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.210 
think to myself and take some deep
breaths<00:02:01.920> through<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:03.420> whole<00:02:03.600> route

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.180 

so<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.459> guess<00:02:08.940> good<00:02:09.360> talk<00:02:09.539> about<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:10.500> perks<00:02:10.800> in

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
don't look at this base this is just

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.599 
don't look at this base this is just
terrible

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
terrible

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.120

but<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.570> guy<00:03:12.810> was<00:03:13.019> just<00:03:13.049> checking<00:03:13.560> Facebook

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130

but that guy was just checking Facebook
wasn't<00:03:14.370> even<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.850> game<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.060> still<00:03:15.450> managed

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
wasn't even in the game I still managed

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.250 
wasn't even in the game I still managed
to<00:03:16.019> fail<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.530> not<00:03:16.680> killing<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.989> think<00:03:19.200> I

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
to fail and not killing but I think I

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.620 
to fail and not killing but I think I
get<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> couple<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.880> little<00:03:20.880> streaks<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.420> don't

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
get a couple of little streaks I don't

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.750 
get a couple of little streaks I don't

manage to get to the full specialist

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.060 
manage to get to the full specialist
except<00:03:24.060> for<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:24.600> time<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.200> then<00:03:25.320> die

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
except for one time and then die

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.060 
except for one time and then die
straight<00:03:26.400> after<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.700> but<00:03:27.709> like<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.739> mentioned

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
straight after it but like I mentioned

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.729 
straight after it but like I mentioned
I've<00:03:29.130> been<00:03:29.160> trying<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.609> wear<00:03:30.560> experiment<00:03:31.560> with

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
the different specialist package I think

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.690

I've gone for what

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.670 
I've gone for what
I<00:04:15.040> can't<00:04:15.370> remember<00:04:15.900> but<00:04:16.900> for<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.199> second<00:04:17.530> tier

I can't remember but for the second tier

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.319 
I can't remember but for the second tier
anyway<00:04:17.979> I've<00:04:18.100> got<00:04:18.310> hardline<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:18.880> then<00:04:19.209> it

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
anyway I've got hardline and then it

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.539 
anyway I've got hardline and then it
goes<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.540> quick-draw<00:04:20.169> and<00:04:20.380> then<00:04:21.040> assassin

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
goes to quick-draw and then assassin

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.070 
goes to quick-draw and then assassin
I've<00:04:21.699> been<00:04:21.850> trying<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.180> ponder<00:04:22.540> which<00:04:22.690> which

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
I've been trying to ponder which which

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.050 
I've been trying to ponder which which
way<00:04:23.290> around<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.889> should<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.639> whether<00:04:24.790> to<00:04:24.940> go

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
way around I should do it whether to go

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.760 
way around I should do it whether to go
for<00:04:25.210> assassin<00:04:25.630> first<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.139> then<00:04:26.260> quickly<00:04:26.500> whoa

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
for assassin first and then quickly whoa

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.800 
for assassin first and then quickly whoa
I<00:04:27.010> don't<00:04:27.400> know<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.580> think<00:04:27.880> quick-draw<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:28.600> one

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
I don't know I think quick-draw is one

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.600 
I don't know I think quick-draw is one
of<00:04:28.900> those<00:04:29.020> perks<00:04:29.320> that's<00:04:29.680> really<00:04:30.340> underrated

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
of those perks that's really underrated

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.629 
of those perks that's really underrated
on<00:04:31.510> paper<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.199> doesn't<00:04:32.410> really<00:04:32.560> seem<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.490> give

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
on paper it doesn't really seem to give

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.010 
on paper it doesn't really seem to give
you<00:04:33.669> that<00:04:33.850> many<00:04:34.030> advantages<00:04:34.360> but<00:04:34.660> when<00:04:34.900> you

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
you that many advantages but when you

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.680 
you that many advantages but when you
when<00:04:35.350> you're<00:04:35.470> playing<00:04:35.680> on<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:36.060> on<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.120> game<00:04:37.419> where

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
when you're playing on a on a game where

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.650 
when you're playing on a on a game where
twitch<00:04:38.639> encounters<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.669> really<00:04:40.150> important

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
twitch encounters a really important

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.260 
twitch encounters a really important
been<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.020> first<00:04:41.260> person<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:42.430> open<00:04:42.729> fire<00:04:42.940> I

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
been the first person to to open fire I

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.330 
been the first person to to open fire I
think<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:43.900> more<00:04:44.380> important<00:04:44.949> than<00:04:45.160> mine

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
think it's more important than mine

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.550 
think it's more important than mine
certainly<00:04:45.880> might<00:04:46.090> like<00:04:46.540> really<00:04:46.810> first

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
certainly might like really first

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.060 
certainly might like really first
consider<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:49.180> where<00:04:49.449> I'm<00:04:50.320> still<00:04:50.650> balancing

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
consider so where I'm still balancing

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.469 
consider so where I'm still balancing
between<00:04:51.160> quick-draw<00:04:51.789> and<00:04:51.820> assassin<00:04:52.270> assassin

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
between quick-draw and assassin assassin

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.409 
between quick-draw and assassin assassin
probably<00:04:53.050> in<00:04:53.500> super<00:04:54.250> important<00:04:54.880> they<00:04:55.120> wanted

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
probably in super important they wanted

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.420 
probably in super important they wanted
staff<00:04:55.660> with<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.990> radar<00:04:56.380> but<00:04:57.039> I<00:04:57.070> guess<00:04:57.280> that

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
staff with the radar but I guess that

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.260 
staff with the radar but I guess that
all<00:04:57.550> depends<00:04:57.880> on<00:04:58.260> how<00:04:59.260> good<00:04:59.800> your<00:05:00.550> enemies<00:05:01.090> are

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
all depends on how good your enemies are

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.350 
all depends on how good your enemies are
in<00:05:01.570> whether<00:05:02.410> they've<00:05:02.650> got<00:05:02.970> UAVs<00:05:03.970> in<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.210> air

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
in whether they've got UAVs in the air

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.290 
in whether they've got UAVs in the air
and<00:05:04.830> when<00:05:05.830> it's<00:05:05.979> whether<00:05:06.490> like<00:05:06.760> hunting<00:05:07.180> you

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
and when it's whether like hunting you

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.820 
and when it's whether like hunting you
out<00:05:07.449> from<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.990> little<00:05:08.410> red<00:05:08.530> dot<00:05:08.710> on<00:05:08.800> the

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
so that's the game anyway so I think it

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.150 
so that's the game anyway so I think it
ended<00:06:09.490> up<00:06:09.580> being<00:06:09.789> a<00:06:10.030> 39<00:06:10.979> slightly<00:06:11.979> higher<00:06:12.130> than

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
ended up being a 39 slightly higher than

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.219 
ended up being a 39 slightly higher than
usual<00:06:12.729> in<00:06:12.849> terms<00:06:13.090> of<00:06:13.210> deaths<00:06:13.389> but<00:06:13.690> so<00:06:13.960> if<00:06:14.050> you

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229
