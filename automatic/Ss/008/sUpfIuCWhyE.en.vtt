00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
not really sure of his upbringing at the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.430 
not really sure of his upbringing at the
beginning<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.150> what<00:02:38.270> his<00:02:38.420> story<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.810> exactly

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
beginning and what his story is exactly

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.590 
beginning and what his story is exactly
but<00:02:39.650> he<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.070> typical<00:02:40.520> character<00:02:40.940> who's<00:02:41.570> a

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
but he is a typical character who's a

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.570 
but he is a typical character who's a
little<00:02:41.990> snarky<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.709> little<00:02:43.130> bit<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.280> an<00:02:43.340> ask

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
little snarky a little bit of an ask

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.600 
little snarky a little bit of an ask
sometimes<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.630> kind<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.739> mean<00:02:45.950> at<00:02:46.220> times<00:02:46.430> but

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
sometimes and kind of mean at times but

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.979 
sometimes and kind of mean at times but
I<00:02:46.670> think<00:02:46.760> his<00:02:47.120> character<00:02:47.300> development<00:02:47.810> is

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
I think his character development is

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.560 
I think his character development is
going<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.320> be<00:02:48.459> amazing<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.880> series<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.480> I

talked<00:04:24.590> about<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:24.800> kind<00:04:24.979> of

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
talked about this kind of

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.040 
talked about this kind of
magic<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:25.850> this<00:04:26.300> magic<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:26.750> would<00:04:26.840> help<00:04:26.930> you

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
basically be invincible immortal so sin

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.390 
basically be invincible immortal so sin
is<00:04:29.690> kind<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.020> looking<00:04:30.380> for<00:04:30.620> that<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:30.980> she's

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
seven different perspectives that we end

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.400 
seven different perspectives that we end
up<00:04:43.850> cycling<00:04:44.330> through<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.690> some<00:04:44.900> perspectives

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
up cycling through and some perspectives

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.659 
up cycling through and some perspectives
we<00:04:45.500> get<00:04:45.650> more<00:04:45.830> often<00:04:46.100> than<00:04:46.250> others<00:04:46.520> but

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
we get more often than others but

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.280 
we get more often than others but
typically<00:04:47.060> speaking<00:04:47.480> all<00:04:47.720> of<00:04:47.870> them<00:04:47.990> are<00:04:48.110> kind

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
typically speaking all of them are kind

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.750

of equal throughout the story

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.040 
of equal throughout the story
I<00:04:49.790> enjoy<00:04:50.240> pretty<00:04:50.540> much<00:04:50.660> all<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:50.990> the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
I enjoy pretty much all of the

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.360 
I enjoy pretty much all of the
perspectives<00:04:51.230> that<00:04:51.560> we<00:04:51.740> got<00:04:51.919> so<00:04:52.100> I<00:04:52.160> didn't

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
perspectives that we got so I didn't

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.680 
perspectives that we got so I didn't
find<00:04:52.490> myself<00:04:52.639> particularly<00:04:53.090> bored<00:04:53.510> the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
find myself particularly bored the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.150 
find myself particularly bored the
problem<00:04:53.930> that<00:04:53.990> I<00:04:54.110> had<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.470> that<00:04:54.590> since<00:04:54.770> every

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
problem that I had is that since every

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.190 
problem that I had is that since every
single<00:04:55.880> chapter<00:04:56.150> changes<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:56.990> different

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
single chapter changes to a different

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.260 
single chapter changes to a different
perspective<00:04:57.350> every<00:04:58.310> chapter<00:04:58.700> basically<00:04:58.820> ends

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
perspective every chapter basically ends

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.520 
perspective every chapter basically ends
on<00:04:59.389> a<00:04:59.419> cliffhanger<00:04:59.510> for<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.350> other

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
on a cliffhanger for the other

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.140 
on a cliffhanger for the other
perspective<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.430> have<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.729> wait<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:01.940> little

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
perspective so you have to wait a little

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.610 
perspective so you have to wait a little
bit<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.540> get<00:05:02.630> back<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> controlling<00:05:03.470> on

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
bit to get back to the controlling on

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.500 
bit to get back to the controlling on
there<00:05:03.889> so<00:05:04.400> even<00:05:04.580> though<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:04.820> would<00:05:05.150> enjoy<00:05:05.300> the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
there so even though I would enjoy the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.930 
there so even though I would enjoy the
next<00:05:05.900> chapter<00:05:06.229> as<00:05:06.350> well<00:05:06.620> I'd<00:05:07.250> be<00:05:07.430> thinking<00:05:07.790> oh

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
next chapter as well I'd be thinking oh

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.490 
next chapter as well I'd be thinking oh
I<00:05:08.240> wish<00:05:08.389> I<00:05:08.510> knew<00:05:08.690> what<00:05:08.720> was<00:05:08.840> going<00:05:08.930> on<00:05:09.260> in<00:05:09.350> this

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
I wish I knew what was going on in this

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.810 
I wish I knew what was going on in this
chapter<00:05:09.740> still<00:05:10.130> but<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:10.340> have<00:05:10.460> to<00:05:10.610> wait<00:05:10.790> a

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
chapter still but I have to wait a

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.460 
chapter still but I have to wait a
little<00:05:11.030> bit<00:05:11.270> so<00:05:11.450> wasn't<00:05:11.750> any<00:05:11.990> of<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.260> other

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
little bit so wasn't any of the other

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.110 
little bit so wasn't any of the other
chapters<00:05:12.740> were<00:05:12.979> boring<00:05:13.280> it's<00:05:13.880> just<00:05:14.030> that

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
chapters were boring it's just that

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.969 
chapters were boring it's just that
every<00:05:14.330> single<00:05:14.630> one<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.470> on<00:05:15.560> some<00:05:15.710> kind<00:05:15.889> of

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
every single one and it on some kind of

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.219 
every single one and it on some kind of
like<00:05:16.220> tension<00:05:16.940> point<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:17.900> want<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.139> know

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
like tension point and you want to know

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.629 
like tension point and you want to know
what's<00:05:18.380> going<00:05:18.590> on<00:05:18.650> with<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:18.950> and<00:05:19.280> then<00:05:19.580> you

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
what's going on with that and then you

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.530 
what's going on with that and then you
could<00:05:19.760> pull<00:05:19.910> them<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.090> next<00:05:20.360> one<00:05:20.510> that

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
could pull them to the next one that

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.080 
could pull them to the next one that
would<00:05:20.870> an<00:05:21.050> attention<00:05:21.500> point<00:05:21.740> in<00:05:21.889> etc<00:05:22.490> etc<00:05:22.639> so

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
would an attention point in etc etc so

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.310 
would an attention point in etc etc so
if<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.270> are<00:05:23.450> into<00:05:23.690> those<00:05:23.810> kinds<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.110> stories

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
if you are into those kinds of stories

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.440 
if you are into those kinds of stories
and<00:05:24.560> switching<00:05:24.889> POVs<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:25.610> do<00:05:25.850> not<00:05:26.060> believe<00:05:26.300> you

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
and switching POVs I do not believe you

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.780 
and switching POVs I do not believe you
will<00:05:26.510> like<00:05:26.690> this<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:27.110> enjoyed<00:05:27.950> it<00:05:28.160> and<00:05:28.310> I<00:05:28.639> was

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
will like this I enjoyed it and I was

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.370 
will like this I enjoyed it and I was
ultimately<00:05:29.030> ok<00:05:29.539> with<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:29.840> but<00:05:30.169> it<00:05:30.260> is

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
ultimately ok with it but it is

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.750 
ultimately ok with it but it is
something<00:05:30.530> that<00:05:30.680> kind<00:05:30.950> of<00:05:31.039> irked<00:05:31.190> me<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.370> little

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
something that kind of irked me a little

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.219 
something that kind of irked me a little
bit<00:05:31.880> since<00:05:32.450> there<00:05:32.570> are<00:05:32.660> some<00:05:32.810> 8<00:05:32.870> characters<00:05:33.169> I

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
bit since there are some 8 characters I

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.990 
bit since there are some 8 characters I
really<00:05:33.410> can't<00:05:33.620> get<00:05:33.770> in<00:05:33.979> depth<00:05:34.310> about<00:05:34.520> any<00:05:34.850> of

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
really can't get in depth about any of

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.610 
really can't get in depth about any of
them<00:05:35.120> but<00:05:35.330> I<00:05:35.360> will<00:05:35.570> say<00:05:35.780> that<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:35.990> really<00:05:36.410> enjoy

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
them but I will say that I really enjoy

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.960 
them but I will say that I really enjoy
pretty<00:05:36.890> much<00:05:36.979> all<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.310> characters<00:05:37.700> I<00:05:37.789> find

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
pretty much all the characters I find

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.190 
pretty much all the characters I find
them<00:05:38.090> all<00:05:38.210> very<00:05:38.390> interesting<00:05:38.900> they<00:05:38.990> all<00:05:39.110> have

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
them all very interesting they all have

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.230 
them all very interesting they all have
different<00:05:39.229> motivations<00:05:39.560> they<00:05:40.250> all<00:05:40.400> are<00:05:40.669> kind

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
to talk about the plot as I already

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.650 
to talk about the plot as I already
mentioned<00:06:25.100> the<00:06:25.430> chapters<00:06:25.850> do<00:06:26.060> switch<00:06:26.360> around

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
mentioned the chapters do switch around

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.510 
mentioned the chapters do switch around
a<00:06:26.810> bit<00:06:26.960> so<00:06:27.169> there<00:06:27.350> is<00:06:27.500> this<00:06:27.680> kind<00:06:27.919> of<00:06:28.070> like<00:06:28.220> stop

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
a bit so there is this kind of like stop

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.670 
a bit so there is this kind of like stop
and<00:06:28.760> go<00:06:28.910> a<00:06:28.940> little<00:06:29.120> bit<00:06:29.360> within<00:06:29.690> the<00:06:29.900> plot<00:06:30.139> but

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
and go a little bit within the plot but

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.529 
and go a little bit within the plot but
ultimately<00:06:31.190> it<00:06:31.550> is<00:06:31.880> moving<00:06:32.300> forward

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
ultimately it is moving forward

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.240 
ultimately it is moving forward
especially<00:06:32.870> in<00:06:33.349> the<00:06:33.440> last<00:06:33.620> half<00:06:33.919> of<00:06:33.979> the<00:06:34.070> book
