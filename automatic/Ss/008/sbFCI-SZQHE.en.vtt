00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.439
 I saw test summit 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.390
 haidar 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.919
 do not 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.010
 djs 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.710
 it's almost time for the final battle and 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.770
 we're going against the team that destroyed 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.010
 totally excalibur starbreaker of evil 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.060
 moment to be without your base and I 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.520
 we have come very far to 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.290
 worry about things like that we'll have to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.110
 fight using all the force that 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.630
 we have I will win one and china will win the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.340
 another we will all crush to be 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.200
 breaker and we will take revenge of what you 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.390
 they made their low and there 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.190
 you are reminded that your old friend 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.680
 will be part of the team in duels 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.349
 final 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.659
 if they can not win two duels in a row 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.640
 then masamune or zynga will have to 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.069
 fight a second battle to conclude 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.140
 the director said he's going to get a 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.469
 permission to find a replacement not 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.269
 that is madoka whether there is a 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.849
 third member on the team not that 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.340
 will change your way of thinking there since 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.139
 this is the final battle I think there's 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.840
 that try to increase the possibilities 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.450
 to win as you want it to be 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.209
 I suppose if we do not leave this time 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.780
 those who will feel worse for that will be 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.830
 your house and me 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 that's true I do understand what burned that 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.120
 it means but to whom in the world 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.120
 we could add to the team 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.190
 such if I already told me if I want to already 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.860
 would like to help us with this I think 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.860
 that would be a good option and I already 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.000
 but who knows where he is now 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.760
 he's not really an easy kid 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.720
 find 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.780
 do not 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.650
 all right 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.650
 but life 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.630
 I fought side by side with them in the 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.760
 battle of selection of representatives and 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.850
 also trained very strong from 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.600
 then please guys can I get in 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.600
 want 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.410
 or maybe I do not think maybe if we have 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.510
 had who is on our side 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.450
 from the beginning if it was that I entered his 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.290
 base and I would understand him too if I 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.290
 I would feel 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.060
 do not decide yet 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.570
 now 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.570
 do not 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.240
 if not 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.520
 how long without seeing us eat the recipe 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.710
 of his plans is a legacy of four 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.490
 millennia eat them to use to get close to 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.820
 sure forward to rimense is not to marry 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.490
 is please encourage me the blind innkeeper 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.380
 in management they are doing here 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.660
 We came to see them because we knew that 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.030
 they have shrill problems and the rest of 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.800
 one fusion will fill the gap left by 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.870
 its base 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.060
 where they found out about that do not take the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.970
 Chinese information network of 4000 years to 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.490
 the slight that someone takes the vacancy 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.490
 of your replacement member we have 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.339
 we will help your team besides we 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.619
 I would love to participate in the battle 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:25.499
 so we kill two birds of 

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:31.369
 holes two birds with one shot 'good 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:31.369
 can choose who they want from me 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.110
 and it was already decided and it was decided in 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.530
 serious ah I know what it is about 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.690
 they are going to say then that whoever wins 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.580
 in a battle bay will be the member of 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.580
 galaxy cangas replacement 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:59.400
 it was clear not the winner will be the 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.680
 cangas replacement member galaxy 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.310
 I'm going to make the scrap member not 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.920
 I'll be the one talking 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.250
 and for the information the winner will be 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:16.970
 and what do you think is good all 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.970
 they are willing because it is not now 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.480
 he carries it 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.240
 in the battle of 5 is exciting not 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.490
 believe in yourself not 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.490
 and they will not sit there or yes 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.510
 please tell me you are not going to enter 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.510
 combat also 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:58.600
 of course it does not invest good 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.600
 work 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.580
 In the end my dream is to be the best 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.580
 world 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.940
 but dreams are fulfilled only if 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.940
 efforts 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:27.979
 you 're not bad at all yet at that level 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.979
 can you beat my friend 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.510
 This power 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.610
 now I live 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.610
 yes, yes 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.150
 placed in this battle are all my 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.150
 enemies 

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:54.429
 how good they are but you do me too 

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:54.429
 I want to fight 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.680
 but you are too powerful
