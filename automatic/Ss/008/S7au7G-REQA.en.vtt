00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.489
 hi they are technocratic as is 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.710
 consider and have fanatic dotcom and 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.330
 following with the unpacking of the water 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.580
 what we are going to do now is a video 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.080
 showing us how to synchronize it 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.860
 with our iphone 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 let's go with the video 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.960
 I just learned the clock and then about 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.600
 30-40 seconds of delay and more or less 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.370
 in presenting us this screen we are going to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.059
 choose English because my cell phone 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.350
 I have in English 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.899
 let's place here 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.120
 let the match begin with 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:51.149
 our cell phone we are going to move here the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.250
 light and here we have already opened the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.750
 application that in this case you 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.420
 you have to have at least one cell phone 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.799
 iphone 5 onwards with the latest 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.140
 IOS version or there are 18 and up 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.780
 unless the application appears in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.610
 screen like what you see here and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.300
 to be able to match it simply 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.090
 we make 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.090
 click where they say to leave and we're going to 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.330
 ishihawa of camera 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060
 I do not know what else he wants me to do 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.020
 Y 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.420
 to do so 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.369
 differently it has already synchronized 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.629
 let's leave it there 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.629
 Y 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's do anahuac 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.020
 and I use the clock in my left hand 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:45.489
 and here we are going to have the information of 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.480
 the typical japan contract to be able 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.780
 register and what I 'm going to do now 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.280
 is to put my data in a few minutes 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.730
 then that our 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.849
 account will come this screen of the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.810
 location service serves the 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.220
 diagnosis 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.220
 to put automatically 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.090
 we take out on foot that in case of Japan watch 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.260
 as code let's create a peace court ready 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.450
 here we are working with two screens 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.020
 and a moment using watch watch 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.920
 and forlÃ¡n 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.920
 Lets put 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.940
 around we will put at every moment 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.590
 here you are seeing all the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.840
 process without only a cut to the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.379
 moment to enter my password but 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.379
 this is step by step how to do it 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.850
 we are ready 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.960
 then in these moments apparently 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.560
 the clock is unloading 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.730
 Applications 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.730
 I do not know if they can spot iu 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.750
 the applications that come by default 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.150
 or let's see what it is that presents us 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.680
 One is that this whole process ends 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.359
 I hope it's soon but so 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.440
 I'm seeing is taking your time and in 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.800
 slow in advancing the wheel 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.870
 let's wait and for you win 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.180
 Hopefully seconds for me is what 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.300
 so much more than the time after the 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.610
 synchronization let's tighten ok and here 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.140
 we are going to have some 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.860
 information as I tell them for me everything 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.630
 this is new let's go to my watch and we're going to 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.720
 have here 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.600
 already begins to pass me information of 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.540
 some details with notifications but 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.240
 here we will be able to see the 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.070
 applications that are pre-installed 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.890
 we will be able to enter notifications 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.810
 in the destination of want and here we go 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.940
 to see all the notifications that 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.910
 we want to receive we are going to put 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.689
 here private private and let's go to 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.439
 clock 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.439
 and we have 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.310
 or the code is marked that I can only 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.400
 cancel entry vehicles enter with 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.740
 code and here we are going to have some 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.260
 contacts that I have we will be able to 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.849
 handle the wheel to be able to call 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.509
 those contacts and let's go back 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.509
 we are going to 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.939
 place your finger on the screen 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.939
 in that place 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.990
 Now you have to push hard 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.880
 let's cause more and customize and here 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.670
 you are going to have several parts where 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.610
 They will be able to 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.280
 customize let's place for example 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.580
 I want to receive your good inclusion 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.880
 let's be able to synchronize our faces 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.970
 we do not have in this survey 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.320
 national now and we will be able to 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.930
 visualize our contacts do it and 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.130
 let's go to another the other being I have to 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.350
 study the little clock there are our 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.490
 notifications should not if I have 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.810
 know well then we will be able to 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.129
 use the wheel to be able to climb and 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.990
 go down 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:25.529
 we have our contacts 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.259
 let's go again to home 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:30.360
 and ready here we continue with our 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:34.110
 contact that more 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:39.700
 well let's play with the little clock and 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:41.770
 here we have in the part of to see 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.140
 the activities that we are going to see 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.560
 well this is the first impressions of 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.330
 clock 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.300
 I have to be playing with him to 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.830
 to be able to give full completion but 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.590
 this is just to show you guys 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.780
 how can we synchronize it with in 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.240
 our iphone hopefully you have them 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.620
 liked this video and you know more 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.510
 forward let's introduce you much more 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.310
 videos about that of which we will do 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:08.310
 the comparison with the motor or the motorcycle 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.050
 360 and let's see if indeed 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.310
 work more or less at par or if there 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.960
 any difference either in the 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.090
 notifications or when sending 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.430
 messages let's see how in the 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.870
 comparative and we will be playing with 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.190
 this clock to be able to solve you 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.630
 more information 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.010
