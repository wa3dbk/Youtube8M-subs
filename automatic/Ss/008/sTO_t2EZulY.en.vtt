to old

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:54.970 
to old
this<00:01:46.610> how<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.910> looks<00:01:47.120> like<00:01:52.870> small<00:01:53.870> box<00:01:54.230> with<00:01:54.470> a

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
this how it looks like small box with a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.360 
this how it looks like small box with a
hinge<00:01:55.370> on<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.870> bottom<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.500> can<00:01:57.740> swivel

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
hinge on the bottom that you can swivel

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.050 
hinge on the bottom that you can swivel
forwards<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.640> backwards<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:04.610> can<00:02:04.790> turn

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
forwards and backwards and you can turn

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.970 
forwards and backwards and you can turn
it<00:02:05.920> 360<00:02:06.920> degrees<00:02:08.830> in<00:02:09.830> any<00:02:10.009> direction<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.990> it's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
it 360 degrees in any direction and it's

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.640 
it 360 degrees in any direction and it's
USB<00:02:13.850> cam

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.839 

so<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.579> camera<00:02:19.970> looks<00:02:20.150> like<00:02:24.640> those<00:02:25.640> has<00:02:25.819> a

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
so the camera looks like those has a

in<00:04:26.730> a<00:04:26.790> moment<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.450> will<00:04:28.110> find<00:04:28.890> out<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.430> of

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
in a moment I will find out and of

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.150 
in a moment I will find out and of
course<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.660> second<00:04:31.110> plan<00:04:31.260> just<00:04:31.470> in<00:04:31.620> case<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
course the second plan just in case the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.400 
course the second plan just in case the
first<00:04:32.370> pen<00:04:32.640> is<00:04:32.760> lost<00:04:33.200> up<00:04:34.200> here<00:04:34.260> we<00:04:34.680> have<00:04:34.890> the

first pen is lost up here we have the

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.950 
first pen is lost up here we have the
thinkpads<00:04:38.780> battery<00:04:40.280> charger<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:42.360> looks<00:04:42.870> like

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
thinkpads battery charger so looks like

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.040 
thinkpads battery charger so looks like
a<00:04:43.260> very<00:04:43.530> strange<00:04:44.250> out-of-this-world<00:04:45.050> machine

a very strange out-of-this-world machine

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.240 
a very strange out-of-this-world machine
but<00:04:46.500> i'll<00:04:46.970> try<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.240> figure<00:04:48.540> this<00:04:48.690> out<00:04:48.930> at<00:04:49.250> the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
but i'll try and figure this out at the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.480 
but i'll try and figure this out at the
back<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.640> in<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.360> moment<00:04:51.800> how<00:04:52.800> do<00:04:52.860> sir<00:04:53.280> works

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
back to in a moment how do sir works

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.140 
back to in a moment how do sir works
looks<00:04:53.790> like<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.680> like<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.710> shaving<00:04:56.400> machine<00:04:56.490> with

computer<00:06:07.539> system<00:06:08.289> included<00:06:08.889> in<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.100> eights

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
computer system included in the eights

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.120 
computer system included in the eights
of<00:06:09.460> batteries<00:06:09.850> way<00:06:10.590> something<00:06:11.590> like<00:06:11.740> four

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
of batteries way something like four

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
of batteries way something like four
kilos<00:06:13.080> but<00:06:14.080> if<00:06:14.500> I<00:06:14.650> feel<00:06:15.009> it<00:06:15.190> to<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.400> touch<00:06:15.639> I

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
kilos but if I feel it to the touch I

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.350 
kilos but if I feel it to the touch I
wouldn't<00:06:16.780> say<00:06:17.229> this<00:06:18.009> would<00:06:18.190> be<00:06:18.400> a<00:06:18.430> will<00:06:19.210> be

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
wouldn't say this would be a will be

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.070 
wouldn't say this would be a will be
something<00:06:19.630> about<00:06:20.340> 300<00:06:21.340> to<00:06:22.050> 400<00:06:23.050> grab<00:06:23.680> the

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
something about 300 to 400 grab the

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.120 
something about 300 to 400 grab the
external<00:06:26.080> DVD<00:06:26.680> drive<00:06:27.090> I<00:06:28.530> haven't<00:06:29.530> tested<00:06:29.740> it

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
external DVD drive I haven't tested it

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.089 
external DVD drive I haven't tested it
yet<00:06:30.190> so<00:06:30.699> I<00:06:31.419> also<00:06:31.840> have<00:06:31.990> to<00:06:32.080> figure<00:06:32.380> out<00:06:32.530> how<00:06:32.919> to

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
yet so I also have to figure out how to

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:38.210 
yet so I also have to figure out how to
open<00:06:33.280> this<00:06:34.500> machine<00:06:35.500> but<00:06:36.509> it<00:06:37.509> looks<00:06:37.780> vintage

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
open this machine but it looks vintage

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.460 
open this machine but it looks vintage
there's<00:06:39.220> not<00:06:39.430> a<00:06:40.030> spring<00:06:40.630> mechanism<00:06:40.810> on<00:06:41.289> its

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
there's not a spring mechanism on its

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.129 
there's not a spring mechanism on its
own<00:06:41.620> because<00:06:42.039> when<00:06:42.400> i<00:06:42.430> press<00:06:42.789> the<00:06:42.970> Open<00:06:43.930> button

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:44.139 
own because when i press the Open button

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.430 
own because when i press the Open button
does<00:06:44.800> there's<00:06:45.190> no<00:06:45.400> latch<00:06:46.330> opening<00:06:47.020> so<00:06:47.259> I<00:06:47.289> think

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
does there's no latch opening so I think

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.969 
does there's no latch opening so I think
it's<00:06:47.770> runs<00:06:48.190> on<00:06:48.340> battery<00:06:48.849> fortunately<00:06:49.590> or<00:06:50.590> at

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979 
it's runs on battery fortunately or at

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:52.680 
it's runs on battery fortunately or at
least<00:06:51.220> from<00:06:51.490> another<00:06:51.789> power<00:06:52.060> source<00:06:52.090> but

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
least from another power source but

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.360 
least from another power source but
we'll<00:06:52.930> take<00:06:53.260> a<00:06:53.320> look<00:06:53.560> in<00:06:53.710> the<00:06:53.770> moment<00:06:54.130> sound

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
we'll take a look in the moment sound

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.279 
we'll take a look in the moment sound
