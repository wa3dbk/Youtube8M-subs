hi boys and girls we are back for our
one-year<00:00:10.190> update<00:00:10.850> on<00:00:11.059> our<00:00:11.120> rust<00:00:12.020> experiment<00:00:12.590> I

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
one-year update on our rust experiment I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.560 
one-year update on our rust experiment I
will<00:00:13.100> put<00:00:13.340> the<00:00:13.549> original<00:00:13.760> video<00:00:14.209> called

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
will put the original video called

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.790 
will put the original video called
long-term<00:00:14.920> rust<00:00:15.940> something<00:00:17.410> up<00:00:18.410> there<00:00:18.650> in<00:00:18.710> the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
long-term rust something up there in the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.120 
long-term rust something up there in the
corner

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
corner

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.490 
corner
and<00:00:20.020> just<00:00:21.020> kind<00:00:21.260> of<00:00:21.289> remind<00:00:21.619> you<00:00:22.960> I'll<00:00:23.960> go<00:00:24.290> over

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
and just kind of remind you I'll go over

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.810 
and just kind of remind you I'll go over
I<00:00:24.620> got<00:00:24.860> a<00:00:24.920> little<00:00:25.130> cheat<00:00:25.310> sheet<00:00:25.340> I<00:00:25.550> just

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
I got a little cheat sheet I just

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.160 
I got a little cheat sheet I just
wouldn't<00:00:26.000> watch<00:00:26.150> that<00:00:26.180> video<00:00:26.450> that<00:00:26.900> was<00:00:26.990> kind

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
wouldn't watch that video that was kind

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.100 
wouldn't watch that video that was kind
of<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.910> you<00:00:28.910> know<00:00:28.940> to<00:00:29.060> remind<00:00:29.510> me<00:00:29.660> what<00:00:29.840> we<00:00:29.960> did

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
of the you know to remind me what we did

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.470 
of the you know to remind me what we did
to<00:00:30.230> all<00:00:30.290> these<00:00:31.059> you<00:00:32.059> know<00:00:32.149> these<00:00:32.270> were

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
to all these you know these were

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.880 
to all these you know these were
slightly<00:00:32.719> prepped<00:00:33.110> in<00:00:33.289> slightly<00:00:33.739> different

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
slightly prepped in slightly different

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.340 
slightly prepped in slightly different
ways<00:00:34.510> as<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:35.629> can<00:00:35.750> see<00:00:35.870> they're<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.050> little<00:00:36.170> bit

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
ways as you can see they're a little bit

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.079 
ways as you can see they're a little bit
dirty<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:36.620> I<00:00:36.770> do<00:00:37.010> have<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.309> wet<00:00:37.460> rag<00:00:37.640> I'll<00:00:37.940> wipe

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
dirty so I do have a wet rag I'll wipe

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.520 
dirty so I do have a wet rag I'll wipe
them<00:00:38.300> down<00:00:38.510> here<00:00:38.749> in<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.899> second<00:00:39.260> we'll<00:00:39.379> take<00:00:39.499> a

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
them down here in a second we'll take a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.259 
them down here in a second we'll take a
look<00:00:39.769> at<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:40.179> bar<00:00:41.179> stock<00:00:41.449> one<00:00:42.249> we<00:00:43.249> used<00:00:43.609> the

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
look at it bar stock one we used the

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.680 
look at it bar stock one we used the
naval<00:00:44.809> rust<00:00:45.050> jelly<00:00:45.319> on<00:00:45.530> here<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:46.640> then<00:00:47.390> this

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
naval rust jelly on here and then this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.290 
naval rust jelly on here and then this
was<00:00:47.929> the<00:00:47.960> rest<00:00:48.350> oleum<00:00:48.769> of<00:00:49.039> bed<00:00:49.339> liner<00:00:49.579> they<00:00:50.120> got

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
was the rest oleum of bed liner they got

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.340 
was the rest oleum of bed liner they got
put<00:00:50.479> on<00:00:50.600> there<00:00:51.399> bar<00:00:52.399> stock<00:00:52.670> number<00:00:52.999> two<00:00:53.350> was

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
put on there bar stock number two was

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.819 
put on there bar stock number two was
the<00:00:54.920> rust<00:00:55.460> fix<00:00:55.850> product<00:00:56.600> basically<00:00:57.289> turns<00:00:57.649> the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
the rust fix product basically turns the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.559 
the rust fix product basically turns the
rust<00:00:58.039> into<00:00:58.249> like<00:00:58.429> a<00:00:58.519> black<00:00:58.699> oxide<00:00:59.179> is<00:00:59.449> what

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
rust into like a black oxide is what

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.139 
rust into like a black oxide is what
they<00:00:59.690> said<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.109> then<00:01:00.679> we<00:01:01.309> shot<00:01:01.519> that<00:01:01.729> which<00:01:01.940> is

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
they said and then we shot that which is

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.450 
they said and then we shot that which is
still<00:01:02.329> Kryolan<00:01:02.839> flat<00:01:03.139> black<00:01:03.379> paint

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
still Kryolan flat black paint

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.570 
still Kryolan flat black paint
so<00:01:04.580> not<00:01:04.729> really<00:01:04.760> an<00:01:05.059> outdoor<00:01:05.390> or<00:01:05.600> rust<00:01:05.840> paint

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
so not really an outdoor or rust paint

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.600 
so not really an outdoor or rust paint
three<00:01:07.580> got<00:01:07.790> several<00:01:08.180> treatments<00:01:09.610> underneath

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
three got several treatments underneath

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.300 
three got several treatments underneath
here<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.300> some<00:01:11.510> cheap<00:01:11.870> sheets<00:01:14.260> under<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
here and some cheap sheets under the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.880 
here and some cheap sheets under the
back<00:01:17.210> portion<00:01:17.570> was<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.290> first<00:01:18.500> time<00:01:18.650> I<00:01:18.680> ever

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
back portion was the first time I ever

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.560 
back portion was the first time I ever
tempted<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.460> vinegar<00:01:19.820> which<00:01:20.330> worked

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
tempted the vinegar which worked

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.720 
tempted the vinegar which worked
phenomenal<00:01:21.200> on<00:01:21.860> top<00:01:22.100> of<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.250> vinegar<00:01:22.580> we

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
phenomenal on top of the vinegar we

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.670 
phenomenal on top of the vinegar we
brushed<00:01:23.060> on<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.660> restaurant<00:01:24.140> Lane<00:01:24.260> ham<00:01:24.470> right

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
brushed on the restaurant Lane ham right

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.360 
brushed on the restaurant Lane ham right
out<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.460> can<00:01:25.700> on<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:27.140> side<00:01:27.410> this<00:01:27.800> got<00:01:28.070> rust

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
out of a can on this side this got rust

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.940 
out of a can on this side this got rust
jelly<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.910> then<00:01:29.360> was<00:01:29.540> left<00:01:29.750> exposed<00:01:29.900> this<00:01:30.710> was

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
jelly and then was left exposed this was

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.980 
jelly and then was left exposed this was
rust<00:01:31.190> jellied<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:31.730> then<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.150> rust<00:01:32.600> William

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
rust jellied and then the rust William

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.680 
rust jellied and then the rust William
rust<00:01:33.920> stopper<00:01:34.400> rust<00:01:34.640> fix<00:01:34.940> was<00:01:35.180> sprayed<00:01:35.480> onto

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
rust stopper rust fix was sprayed onto

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.800 
rust stopper rust fix was sprayed onto
it<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:36.440> left<00:01:36.710> out<00:01:36.920> without<00:01:37.490> any<00:01:37.850> topcoat

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
it and then left out without any topcoat

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.870 
it and then left out without any topcoat
paint<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.940> number<00:01:40.940> four<00:01:41.180> was<00:01:41.480> basically<00:01:41.840> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
paint and number four was basically the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.440 
paint and number four was basically the
por-15<00:01:43.880> treatment<00:01:44.540> we<00:01:45.260> use<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.490> 415<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:47.360> know

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
por-15 treatment we use the 415 you know

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.560 
por-15 treatment we use the 415 you know
two-step<00:01:47.900> prep<00:01:48.520> products<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.030> 415

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
two-step prep products and then the 415

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.720 
two-step prep products and then the 415
over<00:01:50.930> there<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.770> let<00:01:52.070> me<00:01:52.160> wipe<00:01:52.310> some<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
over there so let me wipe some of the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.370 
over there so let me wipe some of the
surface<00:01:53.720> dust<00:01:53.960> off<00:01:54.140> these<00:01:54.350> we'll<00:01:54.530> take<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.710> look

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
surface dust off these we'll take a look

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.200 
surface dust off these we'll take a look
all<00:01:57.380> right<00:01:57.440> that's<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.710> little<00:01:57.740> better

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
all right that's a little better

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.930 
all right that's a little better
and<00:01:59.450> all<00:01:59.750> in<00:01:59.900> all<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:01.190> know<00:02:01.310> this<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.730> rust

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
and all in all you know this is the rust

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.130 
and all in all you know this is the rust
jelly<00:02:02.180> number<00:02:02.390> one<00:02:02.540> with<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.380> truck<00:02:03.560> bedliner

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
jelly number one with the truck bedliner

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.940 
jelly number one with the truck bedliner
did<00:02:06.140> fairly<00:02:06.380> well<00:02:07.989> you<00:02:08.989> know<00:02:09.080> there's<00:02:09.349> no<00:02:09.560> real

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
did fairly well you know there's no real

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.880 
did fairly well you know there's no real
cheap<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:11.360> know<00:02:11.480> pitting<00:02:11.930> or<00:02:12.200> bubbling<00:02:12.650> or

here one reason I'm looking at the

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.869 
here one reason I'm looking at the
bottom<00:02:30.769> is<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.950> didn't<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.459> sitting<00:02:31.700> on

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
bottom is I didn't have this sitting on

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.910 
bottom is I didn't have this sitting on
a<00:02:31.909> piece<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.150> cardboard<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.650> wouldn't

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
a piece of cardboard just so wouldn't

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.440 
a piece of cardboard just so wouldn't
transfer<00:02:34.219> any<00:02:34.400> rust<00:02:34.639> to<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.879> top<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.209> Fiat

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
transfer any rust to the top of the Fiat

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.879 
transfer any rust to the top of the Fiat
where<00:02:35.659> I<00:02:35.689> had<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.019> sitting<00:02:36.230> for<00:02:36.590> pretty<00:02:36.769> much

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
where I had this sitting for pretty much

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.509 
where I had this sitting for pretty much
last<00:02:37.189> year<00:02:37.629> I<00:02:38.739> should<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:39.950> pictures<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.430> it

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
last year I should have pictures of it

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.240 
last year I should have pictures of it
in<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:40.700> snow<00:02:40.969> you<00:02:41.389> know<00:02:41.480> buried<00:02:41.870> this<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
in the snow you know buried this is the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.490 
in the snow you know buried this is the
you<00:02:43.849> know<00:02:43.969> semi-arid<00:02:44.930> high<00:02:45.290> desert

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
you know semi-arid high desert

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.009 
you know semi-arid high desert
environment<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.489> Central<00:02:46.819> Oregon<00:02:46.939> so<00:02:47.450> this

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
environment of Central Oregon so this

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.539 
environment of Central Oregon so this
isn't<00:02:48.290> going<00:02:48.379> to<00:02:48.439> be<00:02:48.500> quite<00:02:48.799> as<00:02:48.919> corrosive<00:02:49.189> as

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
isn't going to be quite as corrosive as

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.759 
isn't going to be quite as corrosive as
you<00:02:49.939> know<00:02:50.060> next<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.989> coast<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:51.439> the<00:02:51.470> salt

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
you know next to the coast with the salt

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.440 
you know next to the coast with the salt
water<00:02:51.980> or<00:02:52.099> even<00:02:52.669> in<00:02:52.849> like<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.239> know<00:02:53.359> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
water or even in like you know the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.379 
water or even in like you know the
valley<00:02:53.659> or<00:02:53.930> Seattle<00:02:54.669> you<00:02:55.669> know<00:02:55.790> we<00:02:55.970> only<00:02:56.150> get

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
valley or Seattle you know we only get

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.390 
valley or Seattle you know we only get
whatever<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:57.439> is<00:02:57.560> eight<00:02:57.709> inches<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.220> rain<00:02:58.370> a

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
whatever it is eight inches of rain a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.390 
whatever it is eight inches of rain a
year<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:59.030> but<00:03:00.019> this<00:03:00.260> was<00:03:00.470> what<00:03:00.650> my<00:03:00.680> test<00:03:01.189> was

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
year so but this was what my test was

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.280 
year so but this was what my test was
and<00:03:01.639> so<00:03:01.879> far<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.239> mean<00:03:02.389> no<00:03:02.569> significant

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
and so far I mean no significant

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.339 
and so far I mean no significant
failures<00:03:03.739> even<00:03:04.639> the<00:03:04.939> score<00:03:05.239> marks<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:06.319> know

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
failures even the score marks you know

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.349 
failures even the score marks you know
there's<00:03:06.620> no<00:03:06.769> pitting<00:03:07.189> and<00:03:07.370> pulling<00:03:07.909> from<00:03:08.209> all

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
there's no pitting and pulling from all

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.819 
there's no pitting and pulling from all
those<00:03:08.569> obviously<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.169> wear<00:03:09.409> this<00:03:09.530> down<00:03:09.739> to

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
those obviously that wear this down to

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.050 
those obviously that wear this down to
bare<00:03:09.980> metal<00:03:10.129> there's<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.519> little<00:03:10.700> bit<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.849> rust

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
bare metal there's a little bit of rust

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.179 
bare metal there's a little bit of rust
there<00:03:11.359> but<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.349> other<00:03:12.439> thing<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.769> if<00:03:12.919> you<00:03:12.980> take

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
there but the other thing is if you take

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.970 
there but the other thing is if you take
a<00:03:13.250> look<00:03:13.489> at<00:03:13.669> the<00:03:13.879> unexposed<00:03:14.659> or<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.230> unn<00:03:15.439> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
a look at the unexposed or the unn you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.679 
a look at the unexposed or the unn you
know<00:03:16.069> treated<00:03:16.489> areas<00:03:16.879> of<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.209> exposed

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
know treated areas of just exposed

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.379 
know treated areas of just exposed
rusted<00:03:18.109> metal<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.700> know<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.879> can<00:03:20.000> definitely

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
rusted metal you know you can definitely

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.619 
rusted metal you know you can definitely
tell<00:03:20.540> with<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.290> some<00:03:21.859> cheap<00:03:22.069> krylon<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:23.389> does

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
tell with just some cheap krylon it does

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.550 
tell with just some cheap krylon it does
keep<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.930> rust<00:03:24.290> down<00:03:25.419> and<00:03:26.419> number<00:03:27.139> three<00:03:27.349> you

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
keep the rust down and number three you

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.479 
keep the rust down and number three you
know<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:27.859> kind<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.099> little<00:03:28.159> bit<00:03:28.340> special

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
know it's kind of a little bit special

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.789 
know it's kind of a little bit special
we<00:03:28.729> did<00:03:28.849> a<00:03:28.909> little<00:03:29.090> all<00:03:29.329> sorts<00:03:29.659> of<00:03:29.750> stuff<00:03:29.989> you

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
we did a little all sorts of stuff you

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.530 
we did a little all sorts of stuff you
know<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:31.040> naval<00:03:31.340> jelly<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:31.909> the<00:03:32.090> rust<00:03:32.299> stop

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
know the naval jelly and the rust stop

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.300 
know the naval jelly and the rust stop
you<00:03:33.079> know<00:03:33.169> there<00:03:33.379> is<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.560> little<00:03:33.829> bit<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.129> rust

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
you know there is a little bit of rust

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.460 
you know there is a little bit of rust
trying<00:03:34.909> to<00:03:34.970> come<00:03:35.150> through<00:03:35.180> but<00:03:35.720> it's<00:03:36.049> clearly

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
trying to come through but it's clearly

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.309 
trying to come through but it's clearly
better<00:03:36.739> than<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.370> rust<00:03:37.970> removal<00:03:38.329> it

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
better than just the rust removal it

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.020 
better than just the rust removal it
didn't<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.859> kept<00:03:40.099> most<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.639> rust<00:03:40.879> from

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
didn't it kept most of the rust from

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.229 
didn't it kept most of the rust from
coming<00:03:41.359> back<00:03:42.519> certainly<00:03:43.519> on<00:03:43.699> the<00:03:43.819> bottom

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
coming back certainly on the bottom

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.249 
coming back certainly on the bottom
where<00:03:44.419> it<00:03:44.479> was<00:03:44.569> sitting<00:03:44.810> on<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:44.930> wet

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:45.259 
where it was sitting on that wet

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.509 
where it was sitting on that wet
cardboard<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:46.280> didn't<00:03:46.639> do<00:03:46.729> quite<00:03:46.909> as<00:03:47.150> well<00:03:47.180> and

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
cardboard it didn't do quite as well and

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.420 
cardboard it didn't do quite as well and
you<00:03:49.519> know<00:03:49.639> the<00:03:49.790> hammer<00:03:50.030> right<00:03:50.949> the<00:03:51.949> brush<00:03:52.159> on

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
you know the hammer right the brush on

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.670 
you know the hammer right the brush on
is<00:03:52.609> a<00:03:52.639> little<00:03:52.849> bit<00:03:52.970> thicker<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.509> it<00:03:54.290> seemed<00:03:54.590> to

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
is a little bit thicker and it seemed to

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.860 
is a little bit thicker and it seemed to

of oil and stuff and por-15 should be
resistant<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:52.819> that<00:04:53.050> especially<00:04:54.050> for<00:04:54.439> the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
resistant to that especially for the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.309 
resistant to that especially for the
fact<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.919> they<00:04:55.280> have<00:04:55.719> identical<00:04:56.719> kit<00:04:57.050> that

fact that they have identical kit that

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.119

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
you can put to fix a gas tank leaks so I

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.909 
you can put to fix a gas tank leaks so I
was<00:05:01.490> very<00:05:01.699> surprised<00:05:02.150> when<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:03.080> little<00:05:03.740> bit<00:05:03.830> of

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
was very surprised when a little bit of

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.279 
was very surprised when a little bit of
the<00:05:04.009> oil<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:04.460> stuff<00:05:04.699> was<00:05:05.509> underneath<00:05:05.930> here

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
the oil and stuff was underneath here

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.219 
the oil and stuff was underneath here
and<00:05:06.699> I<00:05:07.699> can<00:05:08.000> start<00:05:08.240> peeling<00:05:08.479> this<00:05:08.780> right<00:05:09.020> up

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
and I can start peeling this right up

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.680 
and I can start peeling this right up
and<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:10.280> believe<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.879> was<00:05:11.000> part<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.330> my<00:05:11.389> issue

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
and I believe that was part of my issue

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.920 
and I believe that was part of my issue
with<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.590> previous<00:05:13.099> owners<00:05:13.430> job<00:05:13.699> of<00:05:13.969> his

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
with the previous owners job of his

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.830 
with the previous owners job of his
bedliner<00:05:15.620> spread<00:05:16.610> job<00:05:16.849> that<00:05:17.030> he<00:05:17.150> did<00:05:17.300> in<00:05:17.539> here

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
bedliner spread job that he did in here

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.020 
bedliner spread job that he did in here
so<00:05:18.530> as<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.770> can<00:05:18.889> see<00:05:18.949> we're<00:05:19.610> starting<00:05:19.729> to<00:05:19.909> get

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
so as you can see we're starting to get

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.839 
so as you can see we're starting to get
back<00:05:20.240> down<00:05:20.419> to<00:05:20.509> that<00:05:20.659> bare<00:05:20.960> metal<00:05:21.699> so<00:05:22.699> it's

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
back down to that bare metal so it's

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.550 
back down to that bare metal so it's
kind<00:05:23.000> of<00:05:23.029> an<00:05:23.150> interesting<00:05:23.270> thing<00:05:23.810> as<00:05:24.169> far<00:05:24.529> as

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
in here this was more of a test you know

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.879 
in here this was more of a test you know
on<00:05:59.509> the<00:05:59.659> truck<00:05:59.900> I<00:06:00.139> didn't<00:06:00.409> do<00:06:00.500> it<00:06:00.620> on<00:06:00.680> the

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
on the truck I didn't do it on the

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.339 
on the truck I didn't do it on the
passenger<00:06:01.339> side<00:06:01.930> wanted<00:06:02.930> to<00:06:03.020> see<00:06:03.110> how<00:06:03.229> it

the way through and you can even see

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.269 
the way through and you can even see
some<00:06:07.580> of<00:06:07.969> the<00:06:08.029> original<00:06:08.479> surface<00:06:09.440> rust<00:06:09.860> you

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810
