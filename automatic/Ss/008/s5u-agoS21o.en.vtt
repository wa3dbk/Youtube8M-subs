I'd kind of like to find more puppies
I'm<00:04:45.350> becoming<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:46.280> dog<00:04:47.000> owner<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:48.110> nothing

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
I'm becoming a dog owner and nothing

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.730 
I'm becoming a dog owner and nothing
will<00:04:49.190> ever<00:04:49.370> stop<00:04:49.520> me<00:04:49.820> I<00:04:50.300> mean<00:04:50.870> I<00:04:50.900> have<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.140> dog<00:04:51.380> I

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
will ever stop me I mean I have a dog I

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.050 
will ever stop me I mean I have a dog I
had<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.190> dog<00:04:52.520> in<00:04:53.420> my<00:04:53.690> real<00:04:54.050> world<00:04:54.850> but<00:04:55.850> now<00:04:56.030> I

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
had a dog in my real world but now I

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.990 
had a dog in my real world but now I
don't<00:04:56.360> because<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:57.230> don't<00:04:57.440> live<00:04:57.590> there<00:04:57.800> anymore

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
don't because I don't live there anymore

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.420 
don't because I don't live there anymore
but<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.030> know<00:04:59.210> what<00:04:59.419> screw<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.380> dog<00:05:00.680> is<00:05:01.220> now

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
but you know what screw that dog is now

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.170 
but you know what screw that dog is now
I<00:05:01.460> got<00:05:01.730> five<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.510> they're<00:05:03.169> all<00:05:03.350> identical

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
I got five and they're all identical

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.600 
I got five and they're all identical
which<00:05:05.180> makes<00:05:05.419> telling<00:05:05.810> them<00:05:05.960> apart<00:05:06.370> kind<00:05:07.370> of

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
which makes telling them apart kind of

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.180 
which makes telling them apart kind of
difficult
