00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.610
 and 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.950
 why 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.960
 and how about sailors how are we and good 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.059
 guys we're back with the review 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.220
 of this map of a word file that 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.100
 formerly good previously I have 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.890
 brought the one that would be curaxys park and already 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.390
 mobile minecraft goal and good 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.309
 previously, as I told you, I had 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.860
 brought the map debug chip art and I wanted to 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.019
 know it by means of good based on the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.610
 movies that make movies and 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.339
 Well now he is looking for the figures and 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.950
 word that is something similar and some say 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.100
 but it 's calix does not have dinosaurs and 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.220
 Well , what's the name of the map? 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.649
 wright the case and I think it's the ways 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.780
 of the train and therefore this king and good in 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:22.100
 end let's see the credits that are 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.110
 by here 15 tanjung for download version 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.289
 1 thanks for downloading I think the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.310
 adoption 1 and just me in twitter bags 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:34.030
 me on twitter 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.960
 avn - king is not tatis 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.909
 do not notice ok and well let's take a 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.170
 mark this I think no longer because I already 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.210
 mobile and we got on it and now yes that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.310
 yes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.009
 I do not know if the other is different to the case 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.440
 that really weighs if something a little 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.140
 more than usual but finally the limit 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.409
 I leave it in the description if you liked it 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.570
 I will follow the train and no more maps 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.670
 because the bikes really is that 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.970
 some do not seem curious to me and they are very 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.540
 unnecessary so basically by 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.490
 I do not bring to an end will continue 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.580
 bringing one or the other there is another 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.190
 bike and well anyway let's see here 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.160
 this I believe that here ends I think 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.540
 that here ends and well that's supposed 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 that you are the good hotel he 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.239
 the kind of building that has been 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.579
 where the movie starts where they are 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.069
 all all the good things 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.210
 holograms of the cinemas the 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.010
 dinosaurs so let's go in 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.910
 good if you know if you have seen the movie 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.060
 mind in deraa 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.760
 where are the holograms and I already made the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.340
 vehicles do not sow good is a I think 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.769
 has no ceiling 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.769
 it's not something strange 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.480
 yes to see what it says here 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.360
 Let's see 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.660
 This is a spilled ball of toast 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.120
 tyrannosaurus if I'm not wrong in 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:16.720
 tiranosaurius rex quin bou ok 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.470
 and they put a spider as if it were a 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.470
 spider that would have 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.890
 but let's see what else there 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.210
 to the and this 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.210
 in the light these great 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.520
 I think I do not know if I really do not 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.520
 and so much 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.730
 OK 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:48.230
 the map if it's something heavy weighs 64 is 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.489
 something heavy weighs 64 if I'm not wrong and 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.810
 it really is that I do not know why it weighs 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.610
 so much 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.020
 but finally the map I leave in the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.860
 description so you can download it 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.330
 and let's see what else there is here 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.489
 kind of tunnels is a kind of 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.069
 hotel and good the link is the option 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.140

 here so better ajn so there's 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.000
 so this is 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.340
 that's the good cage the kind of 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.360
 structure where the in dominus was 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.460
 rex 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.039
 the dinosaur that fucking tasty that 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.310
 came out or is it the windows are you think that 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.540
 are the windows where the wolves were 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.480
 actors 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.400
 where that's where it breaks, I think the 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.260
 region they are trapped they think 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.270
 the good girl is no longer because they see 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.950
 the movie and they will understand me or kia and 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.680
 good is the problem of used and dead line 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:51.139
 comment you share thank you and see you 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.629

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.990
