00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 very good to all boys and girls 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.740
 they acquired tricks by commenting and in 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.509
 he wrote was to bring the best trick of 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.280
 infinite money for gta 5 online for 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.050
 all platforms and good first 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.759
 everything is for the boy because 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.889
 because you will only need the help of a 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.880
 friend and have this garage that's worth 134 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.100
 thousand that you can get it from a 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.420
 way very very easy and good before 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.949
 start with the trick I will teach you 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 where does your friend have to place the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 car and put it in passenger 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.710
 I'm recording this later but 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.390
 I want because this taught it well in the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.519
 trick and ok and I want your friend 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 place it perfect, it can not pass 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.390
 of this line is worth of this white line 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.739
 because if it happens, what will happen is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.780
 that you are not going to reappear there 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.129
 but you're going to reappear when you leave the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.450
 garage you will recognize over there more 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.460
 away and you can not do the trick of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.989
 upload then your friend puts it there 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 puts it in passengers and you what 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.710
 you have to do is buy a bike or 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.120
 two you want depending on the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.530
 Sometimes you want to do the trick 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.789
 in this case I'm going to do it twice 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.090
 followed so you can see that you can 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.410
 sell without waiting and you know guys 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.059
 give it a like because I bring you good 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.129
 daily content and subscribe for more 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.329
 if you are not, you guys already know and well 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.559
 let's teach here the trick you have 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.750
 to put one of these bicycles near 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 that you bought and wait for you 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.570
 let's give it right to go out 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.920
 but you will not give 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.390
 you are simply going to give him the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.210
 be and your friend as he has to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.280
 Being involved in an activity is worth 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.750
 you give to join here you give to accept 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.940
 and just when you give him to accept you give him 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.710
 to the right to take the bicycle and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.140
 you will hear the garage noise then 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.180
 you come alert you give the X and how 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 you will see the sky will rise and then you 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.390
 will lower this is that the trick has come out 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.560
 perfectly if you have 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.920
 listened to the garage and your friend 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.270
 still in activity everything goes perfectly 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.800
 so just when you're dating 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.869
 ok how are you going to see now just when 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.100
 you are coming out here because the only thing 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.450
 what you have to do is give the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.830
 triangle you're going to see here that is 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.630
 about kinematics you give once to 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.090
 triangle and daisy again then you 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.590
 you will go to your friend's car 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.800
 I'll hit you with a couple of goals 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.320
 laos change the camera and you will of 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.210
 pilot is good and now your friend 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.740
 is going to see what it is that you are mounted on 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.390
 your car but it does not matter you guys 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.160
 you put it because the car is not yours 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.780
 It's worth as you see here we did not know 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.759
 what to do because we wanted the car 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.289
 It was his, but well, here I got to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.520
 think a bit I say if you have put me 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.860
 of pilot will be that the car is mine 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.600
 so I put it in and how are you going to see what 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.280
 go back out and you will see that my friend 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.340
 he still has his so you can see that 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.140
 the car doubles and is very 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.489
 now it's just guys is back to 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.410
 do the trick again buy another 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.970
 bicycle that in this comfortable case there is 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.920
 two places for bicycles returning to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.810
 do as you are going to see here I will return 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.180
 to make super super fast camera has 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.920
 remembering the trick is very easy 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.830
 friend places the car and right in front of 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.760
 the white line then you have 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.160
 to check that goes up 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.480
 automatically and you just have to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.950
 enter your friend while in a 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.049
 activity but host but without 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.940
 start you give him to join here you give him 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.730
 to accept and the button on the right to 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.410
 take out the bike and then you will listen 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.760
 the garage then once you return the 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.440
 kinematics you give twice to 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.030
 triangle and will get on the car of 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.380
 your friend is that easy guys if 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.840
 you have some doubt you can leave me 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.160
 below for the comments and this os 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.030
 will serve for any car os 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.910
 your friend can pass 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.099
 any any car there is and now 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.959
 As you can see here, I do not cut anything 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.230
 I put the super super fast camera worth 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.180
 how am I going to sell it and it will give me 145 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.700
 thousand 141,000 or so and the truth is 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.110
 a quite pretty good trick and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.610
 when I recommend you, it's worth when 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.560
 you arrive at 500 minutes you buy the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.180
 apartment of 500 thousand since there you can 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.800
 you have three bicycles worth three 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.110
 bikes instead of two like this 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.320
 and so you can do the trick is more 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.850
 Sometimes faster and more guys win here 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.050
 basically and I'm going to ask for the other car 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.470
 so you can see that they can be sold without 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.110
 you wait 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.640
 I do not know what else to say the truth is 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.740
 coming to the end of life so if it has 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.150
 liked it is worth to like 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.070
