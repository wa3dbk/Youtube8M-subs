crystals<00:01:18.990> forming<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.950> while<00:01:20.250> that's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
crystals forming so while that's

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.310 
crystals forming so while that's
simmering<00:01:20.909> away<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.659> gonna<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:22.020> started

simmering away we're gonna get started
on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.650> actual<00:01:23.520> dough<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.900> uses<00:01:25.560> milk

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
on the actual dough now this uses milk

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
on the actual dough now this uses milk
powder<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:27.090> its<00:01:27.299> main<00:01:27.509> ingredient<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.350> can

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
powder as its main ingredient you can

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
powder as its main ingredient you can
also<00:01:28.710> use<00:01:29.040> Koya<00:01:29.430> which<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> more

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
also use Koya which is the more

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.670 
also use Koya which is the more
traditional<00:01:30.180> ingredient<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> use<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.560> it's

basically I'm just going to walk this in
and<00:02:01.200> make<00:02:01.950> sure<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.969> crumbly<00:02:03.600> mixture

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.779 

and<00:02:07.520> now<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:08.570> fairly<00:02:09.020> crumbly<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.640> got<00:02:10.759> a

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
and now it's fairly crumbly it's got a

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.560 
and now it's fairly crumbly it's got a
really<00:02:11.090> great<00:02:11.360> texture<00:02:12.850> I'm<00:02:13.850> gonna<00:02:14.090> add<00:02:14.270> some

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
really great texture I'm gonna add some

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.640 
really great texture I'm gonna add some
other<00:02:14.690> ingredients<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:15.680> here<00:02:16.150> I've<00:02:17.150> got<00:02:17.650> 2

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
other ingredients in here I've got 2

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.510 
other ingredients in here I've got 2
teaspoons<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:20.200> flour<00:02:21.200> now<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.950> can<00:02:22.280> use

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
teaspoons of flour now you can use

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.820 
teaspoons of flour now you can use
regular<00:02:23.060> all-purpose<00:02:23.630> flour<00:02:24.110> I'm<00:02:24.590> actually

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
regular all-purpose flour I'm actually

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.860 
regular all-purpose flour I'm actually
using<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.459> self<00:02:25.790> raising<00:02:25.970> flour<00:02:26.150> which<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.630> think

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
using a self raising flour which I think

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.410 
using a self raising flour which I think
actually<00:02:27.200> helps<00:02:27.590> fluff<00:02:28.340> up<00:02:28.520> these<00:02:28.700> little

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
actually helps fluff up these little

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.800 
actually helps fluff up these little
balls<00:02:29.660> now<00:02:30.380> if<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.830> are<00:02:30.950> gluten<00:02:31.280> intolerant

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
balls now if you are gluten intolerant

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.330 
balls now if you are gluten intolerant
you<00:02:32.810> could<00:02:33.020> probably<00:02:33.320> substitute<00:02:34.100> just

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
you could probably substitute just

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.330 
you could probably substitute just
regular<00:02:34.760> gluten-free<00:02:35.330> flour<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.620> haven't

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
regular gluten-free flour I haven't

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.430 
regular gluten-free flour I haven't
tried<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.550> myself<00:02:37.700> but<00:02:38.300> let<00:02:38.930> me<00:02:39.050> know<00:02:39.170> what<00:02:39.320> you

of water to the semolina and it sucked
all<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.570> water<00:03:03.170> right<00:03:03.410> out<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:04.010> look<00:03:04.160> at<00:03:04.280> this

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.460 
all the water right out you look at this
beautiful<00:03:04.670> place<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.150> texture<00:03:05.510> I'm<00:03:06.140> gonna<00:03:06.320> add

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
beautiful place to texture I'm gonna add

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.020 
beautiful place to texture I'm gonna add
this<00:03:06.709> in<00:03:06.920> as<00:03:07.040> well

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.030 

and<00:03:12.030> now<00:03:12.150> finally<00:03:12.750> I'm<00:03:12.960> going<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.320> add<00:03:13.500> some

and now finally I'm going to add some

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.810 
and now finally I'm going to add some
milk<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.580> just<00:03:15.360> make<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.840> into<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.890> dough

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
milk and just make this into a dough

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.240 
milk and just make this into a dough
that's<00:03:17.850> tough<00:03:18.540> enough<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:18.870> me<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.350> make

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
that's tough enough for me to make

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.420 
that's tough enough for me to make
little<00:03:20.460> balls<00:03:20.730> out<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.770> I've<00:03:22.770> got<00:03:23.070> about<00:03:23.190> a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
little balls out of I've got about a

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.940 
little balls out of I've got about a
hundred<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.120> fifty<00:03:24.330> ml<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:24.960> milk<00:03:25.530> just

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
hundred and fifty ml of milk just

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.700 
hundred and fifty ml of milk just
regular<00:03:26.640> milk<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:26.970> might<00:03:27.270> use<00:03:27.480> less<00:03:27.870> really

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
regular milk I might use less really

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.840 
regular milk I might use less really
depends<00:03:30.800> on<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:32.070> milk<00:03:32.250> powder<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.820> use

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
depends on the milk powder that you use

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.560 
depends on the milk powder that you use
so<00:03:33.450> work<00:03:34.290> with<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.590> really<00:03:34.740> quickly<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:39.420> add

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
so work with it really quickly and add

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:53.780 
so work with it really quickly and add
milk<00:03:39.900> as<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:40.080> go<00:03:51.770> see<00:03:52.770> how<00:03:52.920> supple<00:03:53.460> this<00:03:53.580> dough

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
milk as you go see how supple this dough

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.760 
milk as you go see how supple this dough
is<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.330> can<00:03:54.630> actually<00:03:54.810> take<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:55.530> and

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
is now you can actually take this and

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.710 
is now you can actually take this and
just<00:03:56.340> make<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.790> into<00:03:57.120> little<00:03:57.330> balls<00:03:57.480> you

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
just make this into little balls you

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.810 
just make this into little balls you
should<00:03:57.930> get<00:03:58.110> about<00:03:58.230> 10<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:59.010> 15<00:03:59.370> out<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.670> this

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
should get about 10 to 15 out of this

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.540 
should get about 10 to 15 out of this
little<00:04:00.390> batch<00:04:01.020> of<00:04:01.230> dough<00:04:01.380> now<00:04:02.040> if<00:04:02.190> you're<00:04:02.340> as

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
little batch of dough now if you're as

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.200 
little batch of dough now if you're as
anal<00:04:03.030> as<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.660> am<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:04.860> can<00:04:05.070> use<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.610> regular<00:04:06.030> ice

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
anal as I am you can use a regular ice

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.960 
anal as I am you can use a regular ice
cream<00:04:06.240> scoop<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.440> reason<00:04:07.710> I<00:04:07.830> use<00:04:08.070> this<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.550> I

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
cream scoop the reason I use this is I

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.210 
cream scoop the reason I use this is I
like<00:04:09.570> them<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.960> be<00:04:10.140> as<00:04:11.150> uniform<00:04:12.150> as<00:04:12.270> possible

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
like them to be as uniform as possible

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.460 
like them to be as uniform as possible
so<00:04:14.220> all<00:04:14.400> I'm<00:04:14.550> gonna<00:04:14.670> do<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:15.540> divide<00:04:15.930> this

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
so all I'm gonna do is just divide this

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.170 
so all I'm gonna do is just divide this
dough<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:18.170> then<00:04:19.170> when<00:04:20.010> it's<00:04:20.190> all<00:04:20.489> divided<00:04:21.090> up

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
dough and then when it's all divided up

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.170 
dough and then when it's all divided up
I'm<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:21.930> going<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.770> lightly<00:04:23.340> grease<00:04:23.880> my

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180
