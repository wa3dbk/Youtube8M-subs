yourself<00:01:15.870> but<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
yourself but it's actually not that

strokes and that you're playing them in
the<00:02:30.170> right<00:02:30.380> rhythm<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.980> then<00:02:31.460> finally<00:02:32.180> you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the right rhythm and then finally you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.480 
the right rhythm and then finally you
try<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.600> play<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.470> same<00:02:33.740> tempo<00:02:34.190> as<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
try to play it in the same tempo as the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.800 
try to play it in the same tempo as the
song<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.210> that<00:02:35.330> would<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.480> something<00:02:35.690> like

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
song and that would be something like

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:44.350 
song and that would be something like
this<00:02:41.290> okay<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.890> when<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.460> reach<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.670> tempo

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
this okay so when you reach that tempo

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.840 
this okay so when you reach that tempo
then<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.810> move<00:02:44.960> on<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.650> pattern<00:02:46.460> okay

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
then you move on to this pattern okay

00:02:46.850 --> 00:03:01.470 
then you move on to this pattern okay
that's<00:02:47.630> gonna<00:02:47.810> be

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:11.589

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
the song as well so let's try it out I'm

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.920 
the song as well so let's try it out I'm
going<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:10.010> tell<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.550> down<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.150> up<00:04:11.300> when<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:11.720> hit

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
going to tell you down and up when I hit

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.510 
going to tell you down and up when I hit
the<00:04:12.140> strings<00:04:12.440> but<00:04:12.620> bear<00:04:12.860> in<00:04:12.920> mind<00:04:13.070> that<00:04:13.220> in

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
the strings but bear in mind that in

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.490 
the strings but bear in mind that in
between<00:04:13.670> that<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.180> am<00:04:14.360> missing<00:04:15.020> the<00:04:15.170> strings

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
between that I am missing the strings

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:30.870 
between that I am missing the strings
I'm<00:04:15.680> just<00:04:15.860> letting<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.160> strings<00:04:16.520> ring<00:04:16.730> out

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:49.580 

even<00:04:31.880> slower

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.970 

okay<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.880> in<00:04:52.080> medium-tempo<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.470> will<00:04:53.650> be<00:04:53.800> like

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
okay and in medium-tempo it will be like

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:03.490 
okay and in medium-tempo it will be like
this

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.490 

down

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.890 

the<00:05:07.500> DSS<00:05:07.919> for<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.430> DSS<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:09.180> pattern<00:05:09.720> is<00:05:09.870> a

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
the DSS for the DSS to pattern is a

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.260 
the DSS for the DSS to pattern is a
little<00:05:09.990> more<00:05:10.289> tricky<00:05:10.710> but<00:05:11.340> once<00:05:11.759> you<00:05:11.910> get<00:05:12.060> the

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
little more tricky but once you get the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.850 
little more tricky but once you get the
previous<00:05:12.720> rhythm<00:05:13.050> pattern<00:05:13.410> you<00:05:13.530> can<00:05:13.650> get<00:05:13.770> this

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
previous rhythm pattern you can get this

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.180 
previous rhythm pattern you can get this
one<00:05:14.009> easily<00:05:14.190> so<00:05:14.789> I'm<00:05:14.849> gonna<00:05:15.000> play<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.440> half<00:05:16.440> or

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
one easily so I'm gonna play it half or

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.710 
one easily so I'm gonna play it half or
more<00:05:17.430> almost<00:05:17.789> normal<00:05:18.090> tempo<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.539> then<00:05:18.599> I'm

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
more almost normal tempo and then I'm

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.509 
more almost normal tempo and then I'm
gonna<00:05:18.870> slow<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:19.139> down<00:05:19.259> and<00:05:19.560> tell<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:19.770> down<00:05:19.919> up

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:27.519 

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:40.530 

and<00:05:28.519> now<00:05:28.819> slow<00:05:29.659> down

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.130 

up<00:05:40.930> down<00:05:41.440> up<00:05:41.500> down<00:05:42.420> so<00:05:43.420> the<00:05:43.600> whole<00:05:43.720> point<00:05:43.960> there

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
up down up down so the whole point there

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.160 
up down up down so the whole point there
is<00:05:44.200> to<00:05:44.320> get<00:05:44.440> to<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:45.490> get<00:05:45.610> this<00:05:45.850> melody<00:05:49.170> you

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
is to get to to get this melody you

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.630 
is to get to to get this melody you
don't<00:05:50.350> hear<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.740> last<00:05:50.950> one<00:05:51.190> but<00:05:51.370> you're

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
don't hear the last one but you're

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.160 
don't hear the last one but you're
always<00:05:51.940> playing<00:05:52.210> this<00:05:52.480> note<00:05:52.690> so<00:05:52.930> it's<00:05:53.050> not

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
always playing this note so it's not

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.520 
always playing this note so it's not
completely<00:05:53.470> audible<00:05:54.270> but<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.510> is<00:05:55.900> in<00:05:56.110> there<00:05:56.290> if

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
completely audible but it is in there if

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:11.310 
completely audible but it is in there if
you<00:05:56.680> listen<00:06:02.130> third<00:06:03.130> fret<00:06:03.430> of<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.640> B<00:06:03.880> string

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.440 

and<00:06:11.500> then<00:06:12.370> when<00:06:12.490> it<00:06:12.580> comes<00:06:12.640> to<00:06:12.790> the<00:06:12.880> chorus<00:06:13.210> you

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
and then when it comes to the chorus you

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.880 
and then when it comes to the chorus you
can<00:06:13.840> play<00:06:13.960> that<00:06:14.110> pretty<00:06:14.350> much<00:06:14.470> any<00:06:14.680> way<00:06:14.830> you

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
can play that pretty much any way you

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.110 
can play that pretty much any way you
want<00:06:15.220> but<00:06:15.370> I'm<00:06:15.550> just<00:06:15.700> going<00:06:15.850> to<00:06:15.880> give<00:06:16.030> you<00:06:16.090> a

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
want but I'm just going to give you a

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.910 
want but I'm just going to give you a
little<00:06:16.300> template<00:06:16.690> to<00:06:16.810> follow<00:06:17.080> so<00:06:17.680> I'm<00:06:17.770> gonna

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
little template to follow so I'm gonna

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.770 
little template to follow so I'm gonna
play<00:06:18.130> it<00:06:18.250> just<00:06:18.280> at<00:06:18.640> an<00:06:18.730> intermediate<00:06:19.120> tempo

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
play it just at an intermediate tempo

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.050 
play it just at an intermediate tempo
and<00:06:20.200> then<00:06:20.320> I'm<00:06:20.440> gonna<00:06:20.560> slow<00:06:21.130> it<00:06:21.310> down<00:06:21.340> for<00:06:21.880> you

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
and then I'm gonna slow it down for you

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:32.820 
and then I'm gonna slow it down for you
okay

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.860 

so<00:06:33.830> that<00:06:34.040> the<00:06:34.220> point<00:06:34.460> of<00:06:34.610> that<00:06:34.760> is<00:06:35.000> to<00:06:35.060> have<00:06:35.480> the

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
so that the point of that is to have the

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.410 
so that the point of that is to have the
accentuation<00:06:36.320> tour<00:06:37.250> to<00:06:37.730> downstrokes<00:06:38.180> on<00:06:38.330> the

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
accentuation tour to downstrokes on the

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.869 
accentuation tour to downstrokes on the
8th
