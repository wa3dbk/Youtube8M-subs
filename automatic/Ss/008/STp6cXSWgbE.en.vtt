baby<00:05:07.170> facing<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:08.010> wasn't<00:05:08.370> actually<00:05:08.610> that

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
baby facing that wasn't actually that

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.790 
baby facing that wasn't actually that
wasn't<00:05:08.940> too<00:05:09.090> bad<00:05:09.120> but<00:05:09.630> I<00:05:10.020> think<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.530> was<00:05:10.620> pretty

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
wasn't too bad but I think it was pretty

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.700 
wasn't too bad but I think it was pretty
tough<00:05:11.040> I<00:05:11.250> think<00:05:11.430> we<00:05:11.600> figured<00:05:12.600> it<00:05:12.810> out<00:05:12.900> think

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
tough I think we figured it out think

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.170 
tough I think we figured it out think
that<00:05:13.800> was<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:13.920> right<00:05:13.980> speed<00:05:14.790> that<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.060> could

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
that was the right speed that you could

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.460 
that was the right speed that you could
have<00:05:15.270> gone<00:05:15.360> fashion<00:05:15.660> at<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.780> top<00:05:15.960> think<00:05:16.350> it's

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
have gone fashion at the top think it's

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.560 
have gone fashion at the top think it's
also<00:05:16.560> because<00:05:16.890> it's<00:05:17.070> in<00:05:17.250> a<00:05:17.280> condensed<00:05:17.730> area<00:05:17.910> it

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
also because it's in a condensed area it

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.000 
also because it's in a condensed area it
actually<00:05:18.750> made<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.080> easiest<00:05:19.470> because<00:05:19.620> the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
actually made it easiest because the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.220 
actually made it easiest because the
third<00:05:20.310> way<00:05:20.490> back<00:05:20.760> up<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.480> just<00:05:21.690> walk<00:05:21.900> off<00:05:22.080> you

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
third way back up you just walk off you

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.650 
third way back up you just walk off you
know<00:05:23.190> bounce<00:05:23.910> off<00:05:24.090> full<00:05:24.270> of<00:05:24.390> bills<00:05:24.540> or

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
know bounce off full of bills or

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.880 
know bounce off full of bills or
anything<00:05:24.900> we're<00:05:25.080> actually<00:05:25.230> in<00:05:25.440> fact<00:05:25.470> because
