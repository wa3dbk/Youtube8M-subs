00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:23.730
 my favorite champion did not give for did not lead 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.890
 There are many builds 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.720
 but I prefer to play and like a browser 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.940
 the most important thing in this build is that it is not 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.590
 allows the enemy initiator to relax 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.330
 and not allowing the enemy carry and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 get close enough for 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.559
 causing significant damage use 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.739
 cougar- shaped pounds 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.150
 of increasing mobility champion 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.430
 sometimes after using found 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.989
 it turns out to become a person yet 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.180
 before you touch the ground 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.850
 master this technique and become even more 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.770
 a threat to the enemy, I remember chasing 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.969
 once behind the enemy trend world and have 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.010
 I was pierced a little 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.140
 hammer passiv slowed him down 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.180
 then when i applied this three drops 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 property in speed when moving 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.780
 through the bushes and transformation back 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.700
 puma helped me catch up with him and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.700
 destroy before he applied the ulta 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.960
 davidoff didn't know but most of all to me 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.640
 like not given what she can 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.860
 splitpushit and still stay 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.720
 challenging goals for ganks however for 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.080
 this need to know what is not capable of 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.090
 have given 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.400
 as well as a few basic techniques 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.470
 microcontrol also need to be able to 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.630
 improve the good moments clip push in 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.540
 general is the most important aspect in 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.570
 the game for the browser is not given until it goes to you 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.440
 need to keep an eye on the minimap 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.729
 pay attention to the position 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.130
 enemy champions 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.140
 think where to put wards count 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.060
 when a couple retreat or share with 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.440
 the team is what you have to do 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:03.070
 engage during split-push myself I
