today<00:00:02.820> we're<00:00:03.030> in<00:00:03.120> Kentucky<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.750> one<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:03.990> our

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
today we're in Kentucky and one of our

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.019 
today we're in Kentucky and one of our
traditional<00:00:04.710> tobacco<00:00:05.069> barns<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.580> has<00:00:05.790> been

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
traditional tobacco barns that has been

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.070 
traditional tobacco barns that has been
converted<00:00:06.330> into<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.809> horse<00:00:06.990> barn<00:00:07.260> and<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:08.040> lot<00:00:08.250> of

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
converted into a horse barn and a lot of

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.600 
converted into a horse barn and a lot of
conversation<00:00:10.080> lately<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.919> the<00:00:11.070> marketplace

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
conversation lately in the marketplace

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.600 
conversation lately in the marketplace
has<00:00:12.150> been<00:00:12.450> put<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.900> laches<00:00:13.589> so<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.039> thought<00:00:14.339> we

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
has been put on laches so I thought we

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.970 
has been put on laches so I thought we
would<00:00:15.150> take<00:00:15.299> advantage<00:00:15.749> of<00:00:15.959> the<00:00:16.530> opportunity

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
would take advantage of the opportunity

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.590 
would take advantage of the opportunity
we<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.670> barn<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> talk<00:00:18.270> about

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
we have here in this barn to talk about

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.210 
we have here in this barn to talk about
what<00:00:18.870> we're<00:00:19.050> calling<00:00:19.290> our<00:00:19.560> gravity<00:00:20.010> latch

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
what we're calling our gravity latch

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.080 
what we're calling our gravity latch
system<00:00:21.020> this<00:00:22.020> latch<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:22.740> developed<00:00:23.280> mostly

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
system this latch was developed mostly

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.860 
system this latch was developed mostly
based<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.720> customer<00:00:25.200> need<00:00:26.540> everybody<00:00:27.540> has

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
based on customer need everybody has

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.200 
based on customer need everybody has
different<00:00:28.050> ideas<00:00:28.320> about<00:00:28.590> laches<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.610> how

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
different ideas about laches about how

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.760 
different ideas about laches about how
easy<00:00:30.480> they<00:00:30.750> should<00:00:30.990> work<00:00:31.200> about<00:00:31.590> how

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
easy they should work about how

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.579 
easy they should work about how
accessible<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.550> should<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:33.469> moulting<00:00:34.469> in

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:34.589 
accessible they should be moulting in

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:36.470 
accessible they should be moulting in
multiple<00:00:34.980> situations<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.210> yokes

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
multiple situations like with yokes

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
multiple situations like with yokes
present<00:00:37.050> oreos<00:00:37.320> not<00:00:37.559> being<00:00:37.829> present<00:00:38.390> so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
present oreos not being present so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.930 
present oreos not being present so
that's<00:00:39.899> where<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.260> latch<00:00:40.440> came<00:00:40.769> from<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that's where this latch came from the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.790 
that's where this latch came from the
concept<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.050> gravity<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.620> why

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
concept of it is just gravity that's why

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
concept of it is just gravity that's why
we<00:00:43.949> call<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.249> a<00:00:44.309> gravity<00:00:44.699> latch<00:00:44.850> system<00:00:45.089> I'll

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
we call it a gravity latch system I'll

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.090 
we call it a gravity latch system I'll
work<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.929> quickly<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:46.530> we'll<00:00:46.679> go<00:00:46.859> back

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
work it quickly and then we'll go back

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.279 
work it quickly and then we'll go back
through<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.670> talk<00:00:48.030> about<00:00:48.179> how<00:00:48.569> it<00:00:48.719> works

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.149 

opened<00:00:54.469> closed<00:00:56.269> that's<00:00:57.269> pretty<00:00:57.479> simple<00:00:57.719> right

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
opened closed that's pretty simple right

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.469 
opened closed that's pretty simple right
actually<00:00:59.159> the<00:00:59.280> latch<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.729> just<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.239> simple

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
actually the latch is just that simple

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.029 
actually the latch is just that simple
come<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:00.929> here<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.139> little<00:01:01.229> closer<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.889> want

to<00:01:02.100> show<00:01:02.249> you<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.819> how<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.120> works<00:01:03.300> here's<00:01:03.539> how

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
to show you just how it works here's how

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.280 
to show you just how it works here's how
it<00:01:03.809> works

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it works

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.060 
it works

you lift up on the bar latch which

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.980 
you lift up on the bar latch which
disengages<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.850> flipper<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> top<00:01:09.659> when

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
disengages the flipper at the top when

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
disengages the flipper at the top when
you<00:01:10.079> lift<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> bar<00:01:10.890> latch<00:01:11.270> it

you lift up on the bar latch it

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.020 
you lift up on the bar latch it
disengages<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> flipper<00:01:13.549> let's<00:01:14.549> create<00:01:14.850> your

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
disengages the flipper let's create your

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.380 
disengages the flipper let's create your
door<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:17.280> open<00:01:17.310> when<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:17.909> closing<00:01:18.210> the

number<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.719> all<00:01:33.869> gravity<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.680> means

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
number one it's all gravity which means

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
number one it's all gravity which means
there<00:01:35.189> are<00:01:35.219> no<00:01:35.399> springs<00:01:35.759> there<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.299> no

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
there are no springs there are no

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.870 
there are no springs there are no
functioning<00:01:37.439> parts<00:01:37.740> inside<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.640> bad

functioning parts inside of to go bad

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.649 
functioning parts inside of to go bad
there's<00:01:39.810> no<00:01:40.110> grease<00:01:41.030> involved<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.390> you

there's no grease involved so that you

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.420 
there's no grease involved so that you
don't<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.530> always<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.979> worried<00:01:44.369> about

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
don't have to always be worried about

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.399 
don't have to always be worried about
making<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.119> smooth<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.990> sucking

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
making it smooth and then it's sucking

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
making it smooth and then it's sucking
dirt<00:01:46.560> inside<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.850> cleaning<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.479> it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
dirt inside of it and cleaning it it's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.830 
dirt inside of it and cleaning it it's
just<00:01:48.960> grabbing<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> goes<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:51.479> flippers

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
just grabbing it goes up the flippers

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.350 
just grabbing it goes up the flippers
the<00:01:52.020> same<00:01:52.229> way<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.310> made<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.729> removable

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the same way it is made to be removable

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.969 
the same way it is made to be removable
so<00:01:54.539> that<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.810> anything<00:01:55.049> ever<00:01:55.320> happened<00:01:55.860> it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so that if anything ever happened it

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.870 
so that if anything ever happened it
could<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.189> taken<00:01:56.640> apart<00:01:58.579> second<00:01:59.579> feature<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
could be taken apart second feature of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609

their<00:02:17.519> reach<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:18.269> also<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> little<00:02:19.080> bit<00:02:20.120> more

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
their reach it also is a little bit more

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.020 
their reach it also is a little bit more
than<00:02:21.360> they<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> angle<00:02:22.620> that's<00:02:23.030> given

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
than they do at the angle that's given
