happens<00:01:08.030> when<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:08.420> don't<00:01:08.690> hit<00:01:08.870> it<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:09.440> show

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
happens when you don't hit it to show

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.020 
happens when you don't hit it to show
you<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.920> there's<00:01:10.280> actually<00:01:10.670> collision

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
you that there's actually collision

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.870 
you that there's actually collision
detection

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.050 

see<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.649> shows<00:01:18.920> that<00:01:19.369> there<00:01:19.880> is

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
see so that shows that there is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.310 
see so that shows that there is
detection<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:21.619> is<00:01:22.039> showing<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.729> barrel<00:01:23.030> and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
detection that is showing the barrel and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.249 
detection that is showing the barrel and
I<00:01:24.320> guess<00:01:24.799> now<00:01:25.070> I'll<00:01:25.280> start<00:01:25.610> showing<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:27.049> Y

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
I guess now I'll start showing you the Y

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:35.109 
I guess now I'll start showing you the Y
ring<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:32.360> on<00:01:32.719> to<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.140> wire<00:01:33.320> ring<00:01:33.590> as<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.970> can

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
ring so on to the wire ring as you can

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.980 
ring so on to the wire ring as you can
see<00:01:35.390> over<00:01:35.899> here<00:01:36.189> I'll<00:01:37.299> shake<00:01:38.299> my<00:01:38.479> camera<00:01:38.810> less

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
see over here I'll shake my camera less

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.609 
see over here I'll shake my camera less
because<00:01:39.229> I'm<00:01:39.530> getting<00:01:40.399> angry<00:01:40.549> at<00:01:40.759> that<00:01:40.970> too<00:01:41.780> so

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
because I'm getting angry at that too so

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.770 
because I'm getting angry at that too so
as<00:01:43.039> you<00:01:43.250> can<00:01:43.369> see<00:01:43.579> here<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.210> exactly<00:01:44.689> like

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
as you can see here this is exactly like

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.630 
as you can see here this is exactly like
the<00:01:44.990> pong<00:01:45.229> part<00:01:45.619> except<00:01:46.100> there's<00:01:46.250> only<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:46.549> of

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
the pong part except there's only one of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.120 
the pong part except there's only one of
these<00:01:46.819> because<00:01:47.179> it's<00:01:48.110> only<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.470> X<00:01:48.649> direction

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
these because it's only the X direction

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.480 
these because it's only the X direction
so<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.580> x<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:50.000> y<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.439> barrel<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
so the x and y this is the barrel the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.490 
so the x and y this is the barrel the
barrel<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:53.000> lights<00:01:53.209> up<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.720> screen<00:01:54.049> lights

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
barrel it lights up on the screen lights

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.719 
barrel it lights up on the screen lights
up<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.770> pixels<00:01:55.159> every<00:01:55.909> time<00:01:56.090> they<00:01:56.270> go<00:01:56.420> through

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
up the pixels every time they go through

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:05.080 
up the pixels every time they go through
ok<00:01:58.959> and<00:02:01.299> I'll<00:02:02.299> also<00:02:02.659> come<00:02:03.259> over<00:02:03.649> here<00:02:04.099> and<00:02:04.280> show

nor<00:02:45.400> latch<00:02:45.460> gate<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.960> that'll<00:02:47.890> make<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.100> able

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
nor latch gate and that'll make it able

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.800 
nor latch gate and that'll make it able
to<00:02:49.170> be<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:51.250> make<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.640> button<00:02:51.880> control<00:02:52.660> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
to be the make the button control the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.160 
to be the make the button control the
two<00:02:52.960> pixels<00:02:53.700> instead<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:55.090> being<00:02:55.750> able<00:02:56.050> to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
two pixels instead of just being able to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.490 
two pixels instead of just being able to
control<00:02:56.590> whether<00:02:57.250> it's<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.790> off<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.500> so

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
control whether it's on and off and so

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.330 
control whether it's on and off and so
these<00:02:59.800> two<00:03:00.070> pixels<00:03:00.550> are<00:03:01.360> connected<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.800> an<00:03:03.040> and

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
these two pixels are connected to an and

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.100 
these two pixels are connected to an and
gate<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:04.860> what's<00:03:05.860> coming<00:03:06.070> in<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.400> barrel

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
gate with what's coming in the barrel

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.470 
gate with what's coming in the barrel
and<00:03:08.110> also<00:03:09.100> an<00:03:09.280> or<00:03:09.460> gate<00:03:09.490> is<00:03:09.910> right<00:03:10.060> here<00:03:10.270> that's

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
and also an or gate is right here that's

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.210 
and also an or gate is right here that's
not<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.960> doesn't<00:03:11.170> look<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.590> gate<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:12.130> it

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
not it doesn't look like a gate but it

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.250 
not it doesn't look like a gate but it
is<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.700> because<00:03:12.910> we're<00:03:13.660> Gates's<00:03:14.110> are

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
is and because we're Gates's are

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.220 
is and because we're Gates's are
obviously<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.270> big<00:03:16.300> problem<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.840> had<00:03:17.020> was

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
obviously so the big problem I had was

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.950 
obviously so the big problem I had was
the<00:03:17.560> or<00:03:17.860> gate<00:03:18.040> kept<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.460> trying<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.300> go<00:03:19.810> back

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
the or gate kept on trying to go back

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.250 
the or gate kept on trying to go back
over<00:03:20.020> here<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.800> effect<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.820> gate<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.480> we

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
over here and effect the and gate and we

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.070 
over here and effect the and gate and we
can<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.830> so<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.670> put<00:03:25.090> up<00:03:25.210> these<00:03:25.420> new<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
can have that so I put up these new the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.850 
can have that so I put up these new the
new<00:03:26.260> repeaters<00:03:27.040> which<00:03:27.880> are<00:03:28.030> amazing<00:03:28.570> thanx<00:03:29.170> to

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
new repeaters which are amazing thanx to

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.730 
new repeaters which are amazing thanx to
notch<00:03:30.250> or<00:03:30.550> Jeb<00:03:30.820> whichever<00:03:31.330> one<00:03:31.510> me<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:31.840> love

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
notch or Jeb whichever one me that love

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.950 
notch or Jeb whichever one me that love
them<00:03:33.010> for<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:34.060> um<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:35.490> it's<00:03:36.490> able<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:37.060> stop

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
them for it so um so it's able to stop

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.890 
them for it so um so it's able to stop
the<00:03:38.230> flow<00:03:38.500> backwards<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.790> it's<00:03:40.450> not<00:03:40.690> always

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
the flow backwards so it's not always

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.780 
the flow backwards so it's not always
continually<00:03:41.530> having<00:03:41.860> all<00:03:42.160> those<00:03:42.340> lights<00:03:42.580> on

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
continually having all those lights on

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.690 
continually having all those lights on
so<00:03:43.690> that's<00:03:44.200> how<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.530> collision<00:03:45.010> detection<00:03:45.400> is

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
so that's how the collision detection is

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.800 
so that's how the collision detection is
working<00:03:46.120> as<00:03:46.270> in<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.940> barrel<00:03:49.300> lights<00:03:49.540> up

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
working as in the the barrel lights up

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.090 
working as in the the barrel lights up
and<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:51.610> affects<00:03:52.240> us<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.660> gate<00:03:52.990> with<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
and it affects us and gate with the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.250 
and it affects us and gate with the
person<00:03:54.580> if<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.270> person<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.660> off<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.020> ground

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
person if the person is off the ground

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.410 
person if the person is off the ground
the<00:03:56.500> NBA<00:03:56.830> won't<00:03:57.070> be<00:03:57.250> successful<00:03:57.820> at<00:03:58.270> the

the NBA won't be successful at the

the NBA won't be successful at the

I<00:04:28.300> was<00:04:28.330> having<00:04:28.450> which

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
I was having which

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:35.070 
I was having which
it<00:04:29.589> made<00:04:30.039> it<00:04:30.069> so<00:04:30.399> long<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.789> build<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:33.839> this<00:04:34.839> is

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
it made it so long to build and this is

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.290 
it made it so long to build and this is
where<00:04:35.349> the<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.249> collision<00:04:36.610> detection<00:04:36.909> comes
