water<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:41.260> flame<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.710> still<00:04:41.740> on<00:04:42.190> medium<00:04:42.729> heat

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
water the flame is still on medium heat

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.400 
water the flame is still on medium heat
and<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.570> want<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.780> keep<00:04:43.900> it<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.080> way<00:04:44.199> for

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
and you want to keep it that way for

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.400 
and you want to keep it that way for
right<00:04:44.680> now<00:04:46.020> give<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.139> good<00:04:47.169> mix<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:49.289> this<00:04:50.289> is

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
right now give it a good mix and this is

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.320 
right now give it a good mix and this is
a<00:04:50.440> good<00:04:50.650> time<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.830> check<00:04:51.099> your<00:04:51.280> salt<00:04:51.580> remember

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
a good time to check your salt remember

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.150 
a good time to check your salt remember
we<00:04:52.479> saw<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.990> make<00:04:53.139> a<00:04:53.260> quite<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.560> bit<00:04:53.800> but<00:04:54.010> we

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
we saw to the make a quite a bit but we

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.100 
we saw to the make a quite a bit but we
squeezed<00:04:54.520> out<00:04:54.700> all<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.090> water<00:04:55.300> so<00:04:55.630> most<00:04:55.960> of

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
squeezed out all that water so most of

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.750 
squeezed out all that water so most of
the<00:04:56.169> salt<00:04:56.410> probably<00:04:57.010> came<00:04:57.160> out<00:04:57.370> with<00:04:57.639> that

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
the salt probably came out with that

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.969 
the salt probably came out with that
water<00:04:58.000> but<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:58.690> little<00:04:58.960> bit<00:04:59.110> really<00:04:59.410> seasoned

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
water but a little bit really seasoned

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.650 
water but a little bit really seasoned
so<00:05:00.430> at<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.639> point<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.000> can<00:05:01.120> taste<00:05:01.330> a<00:05:01.510> little

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
so at this point you can taste a little

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.480 
so at this point you can taste a little
bit<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.960> that<00:05:02.050> water<00:05:02.289> and<00:05:02.680> make<00:05:03.070> sure<00:05:03.220> it's<00:05:03.370> to

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
bit of that water and make sure it's to

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.070 
bit of that water and make sure it's to
your<00:05:03.580> liking<00:05:03.729> or<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.450> can<00:05:04.570> add<00:05:04.690> some<00:05:04.720> marching

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
your liking or you can add some marching

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.670 
your liking or you can add some marching
in<00:05:05.289> to<00:05:05.880> so<00:05:06.880> you<00:05:07.030> mixed<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:07.510> well<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:08.050> you

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
in to so you mixed it well and you

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.529 
in to so you mixed it well and you
checked<00:05:08.889> on<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.099> salt<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:09.669> now<00:05:10.300> we're<00:05:10.450> going

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
checked on the salt and now we're going

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.360 
checked on the salt and now we're going
to<00:05:10.599> let<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:10.750> boil<00:05:11.169> in<00:05:11.530> fact<00:05:12.099> we're<00:05:12.190> going<00:05:12.280> to

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
to let it boil in fact we're going to

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.089 
to let it boil in fact we're going to
increase<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.820> heat<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.000> little<00:05:13.300> bit<00:05:13.449> and<00:05:14.099> let

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
increase the heat a little bit and let

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.900 
increase the heat a little bit and let
it<00:05:15.220> boil<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:15.910> once<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:17.020> rice<00:05:17.770> comes<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.820> the

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
it boil and once the rice comes to the

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.719 
it boil and once the rice comes to the
top<00:05:19.120> you'll<00:05:19.539> be<00:05:19.660> able<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.900> see<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.139> rice<00:05:20.729> form

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
top you'll be able to see the rice form

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.760 
top you'll be able to see the rice form
a<00:05:21.820> layer<00:05:22.000> on<00:05:22.030> top<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:23.229> are<00:05:23.349> going<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.590> see

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
a layer on top and you are going to see

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.100 
a layer on top and you are going to see
a<00:05:23.800> whole<00:05:23.949> lot<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.160> water<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.729> the<00:05:25.690> water<00:05:25.900> will

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
a whole lot of water and the water will

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.409 
a whole lot of water and the water will
kind<00:05:26.349> of<00:05:26.380> get<00:05:26.500> absorbed<00:05:27.000> that's<00:05:28.000> when<00:05:28.300> you

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
kind of get absorbed that's when you

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.400 
kind of get absorbed that's when you
need<00:05:28.539> to<00:05:29.190> reduce<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.430> heat<00:05:30.580> cover<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:31.840> we

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
need to reduce the heat cover it and we

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.800 
need to reduce the heat cover it and we
cook

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
cook

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.400 
cook
from<00:05:32.960> them<00:05:33.170> for<00:05:33.680> about<00:05:33.740> 15<00:05:34.220> minutes<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:35.410> water

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
from them for about 15 minutes so water

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.160 
from them for about 15 minutes so water
has<00:05:36.590> evaporated<00:05:36.710> from<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.340> rice<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:38.050> most<00:05:39.050> of

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
has evaporated from the rice and most of

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.620 
has evaporated from the rice and most of
the<00:05:39.230> moisture<00:05:39.320> is<00:05:39.560> gone<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.920> rice<00:05:40.070> is<00:05:40.570> kind<00:05:41.570> of

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
the moisture is gone the rice is kind of

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.750 
the moisture is gone the rice is kind of
fluffy<00:05:41.930> but<00:05:42.200> not<00:05:42.590> all<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.130> way<00:05:43.220> there<00:05:43.250> so<00:05:43.700> at

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
fluffy but not all the way there so at

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.920 
fluffy but not all the way there so at
this<00:05:43.880> time<00:05:44.060> we're<00:05:44.210> going<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.389> cover<00:05:44.570> it<00:05:44.780> with<00:05:44.810> a

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
this time we're going to cover it with a

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.030 
this time we're going to cover it with a
tight<00:05:45.169> lid<00:05:45.410> and<00:05:45.740> set<00:05:46.370> our<00:05:46.490> timer<00:05:46.669> 15<00:05:47.330> minutes

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
tight lid and set our timer 15 minutes

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.260 
tight lid and set our timer 15 minutes
chip<00:05:49.040> on<00:05:49.160> it<00:05:49.280> after<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:50.950> and<00:05:51.950> we<00:05:52.000> also<00:05:53.000> going

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
chip on it after that and we also going

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.370 
chip on it after that and we also going
to<00:05:53.330> lower<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:54.050> heat<00:05:54.080> to<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.560> lowest<00:05:54.680> setting

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
to lower the heat to the lowest setting

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.300 
to lower the heat to the lowest setting
so<00:05:57.380> if<00:05:57.440> you<00:05:57.530> have<00:05:57.650> a<00:05:57.680> sim

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
so if you have a sim

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.760 
so if you have a sim
that's<00:05:58.760> the<00:05:58.850> best<00:05:59.030> way<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.210> do<00:05:59.419> it<00:05:59.590> it's<00:06:00.590> been

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
that's the best way to do it it's been

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.990 
that's the best way to do it it's been
15<00:06:01.160> minutes<00:06:01.780> you<00:06:02.780> open<00:06:03.710> it<00:06:03.800> up<00:06:03.889> turn<00:06:04.790> off<00:06:04.940> the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
15 minutes you open it up turn off the

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.640 
15 minutes you open it up turn off the
flame<00:06:05.510> and<00:06:06.310> I<00:06:07.310> we<00:06:08.180> have<00:06:08.300> a<00:06:09.760> really<00:06:10.760> big<00:06:10.910> four

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
flame and I we have a really big four

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.630 
flame and I we have a really big four
yes<00:06:12.650> but<00:06:12.890> if<00:06:12.980> you're<00:06:13.100> gonna<00:06:13.220> have<00:06:13.400> one<00:06:13.430> of

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
yes but if you're gonna have one of

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.630 
yes but if you're gonna have one of
these<00:06:13.850> you<00:06:13.910> can<00:06:14.180> use<00:06:14.240> a<00:06:14.419> fork<00:06:14.810> or<00:06:15.550> actually<00:06:16.550> my

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
these you can use a fork or actually my

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.970 
these you can use a fork or actually my
grandmother<00:06:17.030> used<00:06:17.240> to<00:06:17.330> do<00:06:17.480> the<00:06:18.440> other<00:06:18.620> end<00:06:18.860> of

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
grandmother used to do the other end of

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.830 
grandmother used to do the other end of
the<00:06:19.190> thing<00:06:19.910> she<00:06:19.940> would<00:06:20.210> just<00:06:20.360> fluff<00:06:20.570> up<00:06:20.720> the

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
the thing she would just fluff up the

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.810 
the thing she would just fluff up the
rice<00:06:21.020> with<00:06:21.320> that<00:06:21.530> so<00:06:21.919> a<00:06:22.190> lot<00:06:22.669> of<00:06:22.730> different

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
rice with that so a lot of different

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.810 
rice with that so a lot of different
ways<00:06:23.210> around<00:06:23.360> it<00:06:23.630> I<00:06:24.130> think<00:06:25.130> it's<00:06:25.220> a<00:06:25.280> meat<00:06:25.490> fork

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
ways around it I think it's a meat fork

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.100 
ways around it I think it's a meat fork
yeah<00:06:26.180> right<00:06:26.390> I<00:06:26.419> think<00:06:26.690> it's<00:06:26.780> called<00:06:26.960> you

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
yeah right I think it's called you

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.780
