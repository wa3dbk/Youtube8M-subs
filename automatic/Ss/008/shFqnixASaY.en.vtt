00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 kicked off in barcelona at samsung on the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.819
 Craft the band has just been that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.309
 galaxy s 6 and the galaxy nexus 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.400
 we are going to see you last 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:17.690
 get closer now like that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.920
 galaxy s 6 only actually with two 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.539
 angled display countries so that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 what we have from the loud expert samsung 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.289
 here at the sex age of both sides 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.369
 brought however seems to me that can 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.170
 but synonymous s.der size of the device 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.730
 altogether a little more compact is the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 not quite as strong 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.530
 something a little bit softer this works 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.480
 whole is very interesting if you have it 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.280
 holding in hand and can provide here because 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.480
 displayrand looks like because of the over 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.160
 goes to the side so a very 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.710
 interesting optical effect and 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.059
 Of course samsung also has it 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 the right display can be its 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.030
 given functions or more 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 I show one of these functions 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.180
 you sometimes you can here it certain 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.910
 now nothing saved with it even what 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.140
 contacts in colored markings 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.489
 deposit and then this can be so 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.379
 pull out and get here so quick 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.030
 actions for the contacts so samsung 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.129
 Do not let this run display too 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.680
 it will be like this on the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 For example, the display has to lie and the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.130
 Contacts would now be highlighted in yellow 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.810
 call then it lights up here and yellow that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.100
 means one sees immediately acoustic if 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.960
 The device is muted 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.220
 there is no special ringing sound and and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.450
 the contact must now be provided 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.909
 I have the color in the moment 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 can assign on the left side 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.600
 we do not have any special function here 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.799
 just flipboard on so there is now 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.759
 not something especially popular 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.770
 At least I can see that at first 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.820
 Maybe samsung still does not have a look 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.049
 a feature in the software 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.700
 can be turned on 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.680
 otherwise we have the same 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.200
 specifications as well as the s6 the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.570
 means we have the exit processor in the 14th 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.860
 naked process presumably made 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.010
 the 74 20 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.950
 we have 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.140
 the weko hd display with 512 we have 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.910
 the same 2550 milliamp hours 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.830
 because we are not changing any more 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.350
 do not have a micro sd card slot the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.880
 sim cards you can see here slipping 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.230
 above because at the side of course no 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.090
 place is but that's worried that 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.880
 only what is pushed in the device 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.540
 There is otherwise just go 32 64 and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.830
 128 gigabyte variants what the price 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.030
 We will not know how much we will cost 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.150
 assume that it will be again 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.520
 To be more expensive than the regular one 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.899
 galaxy s 6 yes otherwise everything would still exist 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.910
 quite a lot about this device too 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.440
 say it is very nice I like it 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.720
 in fact, the back as in the case 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.480
 s6 solved very nicely with the glass and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.070
 that you look very rammed 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.600
 futuristic and very very 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.040
 pragmatic somehow so any 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.170
 cool device that was synonymous several times 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.820
 in the presentation itself said that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.550
 is a cool device and can not 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.140
 so far confirm it is cool and it 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.610
 feels good and this card this 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.500
 I'm more of a fan of these 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.680
 rounded sides that has with mine 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.800
 note 4 stelle failed the quotations 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.630
 is synonymous samsung galaxy s 6 good 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.760
 As I said down here you can 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.630
 to have a fight 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.180
 Overall, this works in any case 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.430
 ready and it is a very nice device 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.660
 more about galaxy s 6 is also available here 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.280
 in the future it will be in the next 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.600
 days we give track the device 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.190
 course , in the short time 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.600
 as I said, I limit myself now 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.400
 to show you the core changes 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.660
 to tell you it's a very nice one 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.340
 device and for me personally the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.080
 decision between the htc one in 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.540
 new and the samsung galaxy 6 or the 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.950
 66 net not easy fall though 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.269
 you liked the video it tends 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.070
 but jokingly subscribed to by your friend 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.600

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.610
 it just often there is everything 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.340
 Asia without all product news not 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.570
 only samsung the galaxy s 6 that one in 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.440
 new but also everything else 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.060
 manufacturers then also show that 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.440
 relaxing things here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.730
 rubble over, I am poor you rejoice 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.730
