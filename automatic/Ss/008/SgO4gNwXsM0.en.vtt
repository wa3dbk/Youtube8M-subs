 sight of mr near point 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.080
 good that I played this game because they gave it to me along with Miguel Bosé 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.110
 seen that the game follows the rules of the anime or that the pieces fighting 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.160
 against tournament sayings since my personal opinion this game is very 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.950
 well for the great saga of vows to start streets now look at the liter 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.259
 the game would have been even better if they had extended it to the saga of 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.639
 cruises good for that the point was made that there are others that will explain it 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.629

 they like in the rest of the game has improved 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.129

 it's good that they're going to be at least lengthened it until behind
