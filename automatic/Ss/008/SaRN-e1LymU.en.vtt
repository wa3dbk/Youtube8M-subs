00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
this bike is they did lengthen it a

this bike is they did lengthen it a
little<00:02:21.950> bit<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.190> wheelbase<00:02:22.580> actually

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
little bit the wheelbase actually

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.530 
little bit the wheelbase actually
increases<00:02:23.960> by<00:02:24.440> about<00:02:24.700> three<00:02:25.700> inches<00:02:26.390> it's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
increases by about three inches it's

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.420 
increases by about three inches it's
actually<00:02:26.810> 3.2<00:02:27.560> if<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.860> want<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.100> get<00:02:28.220> specific

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430

actually 3.2 if you want to get specific
but<00:02:28.970> about<00:02:29.240> three<00:02:29.540> inches<00:02:30.520> which<00:02:31.520> gives<00:02:31.790> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
but about three inches which gives the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.570 
but about three inches which gives the
bike<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.690> GT<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:34.300> little<00:02:35.300> bit<00:02:36.190> slower<00:02:37.190> turn

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
bike the GT a little bit slower turn

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.850 
bike the GT a little bit slower turn
than<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.060> esting<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.930> does<00:02:39.110> happen<00:02:39.350> if<00:02:39.770> I

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
than the esting that does happen if I

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.949 
than the esting that does happen if I
does<00:02:40.160> not<00:02:40.640> like<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.120> tighter<00:02:41.360> corners<00:02:41.660> as
