00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.309
 confrontation on the street 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.250
 navigation software for aifon 4 with mayonnaise 4 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.169
 We try 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:17.259
 in 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.109
 this is what I fear and sygic 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.140
 ill. mo italy and dynamic 7 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.850
 I will try these three navigation software because they are very similar 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.580
 alla in mengoni in the user interface and also as a 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.380
 navigation are very very similar 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.320
 and let's go immediately to see them 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.800
 let's start with in the grave 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 I'm there in a year 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 in the background 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.070
 highway 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 portrait lens that ages video a team 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.040
 very 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 very fluid 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.239
 ubisoft and behaved very well mind 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.770
 tommy are interfaced 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 the graphics 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.850
 the second true ille 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.960
 dynamics 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.330
 the possibility of choosing 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.810
 id low 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.090
 setting contacts also ex we see 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.270
 briefly the settings 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.570
 new navigator 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.690
 sound mode I waited for re regional personal travel we have 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.780
 also extras with assistance and user buildings 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.170
 let's look at other features 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 me very cold we can also change the appearance 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.610
 in fact we can also set a 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.600
 I have a background also taken from the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.970
 from the library 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.259
 how can we see 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.089
 we have the possibility to choose the online mode then in 3d 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.159
 one year mode 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.879
 in comparison I love the fire only on easy marina torre we will wait for it 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.749
 second time 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:30.310
 now I just want to make people laugh at a brief comparison between these teasing that they have 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.469
 a truly graphical interface 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.169
 similar 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.729
 huh 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.539
 where can I see below king

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.759
 faithfully 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.189
 the characteristics of tomtom 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.689
 this was the enix cot 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.409
 Easter we pass altair so 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.409
 free the sygic aura 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.899
 this also 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.999
 so you know navigator well 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.919
 so it just gives me an overview of the settings 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.279
 now I have difficulties light table 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.659
 the same but it's full 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.369
 diego day 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.669
 I'm recovering with a 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.979
 samsung galaxy s2 just wanted to make people laugh 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.379
 let's say the speed of the three I know why they are high 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.699

 right so shortly in portrait lens key 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.059
 in this case we say the most fluid and certainly the tom tom 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.879
 art and also the finesse a small tracing 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.059
 we make excellent maps excellent menu 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.850
 is a well harper user interface 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.850
 these three navigator very very similar 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.279
 therefore a brief comparison between the sygic aura the reader but 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:00.879
