 Hello everyone and today's release will be 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.320
 about the wedding 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:15.870
 I apologize for having such a voice 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:22.680
 strange i'm sick already moved away from the topic and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:30.050

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:36.270
 many times and so now i am too 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.530
 married but somehow he had not long ago 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.700
 comes into play 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 and I want to tie a divorce and this 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:01:00.199
 hurt it hurt i lazhanul this video 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:01:04.049
 take off I develop and find very difficult 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.589
 for this you need to be rich and high 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.090
 level 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:15.799
 look for i need him to be in you and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.340
 the level was less but how to get married 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.490
 need to add 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.689
 buddy and chat with him if the person 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.930
 and generally do not talk about it all 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:31.079
 immediately divorce will also ask 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.619
 now you enter the game well, do not answer 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.619
 yes but 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.619
 that's not true here 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.619
 Yaroslav he came into the game 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:56.319
 I do not know six months probably ago, so 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.319
 remove your train you need to step by step 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.189
 broke down there hugging raise and 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.700
 raise 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:14.390
 best friends and then you can become 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:19.489
 a couple and then he should make you 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.660
 the proposal is to agree with you 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.950
 or not but I always agree sometimes 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.400
 even regret it 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.329
 walls you will open you will 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.569
 engaged to 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.569
 passport will be such a silver ring 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.620
 the pearls you need to save money 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.980
 wedding suits 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.389
