00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
ever had this happen it's supposed to be

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.299 
ever had this happen it's supposed to be
a<00:00:12.630> touchscreen<00:00:12.990> phone<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.950> why<00:00:14.099> doesn't

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
a touchscreen phone so why doesn't

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.080 
a touchscreen phone so why doesn't
touching<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.820> work<00:00:16.279> many<00:00:17.279> smartphones<00:00:17.640> have

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
touching it work many smartphones have

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.760 
touching it work many smartphones have
what's<00:00:18.300> called<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.600> capacitive<00:00:19.230> touch<00:00:19.439> screen

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
what's called a capacitive touch screen

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.950 
what's called a capacitive touch screen
what<00:00:20.250> does<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.400> mean<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.270> means<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
what does that mean it means that the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
what does that mean it means that the
screen<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.500> sense<00:00:22.769> anything<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.730> comes

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
screen can sense anything that comes

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
screen can sense anything that comes
near<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.689> hold<00:00:24.869> an<00:00:24.990> electrical

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
near it that can hold an electrical

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.920 
near it that can hold an electrical
charge<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.670> example<00:00:27.029> skin<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.480> very<00:00:27.630> good

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
charge so for example skin is very good

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.120 
charge so for example skin is very good
at<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:28.349> gloves<00:00:29.150> are<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:33.770> another<00:00:34.770> way<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
at it but gloves are not another way is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
at it but gloves are not another way is
to<00:00:35.160> use<00:00:35.280> something<00:00:35.610> conductive<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.420> extend

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to use something conductive to extend

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.299 
to use something conductive to extend
the<00:00:36.870> electrical<00:00:37.260> properties<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.739> your<00:00:38.010> skin

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the electrical properties of your skin

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.850 
the electrical properties of your skin
to<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> outside<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.390> glove<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
to the outside of the glove one way to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.170 
to the outside of the glove one way to
do<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.250> would<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.700> use<00:00:41.820> something

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
do this would be to use something

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.080 
do this would be to use something
metallic<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.899> wire<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.829> metal<00:00:43.890> snap<00:00:44.520> but

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
metallic like wire or metal snap but

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.610 
metallic like wire or metal snap but
that<00:00:45.210> would<00:00:45.329> conduct<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.840> cold<00:00:46.200> from<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that would conduct be cold from the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.319 
that would conduct be cold from the
outside<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> glove<00:00:47.309> into<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.789> hand<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
outside of the glove into your hand and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.110 
outside of the glove into your hand and
it<00:00:49.260> might<00:00:49.440> scratch<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.920> screen<00:00:50.219> instead

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it might scratch your screen instead

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.979 
it might scratch your screen instead
we're<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> use<00:00:51.539> something<00:00:51.840> called

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
we're going to use something called

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.889 
we're going to use something called
conductive<00:00:52.800> thread<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:54.480> conducts

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
conductive thread it conducts

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.619 
conductive thread it conducts
electricity<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.980> wire<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.879> washes

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
electricity just like wire but it washes

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
electricity just like wire but it washes
and<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.680> thread<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.730> this

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and so is just like thread for this

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
and so is just like thread for this
project<00:01:00.239> we'll<00:01:00.449> need<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.600> needle<00:01:00.870> some

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
project we'll need a needle some

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.210 
project we'll need a needle some
conductive<00:01:01.949> thread<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.789> scissors<00:01:03.000> oh

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
conductive thread and some scissors oh

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.679 
conductive thread and some scissors oh
and<00:01:05.220> you'll<00:01:05.430> need<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> glove<00:01:05.760> you'll<00:01:06.540> probably

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and you'll need a glove you'll probably

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.149 
and you'll need a glove you'll probably
have<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> buy<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> conductive<00:01:07.619> thread<00:01:07.710> online

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
have to buy the conductive thread online

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.070 
have to buy the conductive thread online
sometimes<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.060> sold<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.360> big<00:01:09.510> spools<00:01:09.780> like

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
sometimes it's sold in big spools like

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
sometimes it's sold in big spools like
this<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> look<00:01:11.100> around<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.580> find

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this but if you look around you can find

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.539 
this but if you look around you can find
it<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.180> shorter<00:01:12.630> links<00:01:12.930> first<00:01:13.830> turn<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> glove

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it in shorter links first turn the glove

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.340 
it in shorter links first turn the glove
inside<00:01:14.939> out<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.720> use<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.020> point<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
inside out you can use the point of the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.260 
inside out you can use the point of the
scissors<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.830> help<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> fingers<00:01:20.270> thread
