00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.210
 Hello 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.210
 Today I'll show you someone like that 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.049
 Christmas keys cake makes first 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.970
 Of course, you need a cake and a cake 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.070
 the client object with her two 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.189
 you could then cut out circles 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.189
 composed together with jam 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.259
 Of course you can get that taste up 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.790
 or too low as you like 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.430
 leave it up to you 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.379
 and then the cake with something 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.059
 chocolate gage and for 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.210
 About 15 minutes in the freezer 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.070
 in the meantime we can 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.140
 ever prepare the snowman and 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.489
 this will be a little further from the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.920
 of course you can also roll out 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.250
 take marzipan and then with one 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 round kicks cookie cutter and one 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.150
 shot glass out two circles 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.780
 they will be done with the help of something 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.400
 water simply composed naturally 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.260
 it only needs eyes and for that 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.720
 I take something black from Kontroll 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.220
 in small kitchens and place 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.200
 then just on the small circle for 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.630
 the nose I take something orange from 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.150
 Dor and bring that into such a 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.210
 triangular shape and then fix it 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.049
 also with some water in the face 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.970
 of the snowman drink something from 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.440
 then i roll the buttons for the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.750
 snowman and of course you have to 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.850
 do not use pink ones you can 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.250
 Use any color you want then 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.460
 something of those same roses will come from there 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.300
 rolled out and stripped and cut 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.560
 the weather 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.560
 The scarf of the snowman 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.610
 Now I have a circle 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.500
 gouged and I share again 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.870
 in the half so that his crescent shape 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.220
 arises and that will be the cap for 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.410
 the snowman he is not making 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.080
 they could also be useful 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.590
 let go but I thought that was very sweet 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 looked 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.380
 the snowman is ready so far now 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.180
 namely roll something light blue from there 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.400
 because you can of course also here 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.020
 I take another color again 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.490
 just thought so bright blue sets one 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.010
 a bit of snow there and then I cut 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.390
 put it in a thick strip so that he 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.890
 once it fits the cake 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.170
 and now he is from there on as said 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.170
 just wrapped around the cake 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.760
 and because that's up here, of course 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.519
 not so nice looks again 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.989
 something from the chocolate garage and 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.579
 Spread the top of my cake 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.349
 but think of it here a little 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.530
 let it go because it will be later 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.239
 how a cup look like the whole 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.060
 then decorated with minima fast 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.640
 I just go for the handle 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.239
 something of that rolled out and then in 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.670
 brought a mold and I attach that 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.799
 Now I'm just finishing it 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.290
 my brush so small holes in the 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.900
 Make cake and then it should be just fine 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.799
 hold 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.019
 now only the snowman has to 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.019
 to be fixed and I glue that 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.629
 Just go back to the water with some water 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.280
 cake on 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.349
 and that's what the finished cake looks like 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.480
 I still decided a few 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.220
 from these snowflakes sprinkle too 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.379
 take and stick to the cake 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.299
 and yes I hope I have the video 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.019
 Thank you for watching and see you soon 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.019
 next time bye
