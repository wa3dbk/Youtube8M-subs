00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 hi guys i chose five perfumes that 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.150
 I have to give tip is for you to 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.420
 perfumes to use in the winter that are 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.660
 perfumes that are a little heavier than 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.789
 I think it blends more with the days. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.240
 cooler is the one I chose from here that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.890
 is the eln in thierry mugler 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.859
 I bought it in the summer and I found it 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.500
 I was suffocating a lot in the summer there I 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.520
 I would rather wait to use it now in the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.910
 Winter 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.879
 mine is a title let and even being the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.399
 I think he's very strong and he 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.879
 has a fixation so absurd it gets 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.309
 on the skin all day but that perfume is 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.010
 Of the ones you like, you do not. 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.440
 I do not think I have a middle ground because 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 It is a strong perfume scent and a remarkable 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.739
 It's not the same as I think the angel is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.810
 much more two and much more a relative 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.640
 but also goes in that line or you like 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.799
 You do not like people who think 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.799
 horrible and there are people who think 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.369
 Wonderful, I know more people than 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.830
 They like what they do not like but that's it. 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.549
 kind of perfume or do you like you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.030
 Do not like it, do not have that deaai. I started to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.570
 Like I think at least on the way. 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.490
 he is very good 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.610
 another that I 've never met before 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.509
 time as well as what is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.509
 team of the royal house and he is beautiful the weak 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:49.340
 also from the service here it seems 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:55.790
 exact game and he is very striking to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:59.430
 first he reminded me of the classic but 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.439
 I do not know if it 's very similar, I do not think 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.740
 from here until a little more delicious 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.799
 the classic is one of my favorites but 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.929
 I think this is my call - I 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.819
 I found it better 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.909
 is one of the few that I also like 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.010
 box is real because I'm not much of a fan 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:21.870
 I do not like the love, I love the box. 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.890
 and those other perfumes is that here 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.719
 I liked very much 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.840
 I really liked it but it is a perfume 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.549
 it's also got incredible fixation 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.290
 This one is farfal 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:36.959
 it has a fixation type that lasts the day 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.909
 whole is used every morning in the morning 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.950
 It's still there and strong is not the one going 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:48.349
 getting weak over time no he is 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.419
 a very striking perfume very good here 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.579
 I can not use these perfumes in summer 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:57.599
 I do not know, I think they are strong perfumes and 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.769
 and has a presence in the summer 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.780
 suffocates 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:05.730
 That's why I think they are perfumes 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.370
 good for the winter even those two 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.230
 there and if it is not so much, it is not 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.329
 the legend of fashion 'glam album and I saw 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.030
 on the website that his vial is 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.579
 inspired by the jewels of a blues rings 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:27.930
 but that's a screw 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:32.340
 For me it's not a screw ring and that 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.310
 hence he is what he is today the fan too 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.239
 also has a very good fixing it 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.659
 hence he is never sweet. 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.709
 it is already fruity and I like it a lot 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:49.049
 of the perfumes are more fruitful but this 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:55.470
 also is the striking perfume is a perfume 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:57.689
 more sophisticated the perfume that has brand 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.900
 who has class even knows the perfume more 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:04.709
 sophisticated but this one from here I do not think 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.889
 that is a perfume that is only for day 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.379
 cold that will focus on the heat I think 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.359
 It's not not being here, it's a bit more. 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.180
 the others but also has 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:21.530
 also the outstanding perfume and is 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:24.530
 very good to be a fan and another 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.300
 that I chose with this one that is the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.639
 I pulse the airplane so it's okay 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.370
 selling now for jequiti nÃ© 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.580
 and I hope I used it once in a 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.919
 day of heat and it was simply 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.919
 horrible on the skin stayed the river 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.040
 there was a day that was raining 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:49.190
 That thin rain, I got it. 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.410
 he went to buy something on the street I 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.850
 I was feeling that smell, you know. 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.800
 definitely for me is a perfume that 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.540
 matches the cold 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.510
 in the cold the smell is not that the smell of it 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.610
 Changed once was much better 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.980
 in the cold that in the heat why I 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.930
 I think there are perfumes that combine 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.510
 more cold days that combine more 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.100
 with hot days and I was feeling 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.410
 that smell of people who came to study 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.780
 Is this there after I've been reminded is the 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.790
 the course of b or c 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:28.040
 it is a perfume plus the vanilla side 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:31.340
 There are a lot of people who compare him a lot 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.850
 they are not alike but they are 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.810
 so you know but when 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.710
 You splash he got a deal like that. 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:45.140
 half citric medium 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.690
 I do not know where it starts, the citrix is â€‹â€‹getting 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.220
 Sweet is very tasty perfume 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.740
 I think it 's a profile that goes only one 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:59.780
 striking perfume or super sensual perfume 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:06:02.150
 and it is very good and enjoyed it more weight and 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.900
 last one I chose a national one that is today 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.930
 the shock that is limited edition but 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.470
 always comes back every year on the back page 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.310
 and he is a chocolate scent but he 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.529
 that is not too sweet chocolate know 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.919
 he also has 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:25.519
 some such a footprint of an air 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:28.329
 dividing so well in fundinho know I 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:33.259
 I do not know if he has anything 

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:38.329
 try lemon so he gives that 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:39.679
 broken in chocolate vanilla and I think 

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:42.909
 that any perfume they have chocolate 

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:47.119
 It's good, it gets good in winter because 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:50.059
 it seems that it is what feels one more thing 

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:52.939
 hot sabino perfume so much today that it has 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:55.879
 chocolate when the woodworking you 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.469
 feel the hottest perfume then you 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:00.439
 ends up smelling more 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:02.749
 warm in the winter, which is 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:05.149
 perfume that has to be very sweet or 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:07.129
 whether the flag is a 

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:10.489
 hot summer perfume 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:12.019
 No one deserves it and will not suffocate you. 

00:07:10.489 --> 00:07:14.089
 guys on the side 

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:16.729
 so I guess any question that 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:21.099
 Have a good chocolate 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:26.199
 a good tip to use in winter 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:29.089
 so the choice only in 5 that only on that day 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:31.099
 I chose the 65 are questions that I 

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:32.479
 I have at home I know there are others who are 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:35.509
 very good to use in the winter 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:37.939
 too but I like to talk about those I 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:39.949
 I have and those I know 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:42.619
 so that's it folks I hope you 

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:45.519
 liked the video of the tips and even 

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:45.519
 the next teleton
