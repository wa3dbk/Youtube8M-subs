 how to become one hundred percent trader and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.129
 was it possible to be one hundred percent 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.890
 a family man, listen to the insidious question without 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.369
 gear at the bottom 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.729
 there was such a moment that they were on the verge 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.460
 when I was doing scalping I will say 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.640
 honestly scalping us a lot of income was not 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.430
 that is, imagine what is good 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.899
 amount and you from this amount month about 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.869
 30-35 percent sausage and 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:33.759
 this this very good money was this 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.679
 there was such a thing but let's say so on junior 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.670
 speak for and 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:42.939
 it is confused very quickly i am here to me 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.119
 did not like firstly what I could on 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.840

 your can wash and I am very imposing 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.270
 behaved yes there covered the computer that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.210
 I am there than just going out and I 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.350
 dived back into the computer to further 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.390
 continue scalpel this for i come 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.709
 home and raced by car immediately 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.170
 here there is a section of the road where you need 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 go 40 kilometers an hour and there it is 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.200
 the little hill there would be an opportunity the reed can't 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.180
 I know there must be to take off well, 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.150
 impossible to ride on this hill 40 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.140
 kilometers an hour I clocked the machine method 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.600
 was Hyundai sonata 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.690
 I dispersed him holding whether that 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.150
 rushed straight buzz as soon as possible 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.420
 run home grab anything on 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.420
 the kitchen and again this is the clap 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.500
 clap clap and look further 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.300
 keep trading was cool 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.610
 money and at the moment it came to the brink 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.269
 in the family sock so yes when bingli good 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.220
 felt that moment that what the 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.380
 no but not at all 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.590
 Well, that's not what he's thinking 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.480
 turned on or something like that 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.709
 it turned out so well here for these three 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.769
 go kart three miles 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.750
 month it was good to earn extra money and 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.880
 she turned out to be such a pillow 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.829
 Security is now exactly there for a year 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.799
 stop doing nothing at all 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:23.540
 Here also the family began to pay more attention 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:26.600
 and saw a more relaxed trade 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.150
 allow more harmonious though on that 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.579
 moment well here i have the smallest 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.320
 time frame was 10 minutes i'm 10 minutes but 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.010
 if you think that this scalping was well 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.950
 that those actions that I took were there 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.350
 tens and 3 more minutes like that 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.840
 guide means there are scalps for 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.720
 here I am at the box office of the guide 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.380
 used 3 minutes and this movement 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.500
 three minutes use adax using 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.299
 German us used snp 500 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.280
 here and in my our sperm in my 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.500
 Savings Bank and here now in these 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.750
 three papers I watched watched in 3 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.209
 mercy and here already brown ishimoku 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.040
 futures on rts in this until the evening bargained 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.600
 it turned out came very cool 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.880
 the strategy is pretty so simple 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.180
 nothing remarkable about this one 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.919
 the moment is calm without her 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.440
 having existed and see that principle 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.810
 I didnâ€™t spend much time until I 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.039
 certainly not up earned but the feeling of being 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.020
 that my rear has become tougher up 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.590
 harder stone on like 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.780
 stone wall then gone gone this 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.370
 fuss, what if I don't take a deal now 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.590
 Now the market will run away, I began to watch 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.930
 more such cool timeframe there 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.539
 weeks began to look at the time 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.400
 there was probably this time 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.910
 appeared because there was a rear in 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.630
 plan 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.190
 Airbags in the form of money 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.180
 there is when the trader is a hunger probably him 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.180
 still need to scalp 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.949
 to take this here and unnecessary well 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.789
 how to call to eat and chew hunt 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.410
 you know the tags is hashtag eat hunt 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.750
 to remove this desire 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.130
 sing your shoot down let there be a plus 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.680
 or minus but you will earn that he 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.889
 small amount and calm down and then 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.260
 already will trade on normal well as the 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.620
 I think this is such here for me 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:30.690
 it was clear that I thought then 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.340
 such it turns out people like me 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.580
 I guess occurred on darwin from 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.729
 monkeys than we should be different well 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.860
 so many 8 today 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.169
 so why don't we have everything else 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.590
 their most likely principle to follow but 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.620
 a set of actions so that you spend on 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.099
 investing your time is different 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:57.360
 one becomes a beer champion 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:06:00.000
 for 2 world champion on watching TV shows 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.440
 the third becomes a champion and becomes 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.150
 in principle, the president of the country 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.770
 it is concentrated since childhood and 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.070
 for some reason he is elected president 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.830
 very cool thing everyone has their own way 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.599
 with equal let's say so with equal 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.280
 the source data is what you will be with 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.289
 do your own data and how are you 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.690
 you will use your 24 hours this already 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.690
 much more important
