00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.879
 we were just a simple youth group 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.030
 a group that wanted to help others but 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.010
 we dream and we wake up with the idea of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.590
 a very different school 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.680
 we gain all our professions for 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.449
 This is what we set up at Maria's school. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.340
 pilgrim is a school completely 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.130
 different from the one you studied for 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.810
 to start a private school without 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 Monthly is a full school 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.180
 individualized family and catholic 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.469
 we want to give the poor a school of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 high standard but also a place where 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:46.910
 really experienced the love of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.910
 hope and faith 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.240
 in school maria peregrina not the class 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.890
 neither holiday nor province is the student who 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.280
 choose what it is he wants to learn 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.470
 all part of the student interest 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.900
 teacher that your tutor that increases 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.930
 pain of their learning will enter the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.670
 curricular subjects in the project that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.620

 maximum 12 members 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.320
 it's us who choose our groups 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.140
 teachers and even we want to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.360
 studying this is wonderful and in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.310
 we feel important and valued 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.890
 maybe that's why everyone here 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.840
 She's crazy about Maria's pilgrim school. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.060
 medium 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.840
 It's necessary that we stay all day. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.820
 so we can learn and study 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.360
 we work with the projects and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.800

 finally all the students of this school 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.260
 meet in an assembly that is chaired 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.330

 elected by the students themselves 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.660
 the assembly is a place where we 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.040
 we organized the finame and headed to 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.230

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.820
 we are also the managing directors and 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.030
 school teachers 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.890
 You know why because we are the school. 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:46.420
 maria would have this school year 2012 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.450
 61 students from the 2nd year to the 6th 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.120
 every year we increase a series to 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.620
 goal is not only to reach high school but 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.620
 higher education 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.150
 if it were not for the school Maria peregrina de 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.060
 be in reality of my son 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.019
 understand and draw up a pedagogy of their own 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.810
 for him 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.599
 I do not know what would be my family's 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.019
 school changed my son because he teaches 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.450
 strong and individualized 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.349
 I have four children here 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.049
 school and school within my family 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:28.610
 it's much more than a school she comes 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.970
 formalize the family she comes is to 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.670
 my family and this information 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.920
 there are several ways in which 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.470
 the monthly pedagogical 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.989
 my children's educators they will 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.540
 pass everything that happened during that 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.510
 medium and in addition they also go there in 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.950
 My house is making visits. 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.750
 monthly is also has the community 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.640
 heart where the family meets several 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.370
 families gather at the home of a 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.500
 of these families 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.720
 I Sunday of life that happens one 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.880
 once a month here in school with the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.540
 participation of all the families that 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.629
 belong to the school and have training in 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.880
 heart without a formation for life 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.470
 interior 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:25.490
 The school for me is much much more 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:30.289
 that a school is a healing formation 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.419
 inside for me and my family to 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.180
 maria school for the catholic church because 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:39.190
 was founded under the inspiration of God in a 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.190
 church youth group at the time 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.220
 as senna who thought that in the neighborhood 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.009
 great treasure 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.310
 the school maria peregrina has been our 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.460
 partner in the execution of courses and 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.470
 also of events for the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.430
 development of the neighborhood and what 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.840
 enchants 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.569
 here at school is that school is 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.479
 particular but without monthly fees 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:12.060
 payment is made differently 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.490
 through an intense participation of the 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.710
 family in the activities that the school 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.930
 realizes 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.270
 I've never seen a school like this. 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.860

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.800
