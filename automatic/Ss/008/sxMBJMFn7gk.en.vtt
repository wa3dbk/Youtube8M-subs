YouTube etc so the next pack is the
first<00:01:28.170> edition<00:01:28.560> jungle<00:01:28.950> pack<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.240> value

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
first edition jungle pack and the value

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
first edition jungle pack and the value
of<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.960> probably<00:01:31.590> somewhere<00:01:31.950> around

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
of these is probably somewhere around

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.880 
of these is probably somewhere around
eight<00:01:32.460> bucks<00:01:32.790> I'd<00:01:33.030> say<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
eight bucks I'd say it is one of the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.760 
eight bucks I'd say it is one of the
rarer<00:01:35.220> packs<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.470> classic<00:01:37.470> steps

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
rarer packs out of the classic steps

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.350 
rarer packs out of the classic steps
here<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> set<00:01:41.369> itself<00:01:41.549> I'm<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
here and as for the set itself I'm not a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.450 
here and as for the set itself I'm not a
huge<00:01:42.630> fan<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.189> these<00:01:44.280> would

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
huge fan and I think these would

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.969 
huge fan and I think these would
definitely<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.000> more<00:01:45.600> valuable<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.740> set

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
definitely be more valuable if the set

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.490 
definitely be more valuable if the set
itself<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.939> bit<00:01:48.060> better<00:01:48.500> there's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
itself was a little bit better there's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
itself was a little bit better there's
not<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.950> many<00:01:50.220> desirable<00:01:50.610> cards<00:01:51.210> in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
not really that many desirable cards in

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.539 
not really that many desirable cards in
this<00:01:51.420> set<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.930> I'm<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.350> too<00:01:53.009> crazy<00:01:53.189> about<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
this set and I'm not too crazy about the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.260 
this set and I'm not too crazy about the

first edition fossil pack and these
values<00:02:00.840> somewhere<00:02:01.229> around<00:02:01.320> six<00:02:01.799> bucks<00:02:02.040> apiece

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240

they're<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> tad<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:04.200> more<00:02:04.500> common<00:02:05.009> than<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
they're a tad bit more common than the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.200 
they're a tad bit more common than the
jungle<00:02:05.729> packs<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.390> opinion<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
jungle packs in my opinion and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.110 
jungle packs in my opinion and
the<00:02:08.330> set<00:02:08.570> itself<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.350> pretty<00:02:10.130> good<00:02:10.430> it's<00:02:10.790> got

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
the set itself is pretty good it's got

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.480 
the set itself is pretty good it's got
the<00:02:11.870> three<00:02:12.110> legendary<00:02:12.530> birds<00:02:12.890> it's<00:02:13.280> got

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
the three legendary birds it's got

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.760 
the three legendary birds it's got
Dragonite<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.840> does<00:02:14.990> have<00:02:15.020> some<00:02:15.410> desirable

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
Dragonite so it does have some desirable

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.430 
Dragonite so it does have some desirable
cards<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.610> some<00:02:16.910> pretty<00:02:17.120> good<00:02:17.440> illustrations

edition gym heroes pack and these value

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.600 
edition gym heroes pack and these value
i'd<00:02:56.930> say<00:02:57.200> somewhere<00:02:57.260> around<00:02:57.710> seven<00:02:58.370> bucks

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
i'd say somewhere around seven bucks

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.920 
i'd say somewhere around seven bucks
it's<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.300> good<00:02:59.510> estimate<00:03:00.640> there<00:03:01.640> may<00:03:02.030> be<00:03:02.780> as

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
it's a good estimate there may be as

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.280 
it's a good estimate there may be as
rare<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.860> team<00:03:04.070> rocket<00:03:04.520> maybe<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.480> tad<00:03:06.080> bit

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
rare as the team rocket maybe a tad bit

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.070 
rare as the team rocket maybe a tad bit
more<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.770> it's<00:03:07.010> kind<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.250> hard<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.520> tell<00:03:08.080> pretty

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
more so it's kind of hard to tell pretty

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.240 
more so it's kind of hard to tell pretty
much<00:03:09.200> on<00:03:09.410> par<00:03:09.440> with<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:10.840> classic<00:03:11.840> sets<00:03:12.250> in

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.980 
behind the first edition base set it's
obvious<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.790> new<00:04:23.940> sets<00:04:24.330> were<00:04:24.480> printed<00:04:24.840> a

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
obvious that the new sets were printed a

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.990 
obvious that the new sets were printed a
lot<00:04:25.230> less<00:04:25.530> than<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.950> classic<00:04:26.130> sets<00:04:26.670> here

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
course but yeah these these are quite

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.280 
course but yeah these these are quite
rare<00:04:32.850> I'd<00:04:33.150> say<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.510> value<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:34.050> somewhere

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
rare I'd say the value is somewhere

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.030 
rare I'd say the value is somewhere
around<00:04:35.930> probably<00:04:36.930> around<00:04:37.020> 20<00:04:37.410> bucks<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.830> pack

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
around probably around 20 bucks a pack

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.360 
around probably around 20 bucks a pack
maybe<00:04:38.730> 15<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.510> 20<00:04:39.810> bucks<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.140> pack<00:04:40.320> but<00:04:40.980> really<00:04:41.340> I

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
maybe 15 to 20 bucks a pack but really I

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.650 
maybe 15 to 20 bucks a pack but really I
think<00:04:41.460> they<00:04:41.730> should<00:04:41.910> be<00:04:42.030> worth<00:04:42.210> more<00:04:42.510> than

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
think they should be worth more than

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.410 
think they should be worth more than
that<00:04:42.720> because<00:04:43.080> I<00:04:43.560> mean<00:04:44.130> these<00:04:44.370> hardly<00:04:45.210> ever

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
that because I mean these hardly ever

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.830 
that because I mean these hardly ever
