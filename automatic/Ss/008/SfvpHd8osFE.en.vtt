which<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> little<00:01:41.250> bit<00:01:41.340> heavier<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> cut

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
which is a little bit heavier so you cut

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.069 
which is a little bit heavier so you cut
in<00:01:44.040> splines<00:01:44.880> anywhere<00:01:45.390> along<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.720> length<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
in splines anywhere along this length to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.870 
in splines anywhere along this length to
make<00:01:46.200> itty<00:01:46.680> bitty<00:01:46.890> axles<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.520> ever<00:01:47.670> eat<00:01:47.729> up

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
make itty bitty axles if I ever eat up

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.530 
make itty bitty axles if I ever eat up
this<00:01:48.060> car<00:01:48.380> but<00:01:49.380> uh<00:01:49.490> these<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.549> 30<00:01:50.880> spine<00:01:51.119> axles

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
this car but uh these are 30 spine axles

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.730 
this car but uh these are 30 spine axles
they're<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.810> bigger<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.229> supply<00:01:52.470> town

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
they're not bigger in supply town

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.370 
they're not bigger in supply town
they're<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.720> 30%<00:01:54.720> stronger<00:01:54.899> than<00:01:55.140> stock

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
they're just 30% stronger than stock

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:19.600 
they're just 30% stronger than stock
heavy<00:01:55.740> push<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.070> other<00:01:56.280> one

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.620 

well<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:20.700> gonna<00:02:20.819> go<00:02:21.000> figure<00:02:21.180> out<00:02:21.360> how<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.510> get

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
well I'm gonna go figure out how to get

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.809 
well I'm gonna go figure out how to get
this<00:02:21.780> other<00:02:21.959> axle<00:02:22.349> out<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.430> should<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
this other axle out but it should be the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.390 
this other axle out but it should be the
same<00:02:24.000> process
