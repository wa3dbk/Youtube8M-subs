00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
definitely be able to see a drastic

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.620 
definitely be able to see a drastic
difference<00:01:03.870> between<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> two<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.670> let's<00:01:06.450> let

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
better than the usual lobby I would get

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.670 
better than the usual lobby I would get
there's<00:01:30.509> only<00:01:30.689> two<00:01:30.960> people<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.500> who<00:01:31.650> have

after<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.530> reach<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.670> original<00:01:36.270> 15<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.259> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
after you reach the original 15 so I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020 
after you reach the original 15 so I
mean<00:01:37.560> everyone<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.100> has<00:01:38.280> prestige<00:01:38.759> at

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
mean everyone in here has prestige at

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.249 
mean everyone in here has prestige at
least<00:01:39.180> once<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.600> everyone<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.170> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.929 
least once I think everyone in here is
at<00:01:40.409> least<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.740> fifth<00:01:41.070> procedure<00:01:41.549> fourth

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
at least like fifth procedure fourth
