00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.589
 good evening and welcome to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.210
 entrepreneur blog briefly under blanc 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.130
 They accompany me on mine 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.599
 life path and learn with me the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.370
 secrets of society and 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.799
 Economics knows about politics 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.310
 and the media like to be kept secret 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.279
 Today I have a pillar 40 years 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.650
 There is no longer a long time to buy 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.080
 a gift won by the independent 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.539
 with yes and today I want to join 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 talk to them about monkeys or 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.050
 the other way I want you from 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.880
 ape telling for what 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 Experiment that you did with them 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.950
 has and this experiment I have from 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.649
 dr stefan frädrich who is a doctor in the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.180
 been psychiatry and meanwhile 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.610
 I have a management consultant 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.500
 this experiment was heard in july 2008 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 and if she is the dr stefan forster 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.390
 know or know mine has ge 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 I have these books with the günter 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 inner pig dog and then you can 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 so in his his in ours 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.430
 brains are doing pretty well so now 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.080
 So it's ape and have one 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 try with one though had a group 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.670
 kept in an appropriate manner the apes in 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.860
 the custody of behavior researchers with 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.740
 Faced a few things and that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.720
 for the ape the market very much 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.540
 very much like bananas and that's one of them 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.130
 preferred candy of which and these 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.020
 bananas you have the under the ceiling 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.369
 hanged and then could again 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 climb up to take on banal ones 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.759
 wonderful then you have since there are light barriers 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.729
 made exceptions and solve cold air 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.590
 and then the monkey climbed up and 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.990
 and now wanted to grab the banana 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.610
 the cold air shower carries and that is 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.210
 not only what monkeys do 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.380
 daily cold air and then you have it 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.180
 seen that the monkeys had several 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.649
 have tried until then 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.649
 have noticed so there are no more 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.479
 Country show is not natural 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.700
 are there still some monkeys? 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.380
 of the type extremely sales who still has to 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.580
 what are they going to try that and then 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.550
 cold 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.400
 not so bananas like cold shower 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.960
 You can not get out of it when you are in 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.060
 internet after board an experiment 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.370
 addiction then there are also in modifications 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.940
 and that one, if that's why 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.230
 The banana attacks but that one the rest 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.910
 the group with water splattered around the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.860
 Group pressure on this individual 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.430
 to create individual the club too 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.930
 to grab 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.580
 the whole group starts screaming 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.900
 the above is communicated by and the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.090
 then keep going that has that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 eyes go because they cold the water 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.290
 to get 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.320
 so that's important now so on the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.560
 a page of this experiment maybe 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.740
 it was for us management participant in 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.900
 So this seminar has been simplified by the 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.730
 group pressure and that groups feel 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.209
 one of the most special is in place 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.550
 important points in this experiment 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.459
 so and now comes the question now 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.670
 audience to you what are you doing with it 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.430
 monkeys go up there again they can 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.730
 the bananas we want the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.010
 Choosing to go something like that, we have it 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:20.370
 in our forum under know.de have 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.140
 that asked and what should they do 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.730
 so that the monkeys go there again 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.260
 After that, of course, you switch the air 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.600
 off or the water spraying one switches 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.980
 but they still do not go there 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.340
 Do not even try if it goes 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.840
 going 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.430
 that 's the special thing about it 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.989
 Do not even try it 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.410
 the suggestive in there they do not go 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.239
 down 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.980
 what could we do now so then 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.300
 we said in the forum so you 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.630
 could not go anymore 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.440
 eat 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.070
 So you could increase the pressure on 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.420
 the food 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.220
 that we are no longer species-appropriate 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.019
 You could keep the bananas 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.850
 could hang together 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.739
 work on the environment 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.510
 but you could peeled the bananas 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.350
 hang up then they look different 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.890
 maybe that works too 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.070
 you could give the port a lot 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.660
 practically gifted if the monkey can do that 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.540
 you could counter the monkey tool 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.110
 blankenstein 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.209
 Tobogganing could be banal 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.760
 occasion I found appeal again 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.019
 already mimic that from man 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.590
 Of course , whiskey could also be in the harbor 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.289
 give 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.780
 yes clearly unsustainable attitude 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.389
 but that's not what you actually have 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.940
 one has external consultants 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.160
 introduced and these external consultants 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.009
 were strangers so have strangers 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.280
 given monkeys in this group and these 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.680
 foreign port office as the bananas seen 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.160
 up there comes the alpha male and that 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.259
 beta females are not interested in us 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.669
 if they wanted to go there then and 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.389
 wanted to get that then were the 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.250
 called back 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.250
 they were even actively prevented from doing so 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.750
 that one goes there so once the 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.169
 role model does not do that power 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.770
 I do or should then go through 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.810
 the do then replaced another 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.009
 has there is now some point makes 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.389
 of people who want to do that but 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.340
 piece by piece the whole of it 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.710
 exchanged until no more in the 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.530
 group in it was the experiment 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.699
 actually witnessed and no 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.990
 monkeys the ballads 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.490
 that was social in the group 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.560
 know you do not go to the 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.729
 bananas and that has carried on 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.080
 within the group even if the 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.120
 last knowledge carrier was gone 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.430
 that would have a very long period now 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.720
 may be that then all died 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.409
 are obsessed by the children because 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.630
 but that is only a matter of a moment 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.419
 that is tradition so close to that now 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.510
 is not that but it could also 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.690
 be bananas in this world of this 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.159
 Monkeys resist that as well 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.930
 poisonous berries would be 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.909
 and then the monkeys would be each other 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.970
 walk this poisonous to eat in time 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.099
 and then they rely on her 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.470
 groups know that is once worked out 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.150
 and there you leave meet and 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:00.099
 That's why I like the things experiments 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.949
 as open as people or as open 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.360
 people are throwing 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.780
 There are many people in our world 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.210
 or in our society 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:13.560
 they do not believe in solid relationships 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.090
 one does not do one does not do one 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.080
 and who are with such people 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.510
 entertained are 17 minutes very bad 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.990
 on it so those people who 100% 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.850
 you do not need them 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.030
 that goes down from above as well me 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.440
 me so nice i think it was 98/99 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.530
 from the spirit 2000 or so 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.640
 the said basta our chancellor roosevelt 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.520
 was not in germany 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.290
 the installed job does not make me and 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.150
 the eu had long since decided that the 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.340
 soot filters come 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.930
 at the end, the french had the soot 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.900
 filter for his first brought this 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.780
 then he also sees a company 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.540
 Volkswagen I did not have that one 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:00.660
 photo up familiar comes not 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.930
 nevertheless, both this alpha 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.790
 following male is high grade 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.720
 dangerous and that is the topic of my 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.520
 Under blogs you think yourself follow them 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.990
 not blind to any opinion because 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.820
 up there but it says he usually has 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.260
 yes, see even more behind the harbor 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.000
 the monkeys just want it before that 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.620
 protect but they usually have 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.290
 a hidden agenda these are not them 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.660
 they want to talk a lot 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.160
 look at other cultures no matter in 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:34.590
 cultures may eat bananas 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:36.390
 and what did the researchers say so 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.020
 Having gotten the wheel will do that well 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.020
 create German 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.040
 yes, that's it for me and now 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.830
 I take care of this district 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.690
 40 years of the very clear after the 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.860
 names very warm thanks for 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.640
 I look forward to seeing her 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.640
 turn back on
