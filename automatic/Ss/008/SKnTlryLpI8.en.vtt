now<00:00:07.900> this<00:00:08.110> is<00:00:08.230> one<00:00:08.380> of<00:00:08.470> the<00:00:08.560> cooler<00:00:08.920> and<00:00:09.070> more

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.220 
now this is one of the cooler and more

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.400 
now this is one of the cooler and more
innovative<00:00:09.670> z68<00:00:10.420> boards<00:00:10.870> out<00:00:11.020> there<00:00:11.200> this<00:00:11.350> is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
innovative z68 boards out there this is

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.060 
innovative z68 boards out there this is
the<00:00:11.680> Z<00:00:11.860> 68<00:00:12.400> XP<00:00:12.940> ud3<00:00:13.540> from<00:00:13.780> gigabyte<00:00:14.070> gigabytes

the Z 68 XP ud3 from gigabyte gigabytes

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.620 
the Z 68 XP ud3 from gigabyte gigabytes
usually<00:00:15.490> pretty<00:00:15.670> good<00:00:15.760> at<00:00:15.910> calling<00:00:16.330> out<00:00:16.480> their

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
usually pretty good at calling out their

key<00:00:16.840> features<00:00:17.230> on<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:17.470> packaging<00:00:17.920> so<00:00:18.070> here

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
key features on the packaging so here

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.560 
key features on the packaging so here
you<00:00:18.369> can<00:00:18.520> see<00:00:18.730> it's<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:19.029> biggest<00:00:19.360> feature

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
you can see it's the biggest feature

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.750 
you can see it's the biggest feature
there<00:00:19.869> there's<00:00:20.349> an<00:00:20.560> onboard<00:00:20.980> M<00:00:21.160> SATA

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
there there's an onboard M SATA

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.760 
there there's an onboard M SATA
connector<00:00:22.510> whistle<00:00:22.900> what<00:00:23.080> that<00:00:23.260> means<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:23.650> you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
connector whistle what that means is you

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.770 
connector whistle what that means is you
can<00:00:23.949> use<00:00:24.100> intel's<00:00:24.490> srt<00:00:25.119> caching<00:00:25.570> feature

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780

6870<00:02:58.580> something<00:02:59.240> along<00:02:59.450> those<00:02:59.600> lines<00:02:59.660> you've

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
6870 something along those lines you've

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.900 
6870 something along those lines you've
got<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.260> very<00:03:00.530> potent<00:03:00.980> little<00:03:01.220> gaming<00:03:01.400> system

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
got a very potent little gaming system

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.330 
got a very potent little gaming system
so<00:03:02.510> here<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.959> see<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.410> power<00:03:03.740> design<00:03:04.160> is

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
so here you can see the power design is

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.040 
so here you can see the power design is
a<00:03:04.370> six<00:03:04.640> plus<00:03:04.850> one<00:03:04.880> phase<00:03:05.360> power<00:03:05.630> we've<00:03:05.870> also

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
a six plus one phase power we've also

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.350 
a six plus one phase power we've also
got<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.650> nice<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.190> mosfet<00:03:07.910> cooling
