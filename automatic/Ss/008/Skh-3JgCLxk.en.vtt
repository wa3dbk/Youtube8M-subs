 got there was in japan 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.080
 no one asked for it 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.870
 but let's just make a movie 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.430
 The content will be up next 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.829

 Go for career as a manga goal 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.410
 both of them quickly realize how 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.770
 sometimes ungrateful and hard job 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.450
 can 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 sticking out dates compete competition 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.140
 We always go with the pulse of the times 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.940
 are a few of the challenge 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 the guys have to face that almost 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.610
 already autobiographical work of the armchair 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.480

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.980
 October in Japan 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.539
 I'm still the whole thing 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.370
 a bit skeptical about 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.930
 bit of chili will be the whole but already 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 Never wanted to do that anyway 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.640
 that she was at the schoolyard already 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.520

 the ex the two years after the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.899
 Events of the anime take place like 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.200
 you look at that , but none of them 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.200
 be us 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.159
 I hope you understand that was one 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.259
 sarcastic wink actually 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.930
 not exactly the opposite sick 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.159
 cinema quality on us train has become yes 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.729
 already from the summary he very much 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.680
 known 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.479
 and yes even the title is again 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.849
 damn long awesome characters 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.160
 meet school setting meeting whether 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.240
 magical knights meet swords 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 select the 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.540
 be formed meet you know 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.220
 decision 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.650
 but hey maybe i'm just too 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.270
 a bit too hasty and the series shines 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.760
 in the end with ingenious plot twists and 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.200
 knock dialogogen now a release of the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.510
 Animes is also not really sure 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.260
 for being responsible 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.790
 but animation studio ever 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.990
 short teaser released the the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.880
 distribution of Japanese 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.260
 dubbing presents to one 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.760
 little character design and one 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.470
 official foot there but unfortunately 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.700
 not really much to see yet 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.230
 It looks like you're looking at it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.390
 look for extraordinary ideas in the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.270
 anime sector or are you satisfied like that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.560
 how it is 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.300
 and now I'm finally allowed over one 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.450
 wild game genre chatter that good and 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.070
 like to be underestimated 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.720
 they do not really play games 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.090
 but rather something like digital books 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.000
 are and anime based on his 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.530
 part namely stone gates and that 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.030
 original work will soon be released in europe 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.530
 league club has to celebrate the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.150
 upcoming release is a trailer 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.130
 published and it does not work 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.660
 Incredibly much new ago actually 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.970
 this is the opening 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.550
 of visual novel but that's the kittner 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.080
 really damn horny sounds on 5 june 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.420
 by the way , steins are also in 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.190
 europe for ps vita and playstation 3 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.570
 without narrow people I have with me 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.890
 just did not look at it because I just got up 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.020
 this vision opel is waiting for that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.000
 original work so to speak and I have the 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.860
 presumption is that a bit of time 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.570
 is better than the anime we have the 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.860
 first consequences of the anime not really 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.130
 I like it and I still remember it 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.220
 better 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.930
 but first I believe that 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.830
 bishops through and then the anime though 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.160
 I write myself and in the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.770
 comments whether the game is anime that 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.910
 anime for god to be complicated 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.530
 Let's just write in the comments 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.730
 what you are doing steins samurai 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.400
 warriors row not necessarily one 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.350
 showcase example for almost 1 on more 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.390
 video games but it often full no matter it 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.720
 goes directly to the thing not much and 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.090
 here directly to the fun part 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.530
 that was always a bit ambiguous 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.110
 The thing is supposed to be in abundance 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.370
 samurai warriors 42 only go with the 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.720
 differed that this time the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.670
 Characters a little more in the spotlight 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.170
 are brought to 310 exciting 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.880
 the motivation of the 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.010
 protagonists are examined more closely 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.480
 but do not worry fans of the chaotic 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.170
 battles are still on their 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.239
 cost to come 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.820
 what the new video footage to samurai 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.560
 warriors 42 clearly proves 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.710
 appear in European fagots 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.940
 By the way, on the second of october for ps4 ps3
