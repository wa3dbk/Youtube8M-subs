 today we are with an embryo transfer program 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.170
 wanting to increase a little this handle had a lot of difficulties in getting 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.090
 genetic material but she 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 with this 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.970
 with this tool that we have 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 eva momentari we believe that it will be a great contribution 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.510
 for for the livestock of the contribution of shadows to continental make a

 It is a race that was selected for its rusticity 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.700
 percent 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 in the place where it is 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.749
 there you have three stern places rubén pop places or pastures places 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.709
 warm cold places will be a race that adapts very well to Paraguay 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.039
 our idea was to do things blessed all and reproducers ii

 offer to the external market 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.969
 this cabin we made acclimated with races zebuinas

 meter is razed 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.699
 what do we know what this 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:43.819
 hunter bring a lot of performance to each indictment with land we have 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.589
 checked that this is a 3 4% 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.869
 the aberrant and I lie May as another race for the type of crime 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.109
 from wever tineo those little ones 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.029
 percent creates intramuscular fat does not have superficial fat then the 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.279
 truly exquisite afternoon 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.969
 in Europe has made us destination country 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:07.650
 demanding is scorched is very dear the goal now it took three years the 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.939
 order not sao paulo market after year as first quality meat 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:12.979
 in nodes 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.429
 currently 30 years of work already with this reason 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:21.439
 this aspect only improving so that this Aztec race these characteristics 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.739
 what we were looking at yes the reality that 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.849
 percent ETA knows how in a continental mass 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:30.220
 percent 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.689
 the art the ono was facing front were large 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.369
 not only of us snack to explain it medium size 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:39.999
 according to our real environment 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:42.699
 and to be able to cross it with other races 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.419
 and that only a lively easy-to-use, easy-to-use tip is also improving 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.879
 a little the maternal line because 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.920
 At the beginning, we thought they had problems. 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:54.949
 mind that 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.289
 that you get materials with better 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.029
 maternal family 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:02.350
 between the characteristics of this race 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.009
 we found that males are very walkers 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:07.719
 while stores are very good mothers 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:11.469
 the breed has a high potential in terms of production of quality meat 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.599
 etc at any age kiki per animal 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.119
 the firmness of the body and of yours the little grease of coverages and the great 

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:22.979
 meat mantle produces some performance hooked very high
