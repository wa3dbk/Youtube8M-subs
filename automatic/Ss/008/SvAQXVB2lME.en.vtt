00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.440
 I live a renault sandouville it is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.420
 more than eight million vehicles 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 products since its origin 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.599
 This is the first time in Europe that has 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.430
 so many transformations in a factory 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.360
 to move from the particular vehicle to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.980
 commercial vehicles 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.539
 we really built 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.820
 facilities a process completely 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.119
 new at the top compared to what is happening 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.649
 do better at renault I think that 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.390
 as was valladolid up 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.710
 now for a start we 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 hope that sandouville will be a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.340
 benchmark 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 we have a montage with spaces 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.170
 completely airy work where we 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.690
 let's separate the part of choice from the pieces 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 of assembling parts when it's called 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.640
 the full keating and then these coins 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.559
 are taken in a wire-guided cart 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.719
 to the assembly station and the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.339
 the operator in the mounting parts and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.569
 assembles them on the car that allows 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.789
 to have much more spaces 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.359
 unobstructed and facilitate the lives of 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.269
 operators 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.920
 we also transformed 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.540
 skills train technicians 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.070
 many operators went in 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.930
 moving to other factories 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 group were able to discover the vehicle 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.070
 utility there is plenty of specificity 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 a very strong diversity in sheet metal with 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.670
 270 thesis a hundred tents in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 painting it happened first with 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.470
 relay trainers who gradually 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.280
 passed on their knowledge in 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.020
 training schools 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.110
 and then on string then there is a whole 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.330
 team that built the device 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.860
 team formation 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.610
 multidisciplinary with manufacturers 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.280
 quality logistics resources 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.980
 human and that leads to a device 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.960
 twenty-day training every 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.240
 employees who work on the line 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.680
 traffic have the same process of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.750
 training whether it's the trades of the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.880
 manufacturing 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.530
 the logistics the quality here we all 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.220
 the positions to build that one 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.570
 knows in chain 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.310
 it allows you to learn everything that is 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.600
 key points the quality gestures the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.020
 operators remain on their 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.430
 job 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.630
 they are taught directly the position of 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.590
 work is not the basic technique 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.690
 cdma chic 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.170
 I had the creed to handle that we are 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.490
 to be better trained to have more 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.289
 of autonomy that we will make the parts 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.480
 the goal is to introduce the new 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.980
 arriving their video post for that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.000
 the operator has a better approach 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.160
 of his post and that he is already 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.140
 visualize some key points of the position 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.239
 with the operator's explanation all 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.230
 is clear the procedure to follow 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.820
 for all and it's easier 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.770
 the important thing is to show them the good 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.920
 chief had to then realize it for 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.180
 to arrive at the perfect join the great 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.440
 chiefs and said it after three thousand 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.090
 times beats normally in the gesture 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.980
 before I was production agent too 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.690
 and knew nothing to do at the level of 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.410
 dexterity of what I say it was to me 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.910
 very useful 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.920
 it's a very important investment 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.810
 for the machined sandouville for renault 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.610
 but it is also a device that is 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.200
 totally indispensable to succeed in 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.489
 starting new traffic 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.660
 the prospects are quite 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.330
 reassuring since with a vehicle 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.410
 utility its 10 12 years of future that 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.830
 are guaranteed for the plant of 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.180
 Sandouville 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.180
 so it's quite exciting
