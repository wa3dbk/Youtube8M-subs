00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
could use something like this I could

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.800 
could use something like this I could
plug<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.340> underneath<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.820> sink<00:01:59.540> right

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
plug that in underneath the sink right

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.620 
plug that in underneath the sink right
and<00:02:00.229> then<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.159> end<00:02:01.460> here<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:01.940> would<00:02:02.180> cut<00:02:02.510> it

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
and then this end here I would cut it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.330 
and then this end here I would cut it
off<00:02:03.220> cut<00:02:04.220> this<00:02:04.369> off<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.299> have<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:05.659> strip<00:02:05.990> it

thing<00:02:14.600> about<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.680> one<00:02:16.460> thing<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.730> might<00:02:17.120> not

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
thing about that one thing you might not

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.830 
thing about that one thing you might not
know<00:02:17.890> if<00:02:18.890> you're<00:02:19.370> going<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.580> use<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.030> type

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.810 

now<00:02:23.840> if<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.050> use<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.350> type<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.950> when<00:02:25.700> you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
now if you use this type here when you

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.610 
now if you use this type here when you
cut<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.270> off<00:02:26.540> I'm<00:02:26.780> not<00:02:26.990> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> cut<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.410> off

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
cut this off I'm not going to cut it off

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.110 
cut this off I'm not going to cut it off
either<00:02:28.010> by<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.490> way<00:02:28.670> that's<00:02:28.940> why<00:02:29.060> I'm

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
either by the way that's why I'm

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.720 
either by the way that's why I'm
explaining<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.220> if<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> cut<00:02:31.580> this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
explaining this to you if you cut this

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.730 
explaining this to you if you cut this
off<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.180> strip<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.630> back<00:02:32.930> you're<00:02:33.320> not<00:02:33.500> going

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
off and strip this back you're not going

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.450 
off and strip this back you're not going
to<00:02:33.830> see<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.340> white<00:02:35.000> wire<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.810> green<00:02:36.620> wire<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
to see a white wire of green wire and a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.210 
to see a white wire of green wire and a
black<00:02:37.790> wire<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:39.230> know<00:02:39.350> kind<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:39.950> like<00:02:40.040> what

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
black wire you know kind of like what

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.380 
black wire you know kind of like what
you're<00:02:40.370> going<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.580> do<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.150> one<00:02:41.450> okay<00:02:42.410> so

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
you're going to do with this one okay so

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.270 
you're going to do with this one okay so
which<00:02:44.390> wire<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.170> white<00:02:45.380> wire<00:02:45.710> how<00:02:46.070> do<00:02:46.130> you

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
which wire is the white wire how do you

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.370 
which wire is the white wire how do you
know<00:02:46.460> which<00:02:46.700> wires<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:47.390> wire<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:48.080> got<00:02:48.230> any

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
know which wires like wire you got any

know which wires like wire you got any
ideas<00:02:48.770> I<00:02:49.180> showed<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.330> this<00:02:50.510> four<00:02:50.870> right<00:02:51.440> here

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
ideas I showed you this four right here

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.690 
ideas I showed you this four right here
could<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.510> tell<00:02:53.810> me<00:02:54.020> which<00:02:54.530> wire<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
could you tell me which wire is the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.020 
could you tell me which wire is the
white<00:02:55.910> wire<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:57.080> first<00:02:57.440> one<00:02:58.030> where's

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
white wire is it that first one where's

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.060 
white wire is it that first one where's
the<00:02:59.390> end<00:02:59.600> one<00:02:59.870> or<00:03:00.200> how<00:03:00.350> about<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.650> middle<00:03:00.920> one

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
the end one or how about the middle one

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.150 
the end one or how about the middle one
the<00:03:01.850> middle<00:03:01.880> one<00:03:02.180> my<00:03:02.630> guess<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.800> it's<00:03:04.040> a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
the middle one my guess and it's a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.640 
the middle one my guess and it's a
pretty<00:03:04.550> good<00:03:04.760> guess<00:03:05.030> here<00:03:05.410> that's<00:03:06.410> going<00:03:06.590> to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
pretty good guess here that's going to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.330 
pretty good guess here that's going to
be<00:03:06.709> your<00:03:06.890> ground<00:03:07.720> okay<00:03:08.720> well<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.770> can't<00:03:10.070> just

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
be your ground okay well you can't just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.540 
be your ground okay well you can't just
swipe<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.420> can't<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:11.900> cut<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.770> end<00:03:12.980> off<00:03:13.190> and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
swipe you can't just cut the end off and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.360 
swipe you can't just cut the end off and
then<00:03:14.540> hook<00:03:14.780> up<00:03:14.930> whatever<00:03:15.320> wire<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.130> black

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
then hook up whatever wire to the black

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.160 
then hook up whatever wire to the black
side<00:03:16.700> whatever<00:03:17.030> wire<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.720> white<00:03:17.900> side

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
side whatever wire to the white side

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.140 
side whatever wire to the white side
there's<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.100> definite<00:03:21.040> way<00:03:22.040> on<00:03:22.430> how<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.640> do<00:03:22.940> that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
there's a definite way on how to do that

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.940 
there's a definite way on how to do that
do<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.480> know<00:03:23.570> how<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.810> figure<00:03:24.080> that<00:03:24.230> out<00:03:24.290> I'm

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
do you know how to figure that out I'm

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.090 
do you know how to figure that out I'm
going<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.160> show<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:26.260> there's<00:03:27.260> two<00:03:27.620> ways<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:28.070> can

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
going to show you there's two ways I can

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
going to show you there's two ways I can
figure<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.580> out<00:03:28.640> with<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.120> core

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.570 

first<00:03:40.120> way<00:03:40.330> I<00:03:40.360> can<00:03:40.660> figure<00:03:40.840> out<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.319> cord<00:03:41.709> so

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
first way I can figure out this cord so

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.920 
first way I can figure out this cord so
I've<00:03:42.640> got<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.910> look<00:03:43.060> at<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.450> now<00:03:43.629> I<00:03:43.720> want<00:03:43.900> to

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
I've got to look at it now I want to

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.630 
I've got to look at it now I want to
make<00:03:44.080> an<00:03:44.860> educated<00:03:45.099> guess<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:47.800> ground<00:03:48.099> is<00:03:48.459> the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
make an educated guess the ground is the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.380 
make an educated guess the ground is the
middle<00:03:49.000> one<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:50.140> right<00:03:50.349> side<00:03:50.410> is<00:03:51.069> this

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
middle one the right side is this

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.080 
middle one the right side is this
right-side<00:03:52.390> wire<00:03:52.769> this<00:03:53.769> left<00:03:54.130> side<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.730> coming

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
right-side wire this left side is coming

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.250 
right-side wire this left side is coming
straight<00:03:55.209> down<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.739> left<00:03:56.980> side<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:58.450> I'm

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
straight down to the left side so I'm

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.680 
straight down to the left side so I'm
pretty<00:03:59.769> sure<00:03:59.890> that<00:04:00.190> how<00:04:00.580> they<00:04:00.730> cook<00:04:01.120> how<00:04:01.510> they

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
pretty sure that how they cook how they

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.140 
pretty sure that how they cook how they
put<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.260> up<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:03.430> when<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:03.700> look<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.030> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
put that up and when you look on the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.380 
put that up and when you look on the
left<00:04:04.360> side<00:04:04.709> if<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.950> can<00:04:06.099> see<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.430> or<00:04:06.489> not<00:04:06.580> this

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
left side if you can see it or not this

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.979 
left side if you can see it or not this
edge<00:04:07.900> here<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.769> longer<00:04:09.489> than<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:09.910> side<00:04:09.989> just

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
edge here is longer than this side just

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.449 
edge here is longer than this side just
like<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.230> plug<00:04:11.680> in<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.040> wall

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
like a plug in the wall

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.680 
like a plug in the wall
have<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.640> ever<00:04:12.790> seen<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.180> plug<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.630> the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
have you ever seen that a plug in the

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.930 
have you ever seen that a plug in the
wall<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:14.470> side<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.920> always<00:04:15.130> longer<00:04:15.700> than

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
wall this side is always longer than

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.620 
wall this side is always longer than
this<00:04:16.930> side<00:04:17.290> looks<00:04:18.280> your<00:04:18.489> plug<00:04:18.790> in<00:04:19.000> wall<00:04:19.269> and

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
this side looks your plug in wall and

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.110 
this side looks your plug in wall and
tell<00:04:20.049> me<00:04:20.200> if<00:04:20.260> that's<00:04:20.440> not<00:04:20.590> true<00:04:21.010> most<00:04:21.790> plugs

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
tell me if that's not true most plugs

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.629 
tell me if that's not true most plugs
are<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.950> okay

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
are like that okay

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
well this is the white neutral side over

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.240 
well this is the white neutral side over
here<00:04:29.610> this<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.970> hot<00:04:31.180> black<00:04:31.690> side<00:04:32.160> when<00:04:33.160> I

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
here this is the hot black side when I

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.020 
here this is the hot black side when I
cut<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:33.700> off<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.560> could<00:04:35.560> remember<00:04:36.419> that<00:04:37.919> okay

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
cut this off I could remember that okay

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.120 
cut this off I could remember that okay
and<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.150> can<00:04:40.330> mark<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:40.900> first<00:04:41.290> somehow<00:04:41.860> with

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
and I can mark that first somehow with

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.450 
and I can mark that first somehow with
that<00:04:42.310> black<00:04:43.300> piece<00:04:43.539> of<00:04:43.570> tape<00:04:44.020> or<00:04:44.350> put<00:04:44.560> put

that black piece of tape or put put

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.430 
that black piece of tape or put put
felt-tip<00:04:46.210> pan<00:04:46.479> over<00:04:46.720> here<00:04:46.900> knowing<00:04:47.320> okay

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
felt-tip pan over here knowing okay

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.770 
felt-tip pan over here knowing okay
that's<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.830> black<00:04:48.039> side<00:04:48.310> or<00:04:48.970> something<00:04:49.330> but

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
that's a black side or something but

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.340 
that's a black side or something but
what<00:04:49.900> happens<00:04:50.320> if<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.530> had<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:50.919> cut<00:04:51.250> off<00:04:52.200> if<00:04:53.200> I

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
what happens if I had that cut off if I

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.950 
what happens if I had that cut off if I
have<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.740> cut<00:04:54.010> off<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:55.479> look<00:04:55.660> at<00:04:55.810> this

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
have that cut off and I look at this

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.629 
have that cut off and I look at this
other<00:04:56.139> end<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.530> kind<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.800> figure<00:04:57.100> it<00:04:57.190> out<00:04:57.340> I

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
other end and kind of figure it out I

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.530 
other end and kind of figure it out I
might<00:04:58.419> be<00:04:58.660> able<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.840> figure<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.200> out

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
might be able to figure it out

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.020 
might be able to figure it out
that<00:04:59.630> way<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:01.760> same<00:05:02.000> way<00:05:02.140> okay<00:05:03.220> that's<00:05:04.220> that

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
that way the same way okay that's that

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.690 
that way the same way okay that's that
will<00:05:05.180> work<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.390> same<00:05:05.800> but<00:05:06.800> what<00:05:07.460> if<00:05:07.580> you

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
will work the same but what if you

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.020 
will work the same but what if you
forget<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.060> do<00:05:08.330> that<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:09.800> there<00:05:10.130> any<00:05:10.160> other<00:05:10.490> way

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
forget to do that is there any other way

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.330 
forget to do that is there any other way
I<00:05:11.060> cut<00:05:11.420> that<00:05:11.450> end<00:05:11.810> off<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:12.410> if<00:05:13.040> you<00:05:13.160> just

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
I cut that end off and if you just

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.890 
I cut that end off and if you just
looked<00:05:13.550> at<00:05:13.640> this<00:05:13.820> wire<00:05:14.030> right<00:05:14.270> here<00:05:14.330> would<00:05:14.750> you

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
looked at this wire right here would you

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.690 
looked at this wire right here would you
be<00:05:14.930> able<00:05:15.200> to<00:05:15.320> tell<00:05:15.530> which<00:05:16.250> is<00:05:16.280> which

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
be able to tell which is which

now<00:05:33.350> see<00:05:33.590> that<00:05:33.800> left<00:05:34.930> edge<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:36.320> that<00:05:36.470> cord<00:05:40.060> the

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
now see that left edge of that cord the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.910 
now see that left edge of that cord the
left<00:05:41.360> edge<00:05:41.600> of<00:05:41.780> that<00:05:41.900> cord<00:05:42.290> has<00:05:42.530> some<00:05:42.770> little

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
left edge of that cord has some little

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.100

you see little ribs like that on little

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.770 
you see little ribs like that on little
cords<00:05:56.000> like<00:05:56.390> say<00:05:56.600> for<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.900> lamp<00:05:57.260> or<00:05:58.600> things<00:05:59.600> of

cords like say for a lamp or things of

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.130 
cords like say for a lamp or things of
that<00:05:59.960> nature<00:06:00.020> that<00:06:00.650> side<00:06:01.520> is<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:02.270> neutral

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
that nature that side is the neutral

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.160 
that nature that side is the neutral
white<00:06:03.590> side<00:06:04.220> did<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:04.670> know<00:06:04.790> that<00:06:05.000> that's<00:06:05.870> how

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
white side did you know that that's how

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:12.460 
white side did you know that that's how
you<00:06:06.200> can<00:06:06.530> figure<00:06:06.770> that<00:06:06.980> out<00:06:10.930> so<00:06:11.930> let's<00:06:12.200> take<00:06:12.440> a

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
you can figure that out so let's take a

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.530 
you can figure that out so let's take a
quick<00:06:12.980> meander<00:06:13.610> here<00:06:14.050> and<00:06:15.820> I<00:06:16.820> wanted<00:06:17.420> to

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
quick meander here and I wanted to

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.490 
quick meander here and I wanted to
figure<00:06:17.780> out<00:06:17.870> where<00:06:18.320> that<00:06:18.500> is<00:06:18.560> okay<00:06:19.010> I<00:06:23.500> think

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
figure out where that is okay I think

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.320 
figure out where that is okay I think
that's<00:06:24.710> right<00:06:25.010> about<00:06:25.280> there<00:06:25.640> isn't<00:06:26.000> it

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
that's right about there isn't it

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:35.710 
that's right about there isn't it
let's<00:06:27.050> see<00:06:27.400> walking<00:06:28.400> back<00:06:28.700> okay<00:06:34.240> see<00:06:35.240> that<00:06:35.270> I

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
smooth okay neat how they figure that

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.780 
smooth okay neat how they figure that
out<00:06:59.380> they've<00:07:00.380> kind<00:07:00.680> of<00:07:00.770> done<00:07:00.980> that<00:07:01.250> just<00:07:01.610> in

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
out they've kind of done that just in

out they've kind of done that just in
case<00:07:02.030> you<00:07:02.240> don't<00:07:02.450> have<00:07:02.510> this<00:07:02.870> end<00:07:03.200> on<00:07:03.470> here<00:07:04.900> or

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
case you don't have this end on here or

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.930 
case you don't have this end on here or
you<00:07:06.320> hook<00:07:06.770> it<00:07:06.920> up<00:07:07.040> another<00:07:07.400> way<00:07:08.020> and<00:07:09.790> let's<00:07:10.790> say

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
you hook it up another way and let's say

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.100 
you hook it up another way and let's say
they're<00:07:11.090> just<00:07:11.270> using<00:07:11.510> this<00:07:11.570> core<00:07:11.870> doesn't

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
they're just using this core doesn't

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.720 
they're just using this core doesn't
that<00:07:12.290> ends<00:07:12.560> on<00:07:12.680> either<00:07:12.770> side<00:07:13.130> or<00:07:13.400> whatever

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
that ends on either side or whatever

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.590 
that ends on either side or whatever
then<00:07:14.480> you<00:07:14.720> can<00:07:14.900> always<00:07:15.970> remember<00:07:16.970> which<00:07:17.570> is

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600 
then you can always remember which is

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.390 
then you can always remember which is
which<00:07:17.810> and<00:07:18.350> how<00:07:18.560> you're<00:07:18.800> going<00:07:18.950> to<00:07:19.010> hook<00:07:19.160> that

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
which and how you're going to hook that

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.910 
which and how you're going to hook that
up<00:07:19.460> is<00:07:19.850> last<00:07:20.120> thing<00:07:20.240> you<00:07:20.360> want<00:07:20.600> to<00:07:20.690> do<00:07:20.840> is<00:07:21.680> hook

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:21.920 
up is last thing you want to do is hook

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.090 
up is last thing you want to do is hook
up<00:07:22.130> your<00:07:22.280> project<00:07:22.790> and<00:07:23.450> have<00:07:24.350> a<00:07:24.380> white<00:07:24.710> to<00:07:25.010> the

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100

black<00:07:25.370> the<00:07:25.730> black<00:07:25.940> to<00:07:26.180> the<00:07:26.210> white<00:07:26.480> that's<00:07:26.810> not

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
black the black to the white that's not

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.190 
black the black to the white that's not
going<00:07:27.320> to<00:07:27.380> be<00:07:27.530> a<00:07:27.560> good<00:07:27.800> bag<00:07:28.690> okay<00:07:29.690> hopefully

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200 
going to be a good bag okay hopefully

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.610

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.750
