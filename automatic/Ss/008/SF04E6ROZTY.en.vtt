towards<00:01:47.850> radiation<00:01:48.479> maintenance<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.520> needed<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
towards radiation maintenance I needed a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.130 
towards radiation maintenance I needed a
school<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.300> could<00:01:51.450> give<00:01:51.660> me<00:01:51.869> both

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
school that could give me both

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.620 
school that could give me both
theoretical<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.039> practical<00:01:53.310> training<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
theoretical and practical training you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.540 
theoretical and practical training you
get<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.959> see<00:01:55.170> exactly<00:01:55.709> what<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.009> talk<00:01:56.220> about

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
get to see exactly what you talk about

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.669 
get to see exactly what you talk about
in<00:01:56.910> class<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.539> you<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:58.020> lab<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
in class when you get to the lab and

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.559 
in class when you get to the lab and
during<00:01:59.369> those<00:01:59.520> labs<00:01:59.789> the<00:02:00.060> students<00:02:00.450> get

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
during those labs the students get

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.150 
during those labs the students get
hands-on<00:02:00.929> experience<00:02:01.619> working<00:02:01.800> with

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
hands-on experience working with

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.130 
hands-on experience working with
aircraft<00:02:02.520> systems<00:02:02.940> components<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:03.810> actually

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
aircraft systems components and actually

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.020 
aircraft systems components and actually
working<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.590> aircraft<00:02:04.740> themselves<00:02:05.130> during

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
working on aircraft themselves during

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.699 
working on aircraft themselves during
classroom<00:02:06.360> discussions<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.259> talk<00:02:07.440> about

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
classroom discussions I can talk about

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:09.230 
classroom discussions I can talk about
all<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> techniques<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.060> there's

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
all of the techniques but there's

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.340 
all of the techniques but there's
nothing<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.690> trying<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.050> bring<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
nothing like trying to bring the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.290 
nothing like trying to bring the
students<00:02:10.679> down<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.220> physically<00:02:11.880> give<00:02:12.120> them

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
students down and physically give them

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.120 
students down and physically give them
the<00:02:12.420> opportunity

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the opportunity

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.820

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
to perform these actions themselves the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.440 
to perform these actions themselves the

out<00:02:41.060> there<00:02:41.330> from<00:02:41.570> general<00:02:41.900> aviation<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.560> Air

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
out there from general aviation to Air

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.340 
out there from general aviation to Air
Transport<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:43.760> new<00:02:44.240> technology<00:02:44.840> changes<00:02:45.230> in

our<00:02:47.750> students<00:02:48.110> learn<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.530> not<00:02:48.680> just<00:02:48.890> blindly

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
our students learn to not just blindly

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.460 
our students learn to not just blindly
hook<00:02:50.000> up<00:02:50.180> wires<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.930> how<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.110> make<00:02:51.260> those

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470
