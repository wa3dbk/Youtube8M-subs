 positioned inside

 look for the padding is sewn there on the 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.740
 their perimeter with the red wire so

 not to let the stuffing out 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.820
 with the gold thread create a bow that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.380

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.450

 because they are the ones that most represent 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.580
 Christmas warm and elegant colors that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.160
 will contribute to instilling joy and 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.709
 heat in your homes making 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.709
 the atmosphere even more intimate
