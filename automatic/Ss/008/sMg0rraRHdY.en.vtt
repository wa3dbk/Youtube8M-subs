00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
an interesting game in terms of number

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.070 
an interesting game in terms of number
of<00:03:01.820> goals<00:03:02.060> because<00:03:02.360> there<00:03:02.480> wasn't<00:03:02.660> obviously

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
of goals because there wasn't obviously

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.720 
of goals because there wasn't obviously
that<00:03:03.290> many<00:03:03.440> shots<00:03:03.740> would<00:03:04.040> just<00:03:04.280> seem<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.550> one

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
that many shots would just seem like one

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.860 
that many shots would just seem like one
of<00:03:04.760> those<00:03:04.910> nights<00:03:05.240> where<00:03:05.480> there<00:03:05.600> were<00:03:05.690> some

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
of those nights where there were some

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.410 
of those nights where there were some
weird<00:03:06.110> bounces<00:03:06.830> maybe<00:03:07.520> some<00:03:07.850> weird<00:03:08.090> goals

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
weird bounces maybe some weird goals

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.820 
weird bounces maybe some weird goals
went<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:11.120> certainly<00:03:11.810> wasn't<00:03:12.080> as<00:03:12.320> loose<00:03:12.620> as

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
went in it certainly wasn't as loose as

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.820 
went in it certainly wasn't as loose as
the<00:03:13.010> score<00:03:13.280> indicated<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.240> thought<00:03:14.720> both<00:03:15.470> teams

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
the score indicated I thought both teams

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.740 
the score indicated I thought both teams
made<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.220> hard<00:03:16.400> on<00:03:16.520> each<00:03:16.580> other<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.150> yet<00:03:17.360> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
made it hard on each other but yet the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.660 
made it hard on each other but yet the
puck<00:03:17.960> phone<00:03:18.200> away<00:03:18.320> in<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.590> net<00:03:18.800> thankfully

puck phone away in the net thankfully
for<00:03:19.850> us<00:03:19.910> we<00:03:20.510> were<00:03:20.570> able<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.810> make<00:03:20.990> one<00:03:21.170> more

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
for us we were able to make one more
