00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.740
 very equal we are here in a new 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.820
 video 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 I've been pretty free and I've done nothing 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.610
 and the truth the first good yesterday exists 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 a video yesterday or the day before yesterday I do not know when 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.010
 I will post this has existed explaining that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.879
 out there and how good it looks 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.140
 there was a week before I left I bought myself 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.360
 this command and the truth is that I wanted 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.269
 make it possible because I do not see it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.240
 timely and because people like it 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.400
 the one box and no 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.490
 so it's bastard we're going to start 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.320
 with the unboxing wrong in this is a command 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.880
 logitech l 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.250
 710 of the gitex gaming series and 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.330
 truth what is not good is a command 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.030
 quite complete as we see here 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.760
 we have 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.860
 a classic control of distribution of 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.140
 the classic buttons and those always 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.920
 play with these controls and I miss this 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.360
 and we have the buttons and it's wireless 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.600
 as you see 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.440
 and the truth is very comfortable because here 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.440
 have 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.409
 how can I turn the light on for you 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.439
 see 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.090
 yes I know I do not know if you will appreciate it 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.079
 this camera very bad 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.649
 this is all made of forced rubber that makes 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.109
 that touch is better from the command and not 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.280
 be so plastic type for example with the 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.229
 command at 3 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.270
 it was all plastic and in the end when 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.510
 You were or 45 hours when the command 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.130
 you tire with this one has the 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:09.729
 function the idea that you do not get tired with 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.200
 the command change some buttons 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.750
 like mandela bay 3 1 2 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.710
 the euro of 2 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:26.590
 being the way is a little asleep 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.550
 and it's pretty good the truth has very 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.550
 double duration 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.700
 and it vibrates pretty well and before it goes with 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.319
 batteries 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.379
 the only downside of this command not 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.420
 incorporate a battery for the weight that has 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.910
 side that came that incorporates a 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.590
 battery but good more works a 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.040
 little bit that battery aspect 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.400
 in short and if then there is nothing friend this 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.250
 cable is not seen is to lengthen to 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.440
 connect this in case you do not get the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.440
 very silly thing signal 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.770
 they are falling 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.580
 balls 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.580
 I will go informing 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.210
 and always puts in this type of usb not 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.040
 it will be crap 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.310
 thank the Chinese colleagues and here 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.310
 you have 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.290
 this wants clearly says that no 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.799
 it happens but it's for shit is 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.140
 exposed to kaka and is if you do not understand 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.270
 beta a psychologist 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.270
 in theory this is removed 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.810
 father 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.700
 and we connect it to someone 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.360
 but you know 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.360
 ale 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.569
 King Ferdinand has cost us between what 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.159
 you will see between 50 and 60 euros 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.870
 it's pretty good for the price the truth 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.970
 paying laws although I thought that 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.130
 I would have a battery 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.250
 and that's all it 's a command does not have much 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.250
 mystery that has a lot of mystery 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.579
 and the truth is that I do not know I have not tried it 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.799
 I will not yet try them and vegetable starting 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.220
 of now it's worth with this and usually the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.930
 play3 no longer looks so bank playing and 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.880
 boss sarcasm and nothing that we 'll see 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.400
 the next video I'm a little stunned 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.270
 not today 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.160
 to see not at all we have to be 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.280
 imbeciles 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.710
 you can of these nine times in boxing and 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.569
 has never seen a boxing the truth a 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:53.240
 homme boxing there is something 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:57.699
 alex under bad that is an imbecile down 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.699
 but good fuck my mother 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.720
 goes fucking mother and if not the box the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.110
 they leave the box it was crap and for not 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.900
 be like three assholes 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.479
 what do they do 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.250
 Look, I do not know if you'll hear but this 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.020
 it's very long now I'm going to do that 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.020
 vibrate the fucking knob to see if it fits 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.560
 what the fuck 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.270
 and olano 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.949
 and it vibrates 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.400
 this would be this accountant maybe it 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.099
 move and I say here also these for 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.090
 connect the litres my understanding is 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.789
 this one because I want that is also 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.550
 compatible with leaders or not 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.279
 Hope so there has switch 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.770
 in the box not the series simply 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:56.169

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.810
 pussy teach a box you understand that 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.990
 has the manuals and this piece of 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.000
 manual I do not understand why balls 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.920
 give a mass so barbarous that I will not 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.630
 see why his command 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.420
 so I hope you liked it 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.300

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.380
 series that will be like a boxing of him 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.470
