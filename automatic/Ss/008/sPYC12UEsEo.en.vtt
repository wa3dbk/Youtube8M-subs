I have here are three different specific

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.439 
I have here are three different specific
tires<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.800> order<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:20.970> aka

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
tires and from in order this is an aka

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.320 
tires and from in order this is an aka
front<00:00:22.109> slick<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> new<00:00:23.490> proline<00:00:23.970> Prime

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
front slick this is a new proline Prime

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.640 
front slick this is a new proline Prime
which<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> slick<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> little

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
which is a slick but it's got a little

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.470 
which is a slick but it's got a little
bit<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> tread<00:00:26.160> pattern<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
bit of a tread pattern on it and then of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
bit of a tread pattern on it and then of
course<00:00:27.510> right<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> good

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
course right here we just have a good

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.009 
course right here we just have a good
old-fashioned<00:00:29.820> dirt<00:00:30.029> web<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.750> see

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
old-fashioned dirt web and you can see

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.389 
old-fashioned dirt web and you can see
it<00:00:31.170> started<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> burn<00:00:31.769> down<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.189> where<00:00:32.279> it's

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
it started to burn down to where it's

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.310 
it started to burn down to where it's
actually<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.880> some<00:00:33.120> slick<00:00:33.390> spots<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.200> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
actually got some slick spots on it and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.459 
actually got some slick spots on it and
so<00:00:35.059> so<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.450> reason<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:36.989> brought<00:00:37.320> out

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
so so the reason I actually brought out

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.630 
so so the reason I actually brought out
the<00:00:37.590> dirt<00:00:37.770> web<00:00:37.920> we'll<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.340> start<00:00:38.550> with

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the dirt web we'll just get start with

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.709 
the dirt web we'll just get start with
the<00:00:38.700> dirt<00:00:38.850> web<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> reason<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.450> brought<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the dirt web the reason I brought the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.840 
the dirt web the reason I brought the
dirt<00:00:39.899> web<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.860> because<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.760> have

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
dirt web out first because there have

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.150 
dirt web out first because there have
been<00:00:41.910> tractive<00:00:42.570> tried<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> outlaw<00:00:43.440> slicks<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
been tractive tried to outlaw slicks and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.540 
been tractive tried to outlaw slicks and
that's<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.090> slippery<00:00:45.660> slope

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
that's really a slippery slope

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.130 
that's really a slippery slope
whoo-hooo<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.910> say<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
whoo-hooo is to say or where do the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
whoo-hooo is to say or where do the
rules<00:00:49.440> there's<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> lot<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.430> gray<00:00:50.610> area<00:00:50.969> when

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
rules there's a lot of gray area when

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
rules there's a lot of gray area when
you're<00:00:51.210> trying<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> determine<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> pin

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you're trying to determine when a pin

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.740 
you're trying to determine when a pin
tire<00:00:53.190> becomes<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.670> slick<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> most

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
tire becomes a slick and for the most

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
tire becomes a slick and for the most
part<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.110> seems<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:56.610> companies

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
part it seems like what these companies

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.660 
part it seems like what these companies
or<00:00:57.600> tracks<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.050> said<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.500> hey<00:00:58.859> once<00:00:59.370> there's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
or tracks have said is hey once there's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.470 
or tracks have said is hey once there's
a<00:00:59.730> bald<00:01:00.120> spot<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.260> tire<00:01:01.609> it's<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.730> slick<00:01:03.000> now

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
a bald spot on the tire it's a slick now

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.149 
a bald spot on the tire it's a slick now
you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.470> particular<00:01:04.769> tire

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you can see that this particular tire

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.789 
you can see that this particular tire
didn't<00:01:05.820> wear<00:01:06.060> super<00:01:06.780> evenly<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.409> right<00:01:07.590> here

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
didn't wear super evenly like right here

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.890 
didn't wear super evenly like right here
in<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.189> Ridge<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.570> pretty

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
in this little Ridge it's it's pretty

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.140 
in this little Ridge it's it's pretty
much<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> slick<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.590> over<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.070> side

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
much a slick but over here on this side

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.630 
much a slick but over here on this side
not<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.180> much<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.490> technically<00:01:14.490> this

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
not so much right so technically this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
not so much right so technically this
tire<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.689> track<00:01:15.930> where<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.140> say<00:01:16.259> once<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
tire at a track where they say once you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.870 
tire at a track where they say once you
have<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> bald<00:01:16.890> spot<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.400> tire<00:01:17.610> would<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
have a bald spot this tire would be a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.440 
have a bald spot this tire would be a
slick<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.740> tires<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.340> arguably<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
slick now these tires are arguably you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.140 
slick now these tires are arguably you
know<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> say<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> proline<00:01:23.520> chide<00:01:23.790> putting<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
know I say the proline chide putting the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
know I say the proline chide putting the
tread<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.479> there<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> keep<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.290> technically

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
tread on there to keep it technically

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.679 
tread on there to keep it technically
legal<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.630> know

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
legal but I really I really don't know

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.440 
legal but I really I really don't know
what<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> reasoning<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:30.030> here's<00:01:30.240> some

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
what the reasoning was but here's some

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.700 
what the reasoning was but here's some
here's<00:01:30.720> some<00:01:30.930> things<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.350> talk<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.619> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
here's some things I want to talk to you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.999 
here's some things I want to talk to you
guys<00:01:31.799> about<00:01:32.329> there<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.509> some<00:01:33.869> benefits<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
guys about there are some benefits to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.780 
guys about there are some benefits to
driving<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.909> slicks<00:01:36.180> racing<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.720> slicks<00:01:37.020> and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
driving on slicks racing on slicks and

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.819 
driving on slicks racing on slicks and
number<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:38.970> there<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.380> run<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> slick

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
number one there if you can run a slick

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.080 
number one there if you can run a slick
if<00:01:40.950> there's<00:01:41.070> an<00:01:41.189> abstraction<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> slick<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
if there's an abstraction on a slick a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.120 
if there's an abstraction on a slick a
slick<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> almost<00:01:42.689> always<00:01:42.960> faster<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
slick is almost always faster and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.310 
slick is almost always faster and
usually<00:01:44.490> by<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> large<00:01:44.939> margin<00:01:45.210> compared<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
usually by a large margin compared to a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.710 
usually by a large margin compared to a
pin<00:01:46.649> tire<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.880> let<00:01:48.240> me<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.450> give<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
pin tire so let me just give you a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.780 
pin tire so let me just give you a
scenario<00:01:48.960> let's<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.560> say<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.280> at

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
scenario let's just say that you are at

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850 
scenario let's just say that you are at
a<00:01:50.820> big<00:01:50.970> race<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.840> track<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.229> always<00:01:52.320> damp<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
a big race the track is always damp in

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.039 
a big race the track is always damp in
the<00:01:52.920> morning<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:54.060> guy<00:01:54.210> goes<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.720> slicks

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the morning some guy goes out on slicks

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
the morning some guy goes out on slicks
and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.470> you're<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.280> let's<00:01:56.579> just

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and then you're not up for let's just

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.330 
and then you're not up for let's just
say<00:01:56.820> another<00:01:57.060> hour<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:58.009> if<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> track<00:01:59.310> is

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
say another hour and if the track is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
say another hour and if the track is
going<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.640> dry<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.630> guy<00:02:00.780> has<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> good

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
going to be dry if that guy has a good

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
going to be dry if that guy has a good
run<00:02:01.439> you're<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:01.920> catching<00:02:02.310> them<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.670> pins

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
run you're not catching them on pins

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.950 
run you're not catching them on pins
it's<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.570> simple

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it's just that simple

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.219 
it's just that simple
slick<00:02:04.469> scan<00:02:04.829> art<00:02:05.100> way<00:02:05.579> faster<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.750> they're

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
slick scan art way faster and so they're

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.650 
slick scan art way faster and so they're
really<00:02:07.259> suited<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.280> tracks<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.060> really

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
really suited to tracks that can really

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.780 
really suited to tracks that can really
control<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.770> racing<00:02:11.160> service<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
control the racing service or the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.410 
control the racing service or the
dampness<00:02:12.150> or<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> conditions<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> race

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
dampness or the conditions of the race

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.020 
dampness or the conditions of the race
surface<00:02:13.780> very<00:02:14.050> very<00:02:14.290> closely<00:02:14.530> or<00:02:14.770> very<00:02:14.920> very

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
surface very very closely or very very

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.220 
surface very very closely or very very
basically<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.120> needed<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.569> very<00:02:16.930> very

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
basically you needed a very very

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.140 
basically you needed a very very
consistent<00:02:17.590> track<00:02:17.950> surface<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:18.910> it's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
consistent track surface so that it's

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.330 
consistent track surface so that it's
fair<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.390> everybody

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
fair for everybody

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.120 
fair for everybody
now<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.840> other<00:02:23.020> benefit<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.560> slicks<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:23.920> some

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
now the other benefit of slicks and some

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.380 
now the other benefit of slicks and some
people<00:02:24.340> call<00:02:24.550> this<00:02:24.640> drawback<00:02:24.880> but<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.239> would

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
people call this drawback but I would

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.580 
people call this drawback but I would
call<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> benefit<00:02:26.050> is<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.410> really

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
call it a benefit is that it really

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.790 
call it a benefit is that it really
teaches<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:28.000> drive<00:02:28.330> very<00:02:28.900> smooth<00:02:29.560> and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
teaches you to drive very smooth and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.740 
teaches you to drive very smooth and
very<00:02:29.950> carefully<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.880> can't<00:02:31.180> have<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:31.600> these

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
very carefully you can't have like these

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.180 
very carefully you can't have like these
rough<00:02:32.020> inputs<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.680> throttle<00:02:33.100> and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
rough inputs on the throttle and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.280 
rough inputs on the throttle and
steering<00:02:33.250> because<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.090> card<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.900> surface

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
steering because the card the surface

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.160 
steering because the card the surface
just<00:02:35.410> won't<00:02:35.620> tolerate<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.480> forces

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
just won't tolerate it so it it forces

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.979 
just won't tolerate it so it it forces
you<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.530> become<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.890> smoother<00:02:39.580> driver<00:02:40.330> while

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
you to become a smoother driver while

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.180 
you to become a smoother driver while
racing<00:02:41.849> now<00:02:42.849> let's<00:02:43.060> talk<00:02:43.180> about<00:02:43.239> some<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.660> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
racing now let's talk about some of the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.170 
racing now let's talk about some of the
okay<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.310> guess<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.550> last<00:02:45.670> benefit<00:02:46.060> so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
okay and I guess the last benefit so

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.610 
okay and I guess the last benefit so
those<00:02:46.330> are<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.930> obviously<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.410> first

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
those are the so obviously the first

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.170 
those are the so obviously the first
benefit<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.010> they're<00:02:48.400> super<00:02:48.550> fast

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
benefit is they're super fast

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.699 
benefit is they're super fast
they<00:02:49.360> teach<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.750> be<00:02:49.989> super<00:02:50.170> smooth<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
they teach you to be super smooth on the

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.979 
they teach you to be super smooth on the
wheel<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.130> last<00:02:51.670> but<00:02:51.850> not<00:02:51.970> least<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.810> don't

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
wheel and last but not least you don't

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.500 
wheel and last but not least you don't
burn<00:02:53.260> through<00:02:53.500> pins<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.069> in<00:02:54.280> theory<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.090> don't

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
burn through pins so in theory you don't

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.330 
burn through pins so in theory you don't
have<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.900> replace<00:02:56.170> your<00:02:56.350> tires<00:02:56.590> as<00:02:56.950> often

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
have to replace your tires as often

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.979 
have to replace your tires as often
although<00:02:57.580> that's<00:02:58.299> not<00:02:58.480> always<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.840> case

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
although that's not always the case

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.520 
although that's not always the case
we'll<00:02:59.650> get<00:02:59.769> into<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.100> little<00:03:00.250> bit<00:03:00.340> later

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
we'll get into that a little bit later

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.840 
we'll get into that a little bit later
now<00:03:02.530> let<00:03:02.769> me<00:03:02.830> make<00:03:03.010> my<00:03:03.160> case<00:03:03.190> against<00:03:04.090> slicks

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
now let me make my case against slicks

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.490 
now let me make my case against slicks
number<00:03:06.850> one<00:03:07.120> you're<00:03:07.810> going<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:07.989> break<00:03:08.230> more

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
number one you're going to break more

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.590 
number one you're going to break more
stuff<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.250> car<00:03:09.880> if<00:03:10.180> there's<00:03:10.330> enough

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
stuff if the car if there's enough

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.110 
stuff if the car if there's enough
traction<00:03:10.989> for<00:03:11.739> slick<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.310> work<00:03:12.489> if<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.910> car

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
traction for slick to work if the car

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.580 
traction for slick to work if the car
lands<00:03:13.420> sideways<00:03:13.810> you're<00:03:14.170> going<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.380> break

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
lands sideways you're going to break

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.590 
lands sideways you're going to break
more<00:03:14.799> stuff<00:03:14.830> if<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.730> land<00:03:15.970> sideways<00:03:16.390> or

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
more stuff if you land sideways or

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.270 
more stuff if you land sideways or
you're<00:03:16.750> off-center<00:03:17.560> at<00:03:17.650> all<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.950> car<00:03:18.130> will

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
you're off-center at all the car will

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.710 
you're off-center at all the car will
land<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.640> then<00:03:18.760> flip<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.299> just<00:03:19.420> do<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> lot<00:03:19.690> of

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720

weird stuff the setup becomes supremely

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.160 
weird stuff the setup becomes supremely
important<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.510> track<00:03:25.900> conditions

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
important and the track conditions

become supremely important because it's

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.810 
become supremely important because it's
it<00:03:29.109> almost<00:03:29.410> takes<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.859> car<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.280> like<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.459> level

it almost takes the car to like a level

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.819 
it almost takes the car to like a level

trying to drive a clean run is wasted

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.960 
trying to drive a clean run is wasted
the<00:03:58.390> first<00:03:58.569> time<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.959> crash<00:03:59.549> the<00:04:00.549> other<00:04:00.700> thing

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
the first time you crash the other thing

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.110 
the first time you crash the other thing
is<00:04:01.150> these<00:04:01.840> tires<00:04:02.140> tend<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.829> rip<00:04:03.340> away<00:04:03.790> from<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
is these tires tend to rip away from the

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.180 
is these tires tend to rip away from the
wheel<00:04:04.269> now<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.810> actually<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.200> brand<00:04:05.620> this

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
wheel now this is actually a brand this

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.949 
wheel now this is actually a brand this
is<00:04:06.370> actually<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.060> tire<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.450> ran<00:04:07.720> at<00:04:07.870> the

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
is actually a the tire that I ran at the

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.559 
is actually a the tire that I ran at the
2015<00:04:08.350> cactus<00:04:08.799> classic<00:04:09.190> and<00:04:09.340> it's<00:04:10.090> on<00:04:10.239> an<00:04:10.359> old

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
2015 cactus classic and it's on an old

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.930 
2015 cactus classic and it's on an old
style<00:04:10.840> bead<00:04:11.170> which<00:04:11.440> doesn't<00:04:11.859> tend<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.549> rip<00:04:12.760> as

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
style bead which doesn't tend to rip as

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.580 
style bead which doesn't tend to rip as
bad<00:04:13.209> as<00:04:13.420> some<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.690> others<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.049> you<00:04:14.109> can

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
bad as some of the others and you can

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.500 
bad as some of the others and you can
still<00:04:14.799> see<00:04:14.829> that<00:04:15.160> it's<00:04:15.220> it's<00:04:16.030> basically

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
still see that it's it's basically

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.240 
still see that it's it's basically
ripped<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.260> rubber<00:04:17.470> rips<00:04:17.739> away<00:04:17.979> because<00:04:18.220> of

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
ripped the rubber rips away because of

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.159 
ripped the rubber rips away because of
how<00:04:18.489> much<00:04:18.669> traction<00:04:19.030> we<00:04:19.329> end<00:04:19.479> up<00:04:19.600> having<00:04:19.780> and

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
how much traction we end up having and

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.029 
how much traction we end up having and
so<00:04:20.799> that's<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.760> little<00:04:22.150> bit<00:04:22.330> of<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.450> downside<00:04:23.039> now

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
so that's a little bit of a downside now

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.920 
so that's a little bit of a downside now
the<00:04:24.099> thing<00:04:24.400> is<00:04:24.430> people<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.330> say<00:04:25.510> hey<00:04:25.750> look

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
the thing is people that say hey look

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.760 
the thing is people that say hey look
pins

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
pins

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.170 
pins
they<00:04:26.919> don't<00:04:27.129> you<00:04:27.460> know<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.610> don't<00:04:27.819> wear<00:04:28.030> out

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
they don't you know you don't wear out

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.950 
they don't you know you don't wear out
slicks<00:04:28.599> like<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:28.840> do<00:04:28.960> pin<00:04:29.169> tires<00:04:29.379> there<00:04:30.340> right

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
slicks like you do pin tires there right

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.050 
slicks like you do pin tires there right
but<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.110> do<00:04:32.319> wear<00:04:32.530> out<00:04:32.560> foams<00:04:33.009> and<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.610> lot

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
but you do wear out foams and so a lot

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.020 
but you do wear out foams and so a lot
of<00:04:34.090> times<00:04:34.440> you'll<00:04:35.440> end<00:04:35.650> up<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:36.520> tire<00:04:36.729> will<00:04:36.909> be

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
of times you'll end up the tire will be

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.610 
of times you'll end up the tire will be
good<00:04:37.210> but<00:04:37.569> you'll<00:04:37.720> end<00:04:37.780> up<00:04:37.900> having<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.289> slice

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
good but you'll end up having to slice

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.230 
good but you'll end up having to slice
out<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.009> insert<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.490> then<00:04:39.610> reglue<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.060> tire

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
out the insert and then reglue the tire

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.020 
out the insert and then reglue the tire
back<00:04:40.449> together<00:04:40.629> and<00:04:41.020> for<00:04:41.830> newer<00:04:42.310> drivers<00:04:42.819> or

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.960 
well just buy new slicks with new
inserts<00:04:51.789> in<00:04:51.970> them<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:52.919> in<00:04:53.919> general<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.729> really

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
inserts in them so in general I really

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.710 
inserts in them so in general I really
feel<00:04:55.330> like<00:04:55.360> slicks<00:04:57.090> while<00:04:58.090> they<00:04:58.240> may<00:04:58.479> teach

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
feel like slicks while they may teach

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.180 
feel like slicks while they may teach
you<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.990> drive<00:04:59.199> really<00:04:59.500> smooth<00:04:59.830> what<00:05:00.069> they

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
you to drive really smooth what they

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.950 
you to drive really smooth what they
don't<00:05:00.430> teach<00:05:00.669> you<00:05:00.819> to<00:05:00.909> do<00:05:01.000> is<00:05:01.150> counter<00:05:01.630> steer

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
don't teach you to do is counter steer

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.460 
don't teach you to do is counter steer
and<00:05:02.199> they<00:05:02.770> don't<00:05:03.009> you<00:05:03.940> never<00:05:04.210> learn<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:04.990> slide

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
and they don't you never learn to slide

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.999 
and they don't you never learn to slide
the<00:05:05.710> car<00:05:05.919> so<00:05:06.220> I<00:05:06.490> think<00:05:06.909> that<00:05:07.330> growing<00:05:07.750> up<00:05:08.050> if

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
the car so I think that growing up if

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.740 
the car so I think that growing up if
you<00:05:09.159> were<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.340> grow<00:05:09.520> up<00:05:09.610> racing<00:05:10.180> on<00:05:10.300> slicks<00:05:10.569> it

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
you were to grow up racing on slicks it

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.450 
you were to grow up racing on slicks it
will<00:05:10.930> make<00:05:11.050> you<00:05:11.169> a<00:05:11.199> smoother<00:05:11.530> driver<00:05:11.800> but<00:05:12.430> I

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
will make you a smoother driver but I

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.040 
will make you a smoother driver but I
don't<00:05:12.699> know<00:05:12.819> that<00:05:13.000> it'll<00:05:13.180> teach<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.930> the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
don't know that it'll teach you the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.589 
don't know that it'll teach you the
skills<00:05:14.169> to<00:05:14.560> slide<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.979> car<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.599> counter

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
skills to slide the car and counter

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.270 
skills to slide the car and counter
steer<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:16.930> stuff<00:05:17.080> like<00:05:17.199> that<00:05:17.380> so<00:05:17.409> arse<00:05:18.039> looks

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
steer and stuff like that so arse looks

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.339 
steer and stuff like that so arse looks
good<00:05:18.430> for<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.639> industry<00:05:18.819> in<00:05:19.120> my<00:05:19.630> opinion<00:05:20.139> I

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
good for the industry in my opinion I

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.379 
good for the industry in my opinion I
would<00:05:20.409> say<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:21.009> I<00:05:21.280> I<00:05:21.340> don't<00:05:21.789> think<00:05:22.030> slicks

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
would say that I I don't think slicks

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.540 
would say that I I don't think slicks
are<00:05:22.539> the<00:05:22.599> answer<00:05:23.039> but<00:05:24.039> I<00:05:24.069> don't<00:05:24.280> think<00:05:24.430> they're

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
are the answer but I don't think they're

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.379 
are the answer but I don't think they're
going<00:05:24.669> anywhere<00:05:24.789> I<00:05:25.000> think<00:05:25.120> they're<00:05:25.210> gonna<00:05:25.300> be

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
going anywhere I think they're gonna be

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:26.399 
going anywhere I think they're gonna be
here<00:05:25.539> to<00:05:25.629> stay<00:05:25.780> so<00:05:25.840> I<00:05:25.960> don't<00:05:26.110> think<00:05:26.229> it<00:05:26.289> really

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
here to stay so I don't think it really

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.309 
here to stay so I don't think it really
matters<00:05:26.590> how<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.340> feel<00:05:27.699> about<00:05:27.940> it<00:05:28.000> in<00:05:28.690> general<00:05:29.110> I

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
matters how I feel about it in general I

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.219 
matters how I feel about it in general I
feel<00:05:29.469> like<00:05:29.590> off-road<00:05:30.159> racing<00:05:30.639> means<00:05:31.569> not<00:05:32.020> on

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
feel like off-road racing means not on

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.580 
feel like off-road racing means not on
pavement<00:05:32.740> so<00:05:33.069> it<00:05:33.550> shouldn't<00:05:34.000> be<00:05:34.590> flawlessly

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
pavement so it shouldn't be flawlessly

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.270 
pavement so it shouldn't be flawlessly
super<00:05:36.280> gooey<00:05:36.639> sticky<00:05:37.120> mega<00:05:37.930> traction<00:05:38.469> I<00:05:38.620> think

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
super gooey sticky mega traction I think

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.790 
super gooey sticky mega traction I think
that's<00:05:39.490> something<00:05:39.729> that<00:05:39.880> has<00:05:40.120> a<00:05:40.419> pin<00:05:41.319> on<00:05:41.349> it<00:05:41.530> I

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
that's something that has a pin on it I

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.469 
that's something that has a pin on it I
think<00:05:42.219> that<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.520> surface<00:05:42.759> where<00:05:43.090> everybody's

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
think that a surface where everybody's

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.059 
think that a surface where everybody's
going<00:05:43.690> as<00:05:43.779> fast<00:05:43.960> as<00:05:44.110> they<00:05:44.229> can<00:05:44.319> go<00:05:44.469> on<00:05:44.590> pins<00:05:44.830> is

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
going as fast as they can go on pins is

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:46.740 
going as fast as they can go on pins is
the<00:05:45.219> type<00:05:45.400> of<00:05:45.430> surface<00:05:45.669> that<00:05:45.969> I<00:05:46.060> personally

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
the type of surface that I personally

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.050 
the type of surface that I personally
prefer<00:05:47.169> to<00:05:47.199> run<00:05:47.409> on<00:05:47.560> so<00:05:47.800> anyways<00:05:48.610> that's<00:05:48.969> my
