nasty this is the Mud Island mega route
this<00:00:24.180> would<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.230> fun<00:00:25.320> obstacle<00:00:26.160> for

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
this would be a really fun obstacle for

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.630 
this would be a really fun obstacle for
an<00:00:26.699> RC<00:00:27.119> crawler<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.900> has<00:00:28.529> closed<00:00:29.039> front<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
an RC crawler that has closed front and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.339 
an RC crawler that has closed front and
rear<00:00:29.789> discs<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.300> solid<00:00:30.599> axles<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.230> this

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
rear discs will solid axles but for this

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.049 
rear discs will solid axles but for this
piece<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.590> shit<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.160> open<00:00:32.460> differentials<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
piece of shit with open differentials a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.030 
piece of shit with open differentials a
fully<00:00:33.270> independent<00:00:33.540> suspension<00:00:33.840> I've<00:00:34.680> seen

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
fully independent suspension I've seen

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040 
fully independent suspension I've seen
servos<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.149> cost<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.630> than<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.870> entire

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
servos that cost more than this entire

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.319 
servos that cost more than this entire
truck<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.219> thing<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.610> bounces<00:00:39.180> all

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
truck so this thing just bounces all

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:59.980 
truck so this thing just bounces all
over<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> piece<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> crap

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.630 

alright<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.170> Mud<00:01:01.380> Island<00:01:01.590> mega<00:01:02.010> route<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.610> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
alright the Mud Island mega route was a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.080 
alright the Mud Island mega route was a
fail<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:04.050> not<00:01:04.290> hard<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:05.160> spot<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.490> jump

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
fail but it's not hard to spot a jump

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
fail but it's not hard to spot a jump
you<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> hill<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:07.500> look<00:01:07.680> for

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you look for a hill and you look for

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.140 
you look for a hill and you look for
something<00:01:08.010> jutting<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> side<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.060> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
something jutting out the side of it you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
something jutting out the side of it you
can<00:01:09.270> drive<00:01:09.450> off<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.870> this<00:01:10.440> has<00:01:10.710> been<00:01:11.010> dubbed

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
can drive off of this has been dubbed

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
can drive off of this has been dubbed
the<00:01:11.730> Mud<00:01:12.240> Island<00:01:12.270> mega<00:01:12.870> jump<00:01:13.230> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.590> see

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the Mud Island mega jump you can see

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.140 
the Mud Island mega jump you can see
it's<00:01:13.890> basically<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.670> little<00:01:14.820> cliff

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it's basically just a little cliff

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
it's basically just a little cliff
jutting<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.870> hill<00:01:16.050> but<00:01:16.410> like<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.680> said

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
jutting out of the hill but like I said

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.680 
jutting out of the hill but like I said
the<00:01:17.070> servo<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.670> thing<00:01:17.880> freakin<00:01:18.330> sucks

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
the servo and this thing freakin sucks

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.540 
the servo and this thing freakin sucks
so<00:01:18.990> hitting<00:01:19.200> anything<00:01:19.680> less<00:01:20.010> than<00:01:20.160> 8<00:01:20.340> feet

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
so hitting anything less than 8 feet

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.940 
so hitting anything less than 8 feet
wide<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:21.060> actually<00:01:21.450> extremely<00:01:21.720> difficult<00:01:22.080> but

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
wide is actually extremely difficult but

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
wide is actually extremely difficult but
at<00:01:23.100> least<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.610> eight<00:01:23.760> feet<00:01:23.940> wide<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
at least this is eight feet wide so it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:35.109 
at least this is eight feet wide so it
wasn't<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.140> hard

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.270 

alright<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> only<00:01:37.440> shit<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.979> truck

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
alright this is the only shit this truck

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.620 
alright this is the only shit this truck
is<00:01:38.430> good<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.850> driving<00:01:39.240> through<00:01:39.330> leaves

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
is good for driving through leaves

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.890 
is good for driving through leaves
puddles<00:01:40.320> down<00:01:41.070> ditches<00:01:41.520> anything<00:01:42.180> downhill

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
puddles down ditches anything downhill

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.100 
puddles down ditches anything downhill
or<00:01:43.260> mud<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.130> uphill<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:45.180> through<00:01:45.390> grass<00:01:45.660> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
or mud but uphill or through grass it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.469 
or mud but uphill or through grass it
freakin<00:01:46.650> it's<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.729> real<00:01:47.970> good<00:01:48.150> for<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
freakin it's not real good for that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
stuff it's a downhill racer a jumper a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.290 
stuff it's a downhill racer a jumper a
roller<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.119> going

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
roller and that's it but it's not going

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.840 
roller and that's it but it's not going
to<00:01:54.360> suck<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.660> long<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.710> gonna<00:01:56.039> put<00:01:56.340> an

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to suck for long I'm gonna put an

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.160 
to suck for long I'm gonna put an
integrity<00:01:58.610> 25<00:01:59.610> turn<00:01:59.910> motor<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
integrity 25 turn motor in it and a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.070 
integrity 25 turn motor in it and a
brand<00:02:01.440> new<00:02:01.590> servo<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.880> lipo<00:02:03.360> battery

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
brand new servo and a lipo battery

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.779 
brand new servo and a lipo battery
hopefully<00:02:04.800> it'll<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> top<00:02:05.399> speed<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
hopefully it'll have a top speed of

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.340 
hopefully it'll have a top speed of
about<00:02:06.380> 45<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.649> 50<00:02:07.800> miles<00:02:08.160> an<00:02:08.340> hour<00:02:09.080> it'll<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.320> a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
about 45 to 50 miles an hour it'll be a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.380 
about 45 to 50 miles an hour it'll be a
little<00:02:10.560> bit<00:02:10.770> cooler<00:02:11.070> then<00:02:11.460> and<00:02:11.820> I'll<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.150> doing

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
little bit cooler then and I'll be doing

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.309 
little bit cooler then and I'll be doing
this<00:02:12.570> kind<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.530> stuff<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:14.160> lot<00:02:14.730> faster<00:02:15.660> cuz<00:02:16.200> this

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
this kind of stuff a lot faster cuz this

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.900 
this kind of stuff a lot faster cuz this
is<00:02:16.500> actually<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:16.980> moving<00:02:17.370> at<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.490> few<00:02:17.700> miles

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
is actually just moving at a few miles

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.270 
is actually just moving at a few miles
an<00:02:18.090> hour<00:02:18.240> but<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.840> can't<00:02:19.530> tell<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.950> looks<00:02:20.069> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
an hour but you can't tell it looks so
