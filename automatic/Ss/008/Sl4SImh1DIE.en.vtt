00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Introducing the Stiltz home lift

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.310
Choosing a home lift that's right for you
and your home is an important decision.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.230
The Stiltz Homelift is the most
versatile, stylish and cost-effective

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.820
solution available in the market.
Here's why.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.480
Place it almost anywhere

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.130
Our great-looking lifts take up little
room and a unique rail design means they

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.000
don't require a supporting wall.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.560
Tuck it in a corner, put it in a cupboard,

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.360
place it in a stairwell void or send it up to
a mezzanine or landing.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.240
No other product gives you the same freedom and flexibility.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.520
They're quiet

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.660
Our unique drive system is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.890
quieter than many stairlifts and
there's no noisy hydraulics or vacuum

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100
systems to worry about.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.520
It's an extra pair of hands

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.280
Standard remote controls allow you to
use your Stiltz Lift to move items such

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.020
as laundry, vacuum cleaners, boxes, or
anything else you need an extra pair of hands with.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.320
Safety as standard

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460
Stiltz Lifts include all the
safety and convenience features you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.860
would expect, including a battery backup
to lower the lift in a power cut,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.610
full or half height doors, obstruction sensors, a key lock to stop unauthorised use,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.680
an optional seat and grab bar.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.400
Cost &amp; value

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.820
Undertaking renovations or building
additions to your home can be costly,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.480
disruptive and stressful.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.940
And moving out of the home you love can be equally as expensive and emotionally draining.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.780
Instead choose a Stiltz Homelift.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.880
Far more versatile and fun than a stairlift,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.300
they'll add significant convenience to
your lifestyle with minimal running costs.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.240
Why build or move when there's no
need to.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.680
Enjoy the style and luxury of a Stiltz Homelift.
