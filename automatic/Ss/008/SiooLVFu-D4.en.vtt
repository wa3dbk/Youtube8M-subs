00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 expensive loss of points or is this something you do 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.470
 go time have to incorporate here 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.570
 sometime well i know we're at the end 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 of the ride that becomes what ultimately 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.469
 determined about duration and what is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 we think that I have good 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.800
 reacted when in the first half 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.119
 from psv 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.220
 yes then you actually eh actually 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.480
 must finish your teeth and then yes then 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.480
 it was also largely over 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.010
 finally and then you come to rest and see 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.400
 see you again one 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.740
 is other vitesse well that is there 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.059
 to make more that the prime us 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.430
 I think 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.280
 in terms of opportunity ratio compared to the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 first pick up what less is one 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.030
 yes then you go with you then you make with 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.770
 damage levels go if you are on the go 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 you go to you go nose 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.860
 we do things based on a will 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.860
 my boss of the second just had 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.050
 tank if you look there is one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.000
 possible differences between both the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 you need half the first half 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.090
 ultimately just the options that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.379
 you will be entertained to one 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 inside with a well the largest 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.320
 in my opinion yes very seriously really sick 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 german I of yes that are just the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.900
 matches where that they score 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.390
 make a difference 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.979
 what exactly happened to an ex who 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.750
 ball that comes and I hit your blow 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.520
 that ball just will not if you do not your pocket 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.590
 the net at the last minute because you 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.380
 know just such a moment everyone jumps 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 impresses in the bodhi states that one 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.229
 I have to head straight ahead I want 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 him in on whatever a knife a stupid 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.450
 get a shoulder 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 yes that happens of course but for me 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.299
 do with that ball just the net you you 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.890
 is in the second half 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.130
 nordin amrabat who is already in rush 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.720
 play is also going to happen for 1 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.000
 February 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.560
 yes the question is of course my last 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.049
 asked a lot and there 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.189
 yes I always say if they are on the market 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.960
 is is what 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.460
 what we can pay because the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.799
 name 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.140
 yes we will make the case that bag and then we 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.350
 are that scanning and we still have 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.729
 a day and yes look at the possibilities 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.560
 are unlimited 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.090
 yes and then that is yes then I need you 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.340
 not difficult to do because it knows 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.869
 I name this club is just that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 knew it would be a shame if it did 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.739
 if it fails then if it succeeds and then it would 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.600
 it a beautiful one 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.220
 you have a nice job on our toilet from the other side 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.569
 for example with nordin amrabat 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.220
 social have previously indicated one 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.230
 alternative to play there well me 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.819
 Thank think certainly when the striker 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.799
 can play war can be excellent in one 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.510
 then play between options 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.780
 we have 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.760
 so only because of that one falls away and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 then that is yes that was very unfortunate 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.940
 but well then you don't always have to 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.920
 look back 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.780
 and so you go with a hangover feeling 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.489
 hangover feeling away here 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.769
 I want you to feel like one like one 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.329
 defeat sure is fun right 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.530
 it feels like a defeat for me 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.120
 this moment 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.380
 the other hand it would be a word 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.090
 wanting it with the door is therefore 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.410
 we have to go through that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.959
 yes that position perhaps for 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.030
 euro yes that is also natural and that 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.709
 you don't dwell on it for too long but 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.959
 it's not annoying that you just do this 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.819
 all in all here you know that 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.590
 it a vitesse from a difficult 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.900
 difficult match is one 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.640
 yes boss of these samples from jan 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.830
 little man you don't score goals but 1 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.200
 conclusion damage but no panic 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.950
 no that not at all then you would 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.489
 then so you say if you can 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.670
 speak when I should worry me 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.930
 then this game is totally different and 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.930
 I didn't think it was today
