00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.970
 surely it will have happened to them as a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.440
 moment when they did not know them 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.340
 when we hear about motorcycles 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:17.730
 electrical we think about the engine 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:21.990
 electric coals coil 2 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.230
 gas balloon ships that wear the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.449
 dominated 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.490
 a whole panorama of complications that 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.130
 they do not really exist 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.170
 now let's explain a little bit how 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.720
 is the operation of these lucky lion 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.410
 electrical but that are really are 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.460
 a wonder they are the ideal solution 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.950
 for working people 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.560
 let's apply it on the first one a 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.040
 little outside 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.780
 as they see a very complete board has 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.329
 speedometer 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.380
 has a voltmeter that tells us the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.410
 Battery status permanently 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.120
 It is equipped with all the lights that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.750
 you have to have a motorbike to drive 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.510
 in the regulatory street you turn everything 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.510
 before low 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.100
 is for example owns 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.100
 a glove compartment here as you see 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.220
 here under the seat 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.080
 a pretty big bowling 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.560
 with a thermal key for protection 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.350
 which is normally used to cut the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.810
 that the batteries are charged has no other 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.770
 function 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.210
 also has 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.680
 in the back 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.790
 a very large trunk here we can take 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.790
 absolutely everything 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.280
 because in addition to the companion 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.280
 those unrepeatable pedals 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.920
 all come equipped with anti-theft 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.560
 with another remote child with two controls 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.790
 in this case not but there are some come 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.520
 with audio equipment come with 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.250
 mp3 player 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.320
 and we are going to explain what is the secret of 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.320
 the reliability of these bikes 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.920
 here is the compartment of the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.000
 batteries 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.110
 it has five batteries because it is 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.650
 450 watts 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.200
 as well as the bikes the difference we're going 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.290
 per displacement here are differentiated by 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.230
 watts in this case 450 watts are 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.210
 those of 350 watts model a little more 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 very cute boy also 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.550
 that has four bacteria 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.810
 all come 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.310
 provided with a corresponding charger 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.819
 in this case it is here in the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.819
 compartment 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.640
 the charger a set of pedals 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.670
 because it will never be necessary but in 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.069
 case of ice outside 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.840
 and the pedals are placed here 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.630
 and he can wait as if he were a 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.460
 bicycle is very very light 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.590
 in case we stayed without 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.660
 battery thing that is quite difficult 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.340
 we can put the pedals and follow 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.860
 pedaling like a bicycle 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.390
 so we're not going anywhere 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.330
 we also want to exercise 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.370
 for the moment we pedal for the moment 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.110
 we let the bike take us in a way 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.790
 soft silent 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.340
 it has an autonomy of approximately 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.550
 80 km depends on the weight of the person 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.790
 You can also go with a companion 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.129
 perfectly carries two people 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.050
 and here's the secret here there's no 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.030
 problems d 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.540
 transmission 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.300
 gears and carbons and bushings 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.830
 maintenance is zero does not have 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.360
 maintenance is not necessary 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.060
 the engine is this the rear wheel inside 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.220
 of the rear wheel is the engine 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.820
 follow the current power supply 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.590
 continuous that batteries provide in 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.680
 reality of this engine is a motor of 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.000
 AC does not need coals 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.460
 takes us to carbon takes us to busquets 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.220
 the motor is formed by an extractor 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.190
 that goes in the fixed central part 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.770
 and around are the magnets that go 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.389
 attached to the rim 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.690
 so here in the problem of 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.480
 coals and bushings is mounted on 2 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.760
 roman online 2 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.850
 so the zero maintenance engine 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.440
 as we said has a converter that 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.230
 converts the direct current of the 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.710
 battery in coordinate high triple without 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.710
 sensors 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:07.550
 that command the variable speed drive 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:11.540
 to give a smooth precise variation 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.460
 As you can see, it has some motorcycles 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.480
 as articulators with spirals 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.370
 forward to have telescopic suspension 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.220
 the brakes are 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.300
 of tapes brake bells with tapes or 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.300
 the traditional motorcycles 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.190
 Really 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.680
 it's a serene motorbike 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.670
 super economic most economical impossible 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.640
 of gas 30 the charger that it brings is not a 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.410
 simple transformer with a rectifier 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.240
 it's a sexy type font 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.420
 what you can have in the 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.420
 notebook 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.790
 in about an hour and a half 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.620
 we have the full charge 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.810
 and as we said it has an autonomy of 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.740
 around 80 km 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.440
 it is ideal 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.220
 to go to work has a speed 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.560
 maximum of about 45 50 kilometers more than 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.270
 Enough to move around the city 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.620
 as you will see it is so comfortable 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.199
 like the scooters 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.990
 of internal combustion engines nothing 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:25.590
 more than in this case super silent 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.740
 super reliable zero problems zero 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.620
 maintenance 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.380
 a motorbike really to enjoy myself 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.930
 I invite anyone who wants to know that 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.200
 want to try it take a spin here in 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.870
 motorcycle fallen in avenue alcorta 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.880
 meters from the Alsina bridge meters from the 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:48.050
 sainz exit on amancio avenue 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.230
 alcorta 4,096 they will be able to see it and 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.590
 to admire 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.449
 insured spare parts 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.550
 guaranteed after-sales service 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.759
 free maintenance free 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.759
 problems
