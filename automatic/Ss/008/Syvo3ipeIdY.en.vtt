00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
on there oh it's a lot of fender the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.160 
on there oh it's a lot of fender the
problem<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.910> remove<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.780> fender

owners<00:01:49.380> would<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.650> them<00:01:49.800> quiet<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.340> well

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580

well<00:01:51.240> we've<00:01:51.390> learned<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.780> motor<00:01:51.960> racing<00:01:52.320> by

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
well we've learned from motor racing by

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.560 
well we've learned from motor racing by
tightening<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.070> area<00:01:53.400> by<00:01:53.670> adding<00:01:53.820> structure

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
tightening this area by adding structure

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
tightening this area by adding structure
and<00:01:54.750> making<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.320> rigid<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.159> make

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and making this more rigid we can make

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.010 
and making this more rigid we can make
the<00:01:56.370> vehicle<00:01:56.520> handle<00:01:56.970> better<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.659> know<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the vehicle handle better we know that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.050 
the vehicle handle better we know that
lower<00:01:58.170> squeak<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.710> rattle<00:01:58.940> frankly<00:01:59.940> it's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
lower squeak and rattle frankly it's

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.210 
lower squeak and rattle frankly it's
great<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.420> durability<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.170> should<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.010> day

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
great for durability and should the day

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.250 
great for durability and should the day
come<00:02:02.490> where<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.760> crash<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.810> structure

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
come where you crash it that structure

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.350 
come where you crash it that structure
is<00:02:04.320> there<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.650> work<00:02:04.830> for<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> now<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:05.940> know<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
is there to work for you now we know the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.289 
is there to work for you now we know the
o7<00:02:06.780> f-150<00:02:07.620> has<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.800> 5/5<00:02:08.310> crash<00:02:08.639> safety<00:02:08.999> rating

o7 f-150 has a 5/5 crash safety rating
but<00:02:09.629> beyond<00:02:10.079> that<00:02:10.229> why<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.889> this

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
but beyond that why I like this

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.739 
but beyond that why I like this
structure<00:02:11.579> is<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:11.969> what<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.299> DOS<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.689> a

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:12.749 
structure is just what a DOS with a

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.000 
structure is just what a DOS with a
vehicle<00:02:12.989> overall<00:02:13.379> and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010

you<00:02:14.069> think<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.730> trike<00:02:15.090> commitment

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
you think this is a trike commitment

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.770 
you think this is a trike commitment
