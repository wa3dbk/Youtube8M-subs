00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
but I would like to share with you the

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.630 
but I would like to share with you the
process<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.890> introduction<00:00:36.340> so<00:00:36.430> that<00:00:36.550> you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
process of the introduction so that you

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.710 
process of the introduction so that you
guys<00:00:36.790> might<00:00:37.030> be<00:00:37.090> able<00:00:37.300> to<00:00:37.360> do<00:00:37.450> that<00:00:37.540> in<00:00:37.660> the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
guys might be able to do that in the

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.360 
guys might be able to do that in the
future<00:00:37.809> so<00:00:38.110> as<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.320> said<00:00:38.470> before<00:00:38.620> it's<00:00:38.980> it<00:00:39.250> can

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
future so as I said before it's it can

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.130 
future so as I said before it's it can
be<00:00:39.460> difficult<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:40.059> introduce<00:00:40.300> two<00:00:40.750> different

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
be difficult to introduce two different

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.740 
be difficult to introduce two different
animals<00:00:41.530> sugar<00:00:42.400> gliders<00:00:42.790> are<00:00:43.030> territorial<00:00:43.629> by

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
animals sugar gliders are territorial by

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.020 
animals sugar gliders are territorial by
nature<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:44.440> males<00:00:45.220> are<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.489> ones<00:00:45.580> that<00:00:45.940> are

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
nature and males are the ones that are

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.030 
nature and males are the ones that are
like<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.300> head<00:00:46.420> honchos<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.080> species<00:00:47.320> so

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
like the head honchos and the species so

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.149 
like the head honchos and the species so
when<00:00:48.879> we<00:00:49.120> did<00:00:49.480> come<00:00:49.989> across<00:00:50.110> a<00:00:50.559> young<00:00:50.589> male

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
when we did come across a young male

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.969 
when we did come across a young male
that<00:00:51.190> needed<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.820> home<00:00:52.290> we're<00:00:53.290> a<00:00:53.650> little

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
that needed a home we're a little

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.710 
that needed a home we're a little
slightly<00:00:54.670> concerned<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.390> two<00:00:55.540> males

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
slightly concerned that the two males

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.759 
slightly concerned that the two males
wouldn't<00:00:56.019> get<00:00:56.110> along<00:00:56.199> but<00:00:56.409> we<00:00:56.530> were<00:00:56.589> hoping

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
wouldn't get along but we were hoping

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.560 
wouldn't get along but we were hoping
for<00:00:57.010> was<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.790> one<00:00:58.059> of<00:00:58.180> them<00:00:58.300> would<00:00:58.449> become

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
for was that one of them would become

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.390 
for was that one of them would become
submissive<00:00:58.930> most<00:00:59.620> likely<00:00:59.949> was<00:01:00.070> gonna<00:01:00.159> be<00:01:00.309> the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
submissive most likely was gonna be the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.399 
submissive most likely was gonna be the
new<00:01:00.550> one<00:01:00.729> because<00:01:01.000> he<00:01:01.120> was<00:01:01.210> younger<00:01:01.479> and<00:01:01.839> gizmo

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
new one because he was younger and gizmo

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.590 
new one because he was younger and gizmo
already<00:01:02.860> kind<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.430> had<00:01:03.729> that<00:01:03.760> territory

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
already kind of had that territory

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.719 
already kind of had that territory
claimed<00:01:04.960> so<00:01:05.650> we're<00:01:06.070> hoping<00:01:06.400> for<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.640> new

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
claimed so we're hoping for the new

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.370 
claimed so we're hoping for the new
guide<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:07.000> be<00:01:07.090> submissive<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.690> gizmo<00:01:08.200> would

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
guide to be submissive and gizmo would

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.010 
guide to be submissive and gizmo would
be<00:01:08.500> very<00:01:08.940> gentle<00:01:09.940> in<00:01:10.150> his<00:01:10.180> acceptance<00:01:10.630> the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
be very gentle in his acceptance the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.600 
be very gentle in his acceptance the
reason<00:01:11.290> we<00:01:11.350> were<00:01:11.470> thinking<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:11.950> gizmo<00:01:12.280> might

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
reason we were thinking that gizmo might

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.820 
reason we were thinking that gizmo might
be<00:01:12.850> gentle<00:01:13.360> in<00:01:13.450> his<00:01:13.720> acceptance<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.799> new

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
be gentle in his acceptance of the new

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.429 
be gentle in his acceptance of the new
guy<00:01:15.130> was<00:01:15.670> because<00:01:16.060> he's<00:01:16.509> probably<00:01:16.840> craving

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
guy was because he's probably craving

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.109 
guy was because he's probably craving
companionship<00:01:18.009> these<00:01:18.159> sugar<00:01:18.670> gliders<00:01:19.000> are

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
companionship these sugar gliders are

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.420 
companionship these sugar gliders are
really<00:01:19.600> social<00:01:20.110> animals<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.860> they<00:01:21.130> create

really social animals and they create

very strong bonds they live in family
groups<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:25.140> gizmo<00:01:26.310> lost<00:01:27.310> his<00:01:27.670> long<00:01:27.969> time<00:01:28.270> 10

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899

ago<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.909> in<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.659> time<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.289> gizmo<00:01:35.619> became

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
ago and in that time it gizmo became

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.550 
ago and in that time it gizmo became
less<00:01:36.130> active<00:01:36.579> it<00:01:37.119> became<00:01:37.450> much<00:01:38.020> more<00:01:38.200> picky

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
less active it became much more picky

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.980
