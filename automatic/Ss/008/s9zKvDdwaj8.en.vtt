always<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:49.839> case<00:00:50.819> let's<00:00:51.819> watch<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.329> last<00:00:52.539> few

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
always the case let's watch the last few

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.229 
always the case let's watch the last few
hours<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.319> satellite<00:00:53.889> you<00:00:54.429> can<00:00:54.639> see<00:00:54.879> clouds

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
hours on satellite you can see clouds

coming<00:00:55.659> down<00:00:55.899> from<00:00:56.170> Canada<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:57.309> you<00:00:57.489> should

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
coming down from Canada but you should

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.119 
coming down from Canada but you should
also<00:00:57.969> notice<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:58.659> cloud<00:00:58.929> line<00:00:59.199> out<00:00:59.469> ahead<00:00:59.649> of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
be frozen as the winter storm so think

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.420 
be frozen as the winter storm so think
about<00:01:49.120> this<00:01:49.380> much<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.770> water<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.160> is

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
about this much of the water that is

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.580 
about this much of the water that is
coming<00:01:51.490> down<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.120> snow<00:01:52.480> across<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.930> Midwest

that<00:01:53.980> will<00:01:54.130> soon<00:01:54.400> reach<00:01:54.730> New<00:01:55.060> England<00:01:55.450> is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960

coming up from the Gulf of Mexico this

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.870 
coming up from the Gulf of Mexico this
is<00:01:59.110> how<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.350> weather<00:01:59.650> works<00:02:00.010> all<00:02:00.250> around<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.450 
is how the weather works all around the
globe<00:02:01.150> we<00:02:01.960> saw<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.170> powerful<00:02:02.800> low<00:02:02.950> at<00:02:03.130> Europe
