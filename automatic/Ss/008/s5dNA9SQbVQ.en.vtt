00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.498
 You are watching a video dedicated to the talent system in Heroes of the Storm. 

00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:21.372
 In each match at a certain level 

00:00:21.597 --> 00:00:24.667
 You can choose talents and create your own version of the development of the hero. 

00:00:25.068 --> 00:00:27.240
 Talents can increase ability damage, 

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:29.459
 give the hero special properties 

00:00:29.484 --> 00:00:31.920
 or add new effects to abilities. 

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:35.115
 To counter enemy strategies, 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.506
 you need to know which talents fit well together. 

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:40.701
 Take, for example, Muradin. 

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:43.631
 Initially, this hero has 3 abilities. 

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.107
 "Thunder Strike" (key Q) throws a hammer, 

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:49.018
 which stuns the first enemy hit and deals damage to it. 

00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:51.232
 Thunderclap ability (W key) 

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:53.875
 slows down nearby enemies and deals damage to them. 

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:56.006
 Dwarven Jump (E key) 

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:58.271
 allows Muradin to jump into the specified area, 

00:00:58.305 --> 00:01:00.670
 dealing damage to enemies upon landing. 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.396
 To Muradin often stunned opponents and was indispensable in the group, 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.748
 at 4th level, choose Skullbreaker talent: 

00:01:07.773 --> 00:01:10.826
 every fourth hit to a target will stun it. 

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.717
 Improve the Dwarven Jump by selecting Impact Impulse at 7th level, 

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:16.881
 Dwarf Launcher - Level 13 

00:01:16.936 --> 00:01:19.373
 and "Strong collision" - on the 16th. 

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:22.639
 So you increase the speed of movement of Muradin after landing, 

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:25.639
 increase the range and scope of the Dwarf Jump 

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:28.600
 and add a stunning effect to it. 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.264
 Using the heroic ability of Avatar, available at 10th level, 

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:35.943
 Muradin will be able to control the course of the battle for key positions. 

00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:38.498
 This is especially useful on the Cursed Hollow battlefield, 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.639
 where teams often fight with each other for gifts. 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.771
 If you want to focus on causing damage, at 1st level 

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.896
 Select the talent “Perfect Storm”, which increases the damage of Thunder Strike by 5. 

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:50.709
 for each enemy hero hit. 

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:53.506
 Then, at 7th level, select the “Piercing Lightning” talent, 

00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:55.927
 allowing the Thunderstorm to hit an additional target. 

00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:58.709
 Hitting two goals with these talents, you increase 

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:02.118
 Damage from Thunder Strike by 10. 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.169
 As a heroic ability at 10th level, select Stunning Blow: 

00:02:06.203 --> 00:02:08.475
 it does great damage and imposes a controlling effect. 

00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:09.857
 If you fight on big battlefields 

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:11.639
 like "Dragon Land" or "Blackhill Bay", 

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.920
 where large-scale battles between teams rarely occur, 

00:02:14.014 --> 00:02:15.771
 then at the 13th level you should choose Thunderclap, 

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:18.053
 which will allow individual targets to inflict enormous damage. 

00:02:18.756 --> 00:02:21.068
 If you are fighting in the "Cursed dell" or "Ghost mines", 

00:02:21.093 --> 00:02:23.084
 where battles for key positions often go, 

00:02:23.272 --> 00:02:26.131
 then the Dwarf Jump is better for you, allowing you to be in the thick of the fight 

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:28.178
 and immediately hit the enemy with a “stunning blow”. 

00:02:28.943 --> 00:02:31.936
 Note that every match in Heroes of the Storm is unique. 

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:34.779
 Talents allow you to change the style of play of your chosen hero, 

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:36.889
 adapt it to a specific team, 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.381
 opponents 

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:40.350
 battlefield 

00:02:40.428 --> 00:02:42.467
 and allied actions. 

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:46.482
 It is very important to understand the situations for which particular talents are suitable. 

00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:49.154
 Choose Fiery Rage if enemies have 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:50.420
 many melee fighters, 

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:53.521
 rush into the thick of events and causing great damage (like a stitch). 

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.881
 This talent allows you to inflict damage to surrounding enemies every second. 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.717
 Fiery Rage is particularly effective on the Ghost Mine battlefield, 

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:03.021
 as it allows you to constantly do damage while you explore the mines 

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:04.779
 or perform tasks. 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.436
 “Burning Storm” combines perfectly with this talent. 

00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:11.670
 since heroes like Stitch, who can't quickly get out of the fight, 

00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:15.514
 You can slow down the "Roll of Thunder" by constantly inflicting damage on them with Fiery Rage. 

00:03:16.373 --> 00:03:19.021
 If your team does not have a good doctor, 

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:20.201
 use "Static Healing", 

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:23.592
 replenishing Muradin 1% of health for each goal struck by "The roll of thunder". 

00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:26.811
 If, at the same time, at the 4th level you choose the “Burning Storm” talent, 

00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:29.631
 allowing fast re-use of Thunderclap, 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.998
 you can double the amount of health replenished by "Static Healing", 

00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:35.647
 which will increase the survivability of the hero both on the line and in battle with the opposing team. 

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:38.428
 If in the opposite team there are heroes like Valla, 

00:03:38.453 --> 00:03:41.076
 whose abilities allow them to move quickly, 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.154
 it is worth strengthening the “Dwarven jump” with the talent “Impulse landing”. 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.646
 “Impulse landing” increases the speed of movement after landing by 20%. 

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.904
 So if Valla keeps his distance with the “Kulbit”, 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.217
 You can quickly catch up with her after the jump due to an increase in speed. 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.123
 We will continue to make changes to the talent system as the game develops. 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.811
 We are working on creating another system 

00:03:59.836 --> 00:04:02.264
 which would allow you to collect information about the talents of the enemy. 

00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:04.061
 This will allow players 

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:06.967
 select development options in accordance with the choice of rivals. 

00:04:07.678 --> 00:04:08.951
 That's all! 

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:11.846
 Do not forget that you can apply to participate in beta testing. 

00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:13.367
 on www.HeroesOfTheStorm.com. 

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:15.303
 With you was Kevin Nok from Blizzard Entertainment. 

00:04:15.328 --> 00:04:16.521
 See you!
