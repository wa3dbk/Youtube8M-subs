00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.389
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.330
 It is the end of the world rubber market 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:16.780
 This time 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:22.150
 I'm going to work on the sinking reception of the fore rotation 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:25.150
 There are a lot of types in the receive as a way not to hit the opponent, but among them 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.580
 The other party gets stuck or the other party gets around 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.580
 Sinking is important to prevent 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.750
 It is also a very effective receive for doubles serve that can only come to the fore 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:47.790
 Is for the top rotation and the lower rotation this time I'd There are two types with respect to the lower rotation of I mean flow 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.370
 Rotate down the side against Saab 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.540
 I will introduce the flow seal 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:01:01.350
 Here is the first step 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:05.390
 The first step is to open your wrist and point straight at the other person 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:12.909
 The lateral rotation by opening here firmly on the wrist 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:16.359
 It will be easy to turn to 4 turns and will soon be public service like Tsutsuki 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.880
 I 'm going to run out of my sink, so I can't put it out to the Diet 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.880
 First of all, please try to open firmly 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.740
 The second step is 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.340
 Of the ball 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.260
 And swing with so firmly stroking the place of the left when viewed from the lower left his ball 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.590
 Please give me 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:43.800
 If you catch a win here, you will be lost by the rotation and you will fall sideways yourself 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:49.440
 Please capture aware of the lower left is to put stronger from 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.190
 Here myself bending greatly prognosis car rotation by taking the lower left because the rotation was the partner of Saab 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:59.370
 Can go 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:06.330
 The third procedure Please doing it go only Tsu re-movements of the opposing coat can image 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:08.710
 It will return even the rotation of Tteyuu because it returns the horizontal press conference when the momentum of the ball is hit in the absence of rotation 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.930
 It is not so fast though 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:18.910
 To be able to be bent firmly largely know little Fuwatte from the bound 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.690
 Will you go to give eyeing the place that say using it firmly again weapon 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.160
 Please give me 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.160
 See also the play then 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.670
 bloo 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.099
 Hmm 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.640
 pr 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.810
 Hmm 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.670
 eh 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.920
 top 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.049
 ua 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.049
 Right now 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.580
 Oh 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.989
 Hmm 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.989
 Right now 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.280
 Haa 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.280
 Did the play emerge? 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:21.630
 You can expand it to make it clogged by bending it firmly as it is now 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.770
 Firm flowed as it was to play Toka practice say waving to the fore to be around to the other party 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.100
 so 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.170
 If development is also practiced together 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.340
 I think it is easy to get along 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.340
 Please try a challenge
