00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.080
 What are you doing these in the kitchen these are 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.240
 we need colorful balloons for 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.310
 make today's recipe we do 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.540
 a super delicious sweet a variation on the 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.359
 theme strawberries and cream 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.340
 but I won't let you know anything is fine I'll tell you 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.380
 we prepare chocolate bowls 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.010
 stuffed with chantilly cream and strawberries e 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.010
 let's see how 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.610
 before melting the chocolate swells 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.440
 balloons 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.790
 I have three given the dark chocolate and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.790
 now the dull in a bain-marie 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.129
 if you don't have a specific pot 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.840
 for the bain-marie use 2 more pans 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.399
 big with boiling water and one 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.470
 smaller put just above the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.470
 water level the bain-marie is a 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.449
 very delicate cooking method indeed 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.190
 the food is not in direct contact with the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.460
 fire because there is water in it 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.460
 boiling 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.119
 if your kids love chocolate 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.930
 white milk milk satisfies ii and 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.930
 use their favorite 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.860
 if you want to get containers that 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.110
 they are crispy shiny then you must 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 temper the chocolate what it means 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.780
 tempera chocolate means you have to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 move it to certain temperatures and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.950
 then cooling it again is a 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.870
 you can do a rather complex procedure 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.760
 use a much simpler one and 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.140
 fast than home for small 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.940
 amount of chocolate ie 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.500
 melt the dark chocolate without 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.500
 let him exceed 28 30 degrees 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.930
 the chocolate is ready 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.399
 take little balloons and 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.140
 rather thick and dip them 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:13.420
 inside so 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.420
 place them on a sheet of parchment paper 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.239
 and they will naturally form one 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.239
 small base 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.310
 proceed to finish all 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.670
 balloons these will form ours 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.670
 bowls 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.780
 now you can put the balloons in 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.260
 refrigerator so the chocolate will become 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.260
 harder 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.349
 and I repeat our chocolate tastes 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.299
 it will be chantilly cream or cream 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.610
 mounted mixed with icing sugar and a 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.610
 vanilla and small pieces of strawberries 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.739
 cut them into small cubes 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.410
 strawberries with cream are great 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.010
 classic but then use the fruit that 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.010
 you prefer 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.420
 for the chantilly cream reserves of 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.040
 engrave a vanilla bean then 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.790
 I take a small boxcutter 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.069
 I first make an engraving on the vessel e 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.189
 then thanks like with the blade of the 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.189
 knife 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.830
 I take a rather large bowl 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.590
 towards the inside the very cold cream 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.420
 from the fridge 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.440
 and very important because it is assembled 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.520
 must 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.520
 sift the icing sugar inside 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.700
 I insert and vanilla seeds 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.139
 and here I can give you an advice for a 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.699
 more pronounced vanilla flavor leaves the 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.610
 berry in similar infusion in cream 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.129
 a few hours in the refrigerator and then mounted 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.999
 a trick not to get dirty with the 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.999
 same as cream 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.950
 now with a mixer we assemble it 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.390
 I transfer the chantilly cream not there 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:10.710
 sac Ã  poche and then they are ready for 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:12.360
 compose the sweet now that the chocolate 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.280
 hardened we must eliminate the 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.360
 balloon we have to burst them or 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.810
 cut it and then slowly remove it 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.810
 from the bowl 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.800
 here it is 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.580
 and now the filling is the most delicious 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.710
 some strawberries 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.799
 and finally chocolate beads 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.139
 and while I finish decorating the 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.490
 we see everyone else together 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.560
 the ingredients to prepare this 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.750
 recipe bowls ingredients of 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.639
 chocolate with chantilly and fruit for 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.820
 eight small bowls 200 g of chocolate 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:21.400
 dark 8 cream balloons 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.400
 chantilly 500 milliliters of fresh cream 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.889

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.600
 veil to decorate 60 grams of strawberries and 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:32.979
 black and white chocolate decorations 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.710
 with an unusual object for the kitchen 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.360
 we created a dessert really 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.560
 irresistible a bit of imagination a 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.720
 a touch of fun a bit of fun 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.880
 the kitchen becomes a game in which 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.560
 involve even the little ones 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.979
 also cook you want let me know if it is 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.979
