of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.700> configurations<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> advantages<00:02:00.420> for

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
of the configurations and advantages for

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.380 
of the configurations and advantages for
the<00:02:00.689> driver<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.200> well<00:02:01.610> obviously<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> driver

possible
so<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:06.840> we've<00:02:06.990> done<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> we've<00:02:07.469> incorporated

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
so what we've done is we've incorporated

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.219 
so what we've done is we've incorporated
an<00:02:08.160> adjustable<00:02:08.729> seat<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
driver's side so you can actually adjust

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.250 
driver's side so you can actually adjust
the<00:02:11.819> seat<00:02:12.090> front<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.599> back

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the seat front to back

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.440 
the seat front to back
making<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.010> much<00:02:14.099> more<00:02:14.160> comfortable<00:02:14.849> for<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
making it much more comfortable for the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.850 
making it much more comfortable for the
different<00:02:15.780> sized<00:02:15.930> riders<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.590> are<00:02:16.740> out

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
different sized riders that are out

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.740 
different sized riders that are out
there<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.670> seat<00:02:18.090> belts<00:02:18.390> actually

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
there the seat belts actually

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.170 
there the seat belts actually
incorporate<00:02:19.319> this<00:02:19.530> anti<00:02:20.220> cinch<00:02:20.550> device<00:02:20.910> that

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
incorporate this anti cinch device that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.370 
incorporate this anti cinch device that
you<00:02:21.239> see<00:02:21.300> there's<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.599> little<00:02:21.810> bit<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.989> give<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
you see there's a little bit of give and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.620 
you see there's a little bit of give and
play<00:02:22.590> there<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.520> again<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.000> allows<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
play there so again that allows for the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.540 
play there so again that allows for the
seat<00:02:24.810> belts<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.349> remain<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.069> lot<00:02:26.280> more

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
seat belts to remain a lot more

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.520 
seat belts to remain a lot more

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
comfortable we also incorporate these

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.199 
comfortable we also incorporate these
cupholders<00:02:29.130> into<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> dash<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.940> we've<00:02:30.060> got

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
cupholders into the dash so we've got

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.110 
cupholders into the dash so we've got
four<00:02:30.450> cup<00:02:30.720> holders<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:32.010> vehicle<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:33.090> can

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
four cup holders in the vehicle you can

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.760 
four cup holders in the vehicle you can
never<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> too<00:02:33.720> much<00:02:33.870> water<00:02:34.110> out<00:02:34.440> there

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
never have it too much water out there

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.809 
never have it too much water out there
when<00:02:34.950> you're<00:02:35.100> working<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.970> field<00:02:40.819> now

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
when you're working in the field now

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.940 
when you're working in the field now
let's<00:02:41.970> talk<00:02:42.090> about<00:02:42.150> cargo<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:43.410> Viking<00:02:43.830> has

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
let's talk about cargo the Viking has

let's talk about cargo the Viking has
several<00:02:44.310> features<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.910> makes<00:02:45.090> carrying

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
several features that makes carrying

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.809 
several features that makes carrying
cargo<00:02:46.019> much<00:02:46.709> better<00:02:47.010> than<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> competitive

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
cargo much better than the competitive

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.670 
cargo much better than the competitive
models<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.269> are<00:02:48.360> out<00:02:48.390> there<00:02:48.720> first<00:02:49.470> thing

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
