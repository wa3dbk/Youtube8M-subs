something<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:12.030> just<00:00:12.059> accept<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:13.110> not

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
something we just accept it's not

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.230 
something we just accept it's not
normally<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> most<00:00:13.950> exciting<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.580> processes

but<00:00:15.630> today<00:00:15.960> we've<00:00:16.320> tried<00:00:16.590> something

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
but today we've tried something

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the fourth most efficient car here but

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
the fourth most efficient car here but
still<00:01:02.070> 70<00:01:02.520> miles<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> gallon<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.629> going

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
still 70 miles to the gallon I'm going

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.179 
still 70 miles to the gallon I'm going
to<00:01:03.870> try<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> difference<00:01:04.530> by

to try and make up the difference by

to try and make up the difference by
going<00:01:05.549> hard<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> start<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> they<00:01:06.780> can

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
going hard of the start and they can

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.390 
going hard of the start and they can
reach<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.350> smiie<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.799> hopefully<00:01:08.220> we're<00:01:08.369> not

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
reach a smiie and hopefully we're not

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
not going to win I know that these

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.490 
not going to win I know that these
wasn't<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> win<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> try

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
wasn't going to win so I'm going to try

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.840 
wasn't going to win so I'm going to try
and<00:01:13.590> beat<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.740> other<00:01:13.830> hi<00:01:14.100> Ridley<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.580> sight

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and beat the other hi Ridley in sight

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.429 
and beat the other hi Ridley in sight
and<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.720> reason<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and for that reason I'm going to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.230 
and for that reason I'm going to
slipstream<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.220> insight<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.090> can

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
slipstream the insight and see if I can

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.050 
slipstream the insight and see if I can
beat<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.720> am<00:01:19.290> driving<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.979> insight<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> my

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
beat it I am driving the insight and my

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.460 
beat it I am driving the insight and my
strategy<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> try<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.110> drive<00:01:22.259> at<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
strategy is to try and drive at a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.950 
strategy is to try and drive at a
constant<00:01:22.680> 56<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.460> 60<00:01:23.880> miles<00:01:24.090> an<00:01:24.299> hour<00:01:24.450> which<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
constant 56 to 60 miles an hour which is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.780 
constant 56 to 60 miles an hour which is
the<00:01:24.990> best<00:01:25.259> kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.710> speed<00:01:26.040> fuel<00:01:26.369> consumption

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the best kind of speed fuel consumption

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.249 
the best kind of speed fuel consumption
and<00:01:26.880> avoid<00:01:27.119> braking<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.750> much<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.080> possible

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and avoid braking as much as possible

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
and avoid braking as much as possible
because<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.710> really<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.310> bad<00:01:29.400> build

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
because that's really really bad build

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.569 
because that's really really bad build
something<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:31.020> driving<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> smart<00:01:31.829> CDI<00:01:32.280> and

something I'm driving a smart CDI and
I'm<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.850> win<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.540> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
I'm going to win because I'm going to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
I'm going to win because I'm going to
drive<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.810> flat<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.590> an<00:01:34.680> hour<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:36.060> I've

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
drive it flat out for an hour and I've

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.660 
drive it flat out for an hour and I've
called<00:01:36.479> dibs<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> BMW<00:01:37.290> 1<00:01:37.799> 160<00:01:38.340> because

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
called dibs on the BMW 1 160 because

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.640 
called dibs on the BMW 1 160 because
it's<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> most<00:01:39.060> powerful<00:01:39.390> car<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.350> my

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it's the most powerful car here and my

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.319 
it's the most powerful car here and my
strategy<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.700> win<00:01:42.000> from<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> front<00:01:46.100> go<00:01:47.329> it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
strategy is to win from the front go it

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.120 
strategy is to win from the front go it
was<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> slowest<00:01:49.170> start<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> erase<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
was the slowest start to erase that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.819 
was the slowest start to erase that
anyone<00:01:50.670> has<00:01:50.880> ever<00:01:51.149> seen<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.290> by<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.500> end<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
anyone has ever seen but by the end of

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.289 
anyone has ever seen but by the end of
the<00:01:52.920> first<00:01:53.159> lap<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.610> clear<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the first lap it was clear that the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.270 
the first lap it was clear that the
Fiesta<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> smart<00:01:55.409> were<00:01:55.799> setting<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
Fiesta and the smart were setting the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.690 
Fiesta and the smart were setting the
pace<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:57.000> Goodwyn<00:01:57.420> powering<00:01:57.990> ahead<00:01:58.110> a

pace with Goodwyn powering ahead a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.090 
pace with Goodwyn powering ahead a
trouble<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.820> my<00:02:00.229> flat-out<00:02:01.229> technique<00:02:01.920> in

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
trouble with my flat-out technique in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.740 
trouble with my flat-out technique in
the<00:02:02.219> smart

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
the smart

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.960 
the smart
is<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.650> it's<00:02:03.770> not<00:02:03.950> very<00:02:04.100> fast<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.880> other

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
is that it's not very fast and the other

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.180 
is that it's not very fast and the other
problem<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.480> the<00:02:06.050> understeer<00:02:06.620> is<00:02:06.710> like<00:02:06.890> you

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
problem is the understeer is like you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.900 
problem is the understeer is like you
wouldn't<00:02:07.400> believe

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
wouldn't believe

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.500 
wouldn't believe
so<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.539> had<00:02:08.690> then<00:02:09.289> got<00:02:10.060> left<00:02:11.060> foot<00:02:11.270> braking

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
so I had then got left foot braking

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.050 
so I had then got left foot braking
doing<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.650> made<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.430> lot<00:02:13.520> easier<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.910> get

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
doing that made it a lot easier to get

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.830 
doing that made it a lot easier to get
around<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.300> corners

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
around the corners

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.620 
around the corners
trouble<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.370> it's<00:02:16.370> brought<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.910> smarts

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
trouble is it's brought the smarts

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.270 
trouble is it's brought the smarts
incredible<00:02:18.200> 80<00:02:18.410> plus<00:02:18.920> mpg<00:02:19.760> fuel<00:02:20.570> consumption
