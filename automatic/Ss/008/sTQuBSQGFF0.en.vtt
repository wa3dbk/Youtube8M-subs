on<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> cast-iron<00:00:44.879> griddle<00:00:45.300> we're<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
on a cast-iron griddle we're going to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.630 
on a cast-iron griddle we're going to
start<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> medium<00:00:47.070> temperature<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.610> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
start at a medium temperature when I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.220 
start at a medium temperature when I
keep<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> nice<00:00:48.989> caramelization

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
keep going and get a nice caramelization

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.410 
keep going and get a nice caramelization
on<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> steak<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.059> want<00:00:51.329> any

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
on the steak and I don't want any

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.970 
on the steak and I don't want any
fluctuations<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.230> temperature<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.680> we're

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
fluctuations in temperature so we're

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
fluctuations in temperature so we're
going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.160> keep<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.460> natural<00:00:53.910> gas<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.809> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
going to keep that natural gas going so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
going to keep that natural gas going so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 

so<00:01:16.920> we've<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.520> medium<00:01:17.880> right<00:01:18.060> now

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so we've got that on medium right now

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
so we've got that on medium right now
this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> medium<00:01:18.990> temperature<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
this is a medium temperature and the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.740 
this is a medium temperature and the
best<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.520> about<00:01:20.700> cooking<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.299> natural

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
best thing about cooking with natural

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
best thing about cooking with natural
gases<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> temperature<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.460> want

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
gases you get the temperature you want

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
gases you get the temperature you want
exactly<00:01:24.450> when<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.690> want<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
exactly when you want it it's going to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.899 
exactly when you want it it's going to
stay<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.070> way<00:01:26.280> throughout<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> whole

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
stay that way throughout the whole

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
stay that way throughout the whole
cooking<00:01:27.180> process<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.440> can<00:01:28.590> leave<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.890> as

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
cooking process so we can leave this as

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.469 
cooking process so we can leave this as
it<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> we're<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> slowly<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it is we're going to slowly get the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
it is we're going to slowly get the
carmelization<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.439> outside<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
carmelization on the outside of the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.330 
carmelization on the outside of the
steak<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:33.140> retain<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> beautiful<00:01:34.590> flavor<00:01:34.830> and

steak and retain a beautiful flavor and
the<00:01:35.490> inside<00:01:35.759> why<00:01:36.149> is<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.539> important<00:01:36.899> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the inside why is it so important to
