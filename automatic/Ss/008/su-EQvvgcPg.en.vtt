of<00:02:41.420> my<00:02:41.510> ripping<00:02:41.780> up<00:02:41.930> everything<00:02:42.080> as<00:02:42.620> far<00:02:42.650> as

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
of my ripping up everything as far as

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.860 
of my ripping up everything as far as
that<00:02:43.100> is<00:02:43.160> still<00:02:43.700> where<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.720> where<00:02:44.810> it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
that is still where it is and where it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.199 
that is still where it is and where it
needs<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.230> be<00:02:45.320> so<00:02:46.040> nothing<00:02:46.459> has<00:02:46.670> changed

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209
