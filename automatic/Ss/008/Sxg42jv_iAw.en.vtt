sometimes<00:00:00.840> students<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:01.770> my<00:00:02.010> classes<00:00:02.520> are

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
sometimes students in my classes are

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.150 
sometimes students in my classes are
surprised<00:00:03.270> that<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.259> care<00:00:04.589> about<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.040> quality

surprised that I care about the quality
of<00:00:05.520> their<00:00:05.790> writing<00:00:06.210> but<00:00:07.080> I'm<00:00:07.230> always

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
of their writing but I'm always

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.709 
of their writing but I'm always
surprised<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.189> anyone<00:00:08.400> could<00:00:08.940> imagine<00:00:09.090> that

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
surprised that anyone could imagine that

there<00:00:10.320> could<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.559> any<00:00:10.860> area<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.429> scholarship

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
there could be any area of scholarship

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.700 
there could be any area of scholarship
or<00:00:12.389> any<00:00:13.200> area<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:15.170> dealing<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> world

or any area of dealing with the world
where<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.460> wouldn't<00:00:17.730> care<00:00:18.090> about<00:00:18.330> how<00:00:18.779> we

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
where we wouldn't care about how we

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:38.370 
where we wouldn't care about how we
write<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> how<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:19.740> speak<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.220> each<00:00:20.340> other

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.640 

I<00:00:41.910> study<00:00:42.910> ants<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.660> because<00:00:44.080> I'm<00:00:44.200> interested

I study ants and because I'm interested

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.470 
I study ants and because I'm interested
in<00:00:44.770> how<00:00:44.980> an<00:00:45.220> organization<00:00:45.880> can<00:00:46.030> work<00:00:46.270> without

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
in how an organization can work without

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.200 
in how an organization can work without
any<00:00:46.810> central<00:00:47.260> control<00:00:47.710> so<00:00:48.640> in<00:00:48.760> an<00:00:48.880> ant<00:00:49.030> colony

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
any central control so in an ant colony

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.120 
any central control so in an ant colony
there's<00:00:49.630> nobody<00:00:49.960> in<00:00:50.080> charge<00:00:50.110> nobody<00:00:50.860> tells

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
there's nobody in charge nobody tells

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.400 
there's nobody in charge nobody tells
anybody<00:00:51.250> what<00:00:51.730> to<00:00:51.850> do<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.810> ants<00:00:53.080> can<00:00:53.230> only

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
anybody what to do the ants can only

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.050 
anybody what to do the ants can only
perceive<00:00:53.830> what's<00:00:54.100> right<00:00:54.310> around<00:00:54.460> them<00:00:54.850> and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
perceive what's right around them and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.900 
perceive what's right around them and
yet<00:00:55.510> somehow<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:56.080> colony<00:00:56.830> can<00:00:57.070> function<00:00:57.610> and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
yet somehow the colony can function and

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.320 
yet somehow the colony can function and
we<00:00:58.360> produce<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:59.489> adjust<00:01:00.489> its<00:01:00.730> behavior<00:01:01.270> to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
we produce and adjust its behavior to

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.110 
we produce and adjust its behavior to
changing<00:01:01.840> conditions<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:03.670> fascinated

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
changing conditions and I'm fascinated

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.640 
changing conditions and I'm fascinated
by<00:01:04.630> how<00:01:05.130> very<00:01:06.130> limited<00:01:07.020> individuals<00:01:08.020> working

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
by how very limited individuals working

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.620 
by how very limited individuals working
in<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:08.979> aggregate<00:01:09.310> can<00:01:09.790> do<00:01:09.940> such<00:01:10.120> complicated

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
in the aggregate can do such complicated

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.160 
in the aggregate can do such complicated
things<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.880> always<00:01:16.119> surprised<00:01:16.540> by<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.810> idea

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
things I'm always surprised by the idea

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.630 
things I'm always surprised by the idea
that<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.380> scientist<00:01:17.920> doesn't<00:01:18.130> need<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.610> know

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
that a scientist doesn't need to know

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.630 
that a scientist doesn't need to know
how<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:18.970> write<00:01:19.300> because<00:01:20.259> a<00:01:20.290> scientist<00:01:20.920> lays

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
how to write because a scientist lays

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.210 
how to write because a scientist lays
out<00:01:21.880> an<00:01:22.060> argument<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:23.140> course<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.590> use<00:01:23.800> numbers

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
out an argument of course we use numbers

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.890 
out an argument of course we use numbers
and<00:01:24.250> measurements<00:01:25.000> but<00:01:25.150> we<00:01:25.300> use<00:01:25.509> them<00:01:25.690> in<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
and measurements but we use them in the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.510 
and measurements but we use them in the
service<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.440> making<00:01:26.860> an<00:01:26.979> argument<00:01:27.160> about

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
service of making an argument about

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.060 
service of making an argument about
ideas<00:01:28.060> about<00:01:28.869> asking<00:01:29.410> questions<00:01:29.860> and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
ideas about asking questions and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.910 
ideas about asking questions and
answering<00:01:30.250> them<00:01:30.640> so<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.630> scientist<00:01:32.410> needs<00:01:32.680> to

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
answering them so a scientist needs to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.150 
answering them so a scientist needs to
be<00:01:33.040> able<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.580> talk<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.300> to<00:01:34.630> write<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.979> as

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
be able to talk and to write just as

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.660 
be able to talk and to write just as
anybody<00:01:36.910> does<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.229> nothing<00:01:38.830> special

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
anybody does there is nothing special

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.900 
anybody does there is nothing special
about<00:01:40.060> science<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:41.070> lifts<00:01:42.070> us<00:01:42.220> out<00:01:42.429> of<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
about science that lifts us out of the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.450 
about science that lifts us out of the
need<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.149> communicate<00:01:44.050> with<00:01:44.229> each<00:01:44.259> other<00:01:44.619> so

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
need to communicate with each other so

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.850 
need to communicate with each other so
writing<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:46.300> science<00:01:46.509> is<00:01:46.869> important<00:01:47.679> in

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
writing and science is important in

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.040 
writing and science is important in
exactly<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.580> same<00:01:48.610> way<00:01:49.030> it's<00:01:49.360> important<00:01:49.899> in

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
exactly the same way it's important in

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.820 
exactly the same way it's important in
any<00:01:50.289> other<00:01:50.560> area<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.160> scholarship<00:01:51.910> or<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.830> any

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
other way that people will want to talk

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.639 
other way that people will want to talk
to<00:01:56.110> each<00:01:56.200> other<00:02:00.840> thinking<00:02:01.840> about<00:02:02.050> my<00:02:02.200> work<00:02:02.410> and

to each other thinking about my work and

talking about my work and writing about

same process one of my favorite things

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.480 
same process one of my favorite things
about<00:02:10.170> studying<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.380> behavior<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.920> ants<00:02:12.190> is

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
about studying the behavior of ants is

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.460 
about studying the behavior of ants is
those<00:02:12.819> moments<00:02:13.090> when<00:02:13.690> I'm<00:02:14.700> quiet<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
those moments when I'm quiet and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.140 
those moments when I'm quiet and
watching<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.770> see<00:02:18.400> things<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.000> never

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
watching and see things that I never

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.380 
watching and see things that I never
thought<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.920> I'm<00:02:21.069> always<00:02:21.340> trying<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.000> put

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
thought of but I'm always trying to put

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.410 
thought of but I'm always trying to put
together<00:02:22.569> what<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.110> see<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.520> make<00:02:24.760> patterns

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
together what I see and to make patterns

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.870 
together what I see and to make patterns
in<00:02:25.780> my<00:02:25.959> mind<00:02:26.230> out<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.890> patterns<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.580> their

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
in my mind out of the patterns of their

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.650 
in my mind out of the patterns of their
behavior<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:29.470> writing<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.490> have<00:02:30.760> time<00:02:31.240> to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
behavior so in writing I have time to

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.300 
behavior so in writing I have time to
think<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.920> lay<00:02:33.220> out<00:02:33.370> an<00:02:33.580> argument<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.330> to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
think and to lay out an argument and to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.720 
think and to lay out an argument and to
put<00:02:36.310> together<00:02:36.599> my<00:02:37.599> thoughts<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.980> writing

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
put together my thoughts so writing

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.839 
put together my thoughts so writing
really<00:02:40.270> helps<00:02:40.660> me<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.050> think

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.059 

the<00:02:46.390> first<00:02:46.659> step<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:46.959> writing<00:02:47.109> is<00:02:47.409> by<00:02:47.590> far<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
the first step in writing is by far the

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.979 
the first step in writing is by far the
hardest<00:02:48.280> because<00:02:49.120> that's<00:02:49.480> when<00:02:49.659> I<00:02:49.689> have<00:02:49.959> to

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
hardest because that's when I have to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.720 
hardest because that's when I have to
figure<00:02:50.230> out<00:02:50.469> what<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.650> really<00:02:50.950> want<00:02:51.159> to<00:02:51.219> say<00:02:51.459> and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
figure out what I really want to say and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.300 
figure out what I really want to say and
in<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.689> beginning<00:02:52.840> all<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.379> want<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.829> do<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.159> to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
in the beginning all I want to do is to

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.899 
in the beginning all I want to do is to
get<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.609> down<00:02:54.819> on<00:02:54.849> paper<00:02:55.409> somehow<00:02:56.409> and<00:02:56.909> not

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
get it down on paper somehow and not

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.580 
get it down on paper somehow and not
worry<00:02:58.180> very<00:02:58.389> much<00:02:58.480> about<00:02:58.749> how<00:02:58.959> I'm<00:02:59.139> saying<00:02:59.379> it

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
worry very much about how I'm saying it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.770 
worry very much about how I'm saying it
but<00:02:59.799> just<00:03:00.159> try<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.519> be<00:03:00.760> clear<00:03:01.090> about<00:03:01.120> what<00:03:01.659> it

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
but just try to be clear about what it

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.459 
but just try to be clear about what it
is<00:03:01.810> exactly<00:03:02.019> that<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.500> want<00:03:02.859> to<00:03:03.010> say<00:03:07.469> everything

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
is exactly that I want to say everything

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.220 
is exactly that I want to say everything
I<00:03:08.590> write<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:08.829> write<00:03:09.219> over<00:03:09.639> and<00:03:09.790> over<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.900> I

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
I write I write over and over so I

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.409 
I write I write over and over so I
learned<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.980> lot<00:03:12.400> about<00:03:12.459> writing<00:03:13.150> from<00:03:13.359> my

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
learned a lot about writing from my

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.470 
learned a lot about writing from my
dissertation<00:03:14.139> advisor<00:03:14.500> who<00:03:15.010> covered<00:03:15.969> every

piece of paper I ever gave him in red
marks<00:03:18.879> and<00:03:19.560> paid<00:03:20.560> enormous<00:03:21.010> amount<00:03:21.400> of

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
marks and paid enormous amount of

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.330 
marks and paid enormous amount of
attention<00:03:21.969> to<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.930> details<00:03:23.379> of<00:03:23.530> grammar<00:03:23.859> to

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
attention to the details of grammar to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.839 
attention to the details of grammar to
reference<00:03:24.969> to<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:26.230> rhythm<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.919> a<00:03:27.370> sentence

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
reference to the rhythm of a sentence

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.720 
reference to the rhythm of a sentence
and<00:03:28.139> I<00:03:29.139> learned<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.829> tremendous<00:03:29.980> amount<00:03:30.400> from

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
and I learned a tremendous amount from

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.500 
and I learned a tremendous amount from
him<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.980> students<00:03:36.459> for<00:03:36.699> people<00:03:36.969> starting<00:03:37.209> out

him for students for people starting out

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.099 
him for students for people starting out
when<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.409> have<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.919> lot<00:03:39.189> of<00:03:39.400> ideas<00:03:40.269> thrown<00:03:40.870> at

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
when you have a lot of ideas thrown at

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.470 
when you have a lot of ideas thrown at
you<00:03:41.439> and<00:03:41.709> it's<00:03:42.400> hard<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.879> see<00:03:43.090> how<00:03:43.269> they<00:03:43.449> all

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
you and it's hard to see how they all

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.099 
you and it's hard to see how they all
fit<00:03:43.659> in<00:03:44.169> then<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:45.909> words<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.510> names<00:03:46.750> the

fit in then the words the names the

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.659 
fit in then the words the names the
jargon<00:03:47.489> become<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.519> way<00:03:48.819> of<00:03:49.150> trying<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:50.669> learn

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
jargon become a way of trying to learn

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.050 
jargon become a way of trying to learn
to<00:03:51.939> talk<00:03:52.269> in<00:03:52.659> this<00:03:52.989> new<00:03:53.349> world<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.129> when
