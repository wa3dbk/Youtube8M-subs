again<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:11.100> want<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> check<00:01:11.490> yourself

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
again you want to check yourself

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820 
again you want to check yourself
throughout<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.510> move<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.320> make<00:01:13.500> sure<00:01:13.650> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
throughout this move to make sure that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
throughout this move to make sure that
your<00:01:13.979> back<00:01:14.130> foot<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:15.000> front<00:01:15.030> hand<00:01:15.540> are

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
your back foot and your front hand are

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.050 
your back foot and your front hand are
still<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.290> same<00:01:16.470> line<00:01:16.890> other<00:01:17.610> than<00:01:17.729> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
still on that same line other than that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
still on that same line other than that
you<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> make<00:01:19.140> sure<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:19.590> hips<00:01:19.710> are

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you want to make sure that your hips are

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
you want to make sure that your hips are
about<00:01:20.189> head<00:01:20.430> level<00:01:20.640> meaning<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.659> back

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
about head level meaning that your back

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.990 
about head level meaning that your back
is<00:01:22.049> relatively<00:01:22.530> straight<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> horizontal<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
is relatively straight and horizontal to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.420 
is relatively straight and horizontal to
the<00:01:24.060> ground<00:01:24.470> lastly<00:01:25.470> make<00:01:25.979> sure<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.310> you're

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the ground lastly make sure that you're

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
the ground lastly make sure that you're
transferring<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> weight<00:01:27.240> equally<00:01:27.810> between

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
transferring the weight equally between

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.460 
transferring the weight equally between
your<00:01:28.560> arms<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> your<00:01:29.759> legs<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> put

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
your arms and your legs so when you put

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.319 
your arms and your legs so when you put
it<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.650> together<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.700> want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> start<00:01:33.210> out

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
it all together you want to start out

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.960 
it all together you want to start out
with<00:01:33.479> slow<00:01:33.810> small<00:01:34.350> steps<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.070> it'll<00:01:35.880> look

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
with slow small steps and it'll look

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.569 
with slow small steps and it'll look
like<00:01:36.119> this

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.219 

if<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.789> hand<00:01:45.000> hand<00:01:45.240> foot<00:01:45.329> foot<00:01:45.659> cadence<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
if the hand hand foot foot cadence is

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.020 
if the hand hand foot foot cadence is
confusing<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> learn<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
confusing for you to learn there is a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.550 
confusing for you to learn there is a
simpler<00:01:48.420> method<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.140> start<00:01:49.409> out

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
simpler method that you can start out

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560 
simpler method that you can start out
with<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.219> setup<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.729> same<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.539> only

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
with the setup is the same the only

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.139 
with the setup is the same the only
difference<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.289> you<00:01:52.740> put<00:01:53.159> both<00:01:53.820> hands

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
difference is that you put both hands

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450 
difference is that you put both hands
down<00:01:54.390> together<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.950> feet<00:01:56.250> together

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
down together and then the feet together

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.210 
down together and then the feet together
both<00:01:57.329> hands<00:01:57.630> both<00:01:57.990> feet<00:01:58.259> both<00:01:58.590> hands<00:01:58.890> both

you'll find that your legs will

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
little bit and your hips will be higher
