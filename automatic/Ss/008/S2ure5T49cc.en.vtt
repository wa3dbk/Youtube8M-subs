recipe dawn that you created by the way

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.250 
recipe dawn that you created by the way
is<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.580> very<00:00:14.849> high<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.450> fiber<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.049> it

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
is that it's very high in fiber and it

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.620 
is that it's very high in fiber and it
has<00:00:16.379> two<00:00:16.619> types<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.039> fiber<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.910> also<00:00:18.119> gluten

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
has two types of fiber it's also gluten

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.359 
has two types of fiber it's also gluten
free<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.320> tastes<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.619> much<00:00:19.830> like<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> real

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
thing it's almost like a replacement for

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.410 
thing it's almost like a replacement for
the<00:00:22.980> bread<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.279> everybody<00:00:24.000> has<00:00:24.210> been

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the bread that everybody has been

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.269 
the bread that everybody has been
missing<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:25.050> let's<00:00:25.230> start<00:00:25.500> off<00:00:25.650> by<00:00:25.710> mixing

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
missing well let's start off by mixing

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
missing well let's start off by mixing
our<00:00:26.580> wet<00:00:26.730> ingredients<00:00:27.019> we're<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.140> going

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
our wet ingredients we're actually going

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
our wet ingredients we're actually going
to<00:00:28.560> demonstrate<00:00:28.800> weighing<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> gram

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to demonstrate weighing this on a gram

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
to demonstrate weighing this on a gram
scale<00:00:30.660> we've<00:00:31.439> pre-weighed<00:00:31.949> some<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.430> these

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
scale we've pre-weighed some of these

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970 
scale we've pre-weighed some of these
ingredients<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> few<00:00:34.620> tips<00:00:34.829> that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
ingredients but we have a few tips that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.310 
ingredients but we have a few tips that
we<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> share<00:00:35.670> first<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.690> being<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
we want to share first one being is

using a syringe to help weigh eggs eggs
can<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.180> tricky<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.660> weigh<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.649> all

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
can be a little tricky to weigh so all

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.020 
can be a little tricky to weigh so all
you<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:48.289> pull<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:50.129> transfer

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you do is pull it up and then transfer

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.689 
you do is pull it up and then transfer
it<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.809> bowl<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.520> weigh

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it to the bowl that you want to weigh

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.779 
it to the bowl that you want to weigh

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
grams do we need and this is 24 grams of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
grams do we need and this is 24 grams of
oil<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.439> seed<00:01:25.770> oil<00:01:26.009> like

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
oil and you can use a seed oil like

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.850 
oil and you can use a seed oil like
sunflower<00:01:27.119> oil<00:01:27.509> safflower<00:01:28.020> oil<00:01:28.380> walnut<00:01:29.100> oil

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.660 
sunflower oil safflower oil walnut oil
and<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.100> at<00:01:32.540> 23<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> half<00:01:34.670> you're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and you're at 23 and a half you're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.990 
and you're at 23 and a half you're
almost<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.390> 24<00:01:38.869> 24<00:01:39.869> grams<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.000> between

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
almost at 24 24 grams and between

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
almost at 24 24 grams and between
weighing<00:01:42.540> each<00:01:42.960> item<00:01:43.500> we're<00:01:43.619> tearing<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
weighing each item we're tearing the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.340 
weighing each item we're tearing the
scale<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> bring<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> back<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.090> zero<00:01:45.329> our<00:01:46.049> next

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
scale to bring it back to zero our next

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.149 
scale to bring it back to zero our next
ingredient<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.860> water<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:49.560> apple<00:01:50.009> cider

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
ingredient is water and then apple cider

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
ingredient is water and then apple cider
vinegar<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:52.140> acts<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.590> little

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
vinegar and this acts as a little

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010 
vinegar and this acts as a little
preservative<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.729> would<00:01:53.880> imagine<00:01:54.119> done<00:01:54.600> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
preservative I would imagine done it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.749 
preservative I would imagine done it
also<00:01:55.140> helps<00:01:55.619> cut<00:01:55.920> through<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.460> strong

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
also helps cut through the strong

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.179 
also helps cut through the strong
flavors<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.719> flax<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.740> psyllium

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
flavors of the flax and the psyllium

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.940 
flavors of the flax and the psyllium
husk<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> good<00:02:00.930> little<00:02:01.140> acid<00:02:01.770> to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
husk so this is a good little acid to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.100 
husk so this is a good little acid to
help<00:02:02.159> bring<00:02:02.909> those<00:02:03.090> flavors<00:02:03.270> forward<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
help bring those flavors forward a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.100 
help bring those flavors forward a
little<00:02:04.340> okay<00:02:05.340> okay<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.210> mix<00:02:06.899> this

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
little okay okay so we just mix this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.809 
little okay okay so we just mix this
together<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.310> start<00:02:08.610> adding

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
together and then we can start adding

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.290 
together and then we can start adding
the<00:02:09.179> dry<00:02:09.209> ingredients<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.190> we've<00:02:11.340> got<00:02:11.610> 13

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the dry ingredients so we've got 13

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.170 
the dry ingredients so we've got 13
grams<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.900> Flex<00:02:13.200> meal<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:15.000> is

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
grams of Flex meal and this is

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.290 
grams of Flex meal and this is
essentially<00:02:15.989> ground<00:02:16.319> flax<00:02:16.770> seeds<00:02:17.090> very<00:02:18.090> high

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
essentially ground flax seeds very high

essentially ground flax seeds very high
in<00:02:18.360> fiber<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.989> mentioned<00:02:19.440> also<00:02:19.650> source<00:02:20.129> of

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
in fiber as I mentioned also source of

in fiber as I mentioned also source of
omega-3<00:02:20.790> fatty<00:02:21.030> acids<00:02:23.030> then<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:24.569> 12

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
omega-3 fatty acids then we have 12

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.190 
omega-3 fatty acids then we have 12
grams<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.650> psyllium<00:02:26.160> husks<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.930> is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
grams of psyllium husks and this is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.180 
grams of psyllium husks and this is
ground<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.459> psyllium<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.010> whole

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
ground of psyllium this is the whole

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.360 
ground of psyllium this is the whole
variety<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.849> also<00:02:33.060> comes<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.870> powder<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.500> it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
variety it also comes in a powder and it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.970 
variety it also comes in a powder and it
will<00:02:35.580> look<00:02:36.030> more<00:02:36.300> like<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> fine<00:02:37.080> baking<00:02:37.680> powder

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
will look more like a fine baking powder

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.600 
will look more like a fine baking powder
consistency<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.810> whole<00:02:40.019> version<00:02:40.950> or<00:02:41.160> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
consistency but the whole version or the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.000 
consistency but the whole version or the
powder<00:02:41.790> version<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.450> perfectly<00:02:43.110> acceptable

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
powder version is perfectly acceptable

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.600 
powder version is perfectly acceptable
as<00:02:44.370> always<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:45.390> tear<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:47.340> we're<00:02:47.489> ready

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
as always we tear and then we're ready

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.220 
as always we tear and then we're ready
for<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:47.940> next<00:02:48.090> ingredient<00:02:48.690> which<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.989> one

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
for the next ingredient which is one

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.190 
for the next ingredient which is one
gram<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.769> baking<00:02:50.220> powder<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:53.569> then<00:02:54.569> one<00:02:54.930> gram

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
gram of baking powder and then one gram

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.729 
gram of baking powder and then one gram
let's<00:02:55.470> tear<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.769> again<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.430> add<00:02:57.030> our<00:02:57.739> baking

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
let's tear it again and add our baking

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.920 
let's tear it again and add our baking
soda<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.730> also<00:02:59.940> one<00:03:00.659> gram<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:03.629> final

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
soda this is also one gram and the final

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.199 
soda this is also one gram and the final
ingredient<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.470> just<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.769> pinch<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.099> salt<00:03:05.340> and

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
ingredient is just a pinch of salt and

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.960 
ingredient is just a pinch of salt and
again<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.230> acts<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.709> preservative<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.700> it

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
again this acts as a preservative and it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.710 
again this acts as a preservative and it
just<00:03:09.209> brings<00:03:09.390> out<00:03:09.599> flavors<00:03:10.200> okay

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.200 

so<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.320> next<00:03:14.530> step<00:03:14.830> with<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.190> recipe<00:03:15.490> is<00:03:15.970> to

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
so the next step with this recipe is to

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.850 
so the next step with this recipe is to
make<00:03:16.450> sure<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.720> all<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.410> these<00:03:17.560> ingredients

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
make sure that all of these ingredients

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.640 
make sure that all of these ingredients
are<00:03:18.520> thoroughly<00:03:18.880> mixed<00:03:19.480> together<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:20.470> will

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
are thoroughly mixed together it will

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.860 
are thoroughly mixed together it will
not<00:03:21.250> look<00:03:21.550> like<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.850> bread<00:03:22.180> dough<00:03:22.210> that<00:03:22.720> you're

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
not look like a bread dough that you're

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.710 
not look like a bread dough that you're
used<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.290> seeing<00:03:23.730> what's<00:03:24.730> gonna<00:03:24.880> happen<00:03:25.420> is

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
used to seeing what's gonna happen is

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.990 
used to seeing what's gonna happen is
the<00:03:26.080> psyllium<00:03:26.590> husk<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.190> going<00:03:27.490> to<00:03:27.670> begin<00:03:27.820> to

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
the psyllium husk is going to begin to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.220 
the psyllium husk is going to begin to
absorb<00:03:28.810> all<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.210> water<00:03:31.210> that<00:03:31.360> we've<00:03:31.960> added

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
absorb all of the water that we've added

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.310 
absorb all of the water that we've added
and<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.800> oil<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.640> it's<00:03:34.330> going<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.750> begin<00:03:34.990> to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
and the oil and it's going to begin to

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.090 
and the oil and it's going to begin to
thicken<00:03:35.650> up<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.360> going<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:38.040> need<00:03:39.040> to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
thicken up so this is going to need to

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.240 
thicken up so this is going to need to
sit<00:03:39.580> for<00:03:40.000> about<00:03:40.180> five<00:03:40.690> minutes<00:03:40.990> to<00:03:41.350> reach<00:03:41.710> the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
sit for about five minutes to reach the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.780 
sit for about five minutes to reach the
right<00:03:42.820> thickness<00:03:43.570> for<00:03:43.900> us<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.410> able<00:03:44.560> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
right thickness for us to be able to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.280 
right thickness for us to be able to
pick<00:03:45.790> up<00:03:45.820> this<00:03:46.180> dough<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.480> shape<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.110> into

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
pick up this dough and shape it into

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.520 
pick up this dough and shape it into
little<00:03:48.070> roll<00:03:48.400> shapes<00:03:48.760> if<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.630> let<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:49.870> sit<00:03:50.200> too

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
little roll shapes if you let it sit too

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.550 
little roll shapes if you let it sit too
long<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.640> will<00:03:51.850> actually<00:03:52.450> release<00:03:52.630> all<00:03:53.110> of<00:03:53.380> the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
long it will actually release all of the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.830 
long it will actually release all of the
oil<00:03:53.800> and<00:03:53.980> then<00:03:54.640> you'll<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.210> to<00:03:55.270> start<00:03:55.660> over

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
oil and then you'll have to start over

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.900 
oil and then you'll have to start over
again<00:03:56.020> so<00:03:56.500> make<00:03:56.740> sure<00:03:56.770> that<00:03:57.010> your<00:03:57.340> oven<00:03:57.370> was

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
again so make sure that your oven was

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.940 
again so make sure that your oven was
preheated<00:03:57.940> before<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:59.230> started<00:03:59.710> mixing

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
preheated before you started mixing

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.740 
preheated before you started mixing
