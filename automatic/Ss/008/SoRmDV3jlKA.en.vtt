00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.009
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.540
 make a roll in and macaci so for 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.990
 some who is not English has 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.300
 passed the free running so already there is 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.040
 two are rolling at speeds and launched 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.350
 two wheels there are four elements in 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.510
 everything that will make you go 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.980
 to have pain so I show you all the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.180
 roulades that are not good 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.240
 the second I could not the sphere 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.090
 question of lack of space these parties 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.329
 have already turned in roulade it's a good 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.130
 taste at least there so if you arrive 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.500
 euros is to understand us or 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.660
 suffered terral committee head 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.129
 this is the head that will take and I 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.410
 do not need to explain to you when 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:50.100
 you are not stupid and we leave you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.050
 so it's gone so you have to go 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.199
 well I hope that like that his head to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.730
 price is to contain the crowd so is 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.379
 the second is actually it is I pose 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.570
 so I'm not going where the farm like the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.980
 says if I propose clothes at night 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.689
 So when you go to see this is the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.110
 speed you arrive technical and after 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.960
 it's same style the already hockey that are 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.080
 speed is better than the first 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.630
 but here's the one after you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 do it she will be there again so of the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.369
 blow his wrists the nape and back which 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.409
 will take expensive 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.990
 so that's why you can 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 avoid this after you hurt yourself so 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.979
 the roulade that I showed you there is 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.450
 two ways the sphere of the way 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.250
 right-handed and left-handed 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.600
 it does not change it's just the side that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.130
 change it's gone I want to make a 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.130
 roulette presentation what it is 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:54.549
 so now the details so you 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.259
 put your hand or place of arms was 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.969
 so to turn right there the place 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.299
 is laid left hand that goes under the 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.679
 arm as soon as he started to leave and 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.319
 as you start reading the floor yourself 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:13.430
 have to remove hands they will you 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:20.209
 go away so that gave that must want 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:22.790
 do because I missed it this one 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.250
 was perfect so she got it after 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.860
 for left-handers that's how the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.310
 same thing two senses a hand thrust 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.129
 left that is posed because the right which at 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.099
 leave and as soon as you approach 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:40.099
 propose the left hand on this shot that 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.519
 will require you to cushion the shock 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.950
 she fat and mango I'm already going to me 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.430
 retired but not long after that his 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.319
 to amortize there one is to withdraw before him 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.209
 ensuring afterwards it's all 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.180
 body that will be almost a ball that 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.669
 will amortize everything so I hope this 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.269
 video will serve you for men 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:03.099
