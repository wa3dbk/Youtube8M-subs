was<00:00:23.749> looking<00:00:24.140> for<00:00:24.499> a<00:00:24.529> data<00:00:25.039> card<00:00:25.400> that<00:00:25.849> has<00:00:26.119> the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
was looking for a data card that has the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.249 
was looking for a data card that has the
software<00:00:26.960> built<00:00:27.650> into<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:29.210> device<00:00:29.419> so<00:00:29.960> this

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
software built into the device so this

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.839 
software built into the device so this
way<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:30.499> don't<00:00:30.769> have<00:00:30.949> to<00:00:31.099> download<00:00:31.279> something

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
way you don't have to download something

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.720 
way you don't have to download something
you<00:00:32.780> could<00:00:32.960> just<00:00:32.989> put<00:00:33.380> it<00:00:33.470> in<00:00:33.590> any<00:00:33.800> laptop<00:00:34.430> and

you could just put it in any laptop and
boom<00:00:35.180> you're<00:00:35.690> you're<00:00:36.140> ready<00:00:36.470> to<00:00:36.650> go<00:00:36.830> and<00:00:37.330> as

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
physically I don't like about this card

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.510 
physically I don't like about this card
is<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.179> this<00:01:20.420> red<00:01:21.229> light<00:01:21.469> always<00:01:21.890> shines

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
is that this red light always shines

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.120 
is that this red light always shines
with<00:01:22.789> some<00:01:22.969> LED<00:01:23.479> light<00:01:23.749> it's<00:01:24.140> not<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.799> real

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
with some LED light it's not a real

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.300 
with some LED light it's not a real
status<00:01:25.789> light<00:01:26.149> it<00:01:26.450> just<00:01:26.780> as<00:01:27.109> long<00:01:27.319> as<00:01:27.469> as<00:01:28.069> soon

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
status light it just as long as as soon

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.039 
status light it just as long as as soon
as<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.579> plug<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.390> shines<00:01:30.229> red<00:01:30.649> and<00:01:32.049> the

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
as you plug it in it shines red and the

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.620 
as you plug it in it shines red and the
status<00:01:33.590> light<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:34.039> actually<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.729> one<00:01:34.789> which

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
status light is actually this one which

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.129 
status light is actually this one which
turns<00:01:36.590> green<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.729> believe<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.179> also<00:01:38.299> blinks

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:39.139 
turns green and I believe it also blinks

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:43.270 
turns green and I believe it also blinks
when<00:01:39.380> there's<00:01:39.679> some<00:01:40.009> data<00:01:40.420> transfers<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:42.740> this

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
when there's some data transfers so this

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.669 
when there's some data transfers so this
also<00:01:43.490> pivots<00:01:46.329> nicely<00:01:47.329> built<00:01:47.569> you<00:01:48.079> know<00:01:48.109> you

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
also pivots nicely built you know you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.859 
also pivots nicely built you know you
put<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:48.950> like<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.549> can<00:01:49.579> rotate<00:01:50.539> it

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
put it like this you can rotate it

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.520 
put it like this you can rotate it
whatever<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.380> want<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.780> thing<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.319> I

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
whatever you want and the thing is I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.020 
whatever you want and the thing is I
think<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.979> people<00:01:55.280> actually<00:01:55.490> don't<00:01:55.909> know

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
think that people actually don't know

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.760 
think that people actually don't know
how<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.350> use<00:01:57.350> it

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
how to use it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.959 
how to use it
so<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.109> is<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.039> only<00:02:01.159> thing<00:02:01.789> that

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
so that that that is the only thing that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.389 
so that that that is the only thing that
I<00:02:01.999> I<00:02:02.090> believe<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:03.139> is<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.770> reason<00:02:03.889> why<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.189> got

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
I I believe that is the reason why I got

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.059 
I I believe that is the reason why I got
bad<00:02:04.609> reviews<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.090> let<00:02:05.240> me<00:02:05.329> show<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:05.920> how<00:02:06.920> it

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
bad reviews so let me show you how it

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.580 
bad reviews so let me show you how it
actually<00:02:07.100> works<00:02:07.729> I'll<00:02:08.479> connect<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.200> my<00:02:09.380> laptop

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
actually works I'll connect to my laptop

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.860 
actually works I'll connect to my laptop
and<00:02:10.069> we'll<00:02:10.580> get<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.060> alright<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.720> one

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
and we'll get to it alright so the one

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.420 
and we'll get to it alright so the one
thing<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.230> one<00:02:12.349> reason<00:02:12.739> I<00:02:12.830> think<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.159> people

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
thing the one reason I think that people

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.290 
thing the one reason I think that people
don't<00:02:13.700> know<00:02:13.909> how<00:02:14.120> to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
don't know how to

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.440 
don't know how to
use<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.810> because<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.920> says<00:02:16.160> right<00:02:16.400> there<00:02:16.450> to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
use it is because it says right there to

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.220 
use it is because it says right there to

and<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> feeling<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:23.900> people<00:02:24.260> don't

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
and I have a feeling that people don't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.590 
and I have a feeling that people don't
really<00:02:24.680> realize<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.820> huh<00:02:26.150> that's<00:02:26.510> how

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
really realize that that huh that's how

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.720 
really realize that that huh that's how
it<00:02:26.870> works<00:02:27.080> also<00:02:27.650> they<00:02:28.010> put<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.550> wrong

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
it works also they put it on the wrong

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.010 
it works also they put it on the wrong
side<00:02:29.030> they<00:02:29.240> should<00:02:29.390> have<00:02:29.480> put<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:29.750> sticker

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
side they should have put this sticker

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.440 
side they should have put this sticker
on<00:02:30.380> this<00:02:31.100> side<00:02:31.370> because<00:02:31.550> when<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:31.880> plug<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.300> in

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
on this side because when you plug it in

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.600 
on this side because when you plug it in
you<00:02:33.020> usually<00:02:33.140> plug<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.740> like<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.340> this

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
you usually plug it like this and this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.060 
you usually plug it like this and this
is<00:02:34.850> visible<00:02:35.270> from<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.660> side<00:02:35.900> all<00:02:36.680> right<00:02:36.800> so

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
is visible from this side all right so

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.010 
is visible from this side all right so
let<00:02:37.220> me<00:02:37.250> plug<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:37.670> in<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.450> let<00:02:38.660> me<00:02:38.810> just

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
let me plug it in and let me just

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.320 
let me plug it in and let me just
remember<00:02:39.290> what<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.860> address<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.370> it's<00:02:40.760> mbb

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330

right so we're gonna let the drivers do

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.360 
right so we're gonna let the drivers do
the<00:02:57.530> installation<00:02:58.340> now<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.130> have<00:03:01.250> an

internet sharing device at this point I

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:23.680 
internet sharing device at this point I
would<00:03:13.760> just<00:03:13.790> recommend<00:03:16.780> removing<00:03:17.780> it

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:32.320 

and<00:03:23.780> then<00:03:24.410> doing<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.830> search<00:03:25.040> again

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:40.600 

as<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.660> see<00:03:33.900> now<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.830> doesn't<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.310> that

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.190 

error

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.550 

so<00:03:45.770> at<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.040> point<00:03:46.660> we<00:03:47.660> can<00:03:47.840> go<00:03:47.870> ahead<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.440> that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
so at this point we can go ahead to that

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.410 
so at this point we can go ahead to that
website<00:03:49.069> the<00:03:49.310> mbb<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:50.000> VZW<00:03:50.390> calm<00:03:51.020> and<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:53.180> we

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
website the mbb that VZW calm and you we

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.760 
website the mbb that VZW calm and you we
could<00:03:53.599> either<00:03:53.870> use<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.910> basic<00:03:55.910> app<00:03:56.090> which

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
could either use the basic app which

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.390 
could either use the basic app which
which<00:03:57.770> doesn't<00:03:58.160> have<00:03:58.340> any<00:03:59.030> installation

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
which doesn't have any installation

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.830 
which doesn't have any installation
requirement<00:04:01.400> we<00:04:01.520> can<00:04:01.880> use<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.150> enhanced<00:04:02.510> app

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
requirement we can use the enhanced app

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.960 
requirement we can use the enhanced app
which<00:04:03.500> basically<00:04:03.860> will<00:04:04.160> install<00:04:04.550> the

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
which basically will install the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.290 
which basically will install the
application<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:06.760> let's<00:04:07.760> go<00:04:07.910> ahead<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.180> do

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
application so let's go ahead and do

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.070 
application so let's go ahead and do
that<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.670> went<00:04:13.819> ahead<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.630> started

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
that so it went ahead and it started

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.780 
that so it went ahead and it started
downloading<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.769> this<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.340> all<00:04:16.489> without

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
downloading and this is all without

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.640 
downloading and this is all without
internet<00:04:17.180> connection<00:04:17.239> it's<00:04:17.810> pulling<00:04:18.200> it<00:04:18.350> from

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
internet connection it's pulling it from

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:28.000 
internet connection it's pulling it from
the<00:04:18.799> device<00:04:19.700> itself<00:04:26.560> we're<00:04:27.560> gonna<00:04:27.680> go<00:04:27.919> ahead

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
the device itself we're gonna go ahead

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:42.260 
the device itself we're gonna go ahead
and<00:04:28.310> install<00:04:28.610> it

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.559 

and<00:04:42.870> right<00:04:43.050> now<00:04:43.229> this<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.759> actual

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.610 

application<00:04:48.569> so<00:04:48.870> as<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.139> can<00:04:49.259> see<00:04:49.470> it's

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
application so as you can see it's

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.670 
application so as you can see it's
outside<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:53.060> view<00:04:54.060> from<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.300> browser<00:04:54.680> now

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
outside of the view from the browser now

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.580 
outside of the view from the browser now
the<00:04:56.039> nice<00:04:56.220> thing<00:04:56.250> about<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:58.349> the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
the nice thing about it is that in the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:08.240 
the nice thing about it is that in the
setup<00:04:58.860> you<00:05:05.060> can<00:05:06.060> tell<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.110> auto<00:05:07.530> connect<00:05:08.009> as

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
setup you can tell it to auto connect as

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.400 
setup you can tell it to auto connect as
soon<00:05:08.550> as<00:05:08.699> you<00:05:08.819> plug<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.240> in<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.990> will<00:05:10.169> auto

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
soon as you plug it in it will auto

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:28.869 
soon as you plug it in it will auto
connect<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:11.310> let's<00:05:11.490> do<00:05:11.669> a<00:05:11.699> quick<00:05:12.000> Gatsby<00:05:12.599> test

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.059 

and<00:05:29.539> as<00:05:29.809> you<00:05:29.929> can<00:05:30.050> see<00:05:30.110> it's<00:05:30.409> a<00:05:30.499> verizon

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
and as you can see it's a verizon

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:39.459 
and as you can see it's a verizon
wireless<00:05:31.099> network<00:05:37.599> excellent<00:05:38.599> speeds<00:05:38.959> where

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:39.469 
wireless network excellent speeds where

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.019 
wireless network excellent speeds where
we're<00:05:39.800> getting<00:05:39.919> like<00:05:40.219> 2<00:05:40.429> megabytes<00:05:40.879> per

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
we're getting like 2 megabytes per

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:47.919 
we're getting like 2 megabytes per
second<00:05:41.599> 2<00:05:41.869> megabytes<00:05:42.469> per<00:05:42.830> second<00:05:45.399> and<00:05:46.929> the

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:47.929 
second 2 megabytes per second and the

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:51.579 
second 2 megabytes per second and the
upload<00:05:48.169> speed<00:05:48.559> is<00:05:49.689> faster<00:05:50.689> than<00:05:50.839> my<00:05:51.139> home

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:51.589 
upload speed is faster than my home

00:05:51.589 --> 00:06:03.579 
upload speed is faster than my home
network<00:05:58.119> so<00:05:59.119> this<00:05:59.300> is<00:05:59.449> about<00:06:01.809> 550<00:06:02.809> kilobytes

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
network so this is about 550 kilobytes

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:07.239 
network so this is about 550 kilobytes
per<00:06:03.889> second<00:06:05.199> faster<00:06:06.199> than<00:06:06.529> my<00:06:06.830> home<00:06:07.069> network

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249 
per second faster than my home network

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.949 
per second faster than my home network
it's<00:06:07.669> pretty<00:06:08.089> annoying<00:06:08.300> actually

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:08.959 
it's pretty annoying actually

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:14.230 
it's pretty annoying actually
and<00:06:10.119> I<00:06:11.119> have<00:06:11.269> a<00:06:11.300> cable<00:06:11.959> service<00:06:12.849> so<00:06:13.849> as<00:06:13.879> you<00:06:14.119> can

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:17.209 
see it's a really awesome device let me

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.790 
see it's a really awesome device let me
let<00:06:17.419> me<00:06:17.449> show<00:06:17.659> you<00:06:17.719> again<00:06:18.019> what<00:06:18.199> happens<00:06:18.589> when

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
let me show you again what happens when

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.509 
let me show you again what happens when
I<00:06:18.849> disconnected<00:06:19.849> I<00:06:20.029> disconnected<00:06:21.019> it

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:24.519 

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:30.119 

obviously<00:06:25.519> if<00:06:25.729> I<00:06:25.879> do<00:06:27.219> test<00:06:28.219> nothing<00:06:29.119> happens

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:30.129 
obviously if I do test nothing happens

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:33.009 
obviously if I do test nothing happens
if<00:06:31.129> I<00:06:31.249> connect<00:06:31.639> it<00:06:31.909> again<00:06:32.029> it's<00:06:32.869> gonna

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:33.019 
if I connect it again it's gonna

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:37.199 
if I connect it again it's gonna
automatically<00:06:34.389> connect<00:06:35.389> me<00:06:35.569> to<00:06:35.599> the<00:06:35.839> network

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:37.209 
automatically connect me to the network

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:40.230 
automatically connect me to the network
and<00:06:38.209> as<00:06:38.449> soon<00:06:38.719> as<00:06:38.869> I<00:06:38.990> see<00:06:39.229> that<00:06:39.409> this<00:06:39.589> is<00:06:39.860> green

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
and as soon as I see that this is green

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:50.060 
and as soon as I see that this is green
we're<00:06:41.240> good

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.880 

and<00:06:50.850> if<00:06:51.000> that<00:06:51.180> doesn't<00:06:51.630> happen<00:06:51.780> you<00:06:52.710> can

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
and if that doesn't happen you can

00:06:52.890 --> 00:07:00.620 
and if that doesn't happen you can
always<00:06:53.040> go<00:06:53.490> to<00:06:55.220> the<00:06:58.400> now<00:06:59.400> it<00:06:59.790> turned<00:07:00.180> out<00:07:00.330> green

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
always go to the now it turned out green

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.330 
always go to the now it turned out green
so<00:07:00.870> let's<00:07:01.050> let's<00:07:01.740> test<00:07:01.980> it<00:07:02.190> out<00:07:04.130> there<00:07:05.130> you<00:07:05.220> go

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
so let's let's test it out there you go

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.370 
so let's let's test it out there you go
so<00:07:05.850> I<00:07:05.880> took<00:07:05.970> it<00:07:06.180> a<00:07:06.210> little<00:07:06.300> while<00:07:06.660> but<00:07:06.900> it

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
so I took it a little while but it

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.590 
so I took it a little while but it
connected<00:07:07.830> automatically<00:07:08.520> all<00:07:09.330> right<00:07:09.450> so

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 
connected automatically all right so

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.060 
connected automatically all right so
