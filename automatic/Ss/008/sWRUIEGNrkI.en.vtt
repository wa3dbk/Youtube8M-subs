00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.500
 good morning i'm irina senchukova and this 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.510
 Maykop rubric 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.610
 today we will look at what 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.400
 should be in each cosmetic bag 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.020
 girls all known situations when u 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.750
 you cosmetic bags a lot of money 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.279
 we do not use new ones sometimes 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.949
 give in to the advice of friends 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.900
 sometimes we buy our feet 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.239
 offer magazines or televisions 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.640
 a dismal result we spent a lot 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.920
 money and make up anyway nothing 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.589
 let's consider what should be in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.600
 every girl's pouch for that I 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.150
 asked her friend to bring her 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.430
 cosmetic bag and we'll see what's in 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:57.280
 purse of the girl and her little 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:00.280
 consider and complement so start with 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.470
 most important cosmetics first 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.270
 There should be a base for makeup and 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.189
 about my girlfriend i don't see her but this 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.080
 really a bug base under makeup 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:16.659
 there should be a base under makeup 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.850
 different they come in different colors 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.679
 why do we need different colors in order 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.439
 to correct some problem 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.149
 for example, a green base under makeup we 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.030
 use to neutralize 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.609
 red complexion purple for 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.590
 to mask the pigment spots but 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.579
 you do not worry color it will 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.859
 only in tube 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.829
 on your skin, it will simply equalize 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:41.140
 if you have no particular skin problems i 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.299
 I recommend you take a transparent vase a 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.149
 on a beautiful level it is a face relief 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.900
 makes your skin radiant as well 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.700

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.430
 they are also completely different to you 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.550
 need to pick up tonal resources 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.750
 according to skin type 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:11.230
 the next product you should 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:14.710
 be this concealer concealer and corrector and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.130
 for anti chamois what is the difference correctors 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:23.160

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:27.520

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.700

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.300
 areas under the eyes as well as nasolabial 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.690
 folds 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.220
 they have a thinner texture than 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.290
 corrector from dense jars 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.250
