pretty damned amazing but the main
reason<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.860> overpowered<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:54.770> because

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
reason it's overpowered is because

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.020

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
especially when it comes to stealth it's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.000

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
when they should and it becomes a little

when they should and it becomes a little
silly<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.880> were<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> few<00:01:12.240> fights<00:01:12.510> where<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
silly there were a few fights where I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.980 
silly there were a few fights where I
knew<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.909> spotted<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.780> lot

of trouble but the sometimes when they
didn't<00:01:18.270> spot<00:01:18.540> me<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.869> kind<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.290> comical<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
didn't spot me was kind of comical and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
didn't spot me was kind of comical and
it's<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> AI<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.200> game<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.530> just

is atrocious even though I've made it

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.070 
is atrocious even though I've made it
harder<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.159> stealthy<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:27.420> still<00:01:27.810> too

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
harder to be stealthy it's still too

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.450 
harder to be stealthy it's still too

from<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:56.100> would<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.810> made<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.500> be

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
from it would be made it would just be

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.429 
from it would be made it would just be
amazing<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.460> obvious<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.630> from<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.049> realism

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
amazing the obvious so from a realism

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.920 
amazing the obvious so from a realism
point<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.009> view<00:02:02.159> weapons<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:03.180> out

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
point of view weapons like this are out

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.429 
point of view weapons like this are out
anyway<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.360> I'm<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.570> stop<00:02:06.780> using<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.170> for

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
anyway so I'm going to stop using it for

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.350 
anyway so I'm going to stop using it for
four<00:02:07.829> because<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.670> overpowered<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.239> not

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
four because it's overpowered and not

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360 
four because it's overpowered and not
realistic<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.410> second<00:02:10.739> reason<00:02:10.830> I'm<00:02:11.039> going<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
realistic the second reason I'm going to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.240 
realistic the second reason I'm going to
start<00:02:11.520> using<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.819> Irish

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
start using is Irish

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.200 
start using is Irish
don't<00:02:12.460> like<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.770> do<00:02:14.770> light<00:02:15.160> weapons<00:02:15.550> that

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.910 
suit their style the western style most
of<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> weapons<00:02:21.400> i<00:02:21.670> use<00:02:22.030> suit<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:23.350> western

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
of the weapons i use suit the western

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.970 
of the weapons i use suit the western

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
style even the anti-material rifle which

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.930 
style even the anti-material rifle which
is<00:02:27.130> not<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:28.030> isn't<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.420> Western<00:02:28.870> weapon<00:02:29.940> somehow

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
is not it isn't a Western weapon somehow

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.750 
is not it isn't a Western weapon somehow
is<00:02:31.390> closer<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:33.570> this<00:02:34.570> style<00:02:35.340> than<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.520> thing

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
is closer to this style than this thing

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.790 
is closer to this style than this thing
this<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.360> very<00:02:37.510> space<00:02:37.870> aid<00:02:38.170> very<00:02:38.470> blade

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
this is just very space aid very blade

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.540 
this is just very space aid very blade
runner<00:02:39.190> um<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:41.890> doesn't<00:02:42.160> make<00:02:42.310> it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
runner um so it just doesn't make it

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.970 
runner um so it just doesn't make it
just<00:02:42.760> does<00:02:43.000> not<00:02:43.150> fix<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.660> style<00:02:43.930> i've<00:02:44.560> been

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
just does not fix the style i've been

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.530 
just does not fix the style i've been
i've<00:02:45.640> been<00:02:45.700> using<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.180> because<00:02:46.270> it's

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
i've been using it because it's

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.790 
i've been using it because it's
convenient<00:02:46.840> because<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.290> powerful<00:02:47.590> and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
convenient because it's powerful and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.560 
convenient because it's powerful and
it's<00:02:48.489> just<00:02:48.640> all<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> wrong<00:02:49.090> reasons<00:02:49.450> for

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
it's just all the wrong reasons for

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.870 
it's just all the wrong reasons for
using<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.080> i'm<00:02:50.170> gonna<00:02:50.380> drop<00:02:50.709> this<00:02:50.980> i<00:02:51.250> think

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
using it so i'm gonna drop this i think

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.860 
using it so i'm gonna drop this i think
it's<00:02:52.000> going<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.209> make<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.480> lot<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.690> missions

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
it's going to make a lot of missions

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.290 
it's going to make a lot of missions
like<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.380> ones<00:02:53.530> i'm<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:53.800> now<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:54.280> lot<00:02:54.760> harder

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
like the ones i'm on now a lot harder

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.570 
like the ones i'm on now a lot harder
and<00:02:55.720> I'm<00:02:56.200> okay<00:02:56.380> with<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.100> I'm<00:02:57.220> sure<00:02:57.400> you

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.920 
guys are as well I'm sure you'd be a lot
happier<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.030> enemies<00:03:01.330> see<00:03:01.540> me<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.870> I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
happier if the enemies see me and I

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.620 
happier if the enemies see me and I
actually<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.590> fight<00:03:02.860> them<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.340> lot<00:03:04.090> more<00:03:04.360> I

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
actually have to fight them a lot more I

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.600 
actually have to fight them a lot more I
mean<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.080> could<00:03:05.260> still<00:03:05.470> use<00:03:05.500> stealth<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.459> can

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
mean I could still use stealth I can

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.900 
mean I could still use stealth I can
still<00:03:06.820> use<00:03:07.180> stealth<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:08.020> I<00:03:08.610> will<00:03:09.610> have<00:03:09.790> to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
still use stealth but I will have to

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.729 
still use stealth but I will have to
stay<00:03:10.090> out<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.209> combat<00:03:10.570> whilst<00:03:11.020> doing<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.500> or<00:03:11.709> at

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
stay out of combat whilst doing so or at

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.520 
stay out of combat whilst doing so or at
least<00:03:12.070> use<00:03:12.480> melee<00:03:13.480> weapons<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.110> get<00:03:14.200> up<00:03:14.290> very

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
least use melee weapons and get up very

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.830 
least use melee weapons and get up very
very<00:03:14.680> close<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.610> i<00:03:15.670> could<00:03:15.850> use<00:03:16.030> stealth<00:03:16.330> sneak

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
very close so i could use stealth sneak

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.620 
very close so i could use stealth sneak
in<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.049> place<00:03:17.310> use<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.489> terminals<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.180> turn<00:03:19.360> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
in a place use the terminals to turn the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.780 
in a place use the terminals to turn the
robots<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.170> everyone<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:21.010> if<00:03:21.130> i<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.610> get

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
robots and everyone but if i have to get

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.190 
robots and everyone but if i have to get
past<00:03:22.030> two<00:03:22.150> or<00:03:22.180> three<00:03:22.299> people<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.750> get<00:03:22.959> there

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
past two or three people to get there

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.910 
past two or three people to get there
it's<00:03:23.410> going<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.799> be<00:03:23.920> tough<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.690> anyway<00:03:26.320> thought

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
it's going to be tough so anyway thought

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.310 
it's going to be tough so anyway thought
I'd<00:03:27.070> just<00:03:27.220> tell<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.600> next<00:03:29.200> time

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
I'd just tell you that so that next time

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.560 
I'd just tell you that so that next time
when<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:29.799> see<00:03:30.220> me<00:03:30.459> running<00:03:31.090> around<00:03:31.150> without

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
when you see me running around without

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.810 
when you see me running around without
this<00:03:32.260> weapon<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.100> understand<00:03:33.910> why
