you

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.470 

you

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.020 

we<00:00:12.290> can<00:00:12.410> always<00:00:12.559> dream<00:00:13.309> of<00:00:13.370> what<00:00:13.639> what<00:00:13.849> could

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
we can always dream of what what could

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.420 
we can always dream of what what could
have<00:00:14.119> been<00:00:14.240> but<00:00:14.539> I<00:00:15.070> personally<00:00:16.070> feel<00:00:16.369> that

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
have been but I personally feel that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.910 
have been but I personally feel that
even<00:00:17.359> even<00:00:17.930> if<00:00:17.990> we<00:00:18.080> didn't<00:00:18.289> have<00:00:18.320> traffic<00:00:18.680> it

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
even even if we didn't have traffic it

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.990 
even even if we didn't have traffic it
would<00:00:19.009> have<00:00:19.099> been<00:00:19.189> very<00:00:19.250> difficult<00:00:19.640> to<00:00:19.880> be

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
would have been very difficult to be

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.839 
would have been very difficult to be
Sebastian<00:00:20.810> I<00:00:21.230> think<00:00:22.039> they<00:00:22.160> were<00:00:22.220> looking

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
Sebastian I think they were looking

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.370 
Sebastian I think they were looking
after<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.390> car<00:00:23.599> a<00:00:23.630> little<00:00:23.840> bit<00:00:23.930> towards<00:00:24.140> into

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
after the car a little bit towards into

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.260 
after the car a little bit towards into
the<00:00:24.470> race<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:24.980> even<00:00:25.579> though<00:00:25.669> I<00:00:25.699> pace<00:00:25.910> was<00:00:26.090> very

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
the race and even though I pace was very

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.120 
the race and even though I pace was very
very<00:00:26.390> good<00:00:26.630> I<00:00:26.930> don't<00:00:27.710> think<00:00:27.859> we<00:00:27.949> could<00:00:28.099> have

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
very good I don't think we could have

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.040 
very good I don't think we could have
really<00:00:28.670> had<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.000> go<00:00:29.119> in<00:00:29.359> I<00:00:29.539> think<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.869> team's

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
really had to go in I think the team's

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.599 
really had to go in I think the team's
done<00:00:30.230> a<00:00:30.259> great<00:00:30.470> job<00:00:30.500> would<00:00:30.980> mean<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.250> are<00:00:31.400> their

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
done a great job would mean we are their

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.640 
done a great job would mean we are their
second<00:00:32.509> quick<00:00:32.660> his<00:00:32.780> team<00:00:32.989> we've<00:00:33.230> been

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
second quick his team we've been

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.160 
second quick his team we've been
massively<00:00:34.220> competitive<00:00:34.790> in<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.780> last<00:00:35.960> couple

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170

the charity or whatever happens is you
know<00:00:53.090> it<00:00:53.690> always<00:00:53.930> got<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.230> do<00:00:54.320> is<00:00:54.440> get<00:00:54.530> one<00:00:54.680> more

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
know it always got to do is get one more

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.770 
know it always got to do is get one more
point<00:00:55.070> but<00:00:55.460> we're<00:00:56.180> working<00:00:56.329> as<00:00:56.539> hard<00:00:56.570> as<00:00:56.719> we

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
point but we're working as hard as we

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.779 
point but we're working as hard as we
can<00:00:57.019> to<00:00:57.079> really<00:00:57.410> challenge<00:00:57.829> Sebastian<00:00:58.460> rebel

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
can to really challenge Sebastian rebel

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.299 
can to really challenge Sebastian rebel
and<00:00:58.910> I<00:00:58.969> think<00:00:59.210> I<00:00:59.620> think<00:01:00.620> there's<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.829> there's<00:01:01.250> a

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
and I think I think there's a there's a

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.500 
and I think I think there's a there's a
win<00:01:01.460> round<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.730> corner

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.020 

I<00:01:08.690> love<00:01:09.500> going<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.800> Japan<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:10.550> a<00:01:10.700> beautiful

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
place and considering they've had some

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.550 
place and considering they've had some
seriously<00:01:14.390> difficult<00:01:14.810> time<00:01:14.990> recently<00:01:15.380> I

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
seriously difficult time recently I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.460 
seriously difficult time recently I
think<00:01:15.890> hopefully<00:01:16.670> we'll<00:01:17.060> be<00:01:17.180> able<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.480> lift

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
think hopefully we'll be able to lift

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.530 
think hopefully we'll be able to lift

the<00:02:06.030> variance<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the variance you know it's not one of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.609 
the variance you know it's not one of
these<00:02:07.860> circuits<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> car<00:02:09.570> park<00:02:09.810> it's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
these circuits is like a car park it's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.190 
these circuits is like a car park it's
not<00:02:10.830> all<00:02:10.950> last<00:02:11.160> fall<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.850> still<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.600> proper

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
not all last fall it's still a proper

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.030 
not all last fall it's still a proper
old<00:02:13.830> school<00:02:14.310> racing<00:02:14.700> circuit<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.800> yeah<00:02:16.800> one

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
old school racing circuit so yeah one

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.920 
old school racing circuit so yeah one
mistake<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.820> you're<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.390> trouble<00:02:18.570> so

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
mistake and the you're in trouble so

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.590 
mistake and the you're in trouble so
it's<00:02:19.500> tough<00:02:19.710> from<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.520> respect<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.150> I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
it's tough from that that respect and I

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.690 
it's tough from that that respect and I
think<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:21.960> all<00:02:21.990> really<00:02:22.830> respect<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.310> circuit

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
think we all really respect the circuit

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.820 
think we all really respect the circuit
because<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.240> it's<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.840> very<00:02:25.050> very<00:02:25.230> fast

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
because of that it's a very very fast

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.190 
because of that it's a very very fast
high<00:02:26.250> high<00:02:26.850> speed<00:02:27.120> circuit<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.020> very

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
high high speed circuit now it's very

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.840 
high high speed circuit now it's very
much<00:02:28.350> flowing<00:02:28.770> needing<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.160> real<00:02:29.430> nice<00:02:29.610> flow

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
much flowing needing a real nice flow

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.700 
much flowing needing a real nice flow
particular<00:02:30.240> through<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.450> first<00:02:30.690> sector<00:02:30.900> then

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
particular through the first sector then

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.170 
particular through the first sector then
you<00:02:31.770> go<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.190> hill<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:32.880> got<00:02:33.000> great

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you go up the hill so it's got great

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.620 
you go up the hill so it's got great
under<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> undulation<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.120> come<00:02:36.330> all

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
under the undulation and they come all

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.270 
under the undulation and they come all
the<00:02:36.690> way<00:02:36.720> down<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.440> back<00:02:37.620> straight<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.130> is

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the way down the back straight which is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.760 
the way down the back straight which is
quite<00:02:38.940> long<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.270> well<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:40.380> very<00:02:40.530> difficult

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
quite long as well it's very difficult

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.440 
quite long as well it's very difficult
to<00:02:40.950> ever<00:02:41.100> take<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.520> track<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.330> all

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
to ever take at that track but it's all

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.280 
to ever take at that track but it's all
about<00:02:42.660> positioning<00:02:42.840> dinner

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.110 

we<00:02:50.860> have<00:02:50.980> some<00:02:51.189> new<00:02:51.219> parts<00:02:51.519> coming<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
we have some new parts coming to the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.119 
we have some new parts coming to the
sukkah<00:02:52.540> which<00:02:52.840> will<00:02:52.989> hopefully<00:02:53.140> bridge<00:02:53.980> the

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
sukkah which will hopefully bridge the

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.780 
sukkah which will hopefully bridge the
gap<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:55.629> I<00:02:56.290> don't<00:02:56.560> know<00:02:56.650> how<00:02:56.829> hard<00:02:57.099> red<00:02:57.579> ball

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
gap and I don't know how hard red ball

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.979 
gap and I don't know how hard red ball
pushing<00:02:58.060> at<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.329> moment<00:02:58.629> because<00:02:58.840> they've

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
pushing at the moment because they've

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.509 
pushing at the moment because they've
pretty<00:02:59.319> much<00:02:59.439> wrapped<00:02:59.769> up<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> championship

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
pretty much wrapped up the championship

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.789 
pretty much wrapped up the championship
so<00:03:01.390> it'd<00:03:01.930> be<00:03:02.049> interesting<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.469> see<00:03:02.650> if<00:03:02.680> they

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
so it'd be interesting to see if they

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.229 
so it'd be interesting to see if they
have<00:03:02.920> any<00:03:03.040> new<00:03:03.159> parts<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.609> truck<00:03:03.819> we

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
have any new parts of the truck we

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.390 
have any new parts of the truck we
definitely<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.079> should<00:03:05.400> should

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
definitely do and it should should

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.940 
definitely do and it should should
bridge<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.450> gap<00:03:07.629> and<00:03:07.959> help<00:03:08.560> us<00:03:08.739> challenge

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
bridge that gap and help us challenge

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.069 
bridge that gap and help us challenge
for<00:03:09.220> victory<00:03:09.549> there<00:03:10.359> are<00:03:10.480> areas<00:03:10.659> we<00:03:10.959> can

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
for victory there are areas we can

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.979 
for victory there are areas we can
improve<00:03:11.319> on<00:03:11.530> we<00:03:11.920> need<00:03:12.069> more<00:03:12.250> downforce<00:03:12.989> which

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
improve on we need more downforce which

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.270 
improve on we need more downforce which
they<00:03:14.170> are<00:03:14.290> working<00:03:14.500> as<00:03:14.709> hard<00:03:14.739> as<00:03:14.920> they<00:03:14.980> can<00:03:15.220> to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
they are working as hard as they can to

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.910 
they are working as hard as they can to
define<00:03:15.909> yourself<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.540> have<00:03:17.409> no<00:03:17.590> doubts<00:03:17.799> that

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
define yourself I have no doubts that

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.349 
define yourself I have no doubts that
the<00:03:18.040> next<00:03:18.310> few<00:03:18.400> races<00:03:18.579> should<00:03:18.760> be<00:03:19.150> quite

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
the next few races should be quite

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.080 
the next few races should be quite
competitive<00:03:19.629> you<00:03:20.469> have<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> good<00:03:21.670> result<00:03:21.819> in

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
competitive you have a good result in

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.460 
competitive you have a good result in
Suzuka<00:03:22.450> would<00:03:22.540> really<00:03:22.750> mean<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.900> lot<00:03:22.989> because<00:03:23.139> i

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
Suzuka would really mean a lot because i

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.949 
Suzuka would really mean a lot because i
love<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.829> circuit<00:03:24.220> i<00:03:24.310> love<00:03:24.489> i<00:03:24.730> love<00:03:25.180> japan<00:03:25.720> and

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
love the circuit i love i love japan and

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.920 
love the circuit i love i love japan and
i<00:03:26.739> think<00:03:27.489> we<00:03:27.579> really<00:03:28.359> need<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> put<00:03:28.659> on<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> good

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
i think we really need to put on a good

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.630 
i think we really need to put on a good
show<00:03:28.989> for<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.319> japanese<00:03:29.650> people
