 What Mr. Professor Harald Lesch said he said 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.880
 I say 70 percent of americans 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.760
 believe in extraterrestrial and then there 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.510
 it is still the question of the intelligent 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.510
 live in all 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.440
 I have over 7,000 pictures in 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.360
 be powerpoint so that helps the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:15.060
 ask in the sequence crashes as I 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.060
 the answers have something about ufos 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.210
 I have a lot on this topic 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:28.320
 studied and I decided 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 I do not know anything about it 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.480
 There are several good books on ufos 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:02:01.340
 Here is a wonderful people asks 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:05.590
 me what really happened and you 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.590
 assumes that is a landing pad for 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.040
 some people just think that's fil 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.470
 therefore confusion 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.320
 mothers bachelor from 6 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.130
 they are simply natural objects like 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.680
 weather balloons or marsh gas as well as top 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.900
 secret experience some think it 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:03.160
 So really really mean government 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:06.010
 Experiments even hitler work on it 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.320
 to develop a round plane both 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.120
 internal one could spend some 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.540
 say it is a satanic and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.910
 demonic activities for the 8th 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.500
 I really do not deserve it 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.600
 thinks that runners in their clothes stone 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.120
 I also do not think that it will live up 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.200
 other planets gives something as islam 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.540
 befÃ¤nden 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:34.330
 the bible says eva is the mother of everything 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:39.430
 alive and said the first 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:43.240
 Corinthians we were all in Christ 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.790
 died for the world of festplatz 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.410
 prevailed like when it live on 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.310
 he would have to give other planets 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.850
 die again 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.330
 the open source there is no evidence 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.970
 that there is somewhere else to live 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.350
 february seems to know people know 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.430
 What they want but that is not 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.430
 more longer science 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.150
 of course I believe that it 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.080
 extraterrestrial life or beings exist 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:35.370
 that would be we have angel shards 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.970
 We have the cow surfing serafin 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:44.430
 the gentleman himself just your wings is there 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.509
 extraterrestrial beings quite clearly exist 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.509
 [Music] 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.180
 So he does not know where this gentleman lesch 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:00.770
 This statement has no time to prove 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.770
 the jazz first piece 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.680
 80 percent of all statistics will be and 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.800
 made this way 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.389
 the gentleman lesch in this newspaper article 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.569
 occupied does not occupy its statement 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.569
