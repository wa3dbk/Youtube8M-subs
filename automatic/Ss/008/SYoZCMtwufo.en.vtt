then this flat side slanting down and
there's<00:02:09.479> jack-in-the-box<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.739> forgot<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
there's jack-in-the-box but I forgot the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.780 
there's jack-in-the-box but I forgot the
lid<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> pop<00:02:11.910> open<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.480> I'll<00:02:12.540> add<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
lid to pop open so I'll add that

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
toward the stalagtite and then a

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.470 
toward the stalagtite and then a
connecting<00:02:26.230> tube<00:02:27.230> down<00:02:27.680> here<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.099> bottom

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.050 
almost like the water system over here
in<00:02:30.829> this<00:02:30.920> area<00:02:31.159> isn't<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:31.790> gonna<00:02:31.879> be

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
in this area isn't it it's gonna be

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.000 
in this area isn't it it's gonna be
connected<00:02:32.299> with<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.629> tube<00:02:32.959> similar<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.859> what

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
connected with a tube similar to what

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.589 
connected with a tube similar to what
you<00:02:34.069> see<00:02:34.220> over<00:02:34.250> here<00:02:34.489> with<00:02:34.760> all<00:02:34.909> these<00:02:35.030> contour

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
you see over here with all these contour

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.330 
you see over here with all these contour
lines<00:02:35.689> wrapping<00:02:36.290> around<00:02:36.379> but<00:02:37.069> I'll<00:02:37.159> use

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
lines wrapping around but I'll use

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.170 
lines wrapping around but I'll use
contour<00:02:37.909> lines<00:02:38.120> down<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.480> on<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> tube<00:02:39.049> and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
contour lines down here on the tube and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.869 
contour lines down here on the tube and
then<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.359> ball<00:02:42.109> around<00:02:42.319> there<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.489> now<00:02:43.639> we're

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
then the ball around there and now we're

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.429 
then the ball around there and now we're
gonna<00:02:43.969> connect<00:02:44.329> it<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.719> make<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> rod<00:02:45.170> going

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
gonna connect it and make a rod going

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.949 
gonna connect it and make a rod going
inside<00:02:45.859> the<00:02:46.099> stalagtite<00:02:46.849> I'll<00:02:47.569> make<00:02:47.810> this

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
inside the stalagtite I'll make this

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.800 
inside the stalagtite I'll make this
really<00:02:48.260> interesting<00:02:48.290> Oh<00:02:50.319> hanging<00:02:51.319> or<00:02:52.129> Meishan

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
really interesting Oh hanging or Meishan

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.210 
really interesting Oh hanging or Meishan
but<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.840> hole<00:02:54.079> in<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.379> so<00:02:54.409> that<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.769> tube<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.129> go

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
but a hole in it so that the tube can go

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.179 
but a hole in it so that the tube can go
right<00:02:55.459> in

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
right in

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.099

slide that slide type and of course it

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.569 
slide that slide type and of course it
bends<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.650> goes<00:03:00.769> up<00:03:00.950> into<00:03:01.099> the<00:03:01.340> vena

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
bends up and it goes up into the vena

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
ceiling I'm using the cross hatching

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.600 
ceiling I'm using the cross hatching
idea<00:07:11.569> and<00:07:12.409> then<00:07:12.589> I'll<00:07:12.709> continue<00:07:13.069> to<00:07:13.429> cross
