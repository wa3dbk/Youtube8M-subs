00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 the tone is set the chefs do not tolerate 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.549
 basic errors 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.549
 notebook 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.630
 still life looks better than yesterday 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.780
 it is in someone indeed they who but 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.130
 you like digiderm a first sight like that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.430
 maybe a little little vegetables 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.430
 mail boat 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.080
 so razor blade leaks very flat for a week 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.140
 fertilizer freshness and help you to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.460
 applying fresh and then us and span 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.460
 brain in your face 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.280
 but this is equally important and the third 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.340
 step teeth 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.660
 do you understand if you had taste then how 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 it started everywhere 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.969
 Percentages needed that we do have potential 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.010
 sit you have recovered well 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.810
 Case I think that signs 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.020
 to do for the next round 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.020
 So 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.160
 Katrien got together with Bruno yesterday 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.309
 the remark too much form too little 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.720
 taste to put it right with 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.640
 a three-color pure one with 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.500
 sea ​​shell garnish 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.150
 yesterday, of course, was misery 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.430
 much 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.530
 yes so i have a bit of a holy shit 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.479
 I like because you already recognize your own 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.370
 just back in your style 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.020
 Just think that you are at first sight 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.540
 nature you have already tasted 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.520
 I did stronger things 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.320
 so that the 14 dishes it would be less 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.000
 can then what is yours and always 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.350
 I like that someone is actually mine 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.880
 personality of the important me 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.330
 nice so in that sense we are very much 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.990
 good but 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.990
 unfair procedure 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.369
 Burglars are there are there are good 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.930
 taste nicer and more expensive are you warm 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.170
 the taste is also evident 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.920
 patience tasty I pray and greet at the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.450

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.850
 disappointed 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.850
 on the contrary 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.240
 this is only stylish 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.240
 Asian 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.360
 will follow child still extra extra 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.410
 add acid then make it so exciting 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.560
 to make it so tasty 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.330
 now prophet at the back of the latter 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.640
 time trial well in the men 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.060
 potential in what does not come complete 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.550
 zipper 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.890

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.239
 after day the tastes are under 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.690
 think that they are very correct and correct 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.690
 goods 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.450
 and we blow it my socks 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.250
 want to see we want as namely 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.920
 a muse dish one finds great or 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.170
 something like that she can still forget him 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.320
 also had some dry dishes too 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.600
 dry and sometimes mediocre 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.209
 then who is the icing on the cake after it 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:56.630
 nice and soft maro not super good 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.640
 then i know we are smiling 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.940
 I still keep trying 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.940
 smile 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.440
 the necessary textures are the cuisson 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.640
 sitemap 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.620
 this maybe a little obedient now one 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.560
 make your own pray a little more extravagant 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.900
 for defenseless armor you have the sun 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.209
 all this plate is certainly not one of the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.209
 worst of day thank you lives 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.660

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.660
 potatoes fennel and seafood 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:39.160
 fresh and fresh is marco v contrast in the 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.010
 sauerkraut can in principle be yes 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.270

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.800
 Yes 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.600

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.150

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.690
