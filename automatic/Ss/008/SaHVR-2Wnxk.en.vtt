in the box it has a 2 megapixel enemies

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.200 
in the box it has a 2 megapixel enemies
just<00:02:03.240> look<00:02:03.570> through<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> year

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
just look through some of the year

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.139 
just look through some of the year
feature<00:02:06.210> there's<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.689> 2<00:02:07.020> megapixel<00:02:07.250> camera<00:02:08.250> it

is gps enabled

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.130 
is gps enabled
so<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.790> should<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.180> able<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.690> get<00:02:12.960> your

location<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:13.980> location-based<00:02:14.490> apps

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
location for location-based apps

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.170 
location for location-based apps
hopefully<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:16.500> has<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.770> gravity<00:02:17.340> sensor<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
hopefully it has a gravity sensor so the
