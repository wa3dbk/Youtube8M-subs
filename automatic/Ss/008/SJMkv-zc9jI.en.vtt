00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.670
 now we will show you small tricks 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.380
 processing 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:15.990
 pines on a lathe for that to us 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:28.279
 need a wide frame but the consequences 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:32.030
 take the Russian and the month exists 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.840
 several ways of holding rice 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:39.350
 some keep it straight to handle 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.350
 preparation 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.829
 some tilted 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.309
 in a straight line the same as if you deploy it under 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.309
 a slight angle 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.420
 the creation will then be different 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.760
 we must not start from the middle 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.140
 small movements 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:43.420
 again you will see that wood 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.420
 almost smooth though it is a Christmas tree 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.220
 finish ripping off all the workpiece 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.120
 many ask a question how i'm sharpening 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.189
 cutter angle 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.230
 purely arbitrarily I do not know under what 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:50.299
 the angle and i totally have me just 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:55.310
 the hand is well filled for. something like this if 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.739
 even you have happened here 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.170
 some rounding sharpening it does not matter 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.640
 it's all right it's not practical 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:09.909
 not work zone and if you take more wax 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.909
 he has a completely different sharpening 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:21.549
 will he he he just everything 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.670
 Art can work that such 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:31.299
 What is this taco a little bit for. 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:35.180
 differently and everything now we take 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.430
 try to do here what the workpiece 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.060
 detail 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.060
 one frame 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.930
 Again girth hands but you can order here 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.930
 how convenient for anyone 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.009
 but 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.820
 but 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.690
 and 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:42.229
 because as somoni on the pocket with us 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.229
 here he is in the way 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:42.870
 if you do even a large number 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:47.580
 blanks and even if they will stand 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:50.710
 about 10 min meters from each other 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:55.680
 size when grinding almost no 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:58.960
 Well, as practice shows 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.740
 you pass everything here only to clean a moment 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.740
 little and all
