00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
 the control is of course the team of colotto of course the team of the man 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.610
 in the golden jersey the dell during the australian now i all three the big 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.859
 rounds has had the leader's jersey and we have the leading group 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.480
 stijn devolder marco marzano rein taaramae 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.860
 and 4 the Spaniards it will then finally be a Spanish stage victory 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.089
 can become 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.339
 for the party tent it is important to make patents, here the leading group hits 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.099
 apart in which the final climb 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.040
 three of the five kilometers in the last 8 kilometers of the stage thousands 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.040
 the favorites and not in we see fortuneo 3ds leading and then it is 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.510
 agree and pure taaramae the champion of germany that pace there 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.440
 As part of a further favorites, the geesink adds to it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.910
 wild 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.720
 he thinks that besides then basso and then there are big problems for the champion 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.720
 the club from germany is 17 by the way 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.600
 then we see that dying turned the attacker on, and you can't do it any more 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.900
 mention if for example easy basso follows easily bossche sings 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.939
 murder let the three go then we see that happen 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.939
 it is simply no longer bees that are released 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.660
 the terrible heavy climbing van with a decrease of 2 afterwards 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.000
 kilometers and then immediately after the finish there was also a great honor 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.299
 marciano bruma and from cleats that one is the leader in the competition just before the summit 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.119
 and while the attack of doing anything falls further during the carnival it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.230
 carnival offer, there was no trace of robert geesink 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.150
 And then it is expected there will again be left behind by MC Zuiderzee engine 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.520
 Christmas Eve 6000 euros for a Spaniard last year was the round of Catalonia 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.600
 profit the favorites just behind them still go with the original men 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.579
 the leading group to save opel we do not 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.639
 they don't have victory for the stage but they ride for it 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:49.660
 rankings 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.560
 here it is then we are standing before seven arrives and it did that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 I then ride on the 3 kilometer ride 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920
 the dangerous descent is that ahead 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.750
 and then adam about that last trickier kilometer in the direction of the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.820
 finish 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.300
 of course to see closely that the three favorites are separate from robert 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.709
 geesink 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.099
 music and dance 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.209
 then it became sequel and then basso must also be there 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.810
 they are also now upstairs and can also start that descent on it 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.309
 In the meantime, party the loose Veloso in the descent 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.549
 a sharp turn to the right and then the last kilometer and then it becomes 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.919
 immediately quality marks for veloso 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.649
 the favorites are not nearly as far as they are still full of that dangerous 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.249
 descent with one of the Spaniards from the original one leading group that at 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.249
 they are not going to take us and he took the victory in the ninth 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:43.499
 stage of the vuelta can stand for cesar veloso and then it is waiting for 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:44.839
 their favorite 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.519
 where the three of us stay at the court is indeed something 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.779
 come closer to the latter being the case they were busy 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.629
 the carriage it is almost a third in the sprint and that is also important further 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.319
 in this stage, among other things, the bonus seconds become responses 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.599
 removed as a reward for the work david de la fuente bonvuren two 6 pin 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.690
 to fifth place 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.470
 Rescue workers percent on a treadmill became the residence after the second 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.300
 So referendum on the sprint just before the victory 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.080
 boerstra president of the lto and the spanjaard and the golden jersey thanks to the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.289
