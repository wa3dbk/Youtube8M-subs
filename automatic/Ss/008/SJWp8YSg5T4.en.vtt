Oceana so now she's going to send out a
sizzle<00:02:20.959> named<00:02:21.830> Tom<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.489> don't<00:02:23.300> know<00:02:23.420> why<00:02:23.720> it's

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
sizzle named Tom I don't know why it's

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.870 
sizzle named Tom I don't know why it's
name<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.050> anyway<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.680> go<00:02:25.100> for<00:02:25.250> another<00:02:25.400> outrage

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
name is anyway I go for another outrage

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.820 
name is anyway I go for another outrage
I<00:02:25.910> thought<00:02:26.270> see<00:02:26.390> what<00:02:26.510> bullet<00:02:26.810> punch<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.380> she

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
I thought see what bullet punch but she

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.130 
I thought see what bullet punch but she
didn't<00:02:28.250> that's<00:02:28.430> strange<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.450> me<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.870> bullet

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
didn't that's strange to me the bullet

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.300 
didn't that's strange to me the bullet
wounds<00:02:30.290> definitely<00:02:30.739> would<00:02:30.860> have<00:02:30.950> killed<00:02:31.130> me

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
wounds definitely would have killed me

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.090 
wounds definitely would have killed me
but<00:02:32.000> she<00:02:32.239> uses<00:02:32.480> fursuit<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.500> guess<00:02:33.950> it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
but she uses fursuit so I guess it

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.259 
but she uses fursuit so I guess it
doesn't<00:02:34.250> really<00:02:34.400> matter<00:02:34.610> what<00:02:34.880> she<00:02:35.090> would've

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
doesn't really matter what she would've

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.580 
doesn't really matter what she would've
used<00:02:35.360> because<00:02:35.810> they<00:02:35.959> both<00:02:36.110> would<00:02:36.350> have<00:02:36.380> killed

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
used because they both would have killed

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.479 
used because they both would have killed
you<00:02:36.709> anyway<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:38.540> it's<00:02:39.320> okay<00:02:39.950> because<00:02:40.250> now

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
that I know the azores choice banded I

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.020 
that I know the azores choice banded I

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
can send in Pangaea to set up ants out

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.880 
can send in Pangaea to set up ants out
the<00:02:47.209> Sun<00:02:47.450> alright<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.200> Sun<00:02:48.380> really<00:02:48.560> doesn't

just I don't know who that's supposed to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.220 
just I don't know who that's supposed to
be<00:02:54.730> maybe<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.940> be<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.209> man<00:02:56.360> or<00:02:56.480> something<00:02:56.780> but

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
be maybe to be the man or something but

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.630 
be maybe to be the man or something but
I<00:02:57.260> set<00:02:57.560> up<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.739> rock<00:02:57.890> polish<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.430> switch

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
I set up the rock polish on the switch

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.780 
I set up the rock polish on the switch
out<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.560> I<00:03:00.560> go<00:03:00.739> for<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.069> earthquake<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.730> the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
out and I go for the earthquake and the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.240 
out and I go for the earthquake and the
earthquake<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.330> going<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.750> do<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.319> lot<00:03:03.980> of

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
earthquake is going to do a lot of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.220 
earthquake is going to do a lot of
damage

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
damage

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.539 
damage
even<00:03:06.230> though<00:03:06.320> grab<00:03:06.530> on<00:03:06.680> has<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.920> lot<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.160> Defense

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
even though grab on has a lot of Defense

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.100 
even though grab on has a lot of Defense
she<00:03:07.880> goes<00:03:08.000> for<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.150> Dragon<00:03:08.600> Claw<00:03:08.780> she

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
she goes for the Dragon Claw she

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.270 
she goes for the Dragon Claw she
definitely<00:03:09.680> should<00:03:09.890> have<00:03:09.920> went<00:03:10.100> for<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
definitely should have went for the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.310 
definitely should have went for the
earthquake<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.870> wouldn't<00:03:12.110> have<00:03:12.200> made<00:03:12.260> any

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
earthquake it wouldn't have made any

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.020 
earthquake it wouldn't have made any
sense<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.709> go<00:03:12.829> for<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.070> rock<00:03:13.549> polish<00:03:13.880> because

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
sense to go for a rock polish because

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.380 
sense to go for a rock polish because
she's<00:03:14.329> already<00:03:14.540> slower<00:03:14.959> than<00:03:15.140> me<00:03:15.260> anyway<00:03:15.380> so

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
she's already slower than me anyway so

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.460 
she's already slower than me anyway so
she<00:03:17.390> definitely<00:03:17.570> should<00:03:18.049> have<00:03:18.140> went<00:03:18.260> for<00:03:18.410> the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
she definitely should have went for the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.890 
she definitely should have went for the
earthquake<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:20.000> she<00:03:20.420> doesn't<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:23.000> guess

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
earthquake but she doesn't so I guess

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.930 
earthquake but she doesn't so I guess
the<00:03:23.989> worse<00:03:24.140> for<00:03:24.350> me<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.890> I'm<00:03:25.310> not<00:03:25.430> complaining

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
the worse for me so I'm not complaining

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.270 
the worse for me so I'm not complaining
so<00:03:26.450> she<00:03:26.540> sends<00:03:26.810> out<00:03:26.900> Tom<00:03:27.170> now<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.739> Tom's<00:03:28.100> going

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
so she sends out Tom now and Tom's going

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.370 
so she sends out Tom now and Tom's going
to<00:03:28.400> bullet<00:03:28.670> punch<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.239> Tom<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.870> not<00:03:30.019> gonna<00:03:30.170> get

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
to bullet punch and Tom is not gonna get

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.949 
to bullet punch and Tom is not gonna get
the<00:03:30.890> kill<00:03:31.130> because<00:03:31.549> Pangea<00:03:32.090> is<00:03:32.299> very<00:03:32.600> both<00:03:32.840> Lee

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the kill because Pangea is very both Lee

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.640 
the kill because Pangea is very both Lee
because<00:03:33.260> it's<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.650> whole<00:03:33.890> earth<00:03:35.650> continent

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
because it's the whole earth continent

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.560 
because it's the whole earth continent
if<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.280> don't<00:03:37.400> know<00:03:37.459> what<00:03:37.579> Pangaea<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.209> an

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
if you don't know what Pangaea is and an

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.940 
if you don't know what Pangaea is and an
earthquake<00:03:38.900> will<00:03:39.049> definitely<00:03:39.620> be<00:03:39.709> strong

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
earthquake will definitely be strong

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.349 
earthquake will definitely be strong
enough<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.280> take<00:03:40.430> out<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.730> scissor<00:03:41.030> because

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
enough to take out the scissor because

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.680 
enough to take out the scissor because
it<00:03:41.540> has<00:03:41.720> overpowered<00:03:42.500> attack<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.209> have<00:03:44.420> 29

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
it has overpowered attack so I have 29

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.720 
it has overpowered attack so I have 29
HP<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.380> that's<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.769> enough<00:03:46.010> for<00:03:46.160> one<00:03:46.370> more

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
HP and that's just enough for one more

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.789 
HP and that's just enough for one more
attack<00:03:47.120> she<00:03:47.660> sounds<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.989> lot<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.320> yes<00:03:48.470> and

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
attack she sounds like a lot of yes and

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.970 
attack she sounds like a lot of yes and
I<00:03:49.579> go<00:03:49.700> for<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:49.910> Dragon<00:03:50.239> Claw<00:03:50.390> it's<00:03:50.660> not<00:03:51.260> going

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
I go for the Dragon Claw it's not going

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.240

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
mistake I go for thunder because we're

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.330 
mistake I go for thunder because we're
in<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.380> water<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:11.740> I<00:04:11.800> thought<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.069> would<00:04:12.160> hit

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
in the water so I thought it would hit

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.930 
in the water so I thought it would hit
just<00:04:12.790> kidding<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:14.440> scoped<00:04:15.250> one<00:04:15.459> for<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.670> 70

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
just kidding I scoped one for the 70

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.370 
just kidding I scoped one for the 70
because<00:04:16.060> I'd<00:04:16.269> really<00:04:16.570> lie<00:04:16.690> don't<00:04:16.989> really<00:04:17.169> like

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
because I'd really lie don't really like

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.409 
because I'd really lie don't really like
using<00:04:18.630> obvious<00:04:19.630> moves<00:04:20.730> she<00:04:21.730> recovered<00:04:22.180> but

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
using obvious moves she recovered but

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.570 
using obvious moves she recovered but
that<00:04:22.870> ice<00:04:23.020> beam<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.560> still<00:04:23.800> gonna<00:04:23.950> be<00:04:24.130> strong

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
that ice beam is still gonna be strong

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.740 
that ice beam is still gonna be strong
enough<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.820> take<00:04:25.060> her<00:04:25.150> out<00:04:25.180> because<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.510> have<00:04:25.720> a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
enough to take her out because I have a

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.460 
enough to take her out because I have a
