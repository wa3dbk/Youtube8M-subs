00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.260
 Hello UTB and nvidia shield 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.510
 The prefix has long been sold and comes out 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.290
 that and nvidia kept their word 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.880
 promising exclusives 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 now on shield you can download 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.500
 official native port half-life 2 and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.020
 portal 2 legends are available only for 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 This android game console work on 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.320
 the current version of the source engine 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 if we compare the half-life 2 nashil 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.630
 cryptic writing can be noticed quite 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.900
 slight difference both videos in resolution 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.669
 720p 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.280
 for likelihood by comparison and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.930
 naturally shadow reflection shaders and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.880
 the main smoothing is better on 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.370
 computer version of the differences in principle 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.989
 there are and they are quite small but you only 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.149
 imagine half-life 2 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.360
 in your pocket it is clear that the shell is in 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.590
 the pocket doesn't fit it figuratively speaking 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.840
 management is the most important thing to play 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.969
 It is convenient to go through the first chapter to 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.920
 get used to managing all the steaks pads 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.270
 all involved and don't even need 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.550
 remake by yourself really 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.379
 very convenient to play on the d-pad choose 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.329
 gun on top is a gun and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.429
 to the right are the machine guns to the left the grenades 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.560
 non-residential gaming gun system in general 

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:09.389
 sharpened specifically under the shield and under it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.920
 graphics controllers at the same time 

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:13.020
 optimized so lags find 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.359
 quite difficult with the picture itself 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.249
 doesn't always give the desired 60fps she 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.829
 ranges from 40 to 60 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:22.079
 but once again I repeat it imperceptibly 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.389
 I went through the whole half-life 2 on shield and 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.119
 now I regret that there is no episode 1 and 2 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.889
 but I really want a portal comparing 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.209
 portal on the console and pisi too 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:32.490
 it becomes clear that the graphics are not 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:34.590
 falls short but it seems that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.079
 the default port is higher 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.819
 settings because the objects are few and therefore 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.740
 and better graphics can do that is 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.079
 graphics to the portal for the computer and shield 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.329
 hardly any different at all and yet 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.489
 whether portal 2 and will be very interesting 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.889
 new episodes half-life on shield as 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.770
 says let's live and see but for now you can 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:55.020
 enjoy the original hits 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.299
 half-life 2 and the portal costs 350 rubles 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.039
 they are available in the play market but officially 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.429
 you can buy games only for and nvidia 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.079
 shield 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.389
 the only flaw in both games 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.450
 the absence of the Russian language and here it is to 

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.440
 sorry not 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.090
 consoles with its rather capacious 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.770
 the battery lasts about six 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.080
 hours of gaming in half-life 2 when 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.240
 maximum brightness for such a powerful 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.310
 games are a very good result before and in 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.350
 whole purchase and shield and the legends themselves 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.130
 dumps at 100 percent 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.130
 justified
