00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.470
 Diop is easing semoun and games 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 will be small video a little bit special 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.009
 on the 1,500 tactics so already I 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.259
 would like to offer this video to all 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.090
 little curious and all the big fans 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.220
 say thorez this video is made for 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.259
 you a friend so we end up on 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.120
 black ops price of the name already where I want to 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.800
 his hand so far what more 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.719
 banal makes a small box a little 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.730
 button bypassing insertion pole and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.530
 it's over media tends to weigh on black 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.910
 ops we see that the airlock has already been done 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 a huge time jump in gear and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 it's in the future we see that there 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.730
 would be much more modern ya even a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.949
 lover coming out insertion and if you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 have been careful there is on the screen the 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.769
 song precisely there was written 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.390
 something but that I'll come back to 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.409
 after 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.749
 I give you some information 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.899
 basic about this tactical insertion 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.249
 so already wanted unlocked neo 47 so 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.050
 it's part of tactical grenades 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.550
 and that that I think you all know 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.200
 it allows you to appear against 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.570
 exactly you put it before you die 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.340
 so on the other hand something you do not 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 do not know it's that finally I think everything 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.000
 to say is that black developers 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.930
 hawk two have booked us a little trick 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.330
 a little surprise 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.980
 so I was going to tell you about 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.440
 a mac cargo so here we are touching 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.780
 amap cargo in the port of departure and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.670
 I put my tactical insertion but we 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 did a freeze frame and sure more 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.670
 precisely the screen of the station 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.650
 tactical and then we can see what we can 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.330
 see he wrote and stuff and 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.310
 finally plan is a big word but I 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.660
 I'm going to charge me anyway 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.090
 to say a little what marked our opinion 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.980
 a little bit of it all the people or left in 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.660
 crazy you can see who writes 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.610
 gps mode so I had some clues 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.860
 is below we can see there you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.740
 forras latitude longitude is a continuation 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 of letters rather than numbers with 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.970
 the end a letter so this letter 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.980
 corresponds to north east south west and so 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 when you see that you say but but 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.820
 but they also have GPS coordinates 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.159
 and yes, in fact these GPS coordinates 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.060
 and 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.579
 do you actually figure these coordinates 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.079
 gps the least intrigued and I told myself 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.179
 why not google maps is 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.039
 returned exactly his coordinates there 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.080
 to see where it is 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.110
 here are these bullshit if we will fall into 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.160
 France while it is on a port before 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.380
 all that I went to see on 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.530
 description of a cargo ship and I could see 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.880
 in fact that according to the game the map is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.190
 actually found in a currency exchange 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.560
 of shanghai of course from singapore and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.810
 so frozen on google maps and I typed 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.310
 the coordinates I made in and out 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.220
 what happened to me on a port of singapore 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.799
 and there it was extraordinary no 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.730
 I'm kidding but finally here's for you 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.560
 to say that it's still a 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.410
 nice little thing so when we play in 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.670
 done on a port of singapore 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.190
 or in fact we see loads of cargo 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.470
 and you can see a green arrow there 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.450
 here that actually show you where 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.549
 you are actually in relation to the game 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.590
 and so we must have no fucking of our 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.959
 mouth actually with division for this 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.310
 trick there at least as to the best of the 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.620
 map for example and composa 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.180
 systematic of agree with me that I 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.920
 am not on a cargo here is at 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.900
 failed to declare people but that's 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.670
 everything so when I go back in 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.500
 coordinates on google maps and ben 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.190
 what's going to happen and we're going 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.359
 change location 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.980
 but we will always stay in the port 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.630
 from shanghai and we will end up in 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.100
 middle of the cargoes a place 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.290
 where there are not precisely these cargoes 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.500
 there then we can imagine that here at the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.180
 crane that makes it what to change from 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.859
 place the cargoes and to give you 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.540
 a third who tarnish to show 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.400
 that we are not our mouth it's 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.300
 that when I go to the other end to alos 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.770
 wildlife 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.480
 at the other end of the map well we 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.740
 can notice that if I come in a 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.160
 again the coordinates that had 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.020
 written on insertion and ben I fall a 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.730
 other place in the port but at best 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.940
 shipments so as you can the 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.380
 see 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.210
 so I was then because I was 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.910
 in the pole and a half and at half spawn 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.870
 what are there cargoes 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.310
 as I was reading and I told myself 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.610
 good now that I discovered that I 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.050
 you're happy I tried to see it so low 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.940
 could not see also on others 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.380
 because what that gave so did on 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.240
 hijack because it's a card when 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.880
 even that intrigues me because we 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.260
 separately west guys have made a leap 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.400
 we brand or international but 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.140
 finally we do not know more 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.490
 and so I said to myself go go I'm going 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.780
 take the coordinates this map 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.670
 as you can see there and if you 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.800
 be careful behind the boat 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.940
 there is an island so remember that I 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.950
 go on google maps I type them 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.540
 coordinates I'm getting in and will be done 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.370
 hear we fall on nothing good I'm going 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.750
 to zoom out ok I need to zoom 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.040
 and we can see that in fact the point is 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.620
 in the middle of the ocean 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.540
 and when for big zoom is there 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.940
 can actually see more precisely when 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.010
 this point is next to the nile which 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.050
 named amsterdam island so deduces 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.720
 if you are logical that lille next 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.490
 of them exact goethe is actually the island 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.830
 amsterdam aulas to give one last 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.930
 little one last little clue actually 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.510
 last small precision for us 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.460
 was worth on the map noting 2025 which if 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.750
 you did not know to be actually a base 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.110
 nuclear tests or in fact one makes 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.060
 fart nuclear bombs on one 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.770
 model of a city with crazy people 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.840
 defect to the mannequins and one 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.460
 fart the bombs and we look at them 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.500
 guy that it does on humans and on 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.490
 the constructions so when I typed 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.990
 the coordinates I had found on 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.120
 our stands in google maps a new 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.370
 times and well the ste strongly not city 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.180
 from nevada to the united states and finally come 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.070
 mountains which is still 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.930
 when you think about it 6 logic of the shot 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.270
 we 're not going to make fart finally try out 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.590
 nuclear bombs in the middle 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.740
 people who really do exist finally 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.750
 people I'm talking about here for risk of them 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.740
 contaminate nuclear icm finally I have 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.430
 spent this Sunday is still enough 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.530
 consistent that it is in full 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.810
 middle of the mountains if you want and 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.790
 so when we play badly but we surrender 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.860
 account that this card there actually because 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.570
 this point is next to a road and in 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.410
 investing who can in pleasure but 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.660
 that's it is 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.150
 but in fact there the road that middle of 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.850
 pines of 2025 which is actually the road 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.830
 which is actually actually on there 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.590
 where there is the point of rope but that's it 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.970
 so asked one last small precision 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.680
 in know that you do not have to 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.420
 to pose for that tactical sense or so of 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.010
 cancel it for if you change location 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.470
 that you want to see if you have changed 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.810
 where to go oath rot 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.370
 if you change from if you move on 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.900
 the game map and want to see 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.550
 if you are moving on the map in 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.690
 you do not have to 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.970
 associations if you want if you 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.020
 walk as I go up now without 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.000
 stop you can see that the 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.650
 GPS coordinates gets updated 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.940
 automatically 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.740
 so I can not hurt if you 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.360
 want to have fun finally here I hope 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.270
 that the video will have pleased you will have 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.650
 learned things and 6 sappy intrigued 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.510
 barred quoted from your side 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.830
 to look at where are the others 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.830
 cards here's me I tell you ciao ciao
