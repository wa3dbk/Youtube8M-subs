00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
Pokemon during the entire playthrough I

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.199

think that's pretty cool it gives a

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.030 
think that's pretty cool it gives a
little<00:04:06.330> more<00:04:06.510> like<00:04:06.780> personalization<00:04:07.530> value
