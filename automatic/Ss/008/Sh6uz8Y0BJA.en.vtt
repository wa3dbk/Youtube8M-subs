00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
possibility of not being wearable when

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.880 
possibility of not being wearable when
they're<00:00:18.630> wearable<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.260> midsole<00:00:19.650> will<00:00:19.800> be

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
they're wearable the midsole will be

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890 
they're wearable the midsole will be
crumbling<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.640> if<00:00:20.730> that's<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> case<00:00:21.300> you

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
crumbling and if that's the case you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.779 
crumbling and if that's the case you
will<00:00:22.020> need<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> soul<00:00:22.470> swap<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.430> some<00:00:23.640> people

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
will need a soul swap so some people

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.220 
will need a soul swap so some people
tend<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.480> they're<00:00:24.689> choosing<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
tend to think that they're choosing a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.140 
tend to think that they're choosing a
soul<00:00:25.470> shot<00:00:25.710> when<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> pain<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> cracking

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
soul shot when just the pain is cracking

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150 
soul shot when just the pain is cracking
let<00:00:27.810> me<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.710> difference

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
let me show you like the difference

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859 
let me show you like the difference
between<00:00:29.250> crumbling<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> pain<00:00:30.449> cracking

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
between crumbling and pain cracking

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.690 
between crumbling and pain cracking
because<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:31.769> people<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.099> know<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.460> tend

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
because some people you know really tend

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.790 
because some people you know really tend
to<00:00:32.820> confuse<00:00:33.120> these<00:00:33.329> two<00:00:33.390> things<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.620> get

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
to confuse these two things like I get

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680 
to confuse these two things like I get
people<00:00:34.950> asking<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.850> soul<00:00:36.149> shop<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
people asking for a soul shop and the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
people asking for a soul shop and the
only<00:00:36.930> thing<00:00:37.110> wrong<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.920> pain<00:00:38.129> is

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
only thing wrong is that the pain is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
only thing wrong is that the pain is
cracking<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> shoe<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.230> pain

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
cracking so this is a shoe that is pain

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
cracking so this is a shoe that is pain
cracking<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.399> see<00:00:41.690> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.840> just
