00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
transformation or anything that you can

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.060

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
is how looks I feel also you can see the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.680 
is how looks I feel also you can see the
comb

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.370 

it's<00:05:10.530> not<00:05:10.770> dry<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:12.120> no<00:05:12.420> even<00:05:12.720> when<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.960> dry<00:05:13.170> it

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
it's not dry and no even when it dry it

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.650 
it's not dry and no even when it dry it
doesn't<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:14.430> doesn't<00:05:14.580> get<00:05:14.790> hard<00:05:15.060> on<00:05:15.150> my<00:05:15.270> hair<00:05:15.450> I

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
doesn't it doesn't get hard on my hair I

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.870 
doesn't it doesn't get hard on my hair I
guess<00:05:15.810> because<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:16.110> use<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.440> oil<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.100> look<00:05:17.700> at

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
guess because I use the oil and look at

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.460 
guess because I use the oil and look at
a<00:05:17.910> conditioner<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:18.870> everything<00:05:19.230> in<00:05:19.410> the

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
a conditioner and everything in the

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.890 
a conditioner and everything in the
shower<00:05:19.910> but<00:05:20.910> I<00:05:20.970> have<00:05:21.270> had<00:05:21.540> some<00:05:21.720> bad

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
shower but I have had some bad

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.840 
shower but I have had some bad
experiences<00:05:21.930> with<00:05:22.680> it<00:05:22.860> if<00:05:23.100> you<00:05:23.250> do<00:05:23.430> put<00:05:23.670> too

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
experiences with it if you do put too

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.730 
experiences with it if you do put too
much<00:05:24.000> like<00:05:24.180> a<00:05:24.210> fatty<00:05:24.540> linking<00:05:24.990> hair<00:05:25.140> white<00:05:25.380> so

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
much like a fatty linking hair white so

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.970 
much like a fatty linking hair white so
make<00:05:26.700> sure<00:05:26.730> that<00:05:27.090> you<00:05:27.390> just<00:05:27.600> use<00:05:27.780> enough<00:05:28.230> it's

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
make sure that you just use enough it's

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.620 
make sure that you just use enough it's
better<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.370> too<00:05:29.670> little<00:05:29.880> that's<00:05:30.090> too<00:05:30.270> much<00:05:30.450> I

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
better you too little that's too much I

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.780 
better you too little that's too much I
think<00:05:30.690> because<00:05:31.200> you<00:05:31.770> know<00:05:31.800> we<00:05:32.010> add<00:05:32.190> more<00:05:32.550> but

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
think because you know we add more but

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.980 
think because you know we add more but
once<00:05:32.970> it's<00:05:33.120> in<00:05:33.180> there<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.480> can't<00:05:33.690> take<00:05:33.870> it

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
once it's in there you can't take it

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.890 
once it's in there you can't take it
away<00:05:34.080> so<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:35.430> is<00:05:35.640> the<00:05:35.730> uncle<00:05:36.000> funky<00:05:36.390> dark

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900
