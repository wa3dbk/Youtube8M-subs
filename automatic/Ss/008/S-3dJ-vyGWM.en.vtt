extending the the window crank what I
want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.000> extend<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:10.470> four

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
want to do is extend this out about four

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.880 
want to do is extend this out about four
inches<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.720> will<00:01:12.930> clear<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> door<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
inches so it will clear the door and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.840 
inches so it will clear the door and
then<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.250> still<00:01:14.460> actually<00:01:14.670> use<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> what

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
then I can still actually use it so what

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.010 
then I can still actually use it so what
I'm<00:01:17.970> doing<00:01:18.860> little<00:01:19.860> blurry<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.780> I'm<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I'm doing little blurry but I'm going to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
I'm doing little blurry but I'm going to
be<00:01:22.110> drilling<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.680> hole<00:01:22.710> through<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.509> tapping

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
be drilling a hole through that tapping

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.770 
be drilling a hole through that tapping
that<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.170> run<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> five<00:01:25.590> sixteenth<00:01:26.070> rod

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
that so I can run a five sixteenth rod

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
that so I can run a five sixteenth rod
through<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.189> aluminum<00:01:29.729> so

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
through because this is all aluminum so

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.690 
through because this is all aluminum so
I<00:01:30.000> can't<00:01:30.240> well<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> run

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
I can't well to this so I'm going to run

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.609 
I can't well to this so I'm going to run
this<00:01:32.880> over<00:01:33.950> 15<00:01:34.950> 16<00:01:35.280> throb<00:01:35.670> through<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.619> weld

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
this over 15 16 throb through this weld

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.530 
this over 15 16 throb through this weld
it<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.220> it'll<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.490> spin<00:01:41.180> then<00:01:42.180> I'll<00:01:42.329> put

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
it so it'll actually spin then I'll put

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
it so it'll actually spin then I'll put
a<00:01:42.570> piece<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.079> inside<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:43.920> I'll<00:01:44.100> shave

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
a piece of this inside here I'll shave

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
a piece of this inside here I'll shave
it<00:01:44.520> down<00:01:44.549> run<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> inside<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:48.170> I'll

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it down run it inside and then I'll

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.749 
it down run it inside and then I'll
actually<00:01:49.320> drill<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.890> tap<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.220> piece<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
actually drill and tap that piece so I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.690 
actually drill and tap that piece so I
can<00:01:50.970> run<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:52.649> factory<00:01:53.840> window<00:01:54.840> crank<00:01:55.700> so

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
can run the factory window crank so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
can run the factory window crank so
hopefully<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.270> should<00:01:57.299> work<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
hopefully that should work it's going to

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.530 
hopefully that should work it's going to
be<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.159> bit<00:01:59.280> longer<00:01:59.670> project<00:02:00.329> than<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
be a little bit longer project than I

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.530 
be a little bit longer project than I
anticipated<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:02.030> that's<00:02:03.030> what<00:02:03.180> I'm<00:02:03.299> doing

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
anticipated but that's what I'm doing

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.080 
anticipated but that's what I'm doing
now<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:05.750> I'll<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.869> running<00:02:07.049> some<00:02:07.380> bolts

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
now and then I'll be running some bolts

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.949 
now and then I'll be running some bolts
to<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.209> able<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> bolt<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> door<00:02:09.869> on

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.839 
and it through and weld it on somehow as
I<00:02:27.870> turn<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:31.069> windows<00:02:32.069> going<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.760> down

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
I turn this windows going up and down

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.500 
I turn this windows going up and down
this<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.750> what<00:02:33.840> works<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:35.060> decided<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.390> do

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
this is what works I decided not to do

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.149 
this is what works I decided not to do
all<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.810> fancy<00:02:38.690> tapping<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.989> drilling<00:02:40.680> and

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
all the fancy tapping and drilling and

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.190 
all the fancy tapping and drilling and
whatever<00:02:41.760> because<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.450> wasn't<00:02:42.750> working<00:02:42.780> very

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
whatever because it wasn't working very

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.460 
whatever because it wasn't working very
well<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:44.239> so<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.360> will<00:02:45.569> be<00:02:45.840> sticking<00:02:46.200> out

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
well and so this will be sticking out

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.240 
well and so this will be sticking out
past<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.920> door<00:02:48.440> i'll<00:02:49.440> probably<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.829> weld<00:02:50.129> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
past the door i'll probably just weld a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.729 
past the door i'll probably just weld a
piece<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.940> or<00:02:51.500> something<00:02:52.500> I'll

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
piece on to this or something I'll

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.309 
piece on to this or something I'll
figure<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.190> out<00:02:53.250> later<00:02:54.109> because<00:02:55.109> I<00:02:55.170> don't

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
figure it out later because I don't

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.440 
figure it out later because I don't
really<00:02:55.379> care<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:55.890> now<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:57.090> that's<00:02:57.239> what's

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
really care right now but that's what's

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.800 
really care right now but that's what's
on<00:02:57.569> there<00:02:58.579> alright<00:02:59.579> so<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.730> got<00:02:59.790> some<00:03:00.060> PL<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.660> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
on there alright so I got some PL on the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.599 
on there alright so I got some PL on the
door<00:03:00.989> now<00:03:02.510> he<00:03:03.510> got<00:03:03.720> bit<00:03:03.959> on<00:03:04.280> use<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.459> whole

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
door now he got bit on use the whole

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.229 
door now he got bit on use the whole
tube<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:07.220> now<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.549> stick<00:03:08.819> this<00:03:08.879> on

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
tube and now I'm going to stick this on

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.710 
tube and now I'm going to stick this on
there<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.010> shoot<00:03:11.010> some<00:03:11.220> screws<00:03:11.489> in<00:03:11.730> got<00:03:12.540> some

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
there and shoot some screws in got some

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.780 
there and shoot some screws in got some
ideas<00:03:13.079> for<00:03:13.290> some<00:03:14.090> lag<00:03:15.090> bolts<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:15.780> anchors<00:03:16.200> and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
ideas for some lag bolts and anchors and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.599 
ideas for some lag bolts and anchors and
stuff<00:03:17.790> but<00:03:17.940> i'll<00:03:18.060> probably<00:03:18.239> just<00:03:18.389> use<00:03:18.630> some

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
stuff but i'll probably just use some

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.449 
stuff but i'll probably just use some
screws<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.849> hold<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.239> there<00:03:21.389> for<00:03:21.419> now

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
screws to hold it in there for now

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.690 
screws to hold it in there for now
alright<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:25.190> what<00:03:26.190> i<00:03:26.220> got<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.609> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
alright so here is what i got of the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.420 
alright so here is what i got of the
door<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.150> far<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.530> hard<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.919> see<00:03:29.099> but<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
door so far and hard to see but the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.509 
door so far and hard to see but the
panels<00:03:29.760> on<00:03:29.940> i<00:03:30.290> did<00:03:31.290> lay<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.500> two-by-four<00:03:31.919> across

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
panels on i did lay a two-by-four across

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.400 
panels on i did lay a two-by-four across
the<00:03:32.790> bottom<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.480> seal<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> bottom<00:03:34.049> so<00:03:34.380> it

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
the bottom to seal the bottom so it

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.789 
the bottom to seal the bottom so it
hangs<00:03:34.620> over<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:34.950> lip<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:36.560> basically<00:03:37.560> just

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
hangs over the lip and basically just

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.009 
hangs over the lip and basically just
disassembled<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:39.530> door<00:03:40.530> latch<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
disassembled the door latch so I have a

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.620 
disassembled the door latch so I have a
little<00:03:43.260> pull<00:03:44.220> cable<00:03:45.079> there<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.329> works<00:03:48.480> out

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
little pull cable there and it works out

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.539 
little pull cable there and it works out
pretty<00:03:48.810> good<00:03:49.109> so<00:03:49.730> that'll<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:50.849> my<00:03:52.370> baseline<00:03:53.370> to

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
pretty good so that'll be my baseline to

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.770 
pretty good so that'll be my baseline to
start<00:03:53.819> from<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.650> I'll<00:03:56.209> lay<00:03:57.209> some<00:03:57.419> wood<00:03:57.569> around

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
start from and I'll lay some wood around

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.440 
start from and I'll lay some wood around
there<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.489> should<00:03:59.669> be<00:03:59.790> built<00:04:00.030> up<00:04:00.209> enough

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
there and that should be built up enough

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.009 
there and that should be built up enough
for<00:04:00.660> those<00:04:00.780> speakers<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:02.750> let's<00:04:03.750> see<00:04:03.930> it

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
for those speakers so let's see it

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.189 
for those speakers so let's see it
actually<00:04:04.169> closes<00:04:05.540> pretty<00:04:06.540> good<00:04:06.780> around<00:04:06.900> the

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
actually closes pretty good around the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.729 
actually closes pretty good around the
top<00:04:08.599> buy<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:09.660> some<00:04:09.930> weather<00:04:10.139> stripping<00:04:10.500> and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
top buy you some weather stripping and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.319 
top buy you some weather stripping and
seal<00:04:10.949> that<00:04:11.160> better<00:04:12.379> but<00:04:13.379> I<00:04:13.440> want<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.650> get<00:04:13.769> out

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
seal that better but I want to get out

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.470 
seal that better but I want to get out
pull<00:04:15.329> that<00:04:16.880> pretty<00:04:17.880> slick

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
pull that pretty slick

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.620 
pull that pretty slick
and<00:04:20.480> then<00:04:20.720> there's<00:04:20.900> my<00:04:21.049> window<00:04:21.350> crank
