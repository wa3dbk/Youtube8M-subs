00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.080
 as you are seeing below 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.719

 the yellow strip 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.449
 the end will come 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.309
 the little one will disappear 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:54.550

 the same. 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.300
 much more resistant 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.300
 we will destroy harder things 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.729
 we will also create the shovel 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.589
 in this way hotel two sticks here 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:40.870
 I'm stone on it 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.969
 with the ball it will be easier instead it is bad 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.659
 the earth 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.550

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.379
 4 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.240
 arthritis and also 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.770
 the choice 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.219
 or 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:03.819
 even the sickle for 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.389
 but this will serve me in the future if you want to camp but for the cultivation of 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.719
 Milan 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.779

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.779
 we tend to ours or shock 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.380
 there are several things you can do that fucking box 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.960
 like the door 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.369
 positioning it this way 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:32.169
 and take it 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.240
 now the door we are going to replace 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.979
 to ours 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.110
 small insignificant cube 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.870
 and from here we see 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.499
 you need the right police state key these thing 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.499
 it makes no difference 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:51.210
 you could even create 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.210
 lagoon crate in which to put the stuff 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.910
 putting 9 pieces not this way if you don't have it does nothing 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:06.689
 for cleaning a little 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.169
 as far as I have to put that 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.439
 what does not use turquoise will die 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.449
 will stay there forever 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:16.649
 then 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:20.809
 I like positioning the stone in the same way 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:23.949
 we create a furnace 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.180
 that 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.419
 used with coal 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:29.869
 we could 

00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:32.969
 the in-flight stone 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:35.969
