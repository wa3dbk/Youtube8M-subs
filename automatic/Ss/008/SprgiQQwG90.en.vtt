that<00:01:50.000> understanding<00:01:51.000> those<00:01:51.149> questions<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
that understanding those questions is a

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.810 
that understanding those questions is a
little<00:01:52.409> tricky<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.039> one<00:01:53.250> needs<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.550> have<00:01:53.789> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
little tricky so one needs to have a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.149 
little tricky so one needs to have a
very<00:01:54.119> very<00:01:54.390> good<00:01:54.659> grasp<00:01:55.050> on<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.380> basic

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
very very good grasp on the basic

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.460 
very very good grasp on the basic
concepts<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.390> does<00:01:57.690> have<00:01:57.929> a<00:01:57.960> grasp<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
concepts if one does have a grasp on the

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.169 
concepts if one does have a grasp on the
concepts<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.369> quantitative<00:01:59.850> section

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
concepts the quantitative section

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.980 
concepts the quantitative section
becomes<00:02:00.960> easier<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.220> grounding<00:02:03.179> for<00:02:03.780> one

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
becomes easier so the grounding for one

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.169 
becomes easier so the grounding for one
to<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.319> well<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.530> quant<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.490> very<00:02:06.090> well

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
to do well in quant is to do very well

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.840 
to do well in quant is to do very well
in<00:02:06.569> terms<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.020> concepts<00:02:07.530> which<00:02:08.429> means<00:02:08.640> you

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
in terms of concepts which means you

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.609 
in terms of concepts which means you
have<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> revise<00:02:09.300> concepts<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.080> ensure<00:02:10.590> that

have to revise concepts and ensure that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.440 
have to revise concepts and ensure that

reading comprehension area is one which

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.930 
reading comprehension area is one which
is<00:02:47.459> slightly<00:02:47.730> tricky<00:02:48.239> because<00:02:48.420> cat<00:02:49.260> ask<00:02:49.500> ask

really<00:02:59.400> read<00:03:00.359> with<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.290> lot<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.470> interest<00:03:01.980> so

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
really read with a lot of interest so

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.580 
really read with a lot of interest so
when<00:03:02.730> such<00:03:02.910> passages<00:03:03.150> are<00:03:03.540> given<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.840> cat<00:03:04.109> you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
when such passages are given in cat you

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.940 
when such passages are given in cat you
find<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.980> reading<00:03:05.459> speed<00:03:05.579> dips<00:03:06.329> low<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.200> when

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
find the reading speed dips low and when

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.979 
find the reading speed dips low and when
your<00:03:08.100> speed<00:03:08.370> comes<00:03:08.670> down<00:03:09.000> you'll<00:03:09.660> find<00:03:09.900> that

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
your speed comes down you'll find that

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.300 
your speed comes down you'll find that
you<00:03:10.079> are<00:03:10.170> not<00:03:10.260> able<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.620> attempt<00:03:10.890> as<00:03:10.980> many

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you are not able to attempt as many

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.240 
you are not able to attempt as many
questions<00:03:11.519> as<00:03:11.850> you'd<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:13.440> reading<00:03:13.829> speed

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
questions as you'd like so reading speed

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.600 
questions as you'd like so reading speed
is<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.850> critical<00:03:15.480> element

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
is a critical element

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.140 
is a critical element

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
comprehension one way to work on that is

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.600 
comprehension one way to work on that is
to<00:03:20.330> read<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.690> lot<00:03:20.990> so<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.190> why<00:03:22.280> we<00:03:22.430> tell<00:03:22.580> our

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
to read a lot so that is why we tell our

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.220 
to read a lot so that is why we tell our
own<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.180> do<00:03:23.270> a<00:03:23.300> lot<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.600> regular<00:03:23.900> reading

be<00:04:06.320> that<00:04:06.890> much<00:04:07.040> more<00:04:07.270> recommended<00:04:08.270> for

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
be that much more recommended for

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.380 
be that much more recommended for
reparation<00:04:09.709> in<00:04:09.770> that<00:04:09.920> area<00:04:10.150> now<00:04:11.150> data

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
reparation in that area now data

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.420 
reparation in that area now data
interpretation<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:12.110> something<00:04:12.470> that's<00:04:12.650> easy

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
interpretation is something that's easy

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.430 
interpretation is something that's easy
in<00:04:13.730> terms<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.209> questions<00:04:14.630> but<00:04:15.380> a

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
in terms of the questions but a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.680 
in terms of the questions but a
difficult<00:04:15.860> part<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.489> understand<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.120> data

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
difficult part is to understand the data

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.039 
difficult part is to understand the data
and<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.680> manner<00:04:18.890> in<00:04:18.980> which<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.370> presented

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.960 
and the manner in which it is presented
students<00:04:21.049> should<00:04:21.200> try<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:22.130> ensure<00:04:22.310> that<00:04:22.760> they

to all possibilities is probably the

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.689 
to all possibilities is probably the
best<00:05:26.930> way<00:05:27.199> to<00:05:27.680> go<00:05:27.860> about<00:05:27.889> preparing<00:05:28.160> for<00:05:28.550> cat

best way to go about preparing for cat

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.450 
best way to go about preparing for cat
2008<00:05:29.240> but<00:05:30.229> then<00:05:30.410> if<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:30.680> really<00:05:30.949> want<00:05:31.190> us<00:05:31.370> to

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
2008 but then if you really want us to

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.490 
2008 but then if you really want us to
take<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.090> look<00:05:32.240> at<00:05:32.360> cat<00:05:32.599> 2008<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:33.139> make<00:05:33.470> a

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
take a look at cat 2008 and make a

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.830 
take a look at cat 2008 and make a
prediction<00:05:33.910> these<00:05:34.910> are<00:05:35.090> predictions<00:05:35.570> are

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
prediction these are predictions are

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.450 
prediction these are predictions are
very<00:05:35.990> difficult<00:05:36.199> but<00:05:37.039> if<00:05:37.130> you<00:05:37.190> look<00:05:37.310> at<00:05:37.430> the

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
very difficult but if you look at the

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.980 
very difficult but if you look at the
pattern<00:05:37.910> of<00:05:38.030> cat<00:05:38.330> for<00:05:38.539> the<00:05:38.599> last<00:05:38.750> two<00:05:38.960> years

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
pattern of cat for the last two years

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.680 
pattern of cat for the last two years
you<00:05:39.409> would<00:05:39.500> see<00:05:39.740> that<00:05:39.949> the<00:05:40.729> verbal<00:05:41.090> section<00:05:41.120> is

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
you would see that the verbal section is

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.510 
you would see that the verbal section is
on<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:43.370> tougher<00:05:43.699> side<00:05:43.880> and<00:05:44.210> we<00:05:44.960> expect<00:05:45.349> cat<00:05:45.949> to

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
on the tougher side and we expect cat to

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.360 
on the tougher side and we expect cat to
be<00:05:46.960> maintaining<00:05:47.960> this<00:05:48.110> train<00:05:48.470> for<00:05:48.979> this<00:05:49.099> year

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
be maintaining this train for this year

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.520 
be maintaining this train for this year
but<00:05:49.789> again<00:05:49.880> that<00:05:50.180> depends<00:05:50.509> on<00:05:50.750> what<00:05:51.229> kind<00:05:51.259> of

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
but again that depends on what kind of

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.439 
but again that depends on what kind of
surprise<00:05:52.099> they<00:05:52.250> would<00:05:52.370> spring<00:05:52.610> on<00:05:52.759> us<00:05:52.880> but

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
surprise they would spring on us but

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.640 
surprise they would spring on us but
going<00:05:53.630> with<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.870> pattern<00:05:54.169> of<00:05:54.199> the<00:05:54.259> last<00:05:54.500> two

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
going with the pattern of the last two

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.149 
going with the pattern of the last two
years<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:56.090> verbal<00:05:56.750> section<00:05:56.780> will<00:05:57.680> be<00:05:57.889> on

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
years the the verbal section will be on

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.490 
years the the verbal section will be on
the<00:05:58.520> tougher<00:05:58.789> side<00:05:58.970> that's<00:05:59.539> because<00:05:59.930> they

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
the tougher side that's because they

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.870 
the tougher side that's because they
were<00:06:00.590> five<00:06:00.830> choice<00:06:01.099> in<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.400> last<00:06:01.580> two<00:06:01.729> years

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
were five choice in the last two years

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.909 
were five choice in the last two years
which<00:06:02.360> made<00:06:02.630> things<00:06:02.930> are<00:06:03.590> really<00:06:03.680> difficult

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
which made things are really difficult

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.719 
which made things are really difficult
in<00:06:04.310> that<00:06:04.430> section<00:06:05.080> 1<00:06:06.080> and<00:06:06.349> D<00:06:07.039> I<00:06:07.070> have<00:06:07.580> been

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
in that section 1 and D I have been

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.790 
in that section 1 and D I have been
relatively<00:06:08.120> easier<00:06:08.719> over<00:06:09.259> the<00:06:09.380> last<00:06:09.530> two

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
relatively easier over the last two

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.820 
relatively easier over the last two
years<00:06:09.880> relatively<00:06:10.880> easier<00:06:11.240> so<00:06:11.900> if<00:06:12.229> there<00:06:12.680> is<00:06:12.800> a

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
years relatively easier so if there is a

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.980 
years relatively easier so if there is a
change<00:06:12.949> this<00:06:13.370> year<00:06:13.430> the<00:06:14.060> sections<00:06:14.509> might<00:06:14.719> get

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
change this year the sections might get

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.709 
change this year the sections might get
a<00:06:15.169> little<00:06:15.590> tough<00:06:15.949> this<00:06:16.340> year<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:17.360> if<00:06:17.449> this<00:06:17.539> is

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
a little tough this year so if this is

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.719 
a little tough this year so if this is
what<00:06:17.870> we<00:06:18.020> could<00:06:18.199> possibly<00:06:18.250> say<00:06:19.250> with<00:06:19.430> regards

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
what we could possibly say with regards

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.879 
what we could possibly say with regards
to<00:06:19.789> cat<00:06:20.000> 2008<00:06:20.659> I<00:06:20.900> said<00:06:21.469> again<00:06:21.710> at<00:06:21.800> the

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
to cat 2008 I said again at the

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.680 
to cat 2008 I said again at the
beginning<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.699> best<00:06:22.880> way<00:06:23.090> to<00:06:23.150> go<00:06:23.330> into<00:06:23.509> this

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
beginning the best way to go into this

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.390 
beginning the best way to go into this
exam<00:06:24.080> is<00:06:24.469> to<00:06:24.650> go<00:06:24.800> in<00:06:24.889> with<00:06:25.009> no<00:06:25.250> particular

exam is to go in with no particular

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.490 
exam is to go in with no particular
notion<00:06:25.849> about<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:26.300> exam<00:06:26.599> so<00:06:27.229> when<00:06:27.320> you<00:06:27.380> have

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
notion about the exam so when you have
