00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.159
 but before kneading this dough 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.900
 We need to put our gloves and 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.970
 then we are going to come all about 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.689
 our table remember that the table has 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.079

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.660
 and then we're going to knead this like 10 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.940
 minutes 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.220
 10 minutes later, since we have 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.100
 our mass we are going to put it in a 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.160
 nice plastic we put it here as 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.440
 little ball and we wrap it like that and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.790
 we put it like that and let it rest like 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.890
 about 30 minutes to 45 minutes 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.190
 and while we wait for a sil we are going to 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.080
 prepare our chicken ok to cook 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.680
 our chicken we need to grab this 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.600
 pan and you are going to put just like that one 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.150
 little bit and remember that you have to be 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.060
 over medium high heat to cook this 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.490
 delicious chicken we took the chicken 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.530
 refrigerator and then we're going to unclog it 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.720
 and we are going to put it here 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.760
 but be careful because you can jump 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.430
 Now let's wait until it's done 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.920
 doradito and coffee everywhere as 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.080
 this color from before 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.380
 since it's ready it's about 5 to 6 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.060
 minutes let's pay the fire like this and 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.480

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.410
 Now we only put the chicken here 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.180
 while we make our bread or that already 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.550

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.150

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.150
 we are going to unwrap it so we are going to 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.030
 do in a little roll like that, very nice and what 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.640
 let's cut in half and each bar 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.440

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.720

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.070
 to put a little oil and what 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.290
 we anoint very well and we double it as 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.479
 sandwich we put on a piece of paper 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.180
 waxed and we put it in our 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.669

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.770
 minutes until it is used and seen 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.419
