all of them just happens to be the intro
and<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.500> reason<00:00:19.800> why<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.609> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and the reason why I like this is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.179 
and the reason why I like this is
because<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.510> goes<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.439> theme<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
because it goes with the theme of that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.880 
because it goes with the theme of that
album<00:00:23.570> perfectly<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> way<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.529> beat
