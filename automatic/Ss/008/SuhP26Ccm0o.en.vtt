00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
hi this is Simon from RC lazy just doing

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.639 
hi this is Simon from RC lazy just doing
a<00:00:04.890> video<00:00:05.069> here<00:00:05.490> for<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.879> new<00:00:06.029> Orion<00:00:06.290> stuff<00:00:07.290> so

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
a video here for the new Orion stuff so

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.430 
a video here for the new Orion stuff so
this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.099> Anu<00:00:08.370> Orion<00:00:09.330> speed<00:00:09.960> controller

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
this is the Anu Orion speed controller

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.330 
this is the Anu Orion speed controller
the<00:00:10.710> vortex

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340

modified<00:00:19.380> motors<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.150> would<00:00:21.270> take<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
modified motors so this I would take a a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.660 
modified motors so this I would take a a
little<00:00:22.020> closer<00:00:22.289> look<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.650> these<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.580> all

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
little closer look at these first of all

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.220 
little closer look at these first of all
the<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.880> speedo<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.910> latest

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
the the speedo this is the the latest

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.799 
the the speedo this is the the latest
around<00:00:28.230> speedo<00:00:29.750> 163<00:00:30.750> pounds<00:00:31.140> 95<00:00:31.590> pence<00:00:31.890> and

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
around speedo 163 pounds 95 pence and

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.080 
around speedo 163 pounds 95 pence and
let's<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> look<00:00:34.140> inside<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> box<00:00:38.090> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
let's have a look inside the box and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.530 
let's have a look inside the box and
here<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.510> here's<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:41.030> tiny<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.239> thing

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
here we go here's the tiny little thing

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.709 
here we go here's the tiny little thing
and<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.350> rather<00:00:43.770> nice<00:00:44.329> it's<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:45.539> quite<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
and it's rather nice it's really quite a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.670 
and it's rather nice it's really quite a
small<00:00:46.399> very<00:00:47.399> nicely<00:00:47.700> made<00:00:48.170> for<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> heatsink

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
small very nicely made for the heatsink

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
small very nicely made for the heatsink
on<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> top<00:00:50.070> very<00:00:50.280> nice<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> soldiering

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
on the top very nice bit of soldiering

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.639 
on the top very nice bit of soldiering
already<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> box<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.309> huge<00:00:53.760> long

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
already to go in the box with huge long

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.939 
already to go in the box with huge long
huge<00:00:55.649> long<00:00:55.890> wires<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.710> trim

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
huge long wires so you can you can trim

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.260 
huge long wires so you can you can trim
them<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> length<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.730> nice

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
them to length which is nice

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.090 
them to length which is nice
and<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.809> also<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.079> there's<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.379> very<00:01:01.680> nifty

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and it's also that there's a very nifty

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.969 
and it's also that there's a very nifty
capacitor<00:01:03.059> set<00:01:03.300> look<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.890> know

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
capacitor set look at that you know

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
capacitor set look at that you know
plastic<00:01:05.400> molded<00:01:06.000> case<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.659> really

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
plastic molded case which is really

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.789 
plastic molded case which is really
rather<00:01:07.260> cool<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> year<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.500> speed

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
rather cool so that's the year the speed

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
rather cool so that's the year the speed
control<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.240> elder<00:01:12.540> comes<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> BAM

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
control and the elder comes with a BAM

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140 
control and the elder comes with a BAM
has<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:14.130> heat<00:01:14.280> shrink<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:14.850> bits<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
has some heat shrink and some bits and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.200 
has some heat shrink and some bits and
bobs<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> loads<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> things<00:01:17.210> it's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
bobs and all the loads of things it's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.670 
bobs and all the loads of things it's
that's<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> speed<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:19.200> nice<00:01:19.409> piece<00:01:19.650> of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that's the speed a very nice piece of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.210 
that's the speed a very nice piece of
kit<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:23.549> motor<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> we've<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
kit there and the motor so we've got the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.149 
kit there and the motor so we've got the
orion<00:01:26.880> vortex<00:01:27.780> motor<00:01:28.290> hope<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
orion vortex motor hope it's going to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
orion vortex motor hope it's going to
focus<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.880> motor<00:01:30.119> rather<00:01:30.420> than<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.630> my

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
focus on this motor rather than on my

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.520 
focus on this motor rather than on my
shiny<00:01:31.140> head<00:01:31.460> maybe<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.670> won't<00:01:32.820> okay<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.409> you've

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
shiny head maybe it won't okay so you've

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.249 
shiny head maybe it won't okay so you've
got<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> robotics<00:01:35.369> motor<00:01:35.689> some<00:01:36.689> nice<00:01:36.869> big

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
got the robotics motor some nice big

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.850 
got the robotics motor some nice big
solder<00:01:38.750> buckets<00:01:39.750> there<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> end

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
solder buckets there and that's the end

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.679 
solder buckets there and that's the end
bell<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> sense<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.210> coming<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:42.600> at

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the end and this one is a 7.5 VST pro

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.240 
the end and this one is a 7.5 VST pro
you'll<00:01:47.520> see<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.820> got<00:01:47.970> slots<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> side

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
you'll see it's got slots in the side

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.710 
you'll see it's got slots in the side
and<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.520> believe<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.149> something's<00:01:51.479> dude
