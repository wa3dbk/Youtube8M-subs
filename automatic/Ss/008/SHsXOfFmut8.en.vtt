00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.769
 Hello, I bought a gift in the headset 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.950
 bluetooth headset plantronics m70 here 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 wanted to show so in her that of 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.890
 here is an interesting pictogram 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 see what is russian english 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.869
 voice prompts will speak there 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.210
 on off multipoint 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.680
 this is a few headset can to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.470
 several phones inside several 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.840
 devices connect there so well type 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 slip it so she can fall asleep for 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 saving energy without turning off well yet 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.629
 of the most interesting that is stated here 11 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.210
 hours of conversation well and really so here 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.910
 Somehow I haven't been very long 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.010
 I talk but if you use it so 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.289
 ok then that's 16 days 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.989
 generally work but I don't know on my 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.860
 practice early more than a week I do not charge 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:10.380
 here in this deep slip fashion in general 180 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.000
 days so very light so why 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.990
 I bought what I already use. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.330
 two months everything is fine so 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.100
 the set here is generally minimal 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:28.580
 it is a set of headsets to this here 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.580
 but the arc in his ear and put all and cable 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.970
 so there are some applications there style 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.280
 I do not remember for android and for ios 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.420
 iphone 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:48.750
 well here's the package inside here's this one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.759
 the box opens from below 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:57.680
 what's inside this usb and micro usb 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 charging cable and waste paper all 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.210
 Well, I'm using a headset without 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.470
 this shackle in my ear and so normal 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.330
 sticking out of the big pluses of this headset 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.160
 volume control button plus or minus 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.590
 that is, the double is mostly now 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.010
 headsets and plantronics and jabra all 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.630
 of the left 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.600
 they use one button 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.120
 cyclical sound but this is nonsense 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.010
 who in what drunk delirium thought up it 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.260
 that is, you need to reduce the sound you 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.090
 cycle press but it's usually wheels 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.340
 here everything is normal 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.410
 plus or minus need to reduce reduce 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.190
 increase increase so but this 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.769
 on-off button charging here 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.410
 here from microusb and generally charging from 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.970
 any microusb cable laptop can 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.170
 plug in any outlet where anyone has 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.570
 smart phones that are charged by micro 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.530
 cd and very useful and convenient well and the button 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.049
 out here 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.269
 double tap last dialed 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.120
 the call is very convenient do not need mobile 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.400
 get well very easy well and really 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.180
 turn on attacked charging before 11 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.180
 hours you can talk 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.440
 The headset was bought in the Internet shop 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:18.239
 Shop m Finish so the price with delivery 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:20.160
 503 32 thousand Belarusian rubles so 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.590
 In principle, I recommend this headset 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.540
 shopping here, see uses 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.609
 The surface is so matt to gloss and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.980
 just with a button 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.739
 the truth filed there and about the asphalt hit 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.709
 already a bit like scratches 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.510
 They are such as loyalty is dull but 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.269
 need to see well that is science 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.150
 ok looks comfortable sitting so it 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.459
 m70 but they still have m 90 and some 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.409
 m-75 that is, I do not about it here 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.900
 the instructions say that the instructions for 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.670
 n73 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.989
 90 that is generally completely the same 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:58.000
 headsets what is different is incomprehensible 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.000
 I recommend such a headset
