of the reasons I was scared about
receiving<00:02:16.910> Harper<00:02:17.300> because<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> knew<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.050> would

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
receiving Harper because I knew it would

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.500 
receiving Harper because I knew it would
calm<00:02:18.470> with<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.709> lot<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.010> subscribers<00:02:19.510> actually

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
calm with a lot of subscribers actually

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.690 
calm with a lot of subscribers actually
I<00:02:20.540> didn't<00:02:20.870> think<00:02:21.080> about<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.319> until<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.310> want

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
I didn't think about that until I want

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.770 
I didn't think about that until I want
her<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.720> um<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.610> knew<00:02:25.610> immediately<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.420> this

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
her but um I knew immediately that this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.240 
her but um I knew immediately that this
come<00:02:27.110> with<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.290> lot<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.470> subscribers<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.069> that

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
come with a lot of subscribers and that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.670 
come with a lot of subscribers and that
scared<00:02:28.610> me<00:02:28.700> because<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.180> knew<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:29.840> probably

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
scared me because I knew I probably

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.070 
scared me because I knew I probably
would<00:02:31.040> let<00:02:31.190> them<00:02:31.370> down<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.850> probably<00:02:32.450> would<00:02:32.900> not

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
would let them down I probably would not

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.870 
would let them down I probably would not
make<00:02:34.010> videos<00:02:34.370> or<00:02:34.730> not<00:02:34.970> make<00:02:35.209> good<00:02:35.510> videos<00:02:35.569> and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
make videos or not make good videos and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.360 
make videos or not make good videos and
that<00:02:37.880> was<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.569> big<00:02:38.690> fear<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.959> mine<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.380> sadly

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370
