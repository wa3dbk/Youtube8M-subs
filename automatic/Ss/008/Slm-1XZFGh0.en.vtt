00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.500
 gizmodo i'm matthias here on that 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.570
 do it for you on the way 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.750
 Fritz on the stand of the Chinese 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.250
 manufacturer 2 com or how come one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.630
 others have ever heard of the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 are not really on that yet 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.490
 but European markets have yet to come 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.670
 to pitch there this year and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.619
 to show some products and I am 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.910
 really amazed i have the cattle here 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.030
 comics 780 and looks right too 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.370
 chic from the 55 inch front with full hd 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.309
 display really a really good one 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.680
 Brilliant display great viewing angles and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 special rear complete metal 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.629
 So that reminds me of the Finnish 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.230
 little bit of huawei with 7 in deraa 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.090
 at least everything is really nice 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.879
 a piece of milled metal piece 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.079
 hindendran also has something similar to that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.629
 seven here a little behind 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.520
 fingerprint scanner that is one 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.449
 not a bit English not quite like that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.189
 square as the make 7 but should 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.659
 still work by hanging up 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.159
 and not how to get them from eg 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.680
 different samsung products knows 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.420
 still over it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.490
 bit if the specs one comes in here 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.180
 Qualcomm processor for use 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.680
 2 5 ghz quad-core processor which the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.520
 exactly, unfortunately, I know at the moment 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.640
 also not exactly here is the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.619
 sim cards slot on the left side of it 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.890
 Unfortunately, there is no possibility one 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.840
 insert micro sd card 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.360
 at least that's 32gb 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.159
 internal memory supports third 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.680
 By the way, of all three 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.820
 gigabytes of ram 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.250
 rather, would not make sense yet 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.320
 because here unfortunately only one android 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.520
 version 4.4 on it is yes, however, is 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.899
 here is still not on the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.460
 the German market will be changed 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.450
 probably not until next year 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.130
 but it is just so completely 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.100
 interesting to see what good 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.450
 actually small products 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.640
 at least unknown German unknown 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.390
 Chinese companies on the market 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.159
 bring and if that with 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.569
 in the aggressive price about us in 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.860
 germany to enter the market 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.880
 then you can imagine 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.890
 find many buyers 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.830
 I did not want to pay any for it 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.090
 say a model is a class deeper 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.790
 costs 200 euros 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.290
 and he only meant more than 300 eur 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.420
 or 400 dollars he said 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.200
 So I'm assuming it will be fine 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.050
 Something between 250 and 300 dollars 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.600
 or then probably also cost euro 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.940
 By the way, the rear comes with 3 10 megapixels 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.860
 camera for use in the front are proud 5 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.370
 megapixel 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.480
 the battery was there normal but right 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.160
 big for 2900 sowas in the direction 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.989
 by the way, this phone uses the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.910
 Chinese government became so 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.769
 specially made and with the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.230
 Chinese government officials 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.430
 I like making calls 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.459
 really very good 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.170
 So I really do that if the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.519
 Chinese continue to do so and 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.989
 probably next year or 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.340
 they see a social on the German 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.430
 market you have already new 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.959
 products successor to the be 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.180
 The right way to do it 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.040
 pressure and then have such 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.890
 companies like Samsung really at times 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.549
 Tighten really warm so that's it from 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.690
 me partly comics 780 the video 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.680
 liked then gives me the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.030
 Thumbs up 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.640
 otherwise I want to be happy too 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.720
