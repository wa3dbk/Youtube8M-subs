00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 darkened this moment of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.569
 microsoft position help on channel 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120
 diemme spa italia to bring you a way 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.340
 really very nice I'm talking about 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.580
 minimal ways indeed as he is seeing 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.199
 this mini map on the right is 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.789
 really very well done 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.830
 as you are noticing but we will go to see 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.750
 a little in detail how this works 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.730
 way the first of all a network here in 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.859
 bass introduces us this species of 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 little square that I would be of our mini 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.510
 map to say we will no longer see 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.399
 just make a correct click on the mini 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.350
 map will go away 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.760
 obviously to make the story disappear 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890
 crush like net 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 it will reopen in fact small rooms put us 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.280
 a little because obviously they are 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.200
 dumped there too so had to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.059
 reload immediately obviously immediately 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.190
 fashion has not ended here more 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.530
 many functions that we say yes 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.079
 will activate hold down on the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.180
 our on our map how it will open 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.949
 this new menu here we will go to see 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 a bit all the impositions of the map 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.430
 of the mini map the first setting 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.159
 it would be to have the chunks analyzed, I'd say 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.720
 to keep it low over the five not with 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.220
 more then that would be a bit useless 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.920
 however we put 7 there is also we give 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.869
 what happens venetian fairies render a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.490
 casino also says everyone in that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.799
 square then the other option would be 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.170
 the zoom of the map of course you can 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.150
 set it up a bit like we want here 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.030
 we're going to enjoy the greatness of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.770
 mini map you will want small so big e 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.479
 so it would be a little too big and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 very intrusive so please study 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.259
 keep it normal if you have an intuitive a 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.729
 a bit smaller, maybe even smaller 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.470
 then you see nothing 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.060
 then position yourself you have to knock where 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.729
 put the mini map I recommend you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.409
 put it here at the bottom right because it is 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.360
 the only space where there is nothing then 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.340
 better to keep them here we can activate the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.409
 coordinates under my up but I'm a 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.590
 so even you are so I don't put them 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.290
 then the buttons are also set 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.149
 to zoom the map the mini map are 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.340
 useful, however, even those are not beautiful 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.469
 to see then as usual I take them off 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.810
 we can set the style of 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.119
 pointer diverge to that of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.890
 minecraft cruz and put the arrow not 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.049
 this is also a nice progression from Veneto 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.780
 however you choose a little 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.330
 put on windows you can set the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.790
 it supplies artistic colors daily 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.950
 I recommend you to lands the simple that the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.959
 more beautiful to see then the other option 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.819
 it would be to receive 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.190
 continuous updates on this mode though 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.250
 you want to put them on otherwise you put me on 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.980
 advanced let's say the fps of the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.510
 minimum penn parts when we turn around 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.739
 quickly other things like that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.959
 and then there is the information 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.370
 dell'hadramawt altercation of these 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.290
 let's say that the mode ends here in a 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.120
 very interesting way very useful in the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.940
 survival so I recommend it 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.800
 fully proven of timis if you like it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.330
 finished but also in the comments if it is 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.550
 managed to do something 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.379
 so we were next there to remind you 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.580
 leave a nice boulevard if you cry 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.580
 this is bye bye
