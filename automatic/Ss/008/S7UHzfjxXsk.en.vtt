and<00:00:50.710> future<00:00:51.070> Apple<00:00:51.310> products<00:00:51.610> so<00:00:52.030> what<00:00:52.570> do<00:00:52.720> you

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
and future Apple products so what do you

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.050 
and future Apple products so what do you
do<00:00:52.960> well<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:54.100> theory<00:00:54.310> is<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.580> you<00:00:54.820> supposed

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
do well the theory is that you supposed

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.700 
do well the theory is that you supposed
to<00:00:55.120> get<00:00:55.240> one<00:00:55.480> of<00:00:55.570> these<00:00:55.660> lightning<00:00:56.230> adapters

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
to get one of these lightning adapters

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.090 
to get one of these lightning adapters
which<00:00:57.160> again<00:00:57.490> is<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:58.060> little<00:00:58.450> baby<00:00:58.690> here<00:00:58.960> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
which again is this little baby here and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.680 
which again is this little baby here and
to<00:01:00.100> solve<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.400> problem<00:01:00.670> but<00:01:01.150> I'm<00:01:01.360> going<00:01:01.600> to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
to solve the problem but I'm going to

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.799 
to solve the problem but I'm going to
show<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:01.930> whether<00:01:02.860> it<00:01:03.010> works<00:01:03.190> or<00:01:03.310> not<00:01:03.809> so

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
show you whether it works or not so

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.179 
show you whether it works or not so

and<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.980> will<00:02:26.070> probably<00:02:26.250> start<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.640> play

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
and it will probably start to play

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.890 
and it will probably start to play
I<00:02:27.380> leave<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.500> down<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.920> side<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:30.450> I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
I leave this down to the side and I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.660 
I leave this down to the side and I
select<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.680> iDrive<00:02:31.950> system<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.400> go<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.580> and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
select the iDrive system to go in and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.630 
select the iDrive system to go in and
have<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.820> look<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:35.130> probably<00:02:35.370> hear<00:02:35.550> in

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
have a look so you can probably hear in

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.130 
have a look so you can probably hear in
the<00:02:35.700> background<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.780> playing<00:02:37.020> some

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
the background it's just playing some

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.350 
the background it's just playing some
Foo<00:02:37.290> Fighters<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.940> search<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
Foo Fighters but I can search the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.780 
Foo Fighters but I can search the
artists<00:02:39.690> list<00:02:39.960> on<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.740> car<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.280> see<00:02:41.460> what's<00:02:41.670> on

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
artists list on the car to see what's on

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.700 
artists list on the car to see what's on
there<00:02:42.090> there's<00:02:42.840> all<00:02:42.930> kinds<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.290> rubbish<00:02:43.410> on

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
there there's all kinds of rubbish on

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
there there's all kinds of rubbish on
this<00:02:45.350> quite<00:02:46.350> easily<00:02:46.500> done<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.160> there<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.610> go

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
this quite easily done so there you go

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.580 
this quite easily done so there you go
so<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.000> obviously<00:02:48.150> works<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.080> white<00:02:49.260> cable

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
so it obviously works the white cable

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.330 
so it obviously works the white cable
works<00:02:50.060> with<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.270> iPod<00:02:52.110> Classic<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:53.070> I've

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
works with the iPod Classic and I've

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.280 
works with the iPod Classic and I've
also<00:02:53.460> tested<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> iPhone<00:02:54.450> 4<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
also tested it on the iPhone 4 and it

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
also tested it on the iPhone 4 and it
worked<00:02:55.470> as<00:02:55.650> well<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.160> there<00:02:56.520> was<00:02:56.640> no<00:02:56.760> problem

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
worked as well so there was no problem

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.660 
worked as well so there was no problem
with<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.210> okay<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.950> let's<00:02:59.220> try<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.490> with<00:02:59.610> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
with that okay so let's try it with the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.220 
with that okay so let's try it with the
iPhone<00:02:59.970> 5<00:03:00.210> then<00:03:00.540> let<00:03:01.320> me<00:03:01.410> unplug<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:03.650> okay

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
iPhone 5 then let me unplug this okay

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.680 
iPhone 5 then let me unplug this okay
right<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.400> here's<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.770> adapter<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:13.140> plug<00:03:13.170> it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
right so here's the adapter to plug it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.380 
right so here's the adapter to plug it
there<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:15.780> go<00:03:15.930> now<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.500> connected<00:03:17.190> white<00:03:17.730> into

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
there we go now in connected white into

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.750 
there we go now in connected white into
the<00:03:18.480> lightning<00:03:18.750> adapter<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.830> nothing<00:03:20.489> not

quite funny and I'm just going to plug

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:42.290 
quite funny and I'm just going to plug
the<00:03:33.420> lightning<00:03:33.840> adapter<00:03:34.020> in<00:03:38.959> nothing<00:03:41.180> as<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
the lightning adapter in nothing as you

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.000 
the lightning adapter in nothing as you
can<00:03:42.450> see<00:03:42.600> my<00:03:42.810> phone<00:03:43.050> is<00:03:43.230> going<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.680> bit<00:03:43.800> mental

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
can see my phone is going a bit mental

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.650 
can see my phone is going a bit mental
saying<00:03:44.550> it's<00:03:44.700> charging<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:45.209> not<00:03:45.330> charging

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
saying it's charging it's not charging

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.729 
saying it's charging it's not charging
discharging<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:46.200> not<00:03:46.290> charging<00:03:46.650> it's

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
discharging it's not charging it's

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.370 
discharging it's not charging it's
charging<00:03:47.010> it's<00:03:47.160> not<00:03:47.280> charging<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:52.200> it'll

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
charging it's not charging and it'll

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.759 
charging it's not charging and it'll
just<00:03:52.500> sit<00:03:52.650> there<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:52.830> do<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:57.769> obviously

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
just sit there and do that so obviously

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.940 
just sit there and do that so obviously
in<00:03:59.280> this<00:03:59.340> instance<00:04:00.140> it<00:04:01.140> does<00:04:01.380> not<00:04:01.530> appear<00:04:01.890> that

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
in this instance it does not appear that

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.970 
in this instance it does not appear that
the<00:04:02.340> Lightning<00:04:02.730> adapter<00:04:03.090> works<00:04:03.890> for<00:04:04.890> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
the Lightning adapter works for the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.960 
the Lightning adapter works for the
iDrive<00:04:05.280> system<00:04:07.070> so<00:04:08.070> let's<00:04:08.190> disconnect<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:08.850> and

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
iDrive system so let's disconnect it and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.090 
iDrive system so let's disconnect it and
let's<00:04:09.930> go<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.140> other<00:04:10.260> way<00:04:10.380> let's<00:04:10.650> try<00:04:10.950> and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
let's go the other way let's try and

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.190 
let's go the other way let's try and
plug<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.850> lightning<00:04:12.450> adapter<00:04:12.630> into<00:04:13.080> the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
plug in the lightning adapter into the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.970 
plug in the lightning adapter into the
phone<00:04:13.410> first

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.270 

okay<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.520> it's<00:04:21.640> now<00:04:21.790> in<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:21.940> phone<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:23.280> we'll

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
okay so it's now in the phone and we'll

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.080 
okay so it's now in the phone and we'll
try<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.700> plug<00:04:24.880> in<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:27.100> Y<00:04:27.310> cable<00:04:27.760> directly

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
try and plug in the Y cable directly

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.180 
try and plug in the Y cable directly
into<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:29.200> lightning<00:04:29.530> adapter<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:35.190> and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
into the lightning adapter like so and

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:45.060 
into the lightning adapter like so and
again<00:04:36.280> same<00:04:36.880> problem<00:04:41.400> sits<00:04:42.400> there<00:04:42.670> on<00:04:43.770> off<00:04:44.770> on

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
again same problem sits there on off on

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.200 
again same problem sits there on off on
off<00:04:45.130> on<00:04:45.610> off<00:04:45.790> so<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.030> doesn't<00:04:46.060> even<00:04:46.330> charge

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
off on off so it doesn't even charge

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.870 
off on off so it doesn't even charge
correctly<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.220> guess<00:04:51.430> that<00:04:51.580> pretty<00:04:51.700> much

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
correctly so I guess that pretty much

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.670 
correctly so I guess that pretty much
confirms<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.570> again<00:04:52.780> nothing<00:04:53.260> on<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.440> screen

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
confirms and again nothing on the screen

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.440 
confirms and again nothing on the screen
to<00:04:53.920> say<00:04:54.130> that<00:04:54.550> has<00:04:54.670> anything<00:04:55.000> connected<00:04:55.360> it

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
to say that has anything connected it

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.200 
to say that has anything connected it
still<00:04:55.630> says<00:04:55.840> not<00:04:56.410> connected<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:57.910> guess<00:04:58.060> that

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
still says not connected so I guess that

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.510 
still says not connected so I guess that
confirms<00:04:58.540> that<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.810> doesn't<00:04:58.990> work<00:04:59.490> with<00:05:00.490> a

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
confirms that that doesn't work with a

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.740 
confirms that that doesn't work with a
white<00:05:00.820> cable<00:05:01.030> adapter<00:05:01.510> but<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.920> fun<00:05:03.750> let's

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
white cable adapter but for fun let's

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:12.150 
white cable adapter but for fun let's
just<00:05:05.110> try<00:05:05.530> if<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.490> unplug<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:08.970> Y<00:05:09.970> cable<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:12.070> I

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
just try if I unplug the Y cable and I

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.200 
just try if I unplug the Y cable and I
take<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.460> standard<00:05:14.370> USB<00:05:15.370> cable<00:05:16.650> from<00:05:17.650> Apple

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
take a standard USB cable from Apple

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.150 
take a standard USB cable from Apple
again<00:05:19.210> apologies<00:05:19.690> for<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:20.020> shaky<00:05:20.530> cameras<00:05:21.040> on

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
again apologies for the shaky cameras on

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.980 
again apologies for the shaky cameras on
this<00:05:21.280> it's<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:22.120> anyway<00:05:22.330> I<00:05:22.360> could<00:05:22.510> really<00:05:22.660> do<00:05:22.840> it

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
this it's so anyway I could really do it

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.920 
this it's so anyway I could really do it
and<00:05:24.720> again<00:05:25.980> we'll<00:05:26.980> plug<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:28.600> lightning

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
and again we'll plug the lightning

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.810 
and again we'll plug the lightning
adapter<00:05:29.110> directly<00:05:29.740> in<00:05:29.950> well<00:05:30.430> first<00:05:30.640> of<00:05:30.760> all

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
adapter directly in well first of all

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.030 
adapter directly in well first of all
again<00:05:31.000> we'll<00:05:31.450> show<00:05:31.600> you<00:05:31.660> what<00:05:31.840> happens<00:05:32.140> if<00:05:32.920> I

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
again we'll show you what happens if I

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.500 
again we'll show you what happens if I
plug<00:05:33.250> this<00:05:33.430> directly<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.690> via<00:05:34.900> USB<00:05:35.050> into<00:05:35.800> the

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
plug this directly in via USB into the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.570 
plug this directly in via USB into the
iPod<00:05:37.510> Classic<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:40.030> we<00:05:40.240> get<00:05:40.420> on<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.660> screen<00:05:41.580> as

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
iPod Classic and we get on the screen as

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.340 
iPod Classic and we get on the screen as
it's<00:05:42.760> reading

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.020 

not<00:05:52.350> supportive<00:05:52.830> that's<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.580> reason<00:05:53.880> being

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
not supportive that's the reason being

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.730 
not supportive that's the reason being
because<00:05:54.180> it<00:05:54.419> hasn't<00:05:54.540> got<00:05:54.660> the<00:05:54.780> white<00:05:54.930> cable<00:05:55.139> so

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
because it hasn't got the white cable so

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.110 
because it hasn't got the white cable so
which<00:05:56.070> is<00:05:56.190> not<00:05:56.310> surprising<00:05:56.639> but<00:05:56.699> at<00:05:56.820> least<00:05:56.910> it

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
which is not surprising but at least it

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.320 
which is not surprising but at least it
actually<00:05:57.389> did<00:05:57.479> try<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.690> read<00:05:57.960> the<00:05:58.080> device<00:05:59.330> okay

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
actually did try to read the device okay

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.540 
actually did try to read the device okay
so<00:06:00.389> it's<00:06:00.720> unplug<00:06:01.139> that<00:06:01.169> and<00:06:03.050> plug<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:05.310> Y

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
so it's unplug that and plug the Y

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.820 
so it's unplug that and plug the Y
adapter<00:06:06.020> sorry<00:06:07.020> not<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.410> way<00:06:07.500> that<00:06:07.560> I've<00:06:07.680> did

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
adapter sorry not the way that I've did

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:14.180 
adapter sorry not the way that I've did
a<00:06:07.860> lightning<00:06:08.160> adapter<00:06:08.340> into<00:06:08.880> the<00:06:11.810> original<00:06:13.190> 30

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
a lightning adapter into the original 30

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.189 
a lightning adapter into the original 30
pin<00:06:14.490> connector<00:06:14.520> which<00:06:15.389> is<00:06:15.419> so<00:06:15.900> it<00:06:16.020> would<00:06:16.110> look

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
pin connector which is so it would look

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.400 
pin connector which is so it would look
like<00:06:16.260> this<00:06:17.479> now<00:06:18.479> let's<00:06:18.720> try<00:06:18.930> that<00:06:19.050> in<00:06:19.260> the

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
like this now let's try that in the

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:31.550 
like this now let's try that in the
iPhone<00:06:19.680> 5<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.220> see<00:06:20.340> what<00:06:20.460> happens<00:06:24.590> oops<00:06:30.530> okay

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
iPhone 5 and see what happens oops okay

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:41.480 
iPhone 5 and see what happens oops okay
noise<00:06:32.100> says<00:06:32.699> reading<00:06:40.100> now<00:06:41.100> again<00:06:41.310> not

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
noise says reading now again not

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.700 
noise says reading now again not
supported<00:06:42.000> so<00:06:42.210> it's<00:06:42.389> the<00:06:42.449> same<00:06:42.630> as<00:06:42.750> before<00:06:42.840> but

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
supported so it's the same as before but

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.740 
supported so it's the same as before but
similarly<00:06:44.039> with<00:06:44.520> the<00:06:44.639> what<00:06:45.030> it<00:06:45.150> was<00:06:45.539> doing

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
similarly with the what it was doing

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.750 
similarly with the what it was doing
with<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:45.990> the<00:06:46.199> classic<00:06:46.560> but<00:06:46.740> similarly<00:06:47.250> or

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
with the the classic but similarly or

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.219 
with the the classic but similarly or
what<00:06:47.940> differently<00:06:48.389> I<00:06:48.419> should<00:06:48.630> say<00:06:48.810> is<00:06:48.990> that

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
what differently I should say is that

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:51.529 
what differently I should say is that
it's<00:06:49.530> actually<00:06:49.680> charging<00:06:50.280> the<00:06:50.820> iPhone<00:06:51.150> 5<00:06:51.360> this

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
it's actually charging the iPhone 5 this

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.900 
it's actually charging the iPhone 5 this
time<00:06:51.600> I'm<00:06:52.229> not<00:06:52.289> just<00:06:52.550> zipping<00:06:53.550> in<00:06:53.669> and<00:06:53.760> then

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
time I'm not just zipping in and then

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.640 
time I'm not just zipping in and then
zipping<00:06:54.240> out<00:06:54.330> well<00:06:54.840> who's<00:06:55.020> doing<00:06:55.229> before<00:06:55.500> when

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
zipping out well who's doing before when

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.060 
zipping out well who's doing before when
I<00:06:55.680> had<00:06:55.740> the<00:06:55.919> white<00:06:56.039> cable<00:06:56.250> plugged<00:06:56.550> in<00:06:57.169> so<00:06:58.169> I'm

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
I had the white cable plugged in so I'm

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.370 
I had the white cable plugged in so I'm
guessing<00:06:59.490> some<00:07:00.419> kind<00:07:00.450> of<00:07:00.630> software<00:07:00.960> update<00:07:01.229> is

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
guessing some kind of software update is

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.650 
guessing some kind of software update is
required<00:07:01.560> from<00:07:02.039> BMW<00:07:02.280> to<00:07:03.210> get<00:07:03.330> these<00:07:03.450> to<00:07:03.630> work

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
required from BMW to get these to work

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.879 
required from BMW to get these to work
correctly<00:07:03.930> a<00:07:04.410> bit<00:07:04.919> of<00:07:05.010> a<00:07:05.039> shame<00:07:05.310> but<00:07:06.060> for<00:07:06.270> now

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889 
correctly a bit of a shame but for now

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.440 
correctly a bit of a shame but for now
it<00:07:07.889> doesn't<00:07:08.099> look<00:07:08.250> like<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:08.760> lightning

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
it doesn't look like the lightning

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.300 
it doesn't look like the lightning

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.390 
into the iDrive system of course you can
just<00:07:19.260> use<00:07:19.410> a<00:07:19.949> auxiliary<00:07:21.349> cable<00:07:22.349> just<00:07:23.220> the

whatever media off your phone itself and
that<00:07:35.250> will<00:07:35.370> work<00:07:35.430> but<00:07:37.910> you<00:07:38.910> can't<00:07:39.180> use<00:07:39.330> any<00:07:39.539> of
