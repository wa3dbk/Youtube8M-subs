to for some of the more complicated ones
and<00:00:09.510> less<00:00:09.719> obvious<00:00:10.050> ones<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.320> first<00:00:10.469> episode

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
and less obvious ones the first episode

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.830 
and less obvious ones the first episode
was<00:00:11.160> featured<00:00:11.550> not<00:00:11.670> once<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.090> was<00:00:12.389> not<00:00:12.809> that

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
was featured not once that was not that

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.509 
was featured not once that was not that
hard<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> do<00:00:13.410> not<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> wasn't<00:00:14.040> hard<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> do

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
hard to do not that I wasn't hard to do

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.630 
hard to do not that I wasn't hard to do
but<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.660> they<00:00:15.809> were<00:00:16.070> kind<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.130> once<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.400> got

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
but that they were kind of once you got

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.010 
but that they were kind of once you got
simpler<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> first<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.660> we're<00:00:18.779> gonna<00:00:18.900> be

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
simpler so the first one we're gonna be

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.359 
simpler so the first one we're gonna be
doing<00:00:19.199> here<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.470> jump<00:00:19.770> tree<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.039> good<00:00:20.220> for

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
doing here is jump tree was good for

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.700 
doing here is jump tree was good for
something<00:00:20.430> which<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.820> actually<00:00:21.439> not<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> ball

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
something which is actually not the ball

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.410 
something which is actually not the ball
in<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> goal<00:00:23.220> off<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.760> wall<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.210> what<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
in the goal off the wall and what you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.640 
in the goal off the wall and what you
wanna<00:00:24.539> do<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:24.990> want<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> set<00:00:25.439> up<00:00:25.470> like

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
wanna do here if you want to set up like

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.279 
wanna do here if you want to set up like
I<00:00:26.090> won't<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.330> match<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.019> want<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
I won't be one match and you want to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.009 
I won't be one match and you want to
just<00:00:28.410> set<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:29.060> base<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.269> want<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.810> I

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
just set a base you want to just like I

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.290 
just set a base you want to just like I
went<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.500> Barcelona<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.120> night

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
went just Barcelona and I think a night

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
went just Barcelona and I think a night
it<00:00:33.540> doesn't<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> difference<00:00:34.230> but

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it doesn't really make a difference but

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.139 
it doesn't really make a difference but
what<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> want<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> key<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.059> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
by like holding that in it's just really

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
by like holding that in it's just really
about<00:01:00.690> getting<00:01:00.960> did<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.010> angles<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
about getting did like angles right you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.799 
about getting did like angles right you
just<00:01:02.820> play<00:01:03.030> around<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.420> bit<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.690> you'll

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
just play around a bit and you'll

just play around a bit and you'll
eventually<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.070> easy<00:01:05.309> 20

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
eventually get that's an easy 20

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.940 
eventually get that's an easy 20
gamerscore<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.900> human<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.680> thought

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
gamerscore and like human that I thought

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.859 
gamerscore and like human that I thought
was<00:01:08.159> gonna<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.400> quite<00:01:08.670> difficult<00:01:08.880> again<00:01:09.360> like

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
was gonna be quite difficult again like

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.870 
was gonna be quite difficult again like
initially<00:01:10.320> looking<00:01:10.590> at<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.430> reality<00:01:11.580> like

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
initially looking at but in reality like

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.750 
initially looking at but in reality like
I<00:01:12.180> said<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.630> quite<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.080> easy<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.760> second

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
I said it is quite an easy one second

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.789 
I said it is quite an easy one second
one<00:01:14.850> we're<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.119> first<00:01:15.659> today<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.229> gonna<00:01:16.470> be

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
one we're going first today is gonna be

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980 
one we're going first today is gonna be
I<00:01:17.400> think<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.780> very

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
