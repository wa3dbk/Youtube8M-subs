00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 hey ho people and welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.020
 my annual statistics 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.920
 I do not really have that much 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.250
 review 2014 what do I know video 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.950
 I actually wanted to 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.730
 one of the best ten books of 2014 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.920
 to make a video 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.260
 but when I chose the books 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.179
 I noticed that all 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.949
 Continuation of books I am 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.199
 last year already showed so 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.180
 Mostly I believe six of these 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.460
 ten books will be continued by 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.980
 books I keep showing and the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.570
 anyway all already know here and I 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.640
 Do not know if you like the video anyway 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.629
 I want to see if I turn it off anyway 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.550
 should be for you because I actually 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.350
 keep talking about these books well 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.000
 if you want to see something like that then 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.590
 drives me the comments but now 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.600
 is it first about the statistics because 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.570
 I've evaluated a few numbers and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.609
 calculated and done and I want that 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.800
 you like to recite like my reading 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.739
 year 2014 I'm so lost 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.079
 even really cool notes made loud 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.130
 gottfried really document everything 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.170
 I read 10 51 books in 2004 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.380
 under it are also two three 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.350
 novellus and two you think so 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.630
 So no full books but me 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.330
 have so registered and it stands 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.009
 So I had a goal of 50 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.450
 books and thus have it 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.340
 reached and I am pretty much 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.430
 proud 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.090
 In total, these had 51 books 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.509
 totaled 18 1960 pages that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.680
 means I have about 1500 80 pages 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.140
 read per month which in turn is 52.6 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.000
 Of course, I have pages per day 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.450
 also award star ratings and me 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.180
 I have twice given a star once 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:56.479
 two strikers 12 x 3 stars 23 times four 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.130
 stars and twelve times five stars 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.200
 those who have taken care now know that 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.000
 only 50 books added up i have 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.820
 no idea where I forgot what 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.460
 my most read pipes is youth book 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.890
 in the direction of fantasy with 15 books and 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.010
 the second place is shared by the others 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.160
 book of copies and the contemporary 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.200
 So contemporary books with each 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.319
 nine books and the rest is one 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.350
 I distributed a little bit in 2014 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.170
 Twelve purely attacked and I have 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.140
 seven finished and 18 of my read 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.690
 books would be single volumes i would 2014 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.430
 in a book, it would be up 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.830
 any case a teen book probably 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.709
 a dystopia or a fantasy book that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.880
 book would have 372 pages that's the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 cut him no longer calculated 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.390
 have a page number of the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.270
 books I have read and it 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.070
 would have got 38 4 stars because that is 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.440
 the average rating I use this 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.890
 year was awarded to what yes and 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.750
 was my book statistic for the year 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.340
 2014 I really like to pay and 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.470
 statistics and so forth and that's why 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.459
 I figured that out and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.080
 picked out and investigated and me 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.730
 Hope you liked that and you 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.800
 I can in the comments times 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.940
 reveal how many books I read 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.940
 2014 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.739
 If I am still there with my 51 books 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.989
 pretty good, or if I am 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.150
 am totally bad or if that is so 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.860
 the balance holds and that with the mars 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.510
 is and yes that would be me 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.400
 it was interesting for that too 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.840
 this video I wish you one more 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.320
 nice day see you next time 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.320
