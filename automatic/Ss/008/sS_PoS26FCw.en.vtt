very easy so let's go down what
basically<00:00:56.280> what's<00:00:56.520> happening<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.090> whenever<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
basically what's happening is whenever I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.740 
basically what's happening is whenever I
when<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:58.949> extended<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.270> pressed<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
when it was extended and I pressed the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.479 
when it was extended and I pressed the
button<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.230> gonna<00:01:01.350> reset<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:01.980> Pistons

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
button it's gonna reset all the Pistons

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
button it's gonna reset all the Pistons
push<00:01:02.789> them<00:01:03.030> back<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.359> then<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:03.930> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
push them back and then you see that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.609 
push them back and then you see that
little<00:01:04.290> bugger<00:01:05.240> extending<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:07.260> upward

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
little bugger extending and going upward

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.330 
little bugger extending and going upward
let<00:01:07.799> me<00:01:07.860> show<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.040> again<00:01:08.780> now<00:01:10.040> as<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.280> see

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
client this is the original world is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
client this is the original world is
saying<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> again<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.740> started<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.189> up

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
saying it again so I just started it up

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.969 
saying it again so I just started it up
but<00:01:21.210> what's<00:01:21.600> happening<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> when<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
but what's happening is that when it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.460 
but what's happening is that when it
goes<00:01:23.280> up

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
goes up

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.040 
goes up
and<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.100> stumbles<00:01:25.670> upon<00:01:25.790> that<00:01:26.180> little<00:01:26.810> bugger

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
and it stumbles upon that little bugger

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.320 
and it stumbles upon that little bugger
it's<00:01:27.320> gonna<00:01:27.440> go<00:01:27.590> out<00:01:27.620> of<00:01:27.860> sync<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:28.430> as<00:01:29.120> you<00:01:29.210> can

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
it's gonna go out of sync so as you can

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.780 
it's gonna go out of sync so as you can
see<00:01:29.420> it's<00:01:29.540> now<00:01:29.660> going<00:01:30.040> reasonably<00:01:31.040> leveled

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
see it's now going reasonably leveled

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.910 
see it's now going reasonably leveled
but<00:01:32.390> for<00:01:32.540> some<00:01:32.690> people<00:01:33.050> it<00:01:33.170> was<00:01:33.320> causing<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.800> to

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
but for some people it was causing it to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.360 
but for some people it was causing it to
go<00:01:34.040> out<00:01:34.190> of<00:01:34.220> sync<00:01:34.580> now<00:01:35.540> how<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.080> fix<00:01:36.560> it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
go out of sync now how to fix it

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.860 
go out of sync now how to fix it
what<00:01:37.910> you<00:01:38.000> do<00:01:38.120> is<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.330> go<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.660> white

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
what you do is you go to the white

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.710 
what you do is you go to the white
wiring<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:41.060> that's<00:01:41.210> actually<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.540> white

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
wiring here so that's actually the white

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.560 
wiring here so that's actually the white
whirring<00:01:42.080> I<00:01:42.170> fixed<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:43.340> was<00:01:43.490> causing<00:01:43.730> the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
whirring I fixed that was causing the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.620 
whirring I fixed that was causing the
issue<00:01:45.380> for<00:01:45.620> some<00:01:45.770> people<00:01:46.160> you<00:01:47.000> knock<00:01:47.210> off<00:01:47.390> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
issue for some people you knock off the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.810 
issue for some people you knock off the
repeater<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:49.010> what<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.250> do<00:01:49.370> is<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.670> make

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
repeater and what you do is you make

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.050 
repeater and what you do is you make
five<00:01:50.750> blocks<00:01:51.080> like<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:51.590> with<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.490> block<00:01:52.760> there

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
five blocks like this with a block there

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.840 
five blocks like this with a block there
and<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.300> block<00:01:53.510> there<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.070> place<00:01:55.430> another

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
and a block there and you place another

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.630 
and a block there and you place another
torch<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.810> place<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.650> one-take<00:01:58.160> repeater<00:01:58.520> and

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
torch you place a one-take repeater and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.540 
torch you place a one-take repeater and
a<00:01:58.820> one-take<00:01:59.180> repeater<00:02:00.220> you<00:02:01.220> need<00:02:01.370> some

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
a one-take repeater you need some

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:10.040 
a one-take repeater you need some
glowstone<00:02:03.310> then<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.550> send<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.240> up<00:02:07.300> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
glowstone then you send this up and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.950 
glowstone then you send this up and
into<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.860> block<00:02:11.040> above<00:02:11.310> there<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.700> well

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
into the block above there as well

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.600 
into the block above there as well
previously<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.260> was<00:02:13.440> using<00:02:13.800> one<00:02:14.070> repeater<00:02:14.490> and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
previously I was using one repeater and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.080 
previously I was using one repeater and
sending<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.150> into<00:02:15.300> two<00:02:15.690> different<00:02:17.090> yeah

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
sending it into two different yeah

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.230 
sending it into two different yeah
basically<00:02:18.390> two<00:02:18.750> different<00:02:18.780> things<00:02:20.240> and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
basically two different things and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.620 
basically two different things and
whenever<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.260> got<00:02:22.470> D<00:02:22.740> powered<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:24.420> would

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
whenever this got D powered it would

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.510 
whenever this got D powered it would
cause<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:26.160> thing<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.760> send<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.630> one-take<00:02:28.020> pulse

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
cause the thing to send a one-take pulse

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.840 
cause the thing to send a one-take pulse
but<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:31.170> again<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.650> knock<00:02:32.100> off<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.580> torch

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
but so again just knock off the torch

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.340 
but so again just knock off the torch
place<00:02:33.390> five<00:02:33.720> blocks<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.750> block<00:02:36.960> there<00:02:37.200> and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
place five blocks the block there and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.680 
place five blocks the block there and
block<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.700> basically<00:02:38.910> repeat<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
block there so you basically repeat this

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.990 
block there so you basically repeat this
process<00:02:39.960> all<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.800> way<00:02:40.830> up

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
you guys remember that little bugger

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.650 
you guys remember that little bugger
going<00:02:55.710> out<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.690> well<00:02:58.250> at<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.400> level<00:02:59.660> as

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
going out there well at this level as

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.900 
going out there well at this level as
you<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.900> see<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.260> mean<00:03:01.440> there<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:01.980> still<00:03:02.250> does

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
you can see I mean there it still does

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.620 
you can see I mean there it still does
it<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:05.100> has<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.310> do<00:03:05.520> with<00:03:05.550> coming<00:03:06.540> from

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
it but that has to do with coming from

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.830 
it but that has to do with coming from
above<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.320> below<00:03:07.980> here

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
above so below here

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.800 
above so below here
it<00:03:09.840> doesn't<00:03:10.430> appear<00:03:11.430> anymore<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.150> if<00:03:12.690> you

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
it doesn't appear anymore and if you

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.780 
it doesn't appear anymore and if you
were<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.320> all<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.590> way<00:03:13.710> up<00:03:13.800> it<00:03:14.580> just

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
were to do this all the way up it just

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.420 
were to do this all the way up it just
completely<00:03:15.180> disappears<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:17.040> that's<00:03:17.280> how<00:03:17.370> you

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
completely disappears so that's how you

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.340 
completely disappears so that's how you
fix<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.970> I'm<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.630> going<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> show<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.140> how

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.610 
fix it I'm just going to show you how
you<00:03:19.410> how<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.340> wire<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.700> up<00:03:20.970> at<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.300> top<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.410> let

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
you how you wire it up at the top so let

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.430 
you how you wire it up at the top so let
me<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.860> pause<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.370> go<00:03:23.460> there<00:03:24.080> at<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.230> top

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
me just pause and go there at the top

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.740 
me just pause and go there at the top
it's<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:26.010> little<00:03:26.040> different<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.030> mean<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.510> still

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
it's a little different I mean you still

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.490 
it's a little different I mean you still
knock<00:03:27.960> off<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:29.420> weight<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.930> was<00:03:31.080> still<00:03:31.290> there

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
knock off the weight it was still there

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.010 
knock off the weight it was still there
you<00:03:32.100> still<00:03:32.310> knock<00:03:32.520> off<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.850> repeater<00:03:33.150> but

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
you still knock off the repeater but

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.680 
you still knock off the repeater but
what<00:03:34.740> you<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:36.090> don't<00:03:36.270> need<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.480> use

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
what you get is you don't need to use

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
what you get is you don't need to use
the<00:03:36.870> glowstone<00:03:37.380> basically<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.160> sums<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.550> up

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
the glowstone basically that sums it up

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.630 
the glowstone basically that sums it up
so

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
so

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.520 
so
look<00:03:43.240> there<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:45.330> yeah<00:03:46.360> repeat<00:03:46.870> the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
look there and that yeah repeat the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.800 
look there and that yeah repeat the
previous<00:03:47.950> process<00:03:48.670> all<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.940> way<00:03:48.970> up<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.450> I

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
previous process all the way up and I

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.690 
previous process all the way up and I
hope<00:03:49.990> you<00:03:50.290> don't<00:03:50.470> have<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.680> big<00:03:51.070> elevator<00:03:51.490> like

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
hope you don't have a big elevator like

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.370 
hope you don't have a big elevator like
this<00:03:51.940> which<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.270> could<00:03:52.390> also<00:03:52.450> use<00:03:52.750> mcedit

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
this which you could also use mcedit

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.340 
this which you could also use mcedit
and<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:54.370> should<00:03:54.550> fix<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.000> whole<00:03:55.180> thing<00:03:55.480> now

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
and that should fix the whole thing now

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.930 
and that should fix the whole thing now
before<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:56.860> stop<00:03:57.070> this<00:03:57.160> video<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.520> actually<00:03:57.700> want

the<00:04:17.470> little<00:04:17.709> buggers<00:04:18.100> are<00:04:18.250> gone<00:04:18.459> so<00:04:18.790> we<00:04:19.000> just

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
the little buggers are gone so we just

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.060 
the little buggers are gone so we just
press<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.690> button<00:04:19.840> as<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:20.590> can<00:04:20.769> see<00:04:20.920> they

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
press the button as you can see they

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.120 
press the button as you can see they
retract<00:04:21.489> an<00:04:21.820> extent<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.480> there's<00:04:22.660> no<00:04:22.810> little

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
retract an extent and there's no little

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.490 
retract an extent and there's no little
ya<00:04:24.130> know<00:04:24.730> little<00:04:25.000> gremlins<00:04:25.510> messing<00:04:26.050> stuff<00:04:26.170> up

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
ya know little gremlins messing stuff up

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.960 
ya know little gremlins messing stuff up
now<00:04:27.030> what<00:04:28.030> have<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.180> done<00:04:29.220> so<00:04:30.220> we<00:04:30.460> have<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.730> join

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
now what have I done so we have to join

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.970 
now what have I done so we have to join
fast<00:04:31.360> elevator<00:04:31.810> which<00:04:32.050> will<00:04:32.230> be<00:04:32.320> added<00:04:32.530> in

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
fast elevator which will be added in

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.100 
fast elevator which will be added in
which<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:33.850> can<00:04:33.970> find<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.360> world<00:04:34.540> file<00:04:34.840> I

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
which you can find in the world file I

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.770 
which you can find in the world file I
have<00:04:35.770> added<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.280> little<00:04:36.730> bit<00:04:36.970> longer<00:04:37.270> delay

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
have added a little bit longer delay

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.600 
have added a little bit longer delay
down<00:04:38.110> here<00:04:38.560> because<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:38.980> had<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.220> feeling<00:04:39.580> that

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
down here because I had the feeling that

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.670 
down here because I had the feeling that
you<00:04:40.090> didn't<00:04:40.330> have<00:04:40.420> a<00:04:40.480> lot<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.780> time<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.410> get<00:04:41.560> in

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
you didn't have a lot of time to get in

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.220 
you didn't have a lot of time to get in
the<00:04:41.800> elevator<00:04:41.920> in<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.580> original<00:04:43.030> elevator<00:04:43.420> so

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
the elevator in the original elevator so

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.200 
the elevator in the original elevator so
that's<00:04:44.770> been<00:04:44.920> changed<00:04:45.340> I've<00:04:45.550> got<00:04:45.730> some<00:04:45.910> fancy

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
that's been changed I've got some fancy

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.210 
that's been changed I've got some fancy
iron<00:04:46.840> blocks<00:04:47.050> now<00:04:47.320> instead<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.710> Pistons<00:04:50.220> all

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
iron blocks now instead of Pistons all

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.000 
iron blocks now instead of Pistons all
this<00:04:51.550> work<00:04:51.850> has<00:04:52.030> also<00:04:52.210> been<00:04:52.330> done<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:53.010> the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
this work has also been done on the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.580 
this work has also been done on the
other<00:04:54.730> elevator<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:55.510> I've<00:04:55.690> got<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.200> small

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
other elevator so I've got the small

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.159 
other elevator so I've got the small
fast<00:04:56.919> elevator<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:58.210> works<00:04:58.540> which<00:04:58.960> you<00:04:58.990> can

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
fast elevator it works which you can

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.040 
fast elevator it works which you can
find<00:04:59.350> in<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.650> world<00:04:59.800> file<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:01.390> goes<00:05:01.630> up<00:05:01.840> nice

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
find in the world file and goes up nice

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.250 
find in the world file and goes up nice
and<00:05:02.530> smooth<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.460> then<00:05:03.669> down<00:05:04.570> here<00:05:05.080> I've

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
and smooth and then down here I've

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.290 
and smooth and then down here I've
actually<00:05:05.530> made<00:05:06.130> two<00:05:06.520> different<00:05:06.730> kinds<00:05:07.210> of

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
actually made two different kinds of

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.120 
actually made two different kinds of
elevators<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.110> just<00:05:08.320> wanted<00:05:08.500> to<00:05:08.590> show<00:05:08.860> that

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
elevators and I just wanted to show that

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.650 
elevators and I just wanted to show that
so<00:05:12.130> we've<00:05:12.280> got<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.550> medium<00:05:12.880> fast<00:05:13.150> elevator

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
so we've got the medium fast elevator

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.280 
so we've got the medium fast elevator
that<00:05:13.930> works<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:15.460> I've<00:05:15.790> also<00:05:16.090> rotated<00:05:16.720> it<00:05:16.840> 90

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
that works and I've also rotated it 90

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.600 
that works and I've also rotated it 90
degrees<00:05:17.320> just<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:20.190> show<00:05:21.190> that<00:05:21.400> it's<00:05:21.550> not

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
degrees just to show that it's not

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.670 
degrees just to show that it's not
affected<00:05:22.210> by<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.450> north-south<00:05:23.139> quirk<00:05:23.440> so

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
affected by the north-south quirk so

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.290 
affected by the north-south quirk so
that's<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:24.070> other<00:05:24.160> medium<00:05:24.610> fast<00:05:24.850> elevator

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
that's the other medium fast elevator

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.990 
that's the other medium fast elevator
but<00:05:25.960> then<00:05:26.110> I've<00:05:26.260> also<00:05:26.440> made<00:05:26.860> two<00:05:27.400> smooth

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
but then I've also made two smooth

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.480 
but then I've also made two smooth
elevators<00:05:28.600> these<00:05:29.080> run<00:05:29.350> twice<00:05:29.650> as<00:05:29.710> slow<00:05:30.070> and

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
elevators these run twice as slow and

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.110 
elevators these run twice as slow and
I'm<00:05:31.360> thinking<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:32.050> am<00:05:32.139> going<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.980> ask<00:05:33.160> as<00:05:33.610> zoom

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
I'm thinking I am going to ask as zoom

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.260 
I'm thinking I am going to ask as zoom
avoid<00:05:34.450> to<00:05:34.900> put<00:05:35.590> this<00:05:35.740> on<00:05:35.919> his<00:05:36.100> server<00:05:36.370> yes<00:05:36.850> he

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
avoid to put this on his server yes he

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.420 
avoid to put this on his server yes he
has<00:05:37.419> a<00:05:37.450> pretty<00:05:37.780> good<00:05:37.990> server<00:05:38.290> and<00:05:38.889> I'm<00:05:39.160> sort<00:05:39.370> of

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
has a pretty good server and I'm sort of

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.520 
has a pretty good server and I'm sort of
curious<00:05:39.750> because<00:05:40.750> I<00:05:40.840> think<00:05:40.900> this<00:05:41.290> actually

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
curious because I think this actually

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.480 
curious because I think this actually
might<00:05:41.860> work<00:05:42.310> in<00:05:42.700> sp<00:05:43.660> on<00:05:43.930> his<00:05:44.560> server<00:05:44.830> don't

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
might work in sp on his server don't

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.880 
might work in sp on his server don't
can't<00:05:45.850> guarantee<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.419> on<00:05:46.510> everyone's<00:05:46.930> but

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
can't guarantee it on everyone's but

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.830 
can't guarantee it on everyone's but
I'll<00:05:48.280> add<00:05:48.490> in<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.730> description<00:05:49.390> if<00:05:49.510> I<00:05:49.660> manage

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
I'll add in the description if I manage

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.960 
I'll add in the description if I manage
to<00:05:50.080> get<00:05:50.200> it<00:05:50.290> to<00:05:50.410> work<00:05:50.590> on<00:05:50.830> his<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.700> in<00:05:51.880> the

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
to get it to work on his and in the

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.260 
to get it to work on his and in the
comments<00:05:52.710> yes<00:05:53.710> or<00:05:53.919> no<00:05:54.040> but<00:05:54.790> yeah<00:05:54.940> that's<00:05:55.090> a

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
comments yes or no but yeah that's a

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.630 
comments yes or no but yeah that's a
smooth<00:05:55.540> elevator<00:05:55.840> and<00:05:56.290> yet<00:05:56.830> they<00:05:57.130> all<00:05:57.250> go<00:05:57.430> up

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
smooth elevator and yet they all go up

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.600 
smooth elevator and yet they all go up
and<00:05:57.910> down<00:05:58.060> that's<00:05:58.540> not<00:05:59.310> really<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.370> problem

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
and down that's not really the problem

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.310 
and down that's not really the problem
all<00:06:01.090> leveled<00:06:01.690> out<00:06:01.810> as<00:06:02.050> well<00:06:02.260> so<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.900> can<00:06:05.050> find

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
all leveled out as well so you can find

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.990 
all leveled out as well so you can find
all<00:06:05.470> these<00:06:05.680> you<00:06:06.070> can<00:06:06.190> either<00:06:06.280> fix<00:06:06.760> the

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
all these you can either fix the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.510 
all these you can either fix the
elevator<00:06:07.330> you<00:06:07.419> have<00:06:07.720> or<00:06:08.110> you<00:06:08.979> can<00:06:09.130> just<00:06:09.280> copy

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
elevator you have or you can just copy

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.100 
elevator you have or you can just copy
and<00:06:10.180> paste<00:06:10.720> stuff<00:06:11.080> from<00:06:11.680> this<00:06:11.830> world<00:06:12.070> file<00:06:12.370> and

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
and paste stuff from this world file and

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.570 
and paste stuff from this world file and
like<00:06:14.110> I<00:06:14.229> already<00:06:14.470> said<00:06:14.710> in<00:06:14.890> my<00:06:14.979> previous<00:06:15.190> video

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
like I already said in my previous video

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.680 
like I already said in my previous video
it's<00:06:15.970> modular<00:06:16.210> so<00:06:16.780> if<00:06:16.900> you<00:06:18.060> MC<00:06:19.060> edit<00:06:19.330> or<00:06:19.479> copy

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
it's modular so if you MC edit or copy

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.900 
it's modular so if you MC edit or copy
the<00:06:20.110> lower<00:06:20.290> section<00:06:20.890> and<00:06:21.070> then<00:06:21.250> place<00:06:21.520> either

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
the lower section and then place either

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.090 
the lower section and then place either
a<00:06:22.120> red<00:06:22.479> or<00:06:22.750> a<00:06:22.810> pink<00:06:23.260> they're<00:06:23.680> actually<00:06:23.979> both

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
a red or a pink they're actually both

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.430 
a red or a pink they're actually both
the<00:06:24.160> same<00:06:24.550> identical<00:06:25.210> if<00:06:25.690> you<00:06:25.870> place<00:06:26.080> that<00:06:26.110> on

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
the same identical if you place that on

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.710 
the same identical if you place that on
top<00:06:26.470> you<00:06:26.860> can<00:06:27.039> place<00:06:27.700> on<00:06:27.880> top<00:06:27.910> as<00:06:28.210> many<00:06:28.390> of<00:06:28.570> you

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
top you can place on top as many of you

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.290 
top you can place on top as many of you
as<00:06:28.750> you<00:06:29.140> want<00:06:29.380> and<00:06:29.650> then<00:06:30.310> if<00:06:30.550> you<00:06:30.669> finish<00:06:31.090> off

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
as you want and then if you finish off

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.779 
as you want and then if you finish off
with<00:06:31.510> the<00:06:31.960> top<00:06:32.169> section<00:06:32.440> it<00:06:33.250> should<00:06:33.550> work

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
with the top section it should work

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.060 
with the top section it should work
without<00:06:34.300> any<00:06:34.630> issues<00:06:35.200> so<00:06:35.470> that's<00:06:36.070> nice<00:06:36.630> about

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
without any issues so that's nice about

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.200 
without any issues so that's nice about
future<00:06:39.070> content<00:06:39.550> I<00:06:39.669> can<00:06:39.729> already<00:06:39.970> say

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
future content I can already say

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.630

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.380 
on a multi floor version of this
elevator<00:06:45.220> I<00:06:45.520> don't<00:06:45.850> think<00:06:46.030> it's<00:06:46.150> going<00:06:46.270> to<00:06:46.300> be

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390 
elevator I don't think it's going to be

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.560 
elevator I don't think it's going to be
done<00:06:46.979> anytime<00:06:47.979> soon<00:06:48.460> because<00:06:48.910> I<00:06:49.090> got<00:06:49.240> so<00:06:49.419> many

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570

projects running is next to each other

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.980 
projects running is next to each other
and<00:06:51.760> I<00:06:51.789> would<00:06:51.910> just<00:06:52.030> want<00:06:52.210> to<00:06:52.300> keep<00:06:52.390> constantly

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990
