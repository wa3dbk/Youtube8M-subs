00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Student Finance - just a few facts...

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's no more expensive to study at Oxford than at any other university...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Oxford's world-class facilities and colleges actually keep living costs down.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Since 2012, Oxford has offered the most generous no-strings-attached financial support package of any UK university.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This includes: Fee reductions; Non-repayable bursaries and Scholarships

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Remember: All UK and EU students can access a loan from the UK government... 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to cover the whole cost of their tuition fees...

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.000
...so you don't need to pay any fees upfront!

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:08.000
All UK students can access a repayable maintenance loan from the UK government towards their living costs... 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:13.000
And, if you are from a lower-income household...

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:17.000
You can access a non-repayable maintenance grant from the UK government too!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
All UK government loans are combined into a single amount which only becomes repayable once... 

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.000
You've left your course and...

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.000
You're earning more than a set amount.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So, an English graduate earning £25,000 per year would make loan repayments of... 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
£30 a month, or £360 per year

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
