00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.300
 hello youtube users greet you 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.940
 mister duke and his handsome and sexy friend 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.740
 Marrano and after a while not going up 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 videos due to a couple of issues 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.150
 personal that I had out there today I 've 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.860
 decided to bring you my first video of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.290
 the new series dedicated to weapons 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.320
 secret Nazis hey you do not know 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.200
 forget something culero so thanks for 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.270
 remind me my obese and ugly friend do not know 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.430
 forget to give li to my facebook and 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.399
 follow me on twitter the links are in 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.700
 the description duke andale let me say 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.890
 the first weapon is not squire is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.530
 well Marrano already has like two videos 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.220
 that you do not shit you can start at the end 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.930
 of 1943 Adolf Hitler gave the mission to his 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.060
 most remarkable scientists and the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 manufacture rat oxburgh factory 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.860
 design the ultimate panzer team to a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.440
 panzer fourth boom with a transmission and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.809
 hydraulic direction you take the set 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.030
 that moved the caterpillars was propelled 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.259
 by two pumps that were powered by 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.330
 the engine my cock the 120 of 300 hp for 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.179
 accommodate this and other types of changes 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.810
 the part was modified 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:15.000
 in 1944 the prototype was equipped with the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.200
 turret of a quarter panzer out h 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.569
 modified to rotate 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 hydraulically instead of electrically 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.920
 and make use of the new systems of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.469
 vehicle also had some skirts 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.130
 standardized 8 millimeters for better 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.479
 protection of hydraulic systems 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.209
 greatly improved the task of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.459
 driver improved the march on land 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.859
 difficult and eliminated the need for 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.110
 however gearbox the vehicle 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.179
 it was a technology demonstrator and not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.220
 it was thought to be produced in 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.959
 mass for how expensive it would have been 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.110
 produce it because of the components 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.209
 extra that they used the only prototype that 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.219
 he did a series of tests and 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.649
 was sent to the eastern front in a 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.780
 unit of the uat in ss after 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.129
 survive was returned to germany that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.500
 he used it against the allies 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:05.790
 Western until he was captured by 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.070
 the american army in 1945 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.140
 and the most curious thing about this panzer is that 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.090
 in case of having produced in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.950
 mass would have changed very noticeably 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 the result of the battle of 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.400
 stalingrado to not suffer so many stuck 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.400
 hard on the battlefield 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.890
 the bomb in two thermal would consist of one 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.960
 or several explosives that would be thrown 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.420
 by aircraft with a large radius of action 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.580
 and with the ability to detonate create 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.680
 an area of intense cold that would freeze 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.050
 in a radius of one kilometer all form 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.390
 of life this bomb would be thrown to a 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.190
 area next to invade its effect 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.960
 would be compared to using 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.420
 liquid nitrogen to take one ar 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.610
 piece of meat to then be hit 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.680
 with a hammer unfortunately this 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.630
 weapon was discarded as the high command 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.730
 from the third reich considered that his radio 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.350
 of action would be too small in 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.790
 comparison with the amount of 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.790
 bombers that would be shot down 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.420
 had the purpose of creating whirlwinds 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.280
 to shoot down the allied planes it 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.940
 built in the experimental institute 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.310
 del xerez in the austrian designed tirol 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.320
 by Dr. Peter Meyer had like 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.000
 base a large-caliber mortar that is 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.920
 it sank on the ground and fired 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.290
 projectiles loaded with coal 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.640
 pulverized and an explosive action 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.800
 slow 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.170
 apparently the objective that was sought 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.360
 with this curious invention was to tear down 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.640
 the enemy airplanes at the moment in 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.430
 that explodes is mixed this 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.560
 revolutionary artifact however not 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.950
 it took effect in his first tests 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.780
 so they tried to improve it came to 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.420
 the conclusion that could be produced 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.070
 dark and huge whirlwinds based on 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.110
 coal dust with the power 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.750
 enough to break the wings and the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.780
 structure of allied aircraft 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.110
 The scope of the weapon was estimated at about 150 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.270
 meters apparently this original canyon 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.580
 never came to be used as such 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.580
 but some weapons based on him 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.830
 the rfc project is up to date is 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.750
 one of the great mysteries of the 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.610
 second war because not really 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.190
 there is more evidence of its existence 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.810
 in addition to various roles of the ss and 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.140
 the testimony of several scientists 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.380
 it seems the rfc project is seeing the 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.120
 light in June 1934 and during his first 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.790
 flight and also the last ascended 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.040
 vertically 60 meters but started to 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.740
 have problems in the air the mechanism 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.540
 al a 296 stabilizer that was supposed to 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.880
 should guide the device showed to be 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.070
 totally useless the pilot gave it and 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.300
 he barely managed to take it to the floor and 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.370
 escape before the device 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.220
 will begin to spin in circles and 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.050
 will explode if it was the end of the rcz 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.150
 this was just the beginning of the new 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.160
 generation of rfc weapons is that 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.290
 they would have a great resemblance to UFOs 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.290
 because it had a propulsion by brill and 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.480
 driving by magnetic drive its 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.310
 diameter was 5 meters and the contour 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.050
 of the device faded when 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.540
 it acquired speed and changed color 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.900
 according to the propulsive force it became 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.050
 red yellow green orange white blue 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.129
 or violet began to fly in 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.050
 42 was 11.5 meters and was powered by 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.870
 the rooms chumÃ¡n and piloting by 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.240
 magnetic field drive 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.039
 supposedly it reached a speed 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.990
 2900 to 12,000 kilometers per hour could 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.849
 make flight flight changes in 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.699
 right angle without prejudice to the 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.800
 pilot was not subject to conditions 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.020
 atmospheric and it was perfectly apt 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.110
 to fly in space they were built 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.180
 17 units on April 1 the second 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.610
 prototype was named April 2 and was 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.580
 a cargo ship of almost 50 meters of 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.729
 long and 55 high had a capacity 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.800
 of 25 tons a year autonomy 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.789
 and its maximum speed was 4000 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.789
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.709
 in 1943 on the orders of Adolf himself 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:03.259
 Hitler was born the project even in a 

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:05.599
 class of rcz that had the goal of 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.179
 create this class of vehicles intended 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.519
 to the battlefield because it was equipped 

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:12.679
 with weapons more or less heavy its 

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:15.349
 crew was composed of eight 

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:17.509
 men had a diameter of four thousand 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.029
 eight hundred kilometers per hour can 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:22.669
 reach 17,000 kilometers per hour 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.529
 it was equipped with two ray guns 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.709
 strong drops about 60 millimeters 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:31.669
 mounted on small rotating towers and 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:34.729
 with 4 m 106 it presented an average attitude 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:38.419
 to fly in space it was finished to 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:41.719
 the end of 1942 had a diameter that 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:45.349
 It varied from 26 to 32 meters with a height 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:48.259
 from 9 to 11 could transport from 9 to 20 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.179
 people reached a speed of 6000 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.519
 kilometers per hour and was able to 

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:55.009
 move in space their autonomy 

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:59.029
 It was 55 hours 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:01.099
 from 1945 and the 50s the great 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:03.619
 Most of the UFO sightings were 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:06.139
 round with disk or bell shape 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:07.550
 photographic material well documented 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.240
 shows that the uned 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.580
 was sighted frequently according to the 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.770
 secret documents of the svs volvo e 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.539
 it was even filmed although it is believed that 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.610
 most of the videos and 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:21.830
 documents were stolen by members 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.430
 of the red army and taken to the union 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.569
 Soviet to be studied 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.969
 curiously there is a theory that holds 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:30.399
 that the Nazis came to the moon a lot 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:32.629
 before the Russians and the 

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.699
 Americans to be true is 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:36.469
 likely that their ships will take off from 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:39.199
 soft neus in the cndh and settle down 

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:41.389
 on the dark side of the moon this could 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.550
 explain why after the moon landing 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.919
 there were no more missions to the moon at 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.959
 seem the lunar Nazis prevent them 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:49.759
 put a foot in it and that's why the 

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:52.099
 Nasa is more interested in Mars though 

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:55.279
 according to some authors there are also there 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:58.159
 underground bases Nazis but that one already 

00:07:55.279 --> 00:08:00.349
 is another story x of good users of 

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:02.060
 Youtube says goodbye Mr. Duke 

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:04.430
 forget to subscribe 

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:07.340
 and comment and in case you do not 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:11.350
 will like the video of fucking his mother x 

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.350
 bye bye and until the next video
