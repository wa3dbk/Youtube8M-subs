are both ways as well so just drop twice
I<00:01:34.569> would<00:01:35.569> advise<00:01:35.990> pitting<00:01:36.500> on<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.679> lowest

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
I would advise pitting on the lowest

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.809 
I would advise pitting on the lowest
suspension<00:01:38.000> as<00:01:38.119> well<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:39.590> does<00:01:40.310> help<00:01:40.579> that<00:01:40.640> a

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
suspension as well it does help that a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.539 
suspension as well it does help that a
lot<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.840> makes<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:42.200> even<00:01:42.439> lower<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.099> that's

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
lot it makes it even lower so that's

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.949 
lot it makes it even lower so that's
good<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:46.610> can<00:01:47.179> do<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.539> online<00:01:47.719> you

I don't know and but anyway the next
step<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:13.549> next<00:02:13.579> step<00:02:13.940> way<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.829> it<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:17.230> going

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
step the next step way to do it is going

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.530 
step the next step way to do it is going
to<00:02:18.410> be<00:02:18.560> coming<00:02:18.980> up<00:02:19.099> in<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.370> minute<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:19.880> just<00:02:20.299> stay

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
to be coming up in a minute so just stay

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.810 
to be coming up in a minute so just stay
right

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.450 

alright<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.120> if<00:02:25.360> your<00:02:25.660> car<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.280> blowing<00:02:27.280> up

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
when you shoot the middle of the rims

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.730 
when you shoot the middle of the rims
add<00:02:30.070> twice<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:31.540> make<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.810> track<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.410> try<00:02:32.620> and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
add twice to make a track to try and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.340 
add twice to make a track to try and
make<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:32.890> lower<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.490> like<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.210> salton<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:35.170> all

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.600 
make it lower and like the salton it all
blew<00:02:35.680> up<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.740> way<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.010> how<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
blew up and this is a way of how to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.990 
blew up and this is a way of how to
doing<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.300> with<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.720> blew<00:02:41.110> Ana<00:02:41.290> up<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.760> way

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
doing it with I blew Ana up so this way

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.180 
doing it with I blew Ana up so this way
will<00:02:43.360> be<00:02:43.480> easier<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:44.230> way<00:02:44.440> can<00:02:44.650> work<00:02:44.920> an

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
will be easier this way can work an

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.800 
will be easier this way can work an
Annie<00:02:45.550> car<00:02:45.910> as<00:02:46.210> well

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
Annie car as well
