00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
things like that and like other career

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.889 
things like that and like other career
paths<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.820> also<00:00:35.969> take<00:00:36.300> because<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
paths so you can also take because you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
paths so you can also take because you
don't<00:00:37.079> necessarily<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.030> automatically

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
don't necessarily have to automatically

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.959 
don't necessarily have to automatically
go<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.600> medical<00:00:40.020> school<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.500> you're<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
go into medical school if you're a

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.819 
go into medical school if you're a
neuroscience<00:00:41.969> major<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> am<00:00:43.170> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
neuroscience major which is what I am so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
neuroscience major which is what I am so
neuroscience<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.579> fairly<00:00:44.820> new<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:46.020> my

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
neuroscience is fairly new at my

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.610 
neuroscience is fairly new at my
university<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.289> became<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
university I think it became like a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.389 
university I think it became like a
major<00:00:50.010> um<00:00:50.840> like<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> few<00:00:52.230> years<00:00:52.440> ago<00:00:52.739> maybe<00:00:53.070> um

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
major um like a few years ago maybe um

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
major um like a few years ago maybe um
so<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.210> still<00:00:54.420> fairly<00:00:54.629> new<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:54.960> there's

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
so it's still fairly new but there's

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.650 
so it's still fairly new but there's
like<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> lot<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> people<00:00:56.340> who<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.360> like

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
like a lot of people who have like

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.170 
like a lot of people who have like
joined<00:00:58.460> neuroscience<00:00:59.460> which<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> super

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
joined neuroscience which is super

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
joined neuroscience which is super
awesome<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.840> lot<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.350> people<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:02.039> pre-med

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
awesome a lot of people in my pre-med

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.149 
awesome a lot of people in my pre-med
fraternity<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.750> I'm<00:01:03.870> part<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.350> our

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
fraternity that I'm part of our

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.100 
fraternity that I'm part of our
neuroscience<00:01:05.670> majors<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:06.510> super<00:01:06.689> cool

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
neuroscience majors so that's super cool

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.200 
neuroscience majors so that's super cool
so<00:01:08.040> neuroscience<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so neuroscience is kind of like a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.480 
so neuroscience is kind of like a
combination<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:10.170> biology<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.250> psychology

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
combination of biology and psychology

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.640 
combination of biology and psychology
which<00:01:12.270> were<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:12.960> subjects<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.530> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
which were the two subjects that I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.100 
which were the two subjects that I
really<00:01:13.950> liked<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.340> high<00:01:14.490> school<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> took

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
really liked in high school and I took

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.289 
really liked in high school and I took
both<00:01:16.259> ap<00:01:16.680> bio<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.189> ap<00:01:17.490> psych<00:01:17.759> which<00:01:18.060> really

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
both ap bio and ap psych which really

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
both ap bio and ap psych which really
helped<00:01:18.630> me<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> lot<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> classes

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
helped me out with a lot of the classes

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399 
helped me out with a lot of the classes
that<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.580> take<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.119> my<00:01:21.240> major<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.810> for

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that I have to take for my major and for

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.100 
that I have to take for my major and for
a<00:01:22.439> lot<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:22.979> majors<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:24.360> require<00:01:24.420> like

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
a lot of other majors that require like

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.230 
a lot of other majors that require like
that<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.650> pre-med<00:01:26.100> um<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> take

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that are pre-med um you have to take

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.260 
that are pre-med um you have to take
biology<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:28.049> psychology<00:01:28.680> classes<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
biology in psychology classes so that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
biology in psychology classes so that
really<00:01:30.450> helps<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.320> definitely

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
really helps a lot I definitely

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
recommend if you guys are in high school

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.899 
recommend if you guys are in high school
to<00:01:33.630> take<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.020> many<00:01:34.200> AP<00:01:34.650> classes<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:35.310> possible

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to take as many AP classes as possible

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.740 
to take as many AP classes as possible
because<00:01:36.540> even<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:36.900> stuff<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.500> AP<00:01:37.799> chem<00:01:38.750> AP

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
because even like stuff like AP chem AP

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
because even like stuff like AP chem AP
statistics<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:40.979> those<00:01:41.159> different<00:01:41.579> AP

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
statistics just all those different AP

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
statistics just all those different AP
classes<00:01:42.119> will<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:42.899> helpful<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
classes will be really helpful for you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
classes will be really helpful for you
in<00:01:43.680> college<00:01:44.149> definitely<00:01:45.149> check<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
in college definitely check that the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
accept AP credits though cuz mine did

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.330 
accept AP credits though cuz mine did
super<00:01:50.820> lucky<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.719> some<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.380> so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
yeah that's pretty much for

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.899 
yeah that's pretty much for
neurosciences<00:01:55.020> biology<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.950> psychology<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
neurosciences biology and psychology and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.880 
neurosciences biology and psychology and
you<00:01:57.270> take<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> lot<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.929> biology<00:01:58.409> classes

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you take a lot of biology classes

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.179 
you take a lot of biology classes
obviously<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.479> also<00:02:00.750> um<00:02:01.259> psychology

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
obviously and then also um psychology

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.539 
obviously and then also um psychology
classes<00:02:02.429> which<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.350> love<00:02:04.350> psychology<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> think

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
classes which I love psychology I think

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.419 
classes which I love psychology I think
that's<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:06.210> favorite<00:02:06.689> part<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.350> my<00:02:08.220> major

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's like my favorite part of my major

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.330 
that's like my favorite part of my major
is<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> psychology<00:02:09.239> portion<00:02:10.019> um<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.190> gets

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
is the psychology portion um and it gets

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.820 
is the psychology portion um and it gets
take<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> lot<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.180> cool<00:02:12.420> classes<00:02:12.989> like<00:02:13.260> abnormal

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
take a lot of cool classes like abnormal

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.610 
take a lot of cool classes like abnormal
psychology<00:02:14.450> experimental<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:16.440> all

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
psychology experimental just like all

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.449 
psychology experimental just like all
these<00:02:16.739> different<00:02:16.920> things

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
these different things

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.880 
these different things
you're<00:02:17.580> also<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.819> pre-med<00:02:18.299> major<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.049> I'm

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
you're also a pre-med major so I'm

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.650 
you're also a pre-med major so I'm
already<00:02:20.250> taking<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:20.940> all<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.299> required

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
already taking like all the required

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.479 
already taking like all the required
classes<00:02:21.989> for<00:02:22.440> medical<00:02:22.799> school<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.280> then<00:02:23.370> I'm

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
classes for medical school and then I'm

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.640 
classes for medical school and then I'm
also<00:02:23.640> taking<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> required<00:02:24.329> classes<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
also taking the required classes to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.250 
also taking the required classes to
obtain<00:02:26.340> my<00:02:26.519> degree<00:02:26.549> so<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.420> lot<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.840> classes

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
obtain my degree so a lot of the classes

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.500 
obtain my degree so a lot of the classes
that<00:02:28.349> I'm<00:02:28.500> taking<00:02:28.530> are<00:02:29.069> very<00:02:29.310> similar<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.760> like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
that I'm taking are very similar to like

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.740 
that I'm taking are very similar to like
other<00:02:31.190> pre-med<00:02:32.190> students<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.480> are<00:02:33.569> like

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
other pre-med students that are like

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.850 
other pre-med students that are like
biochem<00:02:35.239> biology<00:02:36.239> chemistry<00:02:36.569> although<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
biochem biology chemistry although you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.770 
biochem biology chemistry although you
have<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.370> take<00:02:38.549> like<00:02:38.730> different<00:02:39.209> classes<00:02:39.630> also

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
have to take like different classes also

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.990 
have to take like different classes also
for<00:02:40.170> your<00:02:40.290> degree<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> lot<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
for your degree so you can do a lot of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.550 
for your degree so you can do a lot of
different<00:02:42.239> things<00:02:42.569> with<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> neuroscience

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
different things with a neuroscience

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.370 
different things with a neuroscience
degree<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.160> kind<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.060> found<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.569> this

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
degree I kind of found that out this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.130 
degree I kind of found that out this
semester<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.640> didn't<00:02:48.329> realize<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.870> there

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
semester I didn't realize that there

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.420 
semester I didn't realize that there
were<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.230> many<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.769> different<00:02:50.160> career

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
were so many like different career

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.280 
were so many like different career
options<00:02:50.640> it's<00:02:51.120> not<00:02:51.299> just<00:02:51.629> like<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:52.110> into

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
options it's not just like going into

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.509 
options it's not just like going into
research<00:02:52.799> or<00:02:53.129> going<00:02:54.120> into<00:02:54.620> medical<00:02:55.620> field<00:02:56.160> you

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
research or going into medical field you

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.129 
research or going into medical field you
can<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> ton<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.269> different<00:02:57.660> things<00:02:57.870> with

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
can do a ton of different things with

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.860 
can do a ton of different things with
your<00:02:58.709> neuroscience<00:02:59.459> degree<00:02:59.790> there's<00:03:00.660> like

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
your neuroscience degree there's like

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.750 
your neuroscience degree there's like
this<00:03:01.079> new<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.799> don't<00:03:01.889> know<00:03:02.069> if<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.310> new

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
this new I don't know if it's new

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.009 
this new I don't know if it's new
relatively<00:03:03.690> new<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.870> guess<00:03:04.220> field<00:03:05.220> like<00:03:05.549> neuro

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
relatively new I guess field like neuro

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.740 
relatively new I guess field like neuro
advertising<00:03:07.019> which<00:03:07.260> was<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.340> cool<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.940> would

advertising which was is so cool I would
totally<00:03:09.959> want<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.350> do<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.889> would

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
totally want to do that if I would

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.000 
totally want to do that if I would
didn't<00:03:11.370> if<00:03:12.150> medicine<00:03:12.630> wasn't<00:03:12.840> like<00:03:13.139> my<00:03:13.650> thing

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
didn't if medicine wasn't like my thing

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.789

but<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.670> love<00:03:14.880> medicine<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:16.049> I<00:03:16.290> really

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
but I love medicine and like I really

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.979 
but I love medicine and like I really
want<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.130> go<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.310> medical<00:03:17.639> school<00:03:17.700> but<00:03:18.150> um<00:03:18.329> you

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
want to go to medical school but um you

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.330 
want to go to medical school but um you
have<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> lot<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.500> different<00:03:19.920> like<00:03:20.040> career

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
have a lot of different like career

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.470 
have a lot of different like career
choices<00:03:20.639> that<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.120> pick<00:03:21.329> with

choices that you can pick with

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.050 
choices that you can pick with
neuroscience<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.859> can<00:03:23.040> even<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.790> do

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
neuroscience you can even like do

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.940 
neuroscience you can even like do
something<00:03:24.359> completely<00:03:25.079> like<00:03:25.290> different<00:03:25.769> like

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
something completely like different like

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.670 
something completely like different like
you<00:03:26.099> can<00:03:26.280> go<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.609> dental<00:03:27.150> school<00:03:27.410> with<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.500> neuro

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
you can go to dental school with a neuro

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.470 
you can go to dental school with a neuro
science<00:03:29.099> degree<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.910> as<00:03:30.060> long<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.389> you

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
science degree know just as long as you

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.259 
science degree know just as long as you
get<00:03:30.630> your<00:03:30.980> prereqs<00:03:31.980> done<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.609> stuff<00:03:33.150> like

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
get your prereqs done and stuff like

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.759 
get your prereqs done and stuff like
that<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:33.750> pretty<00:03:33.959> much<00:03:34.139> made<00:03:34.440> me<00:03:34.560> interested

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
that so pretty much made me interested

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.849 
that so pretty much made me interested
in<00:03:35.099> neuroscience<00:03:35.389> was<00:03:36.389> my<00:03:36.690> AP<00:03:37.200> psych<00:03:37.470> class

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
in neuroscience was my AP psych class

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.390 
in neuroscience was my AP psych class
that<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.160> took<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:39.049> high<00:03:40.049> school<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.590> really

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
that I took in high school I really

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.520 
that I took in high school I really
loved<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.940> class<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.540> was<00:03:42.870> planning<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.260> being

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
loved that class I was planning on being

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.539 
loved that class I was planning on being
a<00:03:43.650> psychology<00:03:44.340> major<00:03:45.290> before<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.590> switched<00:03:47.340> to

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
a psychology major before I switched to

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.370 
a psychology major before I switched to
neuroscience

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
neuroscience

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.650 
neuroscience
I<00:03:48.440> realized<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.280> like<00:03:49.660> neuroscience

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
I realized that like neuroscience

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.780 
I realized that like neuroscience
probably<00:03:50.990> be<00:03:51.110> better<00:03:51.320> for<00:03:51.490> medical<00:03:52.490> school

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
probably be better for medical school

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.240 
probably be better for medical school
since<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.840> lot<00:03:54.020> of<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.470> classes<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.070> have

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
since a lot of the classes that I have

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.100 
since a lot of the classes that I have
to<00:03:55.370> take<00:03:55.550> for<00:03:55.850> neuroscience<00:03:56.510> are<00:03:56.660> like

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
to take for neuroscience are like

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.830 
to take for neuroscience are like
prereqs<00:03:57.590> already<00:03:57.980> for<00:03:58.310> medical<00:03:59.030> school<00:03:59.270> as

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
prereqs already for medical school as

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.560 
prereqs already for medical school as
opposed<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.290> psychology<00:04:01.040> which<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.400> only<00:04:01.670> do

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
opposed to psychology which you only do

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.570 
opposed to psychology which you only do
much<00:04:02.720> focus<00:04:03.140> on<00:04:03.260> psychology<00:04:03.710> depending<00:04:04.460> on

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
much focus on psychology depending on

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.790 
much focus on psychology depending on
the<00:04:04.670> university<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.510> go<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:06.140> don't

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
the university that you go to I don't

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.960 
the university that you go to I don't
know<00:04:06.950> if<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.130> guys<00:04:07.250> have<00:04:07.490> to<00:04:07.640> do<00:04:07.760> like<00:04:07.940> a

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
know if you guys have to do like a

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.570 
know if you guys have to do like a
thesis<00:04:08.390> for<00:04:09.230> neuroscience<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.100> know<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> lot<00:04:10.460> of

to<00:04:37.460> for<00:04:38.210> my<00:04:38.630> major<00:04:38.870> but<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.320> do<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.100> do<00:04:40.190> a

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
to for my major but I do have to do a

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.130 
to for my major but I do have to do a
thesis<00:04:40.520> because<00:04:41.060> I'm<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.210> part<00:04:41.570> of<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.750> Honors

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
thesis because I'm a part of the Honors

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.860 
thesis because I'm a part of the Honors
Program<00:04:42.520> which<00:04:43.520> they<00:04:43.730> require<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.450> to<00:04:44.480> do

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
Program which they require you to do

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.050 
Program which they require you to do
also<00:04:45.410> think<00:04:45.560> about<00:04:45.920> that<00:04:46.130> when<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:46.880> are

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
also think about that when you are

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.910 
also think about that when you are
picking<00:04:47.300> your<00:04:47.780> major<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.350> if<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.530> guys<00:04:48.650> want

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
picking your major and if you guys want

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.800 
picking your major and if you guys want
to<00:04:48.950> be<00:04:49.070> neuroscience<00:04:49.640> majors<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.240> know<00:04:50.570> that

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
to be neuroscience majors I know that

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.080 
to be neuroscience majors I know that
some<00:04:51.110> universities<00:04:52.100> might<00:04:52.400> require<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:52.850> to

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
some universities might require you to

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.510 
some universities might require you to
do<00:04:53.390> a<00:04:53.420> thesis<00:04:53.840> as<00:04:54.560> opposed<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.980> others<00:04:55.280> which

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
do a thesis as opposed to others which

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.250 
do a thesis as opposed to others which
do<00:04:55.790> not<00:04:55.820> I<00:04:56.270> currently<00:04:56.660> work<00:04:56.960> in<00:04:57.140> a

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
do not I currently work in a

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.350 
do not I currently work in a
neuroscience<00:04:57.890> lab<00:04:58.190> there's<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.270> many

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
neuroscience lab there's so many

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.020 
neuroscience lab there's so many
different<00:04:59.780> like<00:04:59.960> ways<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.370> neuroscience

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
different like ways that a neuroscience

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.300 
different like ways that a neuroscience
lab<00:05:02.270> can<00:05:02.600> go<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:03.020> work<00:05:03.230> with<00:05:03.380> fruit<00:05:03.650> flies<00:05:03.740> um

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
lab can go I work with fruit flies um

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.090 
lab can go I work with fruit flies um
and<00:05:04.790> like<00:05:04.940> odors<00:05:05.390> and<00:05:05.810> their<00:05:06.740> olfactory

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
and like odors and their olfactory

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.910 
and like odors and their olfactory
system<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:08.690> that<00:05:08.930> was<00:05:09.080> super<00:05:09.440> cool<00:05:09.470> like

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
system so that was super cool like

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.320 
system so that was super cool like
learning<00:05:10.160> about<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.640> in<00:05:10.820> my<00:05:10.970> intro<00:05:11.270> to

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
learning about that in my intro to

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.780 
learning about that in my intro to
neuroscience<00:05:11.900> class<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:13.550> was<00:05:13.670> actually

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
neuroscience class and that was actually

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.610 
neuroscience class and that was actually
the<00:05:14.030> first<00:05:14.240> kind<00:05:14.660> of<00:05:14.720> like<00:05:14.840> neuroscience

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
the first kind of like neuroscience

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.070 
the first kind of like neuroscience
oriented<00:05:16.250> class<00:05:16.490> that<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:16.790> took<00:05:16.910> um<00:05:17.390> it<00:05:17.960> was

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
oriented class that I took um it was

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.870 
oriented class that I took um it was
like<00:05:18.230> an<00:05:18.350> intro<00:05:18.650> neuroscience<00:05:19.280> class<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.520> took

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
like an intro neuroscience class I took

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.870 
like an intro neuroscience class I took
my<00:05:20.210> first<00:05:20.480> semester<00:05:21.050> freshman<00:05:21.340> year<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.670> last

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
my first semester freshman year so last

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.950 
my first semester freshman year so last
semester<00:05:23.150> um<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.490> was<00:05:25.640> super<00:05:26.090> cool<00:05:26.480> it<00:05:26.780> was

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
semester um and it was super cool it was

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.260 
semester um and it was super cool it was
a<00:05:26.990> lot<00:05:27.170> of<00:05:27.200> what<00:05:27.410> I<00:05:27.470> learned<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:27.830> psychology<00:05:28.520> as

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
a lot of what I learned in psychology as

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.930 
a lot of what I learned in psychology as
well<00:05:29.510> as<00:05:29.630> more<00:05:29.840> about<00:05:30.050> like<00:05:30.230> the<00:05:30.940> biological

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
well as more about like the biological

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.240 
I'm so not like completely psychology so
I<00:05:35.630> thought<00:05:35.870> that<00:05:36.020> was<00:05:36.140> super<00:05:36.290> cool<00:05:36.500> yeah

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
I thought that was super cool yeah

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.300 
I thought that was super cool yeah
that's<00:05:37.490> kind<00:05:37.760> of<00:05:37.820> about<00:05:38.780> my<00:05:39.140> major<00:05:39.350> I'm<00:05:39.860> not<00:05:40.100> I

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310

don't<00:05:40.580> know<00:05:40.670> too<00:05:40.730> much<00:05:41.090> about<00:05:41.450> it<00:05:41.690> yet<00:05:42.050> just

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
don't know too much about it yet just

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.650 
don't know too much about it yet just
because<00:05:42.440> I'm<00:05:42.680> still<00:05:42.890> like<00:05:43.100> a<00:05:43.130> freshman<00:05:43.730> but

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660
