of all of these eggheads it's possible
to<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.439> by<00:00:22.650> taking<00:00:22.830> any<00:00:23.160> damage<00:00:23.400> or

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
to do this by taking any damage or

to do this by taking any damage or
intelligence<00:00:25.490> there<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> go<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.330> second

and use the remaining two hellions to do

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
and use the remaining two hellions to do
additional<00:00:34.380> damage<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.130> famous<00:00:37.219> OOP<00:00:38.600> there

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
additional damage to be famous OOP there

in<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.860> commute<00:01:05.369> lists<00:01:05.700> will<00:01:05.880> tear<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
in this commute lists will tear up the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
in this commute lists will tear up the
Marines<00:01:06.689> pretty<00:01:06.990> bad<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.860> always<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> good

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
Marines pretty bad so it's always a good

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.179 
Marines pretty bad so it's always a good
idea<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.729> cry<00:01:09.180> both<00:01:09.570> ways<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.010> works

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
idea to cry both ways and see what works

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
idea to cry both ways and see what works
for<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.150> most<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> I've<00:01:12.689> ever<00:01:12.869> managed

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
for you the most that I've ever managed

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.570 
for you the most that I've ever managed
to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.680> one's<00:01:13.950> only<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.400> away<00:01:14.490> with

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to do with this one's only get away with

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.860 
to do with this one's only get away with
two<00:01:14.790> casualties

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.140 

focusing<00:01:19.770> fires<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.340> other<00:01:20.490> part<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.940> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
focusing fires the other part of this I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
focusing fires the other part of this I
think<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.570> possible<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.380> zero<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:23.010> this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
think it's possible to get zero on this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.790 
think it's possible to get zero on this
and<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.550> perfect<00:01:23.790> score<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.870> you're<00:01:25.410> gonna

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
and get a perfect score but you're gonna

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.590 
and get a perfect score but you're gonna
need<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.220> try<00:01:26.490> different<00:01:26.820> things<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.360> order<00:01:27.480> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
need to try different things in order to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.330 
need to try different things in order to
make<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.750> work<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> basic<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.160> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
make it work that's the basic on that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.330 
make it work that's the basic on that
one<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.260> this<00:01:31.410> next<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.950> you're
