 slightly and legs worthless some 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.720
 socks and decided to change them at the same time 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:33.170

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:37.340

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.200
 doc 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.310

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 here 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.160
 what we have in the valve first is 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.879
 room 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.909
 the banana is so quick so that you can 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.550
 had to eat 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:12.320
 2 mosquito coils 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.550
 then devils boredom years still until 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:25.780
 so first aid kit in such a convenient 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:25.780

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.970
 Here is such a thing 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:39.170
 the main thing then is not to lose it all 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:41.110
 valve is empty to see your 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:49.520

 cover valve cover from tripod 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.679
 In principle, everything is honestly stupid 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.899

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.660

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.920
 Dimasik carries a saw in it in these pockets 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.319

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.369

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.370

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:25.959
