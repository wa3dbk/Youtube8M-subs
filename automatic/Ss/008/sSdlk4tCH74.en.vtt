00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
those moments where it was probably a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.320 
those moments where it was probably a
little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:22.860> irresponsible<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.150> fast

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
little bit irresponsible to go that fast

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.420 
little bit irresponsible to go that fast
tire<00:01:24.690> wear<00:01:25.020> wise<00:01:25.260> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.010> we<00:01:26.100> got<00:01:26.220> closer

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
tire wear wise and I think we got closer

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.250 
tire wear wise and I think we got closer
to<00:01:26.580> every<00:01:26.880> gutter<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.479> Georgetown
