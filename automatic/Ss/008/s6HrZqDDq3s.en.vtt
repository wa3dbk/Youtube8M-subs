00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
haven't lay it down very little bit it's

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.560 
haven't lay it down very little bit it's
like<00:01:58.869> not<00:01:59.110> totally<00:02:00.039> opaque<00:02:00.399> it's<00:02:01.149> quite<00:02:01.390> sure

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000
