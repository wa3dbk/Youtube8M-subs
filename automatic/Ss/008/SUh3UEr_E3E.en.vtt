packing is at a premium with these hard

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.540 
packing is at a premium with these hard
and<00:04:05.780> ribs<00:04:06.020> these<00:04:06.380> hard<00:04:06.680> metal<00:04:07.010> ribs<00:04:07.220> on<00:04:07.430> the

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
and ribs these hard metal ribs on the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.610 
and ribs these hard metal ribs on the
back<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:08.239> makes<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.570> really<00:04:08.750> hard<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.200> pack

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
back it makes it really hard to pack

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.759 
back it makes it really hard to pack
stuff<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.340> because<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.510> back<00:04:12.050> isn't<00:04:12.560> very

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
stuff in because the back isn't very

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.380 
stuff in because the back isn't very
flexible<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.640> don't<00:04:13.850> have<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.120> lot<00:04:14.360> of

flexible and you don't have a lot of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.990 
flexible and you don't have a lot of
room<00:04:14.750> up<00:04:14.959> front<00:04:15.070> so<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.100> really<00:04:16.700> have<00:04:16.730> to<00:04:16.970> be
