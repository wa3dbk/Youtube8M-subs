the<00:02:08.310> option<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.730> put<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.120> either<00:02:09.330> spot<00:02:09.800> this

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the option to put it in either spot this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800 
the option to put it in either spot this
actually<00:02:11.190> allows<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.580> read<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.570> like<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
actually allows it to read just like a

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.200 
actually allows it to read just like a
sensor<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.310> allows<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> block<00:02:14.970> off

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
sensor and this allows you to block off

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.880 
sensor and this allows you to block off
the<00:02:15.330> hose<00:02:15.510> if<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.780> don't<00:02:15.960> want<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.320> right

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the hose if you don't want it right

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.350 
the hose if you don't want it right
there<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.460> pretty<00:02:17.790> cool<00:02:17.940> little<00:02:18.060> feature

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
there so pretty cool little feature

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.800 
there so pretty cool little feature
there

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
there

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.710 
there
leave<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.830> Box<00:02:20.040> out<00:02:24.890> bring<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.570> this<00:02:27.570> is

leave the Box out bring out is this is

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.840 
leave the Box out bring out is this is
the<00:02:27.900> Box<00:02:28.170> plug<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.310> hole<00:02:29.580> right<00:02:29.610> here

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
which faces an engine more also does

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.310 
which faces an engine more also does
allow<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> little<00:02:33.090> extra<00:02:33.450> heat<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.840> come<00:02:34.050> in

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
allow a little extra heat to come in

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.650 
allow a little extra heat to come in
some<00:02:35.160> people<00:02:35.400> don't<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.000> trade-off<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
some people don't like the trade-off of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.210 
some people don't like the trade-off of
extra<00:02:37.080> hair<00:02:37.260> if<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.620> means<00:02:37.770> you're<00:02:37.890> gonna<00:02:37.980> have

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
extra hair if it means you're gonna have

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.660 
extra hair if it means you're gonna have
more<00:02:38.430> heat<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.050> SMB<00:02:40.050> also<00:02:40.410> includes<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:41.130> ear

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
about this kit and this is more of an

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.580 
about this kit and this is more of an
installation<00:03:47.670> thing<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:48.540> it's<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.320> little<00:03:49.500> bit

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
installation thing but it's a little bit

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.560 
installation thing but it's a little bit
unique<00:03:49.770> is<00:03:50.340> when<00:03:50.850> you're<00:03:50.970> installing<00:03:51.330> this

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
unique is when you're installing this

unique is when you're installing this
the<00:03:52.020> filter<00:03:52.350> actually<00:03:52.590> has<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.280> attached

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
the filter actually has to be attached

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.210 
the filter actually has to be attached
to<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.870> portion<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.500> your<00:03:55.590> outlet<00:03:55.980> tube

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
to this portion of your outlet tube

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.699 
to this portion of your outlet tube
before<00:03:57.150> before<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.110> outlet<00:03:58.440> tube<00:03:58.590> is

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
before before the outlet tube is

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.960 
before before the outlet tube is
attached<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.280> box<00:03:59.489> so<00:03:59.730> you're<00:03:59.850> actually

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
attached to the box so you're actually

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.330 
attached to the box so you're actually
going<00:04:00.270> with<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.600> whole<00:04:00.750> filter<00:04:01.230> out<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.070> tube
