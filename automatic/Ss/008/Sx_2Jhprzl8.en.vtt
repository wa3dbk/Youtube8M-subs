00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.800
 rather associated with early 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.120
 Middle Ages and the main characters are quite 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.130
 could come from the tribe of the year

 The seller, by the way, which he still did not have 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.310
 own name 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.299
 This is the first of distinctive features. 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.030
 series 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.130
 garden necromancers meticulously 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.580
 the perforated pantheon and the dark secrets of the ancients 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.510
 religion and magic 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.500
 but above all about living world with 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 the unique atmosphere of the population 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.730
 responsive to all actions of the hero and 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.000
 France with whom the floor grey to build 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.740
 relations 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.060
 perhaps it is this factor that they are role-playing 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 the system was the key to success 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.670
 because the concept itself 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.590
 these works of the roof are not roles 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.890
 correlated with crusts 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.310
 characteristics but with the construction 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.780
 social relations and harsh survival 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 the world is quite a 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.779
 besides it is role system 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.889
 little shoes noticeably simplified training 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.139
 new skills tied to the trainer system 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.199
 there is also an opinion that the reason 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.909
 popularity has become the presence of say so 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.120
 non-child content such as alcohol a and 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:29.389
 brothels 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.079
 hardly deny that part 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.779
 fans attracts precisely this 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.769
 but let's hope that not rampant 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.519
 one alive series 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.590
 passed from one part to another 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.749
 a set of main characters including 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.439
 the protagonist is closely related all three 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.889
 games and made the player really 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.109
 page with the world 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.169
 the latter may not boast 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.099
 such dimensions as the universe dawn 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.999
 Lugansk Rolls 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.759
 but in terms of elaboration, I am not inferior to any 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.119
 got ready 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.539
 with the release of the first gothic and wide 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.779
 The public learned that the combat component 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.039
 role-playing can be reduced not only to 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.269
 choosing by the actions of him or 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.239
 quick-fire zaskleyki danila enemy 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:06.850
 mouse 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.720
 quite busy management systems 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.120
 in general and fencing in particular added 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.629
 the game and realism 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.909
 so the disease has players perceived 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.909
 simplification boevki visit kitri 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.519
 one of the main issues that their 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.959
 the first part of them follows 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.010
 nameless hero 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.799
 this is a question with who are you 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.870
 need to solve this problem and end 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.459
 Victims without achieving honor and respect 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.989
 any of the faction was decidedly 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:41.930
 is impossible 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.360
 only three large areas of the first part 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.519
 accounted for 13 guilds 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.010
 choosing one of the parties without replacing is not easy 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.969
 received nominee member status 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.120
 each faction has its own party 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.480
 a set of trusts corresponding to her 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.609
 activity therefore after 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.099
 the passing of the game was decent 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.429
 is it worth saying how it raised and 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.429
 robbed a line 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.440
 creating sequel developers carefully 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.439
 cost the original connections 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:21.709
 actions moved to another part of the world 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.710
 added another guild 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.960
 tightened the nuts in the role system 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.620
 the abundance of bugs that suffered and the first 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.210
 part also neatly kept 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.479
 apparently so that later does not exclude the release 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.419
 patches 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.370
 but these stories were still quite 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.779
 small baths 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.329
 welfare is over when 

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:42.300
 came the third part 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.409
 four paws lame on a set 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.400
 optimization and combat system relegated to 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.289
 her two species level is diablo 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.749
 the curious role of bulletins 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.639
 in the barn against 3 was really needed 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.499
 which is very hard-nosed fans 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:58.619
 players tried to lure collapsed 

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:00.759
 of the world we are notorious freedom but it was clear 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.309
 that in a series of something inside replaced 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:06.869
 possibly in a relationship publisher and studio 

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:07.949
 developer 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.999
 not by chance immediately after the release of the game 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.870
 piranha studio I went out from under joe str 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.610
 and decided to make a new desktop game this 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.169
 then we will understand that nothing really 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.280
 but in that game it didn't turn out to be 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.150
 good she was no prize just so she 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.050
 called regarded then as a rebirth 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.419
 East Gothic mediocre 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.550
 planning our own ideas we 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.550
 leaning first version 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.070
 anyway we got the game become 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.610
 one of the best and winning thousands 9 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.330
 the first fare that players all for what 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.080
 killed the original gothic 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.350
 including the gloomy peace of the guilds and 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.669
 nameless hero 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.569
 Gothic took home should have something 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.669
 do however first action publishers 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.220
 it was not entirely clear 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.130
 unknown Indian was found 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.400
 studio edge who was instructed to do 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.810
 soda for the third gothic seemed 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.710
 front set the task 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.240
 do on my friend who will be still 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.530
 worse gothic 3 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.730
 so that everyone can see that everything was originally 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.999
 not so bad 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:22.979
 the plan almost worked 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.050
 playing one was perfect 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.479
 Impossible to trust yourself and to the publisher 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.050
 undermined even more 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.819
 now it was possible to reshape 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.319
 ruin the series to dissect 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.280
 from anew that you got strict 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.150
 pillar 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.449
 why the choice fell on the team noted 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.290
 with tactical strategies they 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.159
 apogee history is silent 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.529
 nevertheless they are enthusiastic 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.879
 began to change what has 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.350
 For starters have made permanent hero 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.860
 nameless villain 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.590
 rather, he himself chose the name as a new one 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.990
 King and new heroes traditionally 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.789
 Nameless must now rake everything 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.599
 the grief committed by the king for 10 years 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.199
 what happened after the events of the third part 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.949
 we have already promised complete freedom of darkness 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.059
 new monsters and items in the same 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.469
 time greatly simplified magical 

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:10.270
 the system 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.030
 exit the game repeatedly 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.980
 tolerated 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.620
 There are cases that she works 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.750
 not good enough last time her 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.750
 waited in the summer of 2010 but again something is not 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.449
 grown together 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.900
 to compete with cancer risk should not 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.430
 somehow read the best 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.979
 elements of the series and at the same time offer a new 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:27.870
 gaming experience 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.970
 the industry as all this time 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.020
 stood still 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.970
 the fact that the creators understand this 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.970
 indicate frequent name changes 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.690
 the project 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.700
 could decide on them for quite some time 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.930
 periodically removed iphone 4 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.410
 as if hinting that you should not expect direct 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.879
 the continuation of the racers 

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:47.399
 however, despite all the peripetia of games 

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.559
 already in October will appear before our 

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:50.249
 doctors 

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:52.139
 you can start sharpening knives 

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:53.930
 in case the expectations of the fans are all 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.240
 don't come true 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.710
