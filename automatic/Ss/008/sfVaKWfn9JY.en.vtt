00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
operating system so if I plot this

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.740

on background is different to the
standard<00:00:30.550> Windows<00:00:30.849> 7<00:00:31.150> machine<00:00:31.180> and<00:00:31.630> this<00:00:32.050> is

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
standard Windows 7 machine and this is

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.710 
standard Windows 7 machine and this is
done<00:00:32.410> by<00:00:32.680> you<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.910> through<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.239> registry

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
done by you going through the registry

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.240

there we go system 32 and go to be e

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.210 
there we go system 32 and go to be e
which<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.390> just<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:12.290> then<00:03:13.290> all<00:03:13.800> we<00:03:14.040> need

which is just here and then all we need

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.360 
which is just here and then all we need
to<00:03:14.250> do<00:03:14.430> then<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.879> one<00:03:15.780> serene<00:03:16.019> here<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.370> create

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
to do then is one serene here is create

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.460 
to do then is one serene here is create
a<00:03:17.400> new<00:03:17.580> folder<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:19.019> we're<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.170> going<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.410> open

a new folder so we're just going to open

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.410 
a new folder so we're just going to open
this<00:03:19.739> up<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.040> make<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:20.940> new<00:03:21.060> folder<00:03:21.269> called

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
this up and make a new folder called

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.160 
this up and make a new folder called
info<00:03:22.230> even<00:03:23.099> though<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:23.840> locking<00:03:24.840> me<00:03:25.019> that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
info even though it's locking me that

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.380 
info even though it's locking me that
there<00:03:25.440> we<00:03:25.530> go<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.790> create<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.090> new<00:03:27.180> folder

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
there we go so create a new folder

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.300 
there we go so create a new folder
called<00:03:27.540> info<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.860> if<00:03:31.860> there's<00:03:32.099> already

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
called info and then if there's already

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.780 
called info and then if there's already
folder<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.269> can<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.629> go<00:03:33.750> into<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.140> folder

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
folder you can just go into that folder

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.610 
folder you can just go into that folder
fix<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.940> already<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.299> folder<00:03:36.630> there<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.470> we're

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
fix is already a folder there and we're

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.780 
fix is already a folder there and we're
going<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.860> go<00:03:37.950> into<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.220> backgrounds<00:03:38.640> folder

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
going to go into the backgrounds folder

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.250 
going to go into the backgrounds folder
if<00:03:39.120> there<00:03:39.569> isn't<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> folder<00:03:40.110> called

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
if there isn't a folder called

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.890 
if there isn't a folder called
backgrounds<00:03:40.799> in<00:03:40.890> here<00:03:41.220> double<00:03:41.790> make<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.420> folder

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
backgrounds in here double make a folder

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.990 
backgrounds in here double make a folder
called<00:03:43.049> backgrounds<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.739> then<00:03:44.519> all<00:03:44.790> we<00:03:44.880> need

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
called backgrounds and then all we need

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.610 
called backgrounds and then all we need
to<00:03:45.030> do<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.450> rename<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.019> picture<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.380> want<00:03:46.470> to

running<00:04:07.829> really<00:04:08.040> slow<00:04:08.250> some<00:04:08.549> within<00:04:08.760> a

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
running really slow some within a

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.780 
running really slow some within a
virtual<00:04:08.970> machine<00:04:09.450> i'm<00:04:09.630> not<00:04:09.780> sure<00:04:09.989> why<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.790> could

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
virtual machine i'm not sure why I could

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.069 
virtual machine i'm not sure why I could
just<00:04:11.910> close<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.420> think<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.690> used<00:04:12.900> to

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
under 200 so what's the 245 is a max so

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.690 
under 200 so what's the 245 is a max so
just<00:04:31.670> not<00:04:32.300> G<00:04:32.450> up<00:04:32.600> as<00:04:32.810> far<00:04:33.320> as<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.680> can<00:04:33.740> go<00:04:34.130> that's

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
just not G up as far as I can go that's

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.960 
just not G up as far as I can go that's
about<00:04:34.880> as<00:04:34.940> far<00:04:35.030> as<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.360> can<00:04:35.420> go<00:04:35.660> quality<00:04:36.140> 7<00:04:36.970> so

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
do that and it's good slow in directory

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.250 
do that and it's good slow in directory
though<00:05:03.140> so<00:05:03.770> when<00:05:04.010> daya<00:05:04.280> are<00:05:04.610> there<00:05:05.000> we<00:05:05.090> go<00:05:05.270> go

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
though so when daya are there we go go

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.080 
though so when daya are there we go go
to<00:05:06.320> info<00:05:06.740> go<00:05:06.890> to<00:05:06.920> backgrounds<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:07.760> I'm<00:05:07.880> going

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
to info go to backgrounds and I'm going

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.160 
to info go to backgrounds and I'm going
to<00:05:08.210> just<00:05:09.340> very<00:05:10.340> quickly<00:05:10.580> drag<00:05:11.300> in<00:05:11.570> my<00:05:11.780> default

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
to just very quickly drag in my default

background which is in this folder into

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.470 
background which is in this folder into
that

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.270 

so<00:05:18.020> I'm<00:05:18.080> just<00:05:18.200> going<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.380> swap<00:05:18.650> these<00:05:18.830> folders

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
so I'm just going to swap these folders

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.180 
so I'm just going to swap these folders
of<00:05:19.490> features<00:05:20.030> around<00:05:20.530> ok<00:05:21.530> so<00:05:21.590> I'll<00:05:21.770> swap<00:05:22.010> them

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
of features around ok so I'll swap them

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.890 
of features around ok so I'll swap them
around<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.760> I'm<00:05:22.910> just<00:05:23.060> going<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.330> lock<00:05:23.690> the

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
around and I'm just going to lock the

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.730 
around and I'm just going to lock the
computer<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:26.140> there<00:05:27.140> we<00:05:27.230> go<00:05:27.350> you<00:05:27.410> can<00:05:27.590> see

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
computer and there we go you can see

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.260 
computer and there we go you can see
that<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:27.980> background<00:05:28.100> has<00:05:28.520> changed<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.000> if<00:05:29.030> I

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
that the background has changed so if I

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.940 
that the background has changed so if I
locked<00:05:29.570> my<00:05:29.780> computer<00:05:30.230> that's<00:05:30.380> what<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.650> looked

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
locked my computer that's what it looked

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.410 
locked my computer that's what it looked
like<00:05:31.010> however<00:05:31.850> if<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.000> did<00:05:32.150> that<00:05:32.180> you'll

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
like however if I did that you'll

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.570 
like however if I did that you'll
actually<00:05:32.450> be<00:05:32.840> able<00:05:32.900> to<00:05:33.020> see<00:05:33.200> it<00:05:33.350> so<00:05:34.130> that's<00:05:34.520> the

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
actually be able to see it so that's the
