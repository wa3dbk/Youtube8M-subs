00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.690 
out um and we'll see with the case it
becomes<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.420> stand<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.250> when<00:01:42.460> you're<00:01:42.579> watching

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
becomes a stand so when you're watching

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.880 
becomes a stand so when you're watching
videos<00:01:43.329> that's<00:01:43.750> really<00:01:44.079> nice<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:47.740> it's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
videos that's really nice and when it's

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.929 
videos that's really nice and when it's
closed<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:49.060> kindle<00:01:49.569> feels<00:01:49.780> very<00:01:50.110> firm<00:01:50.709> in<00:01:51.159> the

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
closed the kindle feels very firm in the

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.749 
closed the kindle feels very firm in the
case<00:01:52.390> um<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:54.009> I<00:01:54.039> think<00:01:54.250> this<00:01:54.310> case<00:01:54.549> does<00:01:54.729> a

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
case um so I think this case does a

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.459 
case um so I think this case does a
really<00:01:55.000> good<00:01:55.240> job<00:01:55.299> protecting<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:56.049> kindle

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
really good job protecting the kindle

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.289 
really good job protecting the kindle
and<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:57.130> also<00:01:57.250> comes<00:01:57.489> with<00:01:57.549> two<00:01:57.819> straps<00:01:58.149> of

and it also comes with two straps of

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.380 
and it also comes with two straps of

different colors which are

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.319 
different colors which are
interchangeable<00:02:05.459> so<00:02:06.459> yeah<00:02:06.729> i<00:02:06.759> really<00:02:07.060> like

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
interchangeable so yeah i really like

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.529 
interchangeable so yeah i really like
this<00:02:07.509> case<00:02:07.780> overall<00:02:08.410> i<00:02:08.649> would<00:02:09.009> give<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.789> zagg
