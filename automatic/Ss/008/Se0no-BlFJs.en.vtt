everyone else falls and I get a flop

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.750 
everyone else falls and I get a flop
that's<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.299> exactly<00:01:06.630> great<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.530> me<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.460> as

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that's not exactly great for me but as

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.020 
that's not exactly great for me but as
well<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.090> don't<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.450> I'm<00:01:09.810> behind<00:01:10.260> him<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
well I don't think I'm behind him so the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
well I don't think I'm behind him so the
only<00:01:12.180> problems<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> king<00:01:13.439> on

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
only problems that there is a king on

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.240 
only problems that there is a king on
the<00:01:13.590> flop<00:01:13.890> there's<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:14.340> two<00:01:14.549> clubs<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.250> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the flop there's also two clubs and this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.760 
the flop there's also two clubs and this
is<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.360> scary<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.840> me<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.140> because<00:01:19.439> he's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
is kind of scary for me but because he's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.679 
is kind of scary for me but because he's
a<00:01:19.799> shorter<00:01:20.189> stack<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.909> win<00:01:21.119> odds<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
a shorter stack and my win odds and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.289 
a shorter stack and my win odds and
holdem<00:01:22.200> indicators<00:01:22.650> am<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.580> point<00:01:23.909> four

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
holdem indicators am but one point four

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.109 
holdem indicators am but one point four
to<00:01:25.170> win<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:26.540> decide<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.570> bed<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.850> just<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> see

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to win I decide to bed out just to see

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.090 
to win I decide to bed out just to see
what<00:01:30.299> he<00:01:30.450> does<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.770> he<00:01:32.070> is

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
what he does and because i think he is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.149 
what he does and because i think he is
tilting<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> last<00:01:33.689> hand<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.320> don't<00:01:34.890> think

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
tilting from the last hand I don't think

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.980 
tilting from the last hand I don't think
he's<00:01:35.310> ahead<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.640> me<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.659> exactly

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
chips good thing about this situation is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.920 
chips good thing about this situation is
that<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.650> blinds<00:02:24.920> are<00:02:25.069> still<00:02:25.310> only<00:02:25.459> 30<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.269> 60

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
that the blinds are still only 30 and 60

that the blinds are still only 30 and 60
these<00:02:27.640> succeeded<00:02:28.640> tournaments<00:02:29.030> tend<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.239> be<00:02:29.360> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
these succeeded tournaments tend to be a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.900 
these succeeded tournaments tend to be a
quite<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> bit<00:02:30.080> more<00:02:30.230> aggressive<00:02:30.349> so<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.190> still

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
quite a bit more aggressive so I still

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.759 
quite a bit more aggressive so I still
have<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.330> opportunity<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.840> look<00:02:32.959> at<00:02:33.080> about<00:02:33.319> 30

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
have the opportunity to look at about 30

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.059 
have the opportunity to look at about 30
35<00:02:34.010> maybe<00:02:34.730> even<00:02:34.940> 40<00:02:35.450> hands<00:02:35.930> before<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.769> have<00:02:37.040> to

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
35 maybe even 40 hands before I have to

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.800 
35 maybe even 40 hands before I have to
get<00:02:37.780> really<00:02:38.780> crazy<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:40.150> based<00:02:41.150> on<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
get really crazy and based on the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.990 
get really crazy and based on the
competition<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.470> I've<00:02:42.620> seen<00:02:42.890> here<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.370> still

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
competition that I've seen here I still

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.210 
competition that I've seen here I still
think<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:45.079> have<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.410> good<00:02:45.560> opportunity<00:02:45.860> to

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
think that I have a good opportunity to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.509 
think that I have a good opportunity to
win<00:02:46.430> now<00:02:47.290> because<00:02:48.290> he<00:02:48.470> called<00:02:48.739> me<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:48.950> think

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
win now because he called me I think

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.630 
win now because he called me I think
that<00:02:49.760> he<00:02:49.970> might<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.390> an<00:02:50.750> ace<00:02:50.989> he's<00:02:51.640> he's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
that he might have an ace he's he's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.880 
that he might have an ace he's he's
pretty<00:02:52.940> much<00:02:53.090> saying<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.049> he<00:02:54.349> has<00:02:54.530> a

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
pretty much saying here that he has a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.270 
pretty much saying here that he has a
sting<00:02:55.280> but<00:02:56.140> at<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.260> same<00:02:57.500> time<00:02:57.709> because<00:02:57.920> he

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
sting but at the same time because he

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.160 
sting but at the same time because he
was<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.579> tilt<00:02:58.879> before<00:02:59.239> I<00:02:59.420> would<00:02:59.930> have<00:03:00.049> expected

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
was on tilt before I would have expected

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.819 
was on tilt before I would have expected
him<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.829> rear<00:03:01.040> A's<00:03:01.250> me<00:03:01.459> all<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:02.019> preflop<00:03:03.019> where

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
him to rear A's me all in preflop where

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.000 
him to rear A's me all in preflop where
I<00:03:03.860> might<00:03:04.280> have<00:03:04.400> folded<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.269> hand<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.980> that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
I might have folded that hand to that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.119 
I might have folded that hand to that
are<00:03:07.310> erased<00:03:08.290> anyway<00:03:09.290> he's<00:03:09.530> representing<00:03:10.099> a

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
are erased anyway he's representing a

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.979 
are erased anyway he's representing a
king<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.489> don't<00:03:10.640> think<00:03:10.819> he<00:03:10.910> has<00:03:11.150> one<00:03:11.450> he<00:03:11.660> could

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
king I don't think he has one he could

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.670 
king I don't think he has one he could
have<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.470> 8<00:03:13.360> which<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:15.019> problem<00:03:15.440> for<00:03:15.470> me

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
have a 8 which is a problem for me

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.500 
have a 8 which is a problem for me
because<00:03:15.920> then<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.430> leaves<00:03:16.790> me<00:03:16.940> three<00:03:17.209> Queens

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
because then that leaves me three Queens

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.660 
because then that leaves me three Queens
for<00:03:17.750> an<00:03:17.840> out<00:03:17.989> or<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.260> backdoor<00:03:18.709> stir<00:03:18.980> straight

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
for an out or a backdoor stir straight

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.300 
for an out or a backdoor stir straight
draw<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.319> he<00:03:21.319> could<00:03:21.530> be<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.769> club<00:03:22.100> draw

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
draw and he could be on a club draw

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.670 
draw and he could be on a club draw
which<00:03:22.519> is<00:03:22.670> where<00:03:22.819> I'm<00:03:22.910> hoping<00:03:23.299> or<00:03:23.480> I'm<00:03:24.350> hoping

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
which is where I'm hoping or I'm hoping

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.740 
which is where I'm hoping or I'm hoping
he's<00:03:24.889> on<00:03:25.069> a<00:03:25.100> week<00:03:25.340> erase<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:25.850> just<00:03:26.090> making<00:03:26.660> a

he's on a week erase and just making a
play<00:03:26.959> here<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:29.180> decide<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.930> call

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
play here so I actually decide to call

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.710 
play here so I actually decide to call
with<00:03:30.410> all<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.739> these<00:03:30.859> factors<00:03:31.130> in<00:03:31.700> play<00:03:32.060> here

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
with all of these factors in play here

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.250 
with all of these factors in play here
and<00:03:32.900> he<00:03:33.560> shows<00:03:33.859> a<00:03:34.099> Sten<00:03:34.639> nothing<00:03:35.599> improves<00:03:35.900> for

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
and he shows a Sten nothing improves for

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.220 
and he shows a Sten nothing improves for
him<00:03:36.530> I'm<00:03:37.180> glad<00:03:38.180> he<00:03:38.450> didn't<00:03:38.660> have<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> a8

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
him I'm glad he didn't have the a8

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.140 
him I'm glad he didn't have the a8
because<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.590> would<00:03:39.829> have<00:03:39.920> been<00:03:40.010> dead<00:03:40.250> here<00:03:40.549> now

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150

because I would have been dead here now
the<00:03:42.079> situation<00:03:42.349> has<00:03:42.739> completely<00:03:43.549> turned
