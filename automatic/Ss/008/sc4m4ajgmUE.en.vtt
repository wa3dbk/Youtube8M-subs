00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello my name is junior rival and this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.670
 bible blog episode number 8 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.649
 freestyle 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.510
 the theme of today are the manifestations that 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.309
 are happening all over the country and 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.480
 importance of the Christian in engaging 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.860
 in this fight 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.660
 if you have questions about the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.949
 importance of the participation of Christians 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.140
 in the movements that are happening 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.140
 so watch this video until the end 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 many people still do not understand that the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.500
 purpose of the gospel for the life of the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.309
 man is exactly providing 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.680
 transformation of the surrounding environment 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.989
 the end if god only had interest 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.040
 save us he would kill us would raise the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.290
 people right to the sky 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 What God does in your life is how 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.730
 influence their lives. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.410
 people who are in need 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.390
 This means that the justice of God 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 need to pass through you and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.649
 reach all who suffer when 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.930
 In the scriptures we analyze the lives of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.239
 prophets you clearly realize that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.280
 they were not just men fighting 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.129
 against a religious system that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 also protested against the right of the orphan 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.680
 of the homeless widow even though 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.630
 had to confront kings and emperors 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.189
 and other people of his time the prophet 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.170
 had nothing to do with those who 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.720
 say a prophet today that in the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.640
 try to practice a horoscope right 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.140
 they want to make useless divinations 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 want to talk about subjects that are not 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 relevant to anyone and they shall be 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 Idiot promises of the kind to Brazil will 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.630
 be lord jesus escape the men who 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.820
 are telling a prophet to receive a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.740
 king glory on the part of the people 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.020
 true prophet is the one who gives 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.240
 life for the truth some people have me 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.799
 searched by facebook twitter talking 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.049
 about the passage that is in 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.540
 Romans 13 who speaks specifically 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.640
 about the need of the Christian and to be 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.360
 submissive to all authority instituted 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.130
 for God 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.570
 this passage is true and it is very 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.119
 important problem is that people 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.430
 are misunderstanding the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.530
 which is the established authority 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.090
 God in our case. 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.670
 if you still do not know the biggest 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.270
 authority established in our country does not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.250
 is the president dilma or other politicians 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.200
 the highest authority the constitution 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.989
 the legitimacy of this 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.510
 constitution comes from the power emanating from the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.280
 people for the people and for the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.099
 means that the policy actually to 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.930
 our employee he represents us more 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.760
 should be charged when you leave us 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.390
 represent the constitution guarantees us 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.939
 health education freedom these rights 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.040
 are called fundamental rights 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.989
 this means that the state has the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.970
 to provide each of them 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.340
 so my friend when we go to the street 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.379
 to protest to collect from politicians 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.549
 that honor what the constitution 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.379
 speech 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.060
 we are not really being against 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.590
 the authority instituted by God by the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.390
 otherwise we are in favor 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.340
 we are defending the authority 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.530
 instituted by God in our country to 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.750
 praise of him that doeth good, then stop 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.239
 make excuses ragged and get involved 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.069
 but the will that this manifestation is 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.560
 something of the illuminati is end of 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.389
 world for the love of god my friend end of 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.489
 world to continue living in this 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:06.359
 line nation we start to think that 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.459
 It's all part of a conspiracy and you 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.109
 do not go to the street you do not get involved 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.269
 You do not want to debate with people. 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.909
 the most basic subjects 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.150
 about the fight for justice for 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.500
 housing for transportation for health but 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.629
 I'm sure that when the selection 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.699
 Are you playing your television? 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.310
 stay there cheering for neymar and company 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.599
 of the showzinho winning millions of its 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.669
 curves while people are 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.829
 dying do not waste your time just 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.780
 with useless manifestations like the march 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.970
 For Jesus, do not waste your time alone. 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.459
 participating in shows and raising their 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.949
 hand being part of a dumb dough that 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.109
 criticizes nothing and does not really 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.419
 moves toward those who are being 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.280
 neglected by our society not 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.260
 is content to be part of a church 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.000
 where people are alienated 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.819
 It is necessary to raise the discussions 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.370
 I need to discuss these things not accepted 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.900
 be overwhelmed by a pastor who does not want 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.400
 become involved with these causes that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.099
 with this bullshit that we should 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.540
 Just keep looking, God in truth. 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.400
 will fix things we will not 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.650
 we need to get involved at last we have 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.959
 to take care only of spiritual things 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.970
 this discourse the speech of the cowards is 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.760
 the discourse of those people's omissions 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.590
 that when he sees injustice being committed 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.579
 prefer to shut up rather go back to 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.949
 their homes 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.380
 the Rev. Martin Luther King in 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.070
 fact did the opposite of it realized how 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.570
 again the origin of a 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.130
 The main manifestation is 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.080
 This is a very 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.670
 serious movement started by luther king 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.160
 in the fight for civil rights in the states 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.140
 United States also ended in violence and 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.050
 a series of opportunities but this 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.210
 never took the legitimacy of what 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.040
 he started understand your responsibility 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.590
 as a Christian and our responsibility 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.520
 As a Brazilian church we need to go. 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.470
 to the streets 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.720
 go to the streets not to kill but to 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.150
 die go to the streets not to break 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.980
 nothing but to be broken if necessary 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.020
 and remember we're writing not 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.180
 only the history books of our 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.910
 children but also the history of the church 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.550
 of our days do not cower in the name of 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.110
 of Jesus Christ already 20 now thursday 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.420
 I will be with the people of my 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.340
 church and some friends at the 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.380
 what will happen in my city that 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.750
 you too can get involved in your 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.330
 reality and that this is not something that 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.710
 ends only in a demonstration and this 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.930
 involvement in this struggle for justice 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.280
 becomes a reality in the church 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.930
 Brazilian from now on 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.860
 God bless you and I'll see you again 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.860
 in the next videos
