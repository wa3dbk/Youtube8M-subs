to<00:02:49.239> somehow<00:02:49.570> land<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.470> pedestrian<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.190> I'm

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
to somehow land on a pedestrian so I'm

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.440 
to somehow land on a pedestrian so I'm
not<00:02:51.400> really<00:02:51.519> sure<00:02:51.730> where<00:02:51.970> I'm<00:02:52.030> supposed<00:02:52.090> to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
not really sure where I'm supposed to

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.120 
not really sure where I'm supposed to
fly<00:02:52.600> because<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.320> have<00:02:53.440> no<00:02:53.560> idea<00:02:53.830> where<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
fly because I have no idea where the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.880 
fly because I have no idea where the
people<00:02:54.400> are<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:55.930> pretty<00:02:56.320> sure<00:02:56.739> that

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
people are and I'm pretty sure that

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.949 
people are and I'm pretty sure that
they're<00:02:57.010> not<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.489> roof<00:02:57.640> now<00:02:58.570> before<00:02:58.900> we

they're not on the roof now before we
continue<00:02:59.050> any<00:02:59.440> further<00:02:59.500> we<00:02:59.890> should<00:02:59.920> probably

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
continue any further we should probably

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.580 
continue any further we should probably
go<00:03:00.730> ahead<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:00.970> repair<00:03:01.390> our<00:03:01.450> car<00:03:01.750> because<00:03:02.380> well

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
straight through the hole and then we

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.100 
straight through the hole and then we
flew<00:03:37.610> into<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.910> sign<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.360> they'd<00:03:38.810> also

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
flew into the sign and they'd also

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.450 
flew into the sign and they'd also
noticed<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.530> if<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.710> do<00:03:39.830> use<00:03:40.010> Franklin's

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
noticed that if you do use Franklin's

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.430 
noticed that if you do use Franklin's
special<00:03:40.760> ability<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.390> you<00:03:42.050> can<00:03:42.290> actually

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
special ability and you can actually

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.800 
special ability and you can actually
turn<00:03:42.710> quite<00:03:43.010> well<00:03:44.620> as<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.830> can<00:03:45.950> clearly<00:03:46.040> see

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
turn quite well as you can clearly see

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.940 
turn quite well as you can clearly see
we're<00:03:47.810> getting<00:03:47.900> closer<00:03:48.260> we're<00:03:48.740> getting

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
we're getting closer we're getting

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.890 
we're getting closer we're getting
closer<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.610> this<00:03:49.820> was<00:03:50.000> way<00:03:50.240> harder<00:03:50.600> than<00:03:50.720> I

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
closer and this was way harder than I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.700 
closer and this was way harder than I
had<00:03:50.990> expected

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
had expected

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.330 
had expected
that's<00:03:51.890> what<00:03:52.070> she<00:03:52.190> said<00:03:54.010> okay<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.040> let's<00:03:55.250> go

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
that's what she said okay so let's go

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
that's what she said okay so let's go
ahead<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.550> see<00:03:55.700> if<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:55.880> can<00:03:56.030> make<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.180> little

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
ahead and see if we can make a little

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.140 
ahead and see if we can make a little
drift<00:03:56.630> right<00:03:56.870> here<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:58.340> let's<00:03:58.520> go<00:03:58.640> ahead<00:03:58.760> and

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
drift right here so let's go ahead and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.820 
drift right here so let's go ahead and
slam<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.750> handbrake<00:04:00.340> here<00:04:01.340> we<00:04:01.430> go<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:02.830> we

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
slam the handbrake here we go and we

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.270 
slam the handbrake here we go and we
crashed

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
crashed

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.830

let's<00:04:18.260> see<00:04:18.410> if<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.680> can<00:04:18.830> maybe<00:04:19.040> make<00:04:19.610> this

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
let's see if you can maybe make this

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.090 
let's see if you can maybe make this
jump<00:04:20.390> right<00:04:20.720> here<00:04:20.780> i'm<00:04:21.530> not<00:04:21.739> sure<00:04:21.890> if<00:04:21.950> the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
jump right here i'm not sure if the

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.830 
jump right here i'm not sure if the
value<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.520> fast<00:04:22.760> enough<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.330> be<00:04:23.450> able<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.630> do

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
value is fast enough to be able to do

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.510 
value is fast enough to be able to do
this<00:04:23.990> but<00:04:24.500> basically<00:04:24.890> we<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.130> need<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.370> go

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
this but basically we just need to go

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.880 
this but basically we just need to go
off<00:04:25.730> this<00:04:25.880> little<00:04:26.180> hill<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.620> not<00:04:27.620> coming

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
off this little hill and not coming

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.530 
off this little hill and not coming
backwards<00:04:28.400> though<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:28.910> then<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.300> fly<00:04:29.510> over

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
backwards though and then you fly over

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.270 
backwards though and then you fly over
the<00:04:29.750> gates<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.230> hopefully<00:04:30.650> enter<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.100> base

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
the gates and hopefully enter the base

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.950 
the gates and hopefully enter the base
okay<00:04:31.850> I<00:04:31.880> think<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.180> run-up<00:04:32.510> should<00:04:32.690> be<00:04:32.810> long

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
okay I think this run-up should be long

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.390 
okay I think this run-up should be long
enough<00:04:32.990> let's<00:04:33.560> just<00:04:33.680> pull<00:04:33.830> some<00:04:34.010> wheelies<00:04:34.310> to

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
enough let's just pull some wheelies to

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.220 
enough let's just pull some wheelies to
go<00:04:34.490> even<00:04:34.760> faster<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.390> I<00:04:35.660> have<00:04:35.780> never<00:04:35.930> seen<00:04:36.200> a

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
go even faster and I have never seen a

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.010 
go even faster and I have never seen a
faggio<00:04:36.710> Drive<00:04:36.980> this<00:04:37.130> quick<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:37.850> let's<00:04:37.880> see<00:04:38.240> if

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
faggio Drive this quick so let's see if

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.200 
faggio Drive this quick so let's see if
we<00:04:39.080> can<00:04:39.350> make<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.590> jump

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.800 

not<00:04:44.210> even<00:04:44.540> close

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
not even close

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.780 
not even close
okay<00:04:45.440> so<00:04:45.530> someone<00:04:45.950> is<00:04:46.070> finished<00:04:46.430> in<00:04:46.550> first

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
okay so someone is finished in first

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.280 
okay so someone is finished in first
place<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.540> don't<00:04:47.600> really<00:04:47.780> think<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:48.170> I'm

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
place and I don't really think that I'm

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.720 
place and I don't really think that I'm
even<00:04:48.530> close<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.040> finish<00:04:49.310> time<00:04:49.490> at<00:04:49.610> all

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
even close to the finish time at all

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.970 
even close to the finish time at all
well<00:04:49.850> let's<00:04:50.000> just<00:04:50.630> keep<00:04:50.780> going<00:04:50.840> come<00:04:51.680> on<00:04:51.770> where

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
well let's just keep going come on where

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.450 
well let's just keep going come on where
is<00:04:52.070> this<00:04:52.190> dude<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.610> we<00:04:53.230> got<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.290> be<00:04:54.410> enough<00:04:54.590> is

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
is this dude and we got to be enough is

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.280 
is this dude and we got to be enough is
we<00:04:55.670> still<00:04:55.910> need<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.120> lot<00:04:56.330> more<00:04:56.600> speed<00:04:56.870> which<00:04:57.140> is

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
we still need a lot more speed which is

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.960 
we still need a lot more speed which is
really<00:04:57.740> really<00:04:57.800> hard<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.190> achieve<00:04:58.310> when<00:04:58.880> you

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
really really hard to achieve when you

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.400 
really really hard to achieve when you
basically<00:04:59.270> don't<00:04:59.510> have<00:04:59.690> any<00:04:59.840> tires<00:05:00.110> but

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
basically don't have any tires but

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
basically don't have any tires but
anyways<00:05:00.680> let's<00:05:00.950> try<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.160> again

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
anyways let's try it again

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.230 
anyways let's try it again
so<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.850> start<00:05:02.150> right<00:05:02.390> here<00:05:02.810> there<00:05:03.560> we<00:05:03.680> go<00:05:04.240> no

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
so the start right here there we go no

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.720 
so the start right here there we go no
no<00:05:05.360> no<00:05:05.480> no<00:05:05.630> no<00:05:05.780> fail<00:05:06.770> again<00:05:07.130> okay<00:05:07.520> here<00:05:07.640> we<00:05:07.670> go

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
no no no no fail again okay here we go

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.230 
no no no no fail again okay here we go
again

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
again

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.840 
again
come<00:05:08.570> on<00:05:08.660> come<00:05:08.780> on<00:05:08.810> come<00:05:08.930> on<00:05:09.050> no<00:05:09.520> Jesus<00:05:10.520> Christ

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
come on come on come on no Jesus Christ

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.130 
come on come on come on no Jesus Christ

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.170 
the stunts we managed to learn inside of
the<00:06:41.830> parking<00:06:42.220> garage<00:06:42.250> then<00:06:42.610> we<00:06:42.700> bumped<00:06:42.880> off

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
the parking garage then we bumped off

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.150 
the parking garage then we bumped off
the<00:06:43.210> roof<00:06:43.600> when<00:06:43.900> we<00:06:44.050> came<00:06:44.200> in<00:06:44.440> but<00:06:44.650> honestly<00:06:45.010> if

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
the roof when we came in but honestly if

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.190 
the roof when we came in but honestly if
it<00:06:45.250> wouldn't<00:06:45.520> have<00:06:45.580> done<00:06:45.820> that<00:06:46.120> and<00:06:46.390> we<00:06:47.020> would

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
it wouldn't have done that and we would

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.990 
it wouldn't have done that and we would
have<00:06:47.230> just<00:06:47.350> slammed<00:06:47.830> right<00:06:47.980> into<00:06:48.460> this<00:06:48.670> ball

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
have just slammed right into this ball

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.940 
have just slammed right into this ball
and<00:06:49.240> just<00:06:49.420> fade<00:06:49.720> basically<00:06:50.230> the<00:06:50.350> only<00:06:50.470> stunt

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
and just fade basically the only stunt

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.280 
and just fade basically the only stunt
that<00:06:51.700> we<00:06:52.030> possibly<00:06:52.330> have<00:06:52.600> a<00:06:52.690> chance<00:06:52.960> of<00:06:53.140> doing

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
that we possibly have a chance of doing

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.170 
that we possibly have a chance of doing
is<00:06:53.620> the<00:06:53.830> garage<00:06:54.070> entry<00:06:54.580> over<00:06:54.760> by<00:06:54.910> the<00:06:54.970> airport

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
is the garage entry over by the airport

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.730 
is the garage entry over by the airport
and<00:06:55.570> I<00:06:55.600> do<00:06:55.660> know<00:06:55.900> that<00:06:55.930> I've<00:06:56.140> done<00:06:56.320> this<00:06:56.500> stunt

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
and I do know that I've done this stunt

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.320 
and I do know that I've done this stunt
many<00:06:56.950> times<00:06:57.190> before<00:06:57.430> but<00:06:57.910> I<00:06:57.970> don't<00:06:58.180> really

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
many times before but I don't really

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.820 
many times before but I don't really
think<00:06:58.390> there's<00:06:58.930> any<00:06:59.050> other<00:06:59.290> standard<00:06:59.590> we

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
think there's any other standard we

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.980 
think there's any other standard we
could<00:07:00.010> do<00:07:00.130> and<00:07:00.490> because<00:07:01.210> well<00:07:01.390> as<00:07:01.570> you<00:07:01.660> can<00:07:01.780> see

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
could do and because well as you can see

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.220 
could do and because well as you can see
I'm<00:07:02.200> completely<00:07:02.410> out<00:07:02.770> of<00:07:02.860> control
