see now we can
get<00:02:52.930> out<00:02:53.110> our<00:02:53.350> electrical<00:02:53.890> connectors<00:02:54.370> when

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
get out our electrical connectors when

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.310 
get out our electrical connectors when
it's<00:02:55.210> a<00:02:55.270> net<00:02:55.450> position<00:02:56.580> right<00:02:57.580> there<00:02:58.320> all

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
it's a net position right there all

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.200 
it's a net position right there all
right<00:02:59.620> let's<00:02:59.770> start<00:03:00.040> with<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.850> gray

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
right let's start with this gray

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.350 
right let's start with this gray
electrical<00:03:01.900> connector<00:03:02.290> right<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:04.210> can

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
electrical connector right here you can

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.810 
electrical connector right here you can
see<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.720> has<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:06.540> lock<00:03:07.540> on<00:03:07.840> one<00:03:08.590> side<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.760> is

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
see it has a lock on one side this is

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.260 
see it has a lock on one side this is
like<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:12.000> three-person<00:03:13.000> operation<00:03:13.540> here<00:03:15.270> here

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
like a three-person operation here here

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.920 
like a three-person operation here here
we<00:03:16.480> go

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
we go

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.080 
we go
I<00:03:17.370> got<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.580> one<00:03:20.430> all<00:03:21.430> right<00:03:21.490> now<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
I got that one all right now for the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.920 
I got that one all right now for the
other<00:03:22.210> one<00:03:22.830> we<00:03:23.830> have<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.330> little<00:03:25.330> lock<00:03:25.630> right

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
other one we have a little lock right

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.030 
other one we have a little lock right
here<00:03:25.990> will<00:03:26.350> push<00:03:26.590> in<00:03:27.570> pry<00:03:28.570> up<00:03:28.600> on<00:03:28.990> it<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.320> there

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
here will push in pry up on it and there

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.290 
here will push in pry up on it and there
it<00:03:30.130> is

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:43.360 

switches<00:03:34.300> all<00:03:34.630> out

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.370 

and<00:03:43.520> that's<00:03:44.180> all<00:03:44.420> there<00:03:44.569> is<00:03:44.599> to<00:03:44.870> removing<00:03:45.260> the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
and that's all there is to removing the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.670 
and that's all there is to removing the
multifunction<00:03:46.099> switch<00:03:46.280> on<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.380> Nissan<00:03:48.380> Quest
