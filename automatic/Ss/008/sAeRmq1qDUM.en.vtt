00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.410
 here to cause a game your score 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.629
 the number of rounds you've already done here 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.690
 the your life 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.230

 here for you to speed up the speed of 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 game 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.079
 let's say it's an increase in difficulty 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.000
 and here the waters 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.770
 face I'll just put the gun here 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 put one in the loot 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:19.979
 placed at the beginning and two here at the end 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.979
 Good, there is not much secret in this game, right? 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.369
 This tower defense games are games 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.280
 simple are very beginners 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.240
 he is very good addicts very much like 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.900
 from this game 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.280
 My record is very high and I'm going to say one 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.200
 little about guns 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.369
 this weapon in this first weapon well 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:48.450
 simple she just shot herself 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:53.130
 according to she already has one, let's say that a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.549
 special power she pauses the enemy is the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.840
 lets the movement of enemies is more 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.049
 slow 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.689
 I will increase the difficulty it here 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.549
 here the increase in difficulty is the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.869
 speed that the character who 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.710
 enemies you may have are normal times 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.860
 2 times 4 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.590
 is to increase the difficulty, but also to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.430
 mentor thing with this ghost that he 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.160
 will pass and will arrive at the point without 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.680
 none of them because because I 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.180
 have to buy this is the weapon that 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.510
 detected discounted 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.940
 I said each holds a function 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.950
 each weapon is acting against a type of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.910
 enemy then how are you talking about this 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.500
 here you have 2004 times and increase 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.990
 difficulty but also increases the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.940
 the award you get when you detonated 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.460
 the enemy is now coming back to talk about 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.290
 the powers of the union have already spoken of this here 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:56.680
 that it pauses the movements of enemies 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.150
 the one that looks like a satellite is for the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.700
 ghosts detection 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.530
 there we have this gun here that is anti 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:10.410
 air it but it is more specifically 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:13.780
 characters that fly by and we have 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.770
 these two others here these two here 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.050
 are very important weapons because 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.100
 because they act against a type of 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.260
 monster and is now passing here the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.440
 other weapons can not act against 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.330
 because it freezes classes only at 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.810
 long range weapon can act 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.560
 against him in case this is ours 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.890
 miss you and this one that costs you 100 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.670
 she is a firearm so besides having 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.020
 a big bill it keeps burning 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.510
 for a while it hit the enemy 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.690
 and will have in Haiti there is still a certain 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.330
 time then these are the top two 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.820
 waters of the game mainly because 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.550
 The hardest world you can take is 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.920
 that money every 20 round you 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.100
 Let's say you have to have a big boss. 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.770
 a master gets on the roll of 20 here he 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.940
 will appear you detonated and you win is 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.090
 20 points in November 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.280
 depending on the difficulty is also you 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.460
 click on love you can also sell 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.650
 you can sell it can sell for 24 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.280
 or I need 30 to do the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:36.860
 upgrade the plaid I picked up from that square 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:39.620
 I lived in this one I can sell and at 20 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.950
 no boss appeared to confuse me 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.330
 for me it 's normal for 20 but it 's subway login 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.850

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.340
