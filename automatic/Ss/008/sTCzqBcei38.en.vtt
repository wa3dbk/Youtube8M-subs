the common metal so you get a new
powerup<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.330> level<00:00:12.480> cloud<00:00:13.380> Mario<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
powerup for this level cloud Mario and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.300 
powerup for this level cloud Mario and
what<00:00:15.360> his<00:00:16.049> powerup<00:00:16.470> more<00:00:16.680> how<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.070> powerup

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
what his powerup more how this powerup

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.400 
what his powerup more how this powerup
works<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.850> every<00:00:18.810> time<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:18.990> touch<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> cloud

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
works is every time you touch a cloud

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.609 
works is every time you touch a cloud
you<00:00:20.250> get<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.550> make<00:00:20.760> three<00:00:21.390> new<00:00:21.720> temporary

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you get to make three new temporary

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.410 
you get to make three new temporary
cloud<00:00:22.949> platforms<00:00:23.460> when<00:00:23.640> jumping<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> air

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
cloud platforms when jumping in the air

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.480 
cloud platforms when jumping in the air
and<00:00:24.930> when<00:00:25.650> you're<00:00:25.769> jumping<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> air<00:00:26.310> you

can shake your controller to create a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.999 
can shake your controller to create a
platform<00:00:30.840> right<00:00:30.900> at<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.170> feet<00:00:31.349> which<00:00:31.769> lets

platform right at your feet which lets
you<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.579> basically<00:00:32.910> almost<00:00:33.329> anywhere<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
you get to basically almost anywhere you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.260 
you get to basically almost anywhere you
want<00:00:34.070> they<00:00:35.070> keep<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.399> pretty<00:00:35.610> easy<00:00:35.820> though<00:00:36.030> for

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
want they keep it pretty easy though for

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.549 
want they keep it pretty easy though for
here<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> don't<00:00:36.840> even<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
here like you don't even have to use the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.830 
here like you don't even have to use the
clouds<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> whole<00:00:39.059> scene<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.390> tap

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
clouds it can do the whole scene and tap

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.330 
clouds it can do the whole scene and tap
a<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> super<00:00:40.710> long<00:00:40.860> jump<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.219> don't

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
a to get the super long jump you don't

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.190 
a to get the super long jump you don't
even<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> use<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
even have to use it and then on this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840 
even have to use it and then on this
part<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.620> actually<00:00:43.890> wall<00:00:44.250> jump<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:44.730> one

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
part you can actually wall jump from one

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.590 
part you can actually wall jump from one
part<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> next<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.559> wouldn't

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
part to the next to get up that wouldn't

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:56.600 
part to the next to get up that wouldn't
shoot<00:00:52.100> also<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.390> cloud<00:00:54.660> platform<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.610> comic

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
shoot also so the cloud platform a comic

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
shoot also so the cloud platform a comic
coin<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.600> directly<00:00:57.960> ahead<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.289> should

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
coin for this is directly ahead I should

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.990 
coin for this is directly ahead I should
not<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.859> jumped<00:00:59.160> into<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> water<00:00:59.579> there<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
not have jumped into the water there I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.400 
not have jumped into the water there I
was<00:01:00.629> gonna<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.020> definitely<00:01:01.320> more

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
was gonna make it definitely more

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
difficult you can see it right on the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.810 
difficult you can see it right on the
top<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.820> pillar<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.549> area

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
top of that pillar but for this area

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
top of that pillar but for this area

points of the star and then after they
disappear<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.610> pick<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.909> cloud

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
disappear you can pick up that cloud

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.820 
disappear you can pick up that cloud
medal<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> didn't<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> before<00:01:19.590> but

medal if you didn't get it before but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.260 
medal if you didn't get it before but
when<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> cloud<00:01:20.549> powerup<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.119> don't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
when you have the cloud powerup I don't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.499 
when you have the cloud powerup I don't
think<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.450> mentioned<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.840> before<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:24.270> cannot

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509

think I mentioned this before you cannot
touch<00:01:24.750> water<00:01:25.130> because<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.159> kills<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.180> power

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
touch water because that kills the power

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.429 
touch water because that kills the power
