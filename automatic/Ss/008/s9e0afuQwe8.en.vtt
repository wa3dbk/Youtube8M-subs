00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
space drop now we have on this piece in

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.059 
space drop now we have on this piece in
the<00:05:14.180> middle<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.630> see<00:05:14.960> little<00:05:15.199> jar<00:05:15.409> up<00:05:15.560> what

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
the middle you see little jar up what

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.740 
the middle you see little jar up what
