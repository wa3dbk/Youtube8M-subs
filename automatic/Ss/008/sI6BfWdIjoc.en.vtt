00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.759
 a question about cinema that does not work is only from God 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.410

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.829
 everything that this one has asked the emulation 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.969
 has been fulfilled 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.530
 asked Oran prayers that the Lord orders that did not come out 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.089

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.839
 normally he does not know with what he said that maybe they still have not received any 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.989

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.210
 I come to the altar because it is a god principle 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.440
 it is a spiritual principle 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 it is a commandment 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.080
 because God as king deserves my honor 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.940

 and I want to have an attitude 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.010
 why 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.560
 I am very impressed by the word that appears in the book of events with the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.340
 life of cornelius 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.500
 a man 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 that was not 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.050
 we could say his fight we're going to today was not the dome 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.330
 so delicious 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.650
 I was not a Christian 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.120
 was a 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.380
 for those of us who could not say was a soldier 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.150
 Roman 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.580
 but that he did not this man had a virtue 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.070
 what the head spoke in front of the presence of the sr says the writing 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.060
 he was a pious man 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 was active he had a generous heart willing heart 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.900
 he was in town and was afraid of god with all his house says these 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.860
 days 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.410
 and that that fearful word gods that he the man heard some 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.740
 moment 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.040
 in the word ni and that word of 2002 the tooth captives 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.300
 I take care 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.389
 to obey that word 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.110
 I a tail to the Lord says the writing that 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.300
 something is characterized this man who now still much 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.759
 and that they offered 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.759
 and I do not know if this man came to read Psalm 20 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.709
 the one who says the passage you remember all his offerings 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.059
 but this man 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.729
 I received a response from God where an angel told him 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:31.939
 cornelius 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.909

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.419

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.169
 Angie have come up for memory before God 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.829
 and the angel was sent to the answer 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.459
 I do not know how many hours were done to them 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.470
 I do not know how many offerings Cornelius gave what I do know is that this man to me 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.619
 shows that he had an attitude 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.689
 constant to pray 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.909

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.420
 that we preserve we will persevere regular that remained firm not the beginning 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.150
 without knowing much 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.339
 because he was not a Jew 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:12.079
 it was not p of the vicious dome 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.359
 he was a pagan of a nation that had invaded to enter 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.879
 but 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.939
 of what he heard was enough for him to persevere at that time 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.149
