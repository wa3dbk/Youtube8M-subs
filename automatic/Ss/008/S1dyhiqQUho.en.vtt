00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.769
 What I am here I bring you today 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.120
 the package we have version 8.11 of 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:10.120
 goal of time you already know that the version 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.679
 8.11 yesterday left the European server and 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.360
 as you know every time it 's a new 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.879
 patch to receive the package of mods 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.920
 updated and I would have liked it as 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.070
 I did the one from the previous time upload it in the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.170
 same day but I could not in this case 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.650
 because the new version of the game have 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 changed many site folders 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.420
 the peephole did not work well the x goes up 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.340
 it absolutely destroyed me and neither 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.379
 it worked was looked for in how many outputs 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.770
 of the game a real disaster the 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.390
 true then I have had in the end that 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 obviate the part insert the damage panel 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.230
 because I have not managed to find 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 still the updated version the panel 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.470
 of damage as soon as it leaves it will incorporate 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.330
 and I will upload the mods package again 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.269
 but as many of you have already asked me 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.239
 peephole with the zoom and with the new one that 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.739
 upload my everything so I'll upload it 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.300
 perfectly in any kind of problem 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.850
 as for the doubts that you had me 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.100
 proposed if the package of mods is legal 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.090
 if the peephole with the zoom by 30 is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.640
 perfectly legal there are many many 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.770
 mods with the peephole 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.340
 they use this zoom for 30 or so this is 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.600
 it is not a separate case and really the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.040
 only that changes that you can see the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.140
 better trajectory of the projectile though 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.570
 At first do not panic if you fail 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.390
 many many shots because being so 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.000
 so close gives you a sense of false 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.369
 africanÃ­a and you're really at 400 meters 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.360
 is the giant tank with your screen and 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.550
 you think that the shot will go exactly 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.630
 where are you going to aim and it's not like that 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.150
 can you really see what the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.470
 trajectory that the projectile carries and what 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.330
 that yes that will allow you is that 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.430
 principle even if it is not very effective 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.560
 then you get the hang of it with many 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.270
 more canyons and you can see perfectly 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.820
 what is the real trajectory and can you 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.759
 anticipate the tanks much better 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.860
 enemies when they move so nothing 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.539
 you ask me where is the package of 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.190
 way it gets on the hill is down there in 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.590
 the description of the video you will see so that 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.990
 we have updated you to version 8.11 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.820
 with the new yellow will be raised 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.800
 equal mediafire gone well done is 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.539
 just open the folder which is picks 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.000
 the archives the copies and you will see them in 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.860
 your wall of tanks folder like 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.600
 a works if I see that there are many people 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.650
 who does not like this new mini and me 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.110
 It seems a lot 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.610
 useful that the one that had before served that 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.930
 you do not like what I do is I go back to 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.120
 upload the package of mods that I had 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.000
 old changing the peephole and you're 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.579
 all as always but considered that the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.620
 peephole is a very important change and os 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.689
 will allow you to better target the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.590
 final as I tell you then nothing has this 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.720
 been everything has been a pretty video 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.549
 fast so nothing lucky them in the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.549
 battlefield see you later
