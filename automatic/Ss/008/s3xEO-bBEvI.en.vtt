comparison between the HTC One m8 and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.629 
comparison between the HTC One m8 and
iPhone<00:00:12.870> 5s<00:00:13.380> but<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.860> time<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.219> are<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
iPhone 5s but this time we are going to

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.580 
iPhone 5s but this time we are going to
be<00:00:14.759> comparing<00:00:15.330> picture<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.020> video<00:00:16.379> samples

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
be comparing picture and video samples

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.740 
be comparing picture and video samples
to<00:00:17.010> determine<00:00:17.460> which<00:00:17.640> phone<00:00:17.910> has<00:00:18.180> an<00:00:18.330> overall

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
to determine which phone has an overall

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.779 
to determine which phone has an overall
better<00:00:18.930> camera<00:00:19.500> quality<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.369> Before<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.699> jump

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
better camera quality so Before we jump

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.670 
better camera quality so Before we jump
in<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> samples<00:00:21.630> let's<00:00:21.930> take<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> quick<00:00:22.529> look

so one thing I want to mention here is
that<00:05:59.629> both<00:06:00.169> the<00:06:00.319> iPhone<00:06:00.470> 5s<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.490> m8<00:06:01.970> don't

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
that both the iPhone 5s and the m8 don't

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.510

to<00:06:17.509> give<00:06:17.720> you<00:06:17.840> an<00:06:17.960> idea<00:06:18.050> of<00:06:18.319> the<00:06:18.650> focusing

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
to give you an idea of the focusing

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:28.749 
to give you an idea of the focusing
speed<00:06:26.380> now<00:06:27.380> let's<00:06:27.620> look<00:06:27.710> at<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:27.979> m8<00:06:28.400> once

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
speed now let's look at the m8 once

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.939 
speed now let's look at the m8 once
again<00:06:29.000> it<00:06:29.180> doesn't<00:06:29.210> continuously<00:06:30.050> autofocus

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:30.949 
again it doesn't continuously autofocus

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:32.770 
again it doesn't continuously autofocus
so<00:06:31.130> I<00:06:31.159> manually<00:06:31.610> adjusting<00:06:32.120> it<00:06:32.240> as<00:06:32.360> I<00:06:32.539> move

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
so I manually adjusting it as I move

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.749 
so I manually adjusting it as I move
between<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:33.199> objects<00:06:33.740> and<00:06:33.919> you<00:06:34.430> can<00:06:34.460> tell

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
between the objects and you can tell

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.580 
between the objects and you can tell
here<00:06:35.030> that<00:06:35.180> the<00:06:35.300> m8<00:06:35.599> is<00:06:35.750> noticeably<00:06:36.319> faster

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
here that the m8 is noticeably faster

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:55.909 
here that the m8 is noticeably faster
when<00:06:37.099> it<00:06:37.220> comes<00:06:37.490> to<00:06:37.699> focusing

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.379 

anyways<00:06:56.919> that<00:06:57.159> is<00:06:57.280> it<00:06:57.430> for<00:06:57.550> the<00:06:57.610> camera<00:06:57.939> tests

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
anyways that is it for the camera tests

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.600
