00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:16.610
 yes windows with youtube friends like 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.890
 are welcome to a new video of 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.980
 minecraft and guys and in this case they are 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.780
 news many news and good as 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.150
 you know the new version is the 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.100
 0.11 zero point and according to 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.860
 developers this update does not 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.430
 it will be as big as 0.9 point zero 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.740
 but the big one will be 1.0 point zero 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.770
 without wrapping guys could decide and 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.560
 instead of doing them to point 11.0 do 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.790
 definitely the 1.0 zero point but 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.500
 well that 's a lot, so it goes 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.000
 we are going to what interests us which is 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.530
 very cool because all three 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.989
 developers have put their part 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.260
 to add new things to minecraft and 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.270
 the first one is tomÃ¡s uchechi which has 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.670
 I've been experimenting with various things 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.739
 among which we knew was the menu 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.600
 world edition which we can 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.790
 change the game mode ie 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.650
 just creative and also vice versa 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.660
 among other things 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.270
 and more guys this menu was totally 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.460
 added now according to him it's time to 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.040
 start adding the cans thing that you 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.740
 supposed to be at 0.10 point 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.050
 zero but it was not like that though guys 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.840
 Tom has been distracted again and in this 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.270
 case the following tweet is not sent 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.880
 and I got to this for an hour 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.710
 and as always it seems a time mode of 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.690
 reverse it 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.060
 and good guys how can you appreciate in 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.430
 the image tommaso did something with the grass 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.680
 made this have a mini effect 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.229
 high grass is to say that the block of 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.180
 grass has a low grass elevation 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.340
 but it does not become like the herbs of 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.920
 tall grass are simply going low 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.960
 all of you but I like it as 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.909
 see however we do not know if 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.550
 will keep or take it away 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.409
 It is probable that they will leave it but good 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.630
 on the other side we go with the developer 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.000
 johan which is underway with the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.250
 skins and in this case we simply 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.990
 It keeps track of your progress and this 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.479
 it's your tweet 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.180
 and we're still working on the corners 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.690
 that's me as I currently see in the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.090
 zip and 0.11 point zero see guys 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.980
 it's just a girl's skin but 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.110
 here the interesting thing is that it is assumed that 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.330
 did not use any kind of external means 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.330
 to place it but he used the same 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.340
 game to put the skin is not yet known 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.080
 a lot about how the process will be but 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.910
 I can assure you that we will not have to 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.760
 replace any point the chart of 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.610
 game and finally we go with someone who 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.290
 I was missing by a lot and it's a 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.110
 former developer of minecraft and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.310
 minecraft and what he presents to us is 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.769
 something amazing 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.019
 here is your tweets effects 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.910
 provisions in the zip and only the 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.000
 There are still no bottles because 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.250
 they need the net there 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.740
 and in the image guys we can see that the 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.240
 bar of hearts is in green this is 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.580
 because the effect of 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.800
 poisoning and in the part of the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.990
 right we can see the list of effects 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.420
 that currently has steve in the image 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.060
 the meanings of the icons are the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.470
 following the wing means more 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.150
 speed when walking 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.550
 the rabbit means more height than 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.160
 jump the shield is more resistance to 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.440
 blows and the heart is poisoning 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.030
 and good guys as we can see in the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.489
 next update there will already be the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.380
 effects as when a spider 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.989
 cave attacks you get the effect of 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.120
 poisoning and good guys to say 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.530
 I'm really a bit confused 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.180
 He always mentions that there is no 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.610
 positions as such in the new version 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.230
 Well, we need several things from 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.170
 schneider to make the potions is 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.330
 say those potion bottles without 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.550
 However, the effects of the positions 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.560
 they will be but as we can see 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.900
 in the image this has the effect of 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.370
 jump and increased speed so no 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.950
 I'm sure how these will be obtained 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.660
 effects but marc guys that would be all 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.400
 today go to the area of the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.480
 comments so they can read what 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.410
 you think about the 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.940
 positions 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.550
 If any of you have any theory 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.290
 and as I told you guys that it would be all of 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.670
 my part so do not forget to leave me 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.400
