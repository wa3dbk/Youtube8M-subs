00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.280
 Good afternoon, everyone, we have the last batch 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.599
 the contest is already ending June 29th and 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.360
 sent us a batch 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:18.410
 black may be km and played black 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:23.789
 111 opponent on site 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:29.340
 Czech and we have a system stay close 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 scrapping would be 4 elephant in f5 riga and horse from 6 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.719
 am original play debut stati 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.800
 at the amateur level very 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.239
 not bad because white is often 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.010
 just not familiar with this arrangement 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.920
 black figures 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.590
 candida you barely ate and 30 and look 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.640
 how black imposed slark immediately were not 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.239
 will rival 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.699
 suddenly castling cannot be made a knight 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.710
 On 6, too, not will because shahnoz 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.649
 4 then the whole beta 6 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.100
 pawn is not 4 under pressure and is ready 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:12.960
 jump h4 is no longer clear who is better 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.180
 the gator 6 step itself and beats the whole beats 6 what 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.659
 do all the blacks in my opinion 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.170
 debut and got tube elephants and impossible 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.990
 our send smart 8 white king in the center 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.409
 through b2 walks the chain while holding 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.650
 divisions in 2 and 3 0 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:35.130
 such a struggle is interesting to end the 6th 5 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.799
 queens v2 black may get ahead without 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.380
 trying to seek happiness at the gate of others 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.600
 own in one beats f1 well for me 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.079
 it seems logical idea the thing is that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 black will get brillante for queen and with 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.479
 that it will not just two rooks are very 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.439

 rival camp until three ate bbc he 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.410
 to be rival cost the king not to beat 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.530
 know bbc rook and in 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.280
 two here is such a strange balance of power 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.700

 deprim spiral breathing horses again 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.530
 opens the track for an elephant 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.130
 attacking a weak pawn on c4 takes away 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.790
 King's important field in it c5 go white 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.580

 rooks position is tangled taking possession of 2 attack on 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.810
 knight 4 and b2 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.220

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.340
 you run four stages and 51 budget 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.000
 District 4 see what it looks like 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.110
 as if on a nest for a bird white traces 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.260
 for his king on field 34 but by the way 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.660

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.450
 stand they beat and beat e and gently 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:31.820

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:39.180

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.230
 about him the king in the center bestowed upon him 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:51.180
 black pieces their own pawn features 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:57.480
 e5 e6 c4 c5 is generally similar to something 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.030
 know such tasks etudes make 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.540
 such a design that will be such 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.180
 baby 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:08.450
 special geometry well and generally 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.590
 the ship is such a figure 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:16.910
 what is very pretty and mate at the end 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:20.000
 such a crowd morph I think would be pleased 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.120
