00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
transforming here start at the arms and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.800 
transforming here start at the arms and
they'll<00:02:15.410> pull<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:15.800> kind<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.490> sometimes<00:02:16.880> we

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
can be tough just push from the top and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.830 
can be tough just push from the top and
push<00:02:20.300> down

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
push down

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
okay she wants to fall back because she

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.159 
okay she wants to fall back because she
is<00:04:54.710> super<00:04:55.069> back<00:04:55.610> heavy<00:04:56.319> there<00:04:57.319> you<00:04:57.680> go

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
is super back heavy there you go

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.070 
is super back heavy there you go
and<00:05:00.169> I'm<00:05:01.069> gonna<00:05:01.250> zoom<00:05:01.550> in<00:05:01.759> real<00:05:02.150> quick<00:05:02.419> here<00:05:02.690> so

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
and I'm gonna zoom in real quick here so

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.550 
and I'm gonna zoom in real quick here so
and<00:05:04.389> kind<00:05:05.389> of<00:05:05.449> get<00:05:05.569> a<00:05:05.599> good<00:05:05.660> look<00:05:06.020> at<00:05:06.199> her<00:05:06.349> so

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
and kind of get a good look at her so

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.050 
and kind of get a good look at her so
you<00:05:06.650> can<00:05:06.800> see<00:05:06.979> she<00:05:07.280> does<00:05:07.430> have<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.669> good<00:05:07.849> face

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
you can see she does have a good face

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.210 
you can see she does have a good face
sculpt<00:05:08.509> she<00:05:08.780> does<00:05:08.930> have<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.199> good<00:05:09.440> body<00:05:09.740> sculpt

sculpt she does have a good body sculpt

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.469 
sculpt she does have a good body sculpt
but<00:05:10.310> that's<00:05:10.490> kind<00:05:10.699> of<00:05:10.729> pretty<00:05:10.970> much<00:05:11.090> where<00:05:11.330> it

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
but that's kind of pretty much where it

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.080 
but that's kind of pretty much where it
ends<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:12.770> backpack<00:05:13.250> in<00:05:13.430> general<00:05:13.819> just<00:05:14.030> kind

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
ends the backpack in general just kind

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.689 
ends the backpack in general just kind
of<00:05:14.300> ruins<00:05:14.690> this<00:05:14.840> whole<00:05:15.080> figure<00:05:15.550> wasn't<00:05:16.550> for

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
of ruins this whole figure wasn't for

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.400 
of ruins this whole figure wasn't for
that<00:05:16.729> I'd<00:05:17.060> say<00:05:17.270> this<00:05:17.419> figure<00:05:17.750> probably<00:05:18.080> would

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
that I'd say this figure probably would

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.900 
that I'd say this figure probably would
be<00:05:18.530> able<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.770> pull<00:05:18.949> it<00:05:19.069> off<00:05:19.190> but<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.550> fact<00:05:19.789> that

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
be able to pull it off but the fact that

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.570 
be able to pull it off but the fact that
the<00:05:20.180> legs<00:05:20.419> are<00:05:20.960> there<00:05:21.590> really<00:05:22.099> getting<00:05:22.370> too

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
the legs are there really getting too

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.339 
the legs are there really getting too
skinny<00:05:22.909> at<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.240> feet<00:05:23.509> for<00:05:23.840> them<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.139> be<00:05:24.259> able

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
skinny at the feet for them to be able

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.100 
skinny at the feet for them to be able
to<00:05:24.500> support<00:05:25.009> all<00:05:25.490> that<00:05:26.120> up<00:05:26.330> there<00:05:26.569> it's<00:05:26.930> not

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
to support all that up there it's not

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.020 
to support all that up there it's not
balanced<00:05:27.740> enough<00:05:28.009> to<00:05:28.220> that<00:05:28.310> point<00:05:28.639> where<00:05:28.849> you

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
balanced enough to that point where you

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.640 
balanced enough to that point where you
actually<00:05:29.180> have<00:05:29.509> to<00:05:29.539> perform<00:05:29.990> some<00:05:30.289> sort<00:05:30.560> of

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
actually have to perform some sort of

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.680 
actually have to perform some sort of
miracle<00:05:30.979> balancing<00:05:31.759> act<00:05:31.940> in<00:05:32.150> order<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.449> get<00:05:32.599> it

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
miracle balancing act in order to get it

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.200 
miracle balancing act in order to get it
to<00:05:32.720> work<00:05:33.020> however<00:05:33.860> there<00:05:34.400> are<00:05:34.550> some<00:05:34.789> traits<00:05:35.030> of

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
to work however there are some traits of

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.680 
to work however there are some traits of
it<00:05:35.330> that<00:05:35.479> just<00:05:35.509> pull<00:05:35.900> it<00:05:36.020> off<00:05:36.970> but<00:05:37.970> not<00:05:38.150> reality

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
it that just pull it off but not reality

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.300 
it that just pull it off but not reality
you<00:05:38.870> know<00:05:38.990> that's<00:05:39.229> pretty<00:05:39.500> much<00:05:39.620> left<00:05:39.979> up<00:05:40.159> to

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
you know that's pretty much left up to

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.370 
you know that's pretty much left up to
you<00:05:40.490> to<00:05:40.759> what<00:05:40.940> you<00:05:41.360> know<00:05:41.479> you<00:05:41.569> like<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:42.229> what

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
you to what you know you like and what

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.320 
you to what you know you like and what
you<00:05:42.560> enjoy<00:05:42.800> as<00:05:43.280> far<00:05:43.520> as<00:05:43.669> this<00:05:43.880> figure<00:05:44.210> is

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
you enjoy as far as this figure is

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.589 
you enjoy as far as this figure is
concerned<00:05:44.810> I<00:05:45.080> would<00:05:45.860> most<00:05:46.099> definitely<00:05:46.880> have

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
concerned I would most definitely have

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.460 
concerned I would most definitely have
to<00:05:47.990> advise<00:05:48.770> you<00:05:48.800> to<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:50.210> know<00:05:50.270> if<00:05:51.020> you<00:05:51.229> want<00:05:51.409> to

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
to advise you to you know if you want to

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.959 
to advise you to you know if you want to
pick<00:05:51.620> this<00:05:51.770> up<00:05:51.949> pick<00:05:52.130> it<00:05:52.220> up<00:05:52.280> at<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.759> later

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
pick this up pick it up at the later

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.430 
pick this up pick it up at the later
date<00:05:53.270> but<00:05:53.509> it<00:05:53.659> is<00:05:53.780> kind<00:05:54.050> of<00:05:54.080> hard<00:05:54.229> to<00:05:54.259> get<00:05:54.380> a

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
date but it is kind of hard to get a

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.790 
date but it is kind of hard to get a
hold<00:05:54.590> of<00:05:54.770> she<00:05:55.039> is<00:05:55.070> single<00:05:55.400> packed<00:05:56.500> so<00:05:57.500> it<00:05:57.650> is

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
hold of she is single packed so it is

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.439 
hold of she is single packed so it is
not<00:05:58.430> an<00:05:58.669> easy<00:05:59.469> easy<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:01.490> get<00:06:01.639> her<00:06:01.789> at<00:06:01.909> all<00:06:02.060> but

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
not an easy easy to get her at all but

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.209 
not an easy easy to get her at all but
you<00:06:02.539> can<00:06:02.750> peg<00:06:03.169> these<00:06:03.380> guns<00:06:03.620> in<00:06:03.830> them<00:06:03.949> to<00:06:04.130> the

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
you can peg these guns in them to the

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:07.659 
you can peg these guns in them to the
inside<00:06:04.550> of<00:06:04.729> her<00:06:04.789> hands<00:06:06.250> I'll<00:06:07.250> show<00:06:07.490> you<00:06:07.550> what

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
inside of her hands I'll show you what

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.839 
inside of her hands I'll show you what
that<00:06:07.699> kind<00:06:08.360> of<00:06:08.509> looks<00:06:08.599> like<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:10.190> can<00:06:10.430> turn<00:06:10.669> her

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
that kind of looks like you can turn her

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.610 
that kind of looks like you can turn her
hands<00:06:11.150> in<00:06:11.449> so<00:06:11.750> it<00:06:11.840> looks<00:06:11.900> like<00:06:12.229> she<00:06:12.440> doesn't

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
hands in so it looks like she doesn't

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.459 
hands in so it looks like she doesn't
like<00:06:12.830> she's<00:06:13.310> not<00:06:13.460> holding<00:06:13.729> in<00:06:14.060> it<00:06:14.180> but<00:06:14.469> and

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
like she's not holding in it but and

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:16.719 
like she's not holding in it but and
that's<00:06:15.620> pretty<00:06:15.860> much<00:06:15.979> what<00:06:16.250> she<00:06:16.430> gets<00:06:16.520> these

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
that's pretty much what she gets these

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.909 
that's pretty much what she gets these
blasters<00:06:17.389> they're<00:06:17.750> pretty<00:06:17.960> cool<00:06:18.139> and

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
blasters they're pretty cool and

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.770 
blasters they're pretty cool and
basically<00:06:19.159> I<00:06:19.520> think<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:20.120> only<00:06:20.389> reason<00:06:20.659> why

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
basically I think the only reason why

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.360 
basically I think the only reason why
they<00:06:20.930> gave<00:06:21.110> her<00:06:21.229> these<00:06:21.349> blasters<00:06:21.919> is<00:06:22.099> because

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
they gave her these blasters is because

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.890 
they gave her these blasters is because
they<00:06:22.490> kind<00:06:22.669> of<00:06:22.729> offset<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.180> balance<00:06:23.449> of<00:06:23.840> the

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
they kind of offset the balance of the

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.180 
they kind of offset the balance of the
figure<00:06:24.169> a<00:06:24.199> little<00:06:24.469> bit<00:06:24.590> so<00:06:24.770> you<00:06:24.860> won't<00:06:25.039> have

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
figure a little bit so you won't have

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.670 
figure a little bit so you won't have
such<00:06:25.449> trouble<00:06:26.449> and<00:06:26.599> standing<00:06:27.050> it<00:06:27.169> up<00:06:27.259> next<00:06:27.500> to

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
such trouble and standing it up next to

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.159 
such trouble and standing it up next to
your<00:06:27.800> other<00:06:27.889> figures<00:06:28.400> you<00:06:29.180> know<00:06:29.300> reality<00:06:29.840> I

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
your other figures you know reality I

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.959 
your other figures you know reality I
kind<00:06:30.560> of<00:06:30.590> give<00:06:30.770> this<00:06:30.889> figure<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.550> know<00:06:31.759> like<00:06:31.940> a

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 
kind of give this figure you know like a
