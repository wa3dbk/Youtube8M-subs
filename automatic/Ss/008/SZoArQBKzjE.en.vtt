00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.049
 collector world more 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.179
 This is a very big mail of the video 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.910
 It will probably be very long again 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.009
 yes i already have it right now 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.420
 post strike filled the mailbox bar 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.189
 the last few days nothing came today 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.199
 came again what a letter to milk 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.210
 address if you wanted to send mails 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.410
 I here again otherwise faded 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.590
 she stands on the letter when I do that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.910
 I should turn and forget, I want to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.679
 not that one sees the address here 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.329
 a few of those had a letter to me 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.350
 he did not write the cards 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.300
 That's why he needs me more 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.890
 sent on it was not on me that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.340
 should read the letter so is the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.530
 That's why I'm not reading you a letter 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.870
 you have to write that on the one hand 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.079
 should be read if you want 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.340
 that gentleman is read yes in that 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.649
 Letters are two calf action in it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.960
 so square here and the other looks 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.320
 I look like cards with the other one 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.629
 not sure 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.330
 It could be from Revier these collection cards 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:14.460
 the goods were always so almost 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.479
 square but well packed so comes 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.920
 the card does not mess up as if 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.439
 we loose the cards in the letter 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 purely throws then the chance is greater 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.930
 that the broken during the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.229
 transports but here taped that for 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.470
 I'm fine even if I just 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.470
 actually break too much 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.740
 so the cards are still in good condition 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.300
 I'm just on my head I have to 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.600
 once again the power cable here 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.600
 connect 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.070

 neustadt olic shirley horn champions 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.030
 league also sees many many cards 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.239
 everything still match attax which 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.220
 This is 10 11 series and this one 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.600
 is then last year 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.380
 that was 12 13 the two here 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:26.160
 bussi and benaglio marc andré ter stegen 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:28.020

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.400
 and strong as he has me here more 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.030
 Matchwinner is sent of course 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.280
 very cool 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.190
 So there you have to say thank you 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.870
 even if I know what it's here 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.299
 So it feels hard in any case 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.680
 as this card stack knows about it 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.680
 I do not know what's in here 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:02.349
 where can I do not want that too much 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.540
 break away here 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.120
 I think that would have been correct 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.959
 yes come on, yes I was right that is 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.670

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.049
 there is still a new firm yes new 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.549
 i'm lost if i say that 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.310
 to clips you have to take care that that 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.410
 does not stick to cards bit 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.590

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.550
 and I'll just have a look 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:56.060

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.680
 extra minutely as the teacher teams that 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.820
 It's like being in collections because of you 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.009

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.389
 I myself already, I believe 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.909
 open that's why I have two now 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:16.119
 even though it's a total of what it is 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:21.589
 37 teams so here the regulator text in 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:23.389

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:33.559

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:35.089

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:50.569
 she does not need that anymore 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:52.399
 I said clearly for my collection 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.990

00:05:52.399 --> 00:06:00.039

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:03.770
 davos 10 times something like this took mertens 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:06.080
 so a match text extra team from the 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.789
 premier league reiterates what 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.169

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.969
 Every team has one in my collection 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.889
 grab those I do not have yet 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.059
 and shall I tell you so will him 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.189
 I always have a topic 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:18.740
 give away a lesson to me completely 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:19.969
 filled with cards yet I have so 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.580
 many cards here too the loose 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:28.449

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:31.129
 team again a pokémon here is the 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.779
 I'm quite a few tips 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.779
 Now try out 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.580
 Kramen here is another pokémon 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.960
 Here it is therefore already extremely 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.910
 So in many different teams and 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.170
 all just stop again more often 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:04.450

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:46.360
 do you want me not to give away? 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.249
 I wanted to keep that one else 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.869
 I might stop by every dose 

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:50.679
 even keep 34 because then can 

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:54.699
 Maybe a few years here 

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:58.029
 I could not sell one 

00:07:54.699 --> 00:08:00.749
