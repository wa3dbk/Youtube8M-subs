00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
we're going to go back to the lane and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.760 
we're going to go back to the lane and
we<00:01:58.790> are<00:01:59.000> not<00:01:59.330> going<00:01:59.660> to<00:01:59.870> turn<00:02:00.050> back<00:02:00.320> from<00:02:00.620> this

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
we are not going to turn back from this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.380 
we are not going to turn back from this
point<00:02:01.040> on<00:02:01.310> because<00:02:01.670> we<00:02:01.790> have<00:02:01.910> darpa<00:02:02.210> land

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
point on because we have darpa land

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.890 
point on because we have darpa land
volts<00:02:02.630> are<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.610> if<00:02:04.610> you're<00:02:05.510> playing<00:02:05.720> a

volts are and if you're playing a

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.480 
volts are and if you're playing a
three-month<00:02:06.320> team<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:06.770> combination<00:02:07.400> to

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
three-month team this is combination to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.960 
three-month team this is combination to
use<00:02:07.640> right<00:02:07.880> now<00:02:07.910> until<00:02:08.950> skull<00:02:09.950> do<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.250> nerf

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
use right now until skull do is nerf

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.970 
use right now until skull do is nerf
simply<00:02:11.510> because<00:02:11.810> there's<00:02:12.410> no<00:02:12.709> better

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
simply because there's no better

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.240 
simply because there's no better
combination<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.880> can<00:02:14.120> see<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.890> makes<00:02:16.130> it

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
combination that I can see that makes it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.850 
combination that I can see that makes it
as<00:02:16.459> easy<00:02:16.790> as<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.660> right<00:02:17.990> now<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.500> take

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
down it goes and here we go there's also

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.110 
down it goes and here we go there's also
that<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.860> little<00:02:43.220> bit<00:02:43.340> where<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:43.970> actually

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
that a little bit where you can actually

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.030 
that a little bit where you can actually
if<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.420> stand<00:02:44.690> straight<00:02:45.019> up<00:02:45.230> against<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
if you stand straight up against the

turret and hit someone in the back which

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.250 
turret and hit someone in the back which
is<00:02:49.640> why<00:02:49.820> I<00:02:49.850> want<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.209> upgrade<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.780> third<00:02:51.050> hit

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
is why I want to upgrade the third hit

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.110 
is why I want to upgrade the third hit
as<00:02:51.440> much<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:51.680> possible<00:02:51.800> now<00:02:52.519> trusting<00:02:52.910> vault

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
as much as possible now trusting vault

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.850 
as much as possible now trusting vault
or<00:02:53.300> keep<00:02:53.630> me<00:02:53.750> alive<00:02:53.900> as<00:02:54.080> much<00:02:54.230> possible<00:02:54.440> and

or keep me alive as much possible and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.110 
or keep me alive as much possible and
I'm<00:02:55.040> not<00:02:55.190> even<00:02:55.400> worried<00:02:55.610> because<00:02:55.790> someone

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
I'm not even worried because someone

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.729 
I'm not even worried because someone
comes<00:02:56.330> in<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.630> throw<00:02:56.870> him<00:02:56.989> right<00:02:57.019> back<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.680> he

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
comes in I throw him right back and he

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.100 
comes in I throw him right back and he
gets<00:02:58.519> stunned<00:02:58.820> by<00:02:59.060> der<00:02:59.120> Pol<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.720> down<00:02:59.930> he<00:03:00.080> goes

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
gets stunned by der Pol and down he goes

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.370 
gets stunned by der Pol and down he goes
that's<00:03:00.830> how<00:03:01.010> easy<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.580> kill<00:03:01.880> anyone

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
that's how easy it is to kill anyone

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.810 
that's how easy it is to kill anyone
even<00:03:03.380> if<00:03:03.470> they<00:03:03.560> come<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:04.040> twos<00:03:04.340> right<00:03:04.640> now

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
even if they come in twos right now

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.310 
even if they come in twos right now
there's<00:03:05.150> not<00:03:05.300> gonna<00:03:05.450> be<00:03:05.540> much<00:03:05.660> difference

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
there's not gonna be much difference

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.070 
there's not gonna be much difference
because<00:03:06.680> we<00:03:07.010> can<00:03:07.220> both<00:03:07.400> stun<00:03:07.970> enough<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.810> keep

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
because we can both stun enough to keep

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.690 
because we can both stun enough to keep
them<00:03:09.290> locked<00:03:09.500> down<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.040> all<00:03:10.130> they<00:03:10.310> can<00:03:10.370> really

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
them locked down and all they can really

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.440 
them locked down and all they can really
do<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:11.000> run<00:03:11.239> away<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.760> suddenly<00:03:13.760> we're<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.209> and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
do is run away and suddenly we're in and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.940 
do is run away and suddenly we're in and
people<00:03:15.140> are<00:03:15.200> starting<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.470> rage<00:03:15.650> quit

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
people are starting to rage quit

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.710 
people are starting to rage quit
as<00:03:18.310> always<00:03:18.819> loans<00:03:19.060> are<00:03:19.239> being<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.450> little<00:03:19.599> bit

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
as always loans are being a little bit

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.240 
as always loans are being a little bit
annoying<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.379> also<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.739> reason<00:03:20.860> why<00:03:21.129> you

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
annoying this is also the reason why you

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.530 
annoying this is also the reason why you
want<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.580> have<00:03:21.700> durable<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.180> background

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
want to have durable in the background

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.259 
want to have durable in the background
because<00:03:22.810> all<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.580> bounces<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:24.760> push<00:03:24.970> backs

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
because all the bounces and push backs

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.900 
because all the bounces and push backs
and<00:03:25.510> whatever<00:03:25.870> will<00:03:26.319> be<00:03:26.349> stopped<00:03:26.920> by<00:03:27.250> der<00:03:27.610> pol

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
and whatever will be stopped by der pol

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.890 
and whatever will be stopped by der pol
so<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.730> all<00:03:30.970> we're<00:03:31.120> gonna<00:03:31.209> do<00:03:31.420> someone

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
so this is all we're gonna do someone

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.890 
so this is all we're gonna do someone
comes<00:03:32.110> we<00:03:32.290> throw<00:03:32.500> them<00:03:32.680> we<00:03:33.190> chased<00:03:33.430> them<00:03:33.550> down

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
comes we throw them we chased them down

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.820 
comes we throw them we chased them down
and<00:03:36.150> down<00:03:37.150> he<00:03:37.420> should<00:03:37.660> go<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.140> second<00:03:38.560> there

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
and down he should go in a second there

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.650 
and down he should go in a second there
we<00:03:38.920> go<00:03:39.099> he<00:03:39.430> could<00:03:39.640> do<00:03:39.790> very<00:03:39.819> little<00:03:40.120> about<00:03:40.450> that

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
we go he could do very little about that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.229 
we go he could do very little about that
