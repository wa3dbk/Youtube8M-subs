 with samsung galaxy s 4g i'll talk about 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.980
 another safety measure that 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 exists on this cell phone 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.760
 It's me when I went to try to run the nox 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.400
 I do not execute yet I still see you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.740
 still what they do with what I 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.689
 I'm going to play this show so we can 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
 make a video for you is for example 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.890
 on the first screen when you enter the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.720
 the new program he has an explanation 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.149
 I'm going to take a print from this screen to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.149
 then explain to staff what it means 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.170
 I came here that neither the present nor the 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.290
 haiyÃ´ that he does 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.030
 the cell phone he comes here 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.140
 it shows a warning sign on the photo 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.399
 I tried to take away 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 Let's take a look here. Oh, it's not. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.289
 possible to capture the impossible image 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.140
 capture screen protected image by brm 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:04.170
 drm personnel is for those for whom no 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.479
 do you know the drm dr means of star wars 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 medium - that is, management of 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.270
 digital rights is very wise and mp3 at 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.060
 microsoft liked to use this 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.210
 this drm and other systems for example 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.380
 one with 11 I'm not mistaken got to use 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.509
 drm is the sporting game has some other 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.939
 games and also to realize that the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.970
 sporting if I'm not mistaken on my own 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.600
 own xbox there is also the drm inside 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.909
 from there to check if the game is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.590
 original is not it then it happens 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.369
 It does not happen, does not it, personally? 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.799
 When you try to take it, it 's a print of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.799
 something that has information that can be 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.049
 important that it could compromise 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.270
 safety of your device in this 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.740
 message but what we can do is 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.850
 try to take a print now here then 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.610
 go there he took the prudent from the screen 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.879
 having pasted the image of the screen captured 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.860
 could not be captured because of the 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.740
 want and it stays in a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.560
 phone security right then by 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.590

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.720
 more informative having more 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.430
 more alert information. 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.080
