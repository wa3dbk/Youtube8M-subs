Hi, guys!

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.080
Today we are going to talk about
Hughes &amp; Kettner Tubemeister 36 guitar amp.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.670
This is a 36 W three-channel tube amp

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.280
that has 3 tubes 12AX7 in the preamp
and 4 tubes EL84 in the power amp.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.670
On the back side it has a cabinet output,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.600
attenuator with power selection
(1 W, 5 W, 18 W, 36 W)

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.220
Tubes control system

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.400
Red box for line recording

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.600
Reverb

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.290
Effects loop

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.490
Footswitches

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.690
and MIDI control

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.560
This amp is awesome, let's listen to it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.930
We use Sure SM57 and SE Electronics
4400A microphones for recording.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.960
So, clean

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.930
And now crunch

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.010
Let's add some gain

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.590
