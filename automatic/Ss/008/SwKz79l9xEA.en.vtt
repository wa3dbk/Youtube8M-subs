00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and make sure I at least have some wire

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.750 
and make sure I at least have some wire
to<00:01:17.190> stick<00:01:17.490> through<00:01:19.340> my<00:01:20.340> Tron<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:22.680> take<00:01:23.010> this

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.580 

and<00:01:26.760> then<00:01:26.910> I<00:01:29.090> bend<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.240> slight<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.320> like

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and then I bend it just slight bit like

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.969 
and then I bend it just slight bit like
that<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:34.940> take<00:01:35.940> my<00:01:36.410> clothes<00:01:37.410> on

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that I take my clothes on

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.190 
that I take my clothes on
I<00:01:38.630> put<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.900> head<00:01:40.259> pin<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:41.190> like<00:01:41.430> this

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
I put the head pin in down like this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.330 
I put the head pin in down like this
then<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:45.290> turn<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:48.890> people<00:01:49.890> make<00:01:50.190> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
then I turn it up and people make the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760 
then I turn it up and people make the
mistake<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.210> leave<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.170> head<00:01:52.350> pin<00:01:52.530> like

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
mistake to just leave the head pin like

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.320 
mistake to just leave the head pin like
that<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.310> would<00:01:53.580> pull<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.030> easy<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:56.330> figured

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
that which would pull out easy I figured

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.510 
that which would pull out easy I figured
that<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.020> push<00:01:58.500> my<00:01:58.830> eye<00:01:59.630> pin<00:02:00.920> more<00:02:01.920> down<00:02:02.190> like

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
that if I push my eye pin more down like

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.850 
that if I push my eye pin more down like
half<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.630> half<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> circle<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.620> in<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
half way so half the circle is in the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.770 
half way so half the circle is in the
clay<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:07.220> will<00:02:08.220> stay<00:02:08.549> so<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.880> push<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.269> clay<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
clay that will stay so I push the clay a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.020 
clay that will stay so I push the clay a
bit<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:11.670> wraps<00:02:12.000> around<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.870> wire<00:02:13.670> then<00:02:14.670> I

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
bit so it wraps around the wire then I

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.530 
bit so it wraps around the wire then I
take<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> toothpick<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:17.030> see<00:02:18.030> how<00:02:18.239> there's<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
take a toothpick and see how there's a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.289 
take a toothpick and see how there's a
gap<00:02:18.840> between<00:02:19.200> my<00:02:20.130> eye<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.060> pushed

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
gap between my eye because it pushed

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.940 
gap between my eye because it pushed
through<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:22.680> cover<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.209> my<00:02:24.209> toothpick<00:02:24.950> push

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
through to cover that my toothpick push

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.540 
through to cover that my toothpick push
down<00:02:26.250> some<00:02:26.519> of<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.760> extra<00:02:27.390> clay

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:43.070 

smooth<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.730> out

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.740 

like<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> now<00:02:45.550> it's<00:02:45.820> covered<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.510> nerf

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
like that so now it's covered in nerf

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.060 
like that so now it's covered in nerf
you<00:02:47.020> can<00:02:47.200> see<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:52.330> there's<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.170> then<00:02:53.920> you

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
you can see so there's that and then you

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.230 
you can see so there's that and then you
don't<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.400> worry<00:02:54.580> about<00:02:54.760> your<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:54.940> pens

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
don't have to worry about your I pens

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.680 
don't have to worry about your I pens
ever<00:02:55.480> falling<00:02:55.870> out<00:02:55.990> after<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:57.120> head<00:02:58.120> pins<00:02:58.480> I

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
ever falling out after that head pins I

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.030 
ever falling out after that head pins I
use<00:02:59.310> for<00:03:00.310> like<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.850> dice<00:03:01.570> or<00:03:02.050> anything<00:03:02.500> like<00:03:02.830> my

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
use for like a dice or anything like my

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.790 
use for like a dice or anything like my
cupcake<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:04.060> what<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.420> do<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.990> some<00:03:05.380> people

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
cupcake and what I do is some people

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.220 
cupcake and what I do is some people
when<00:03:06.340> they<00:03:06.370> stick<00:03:06.820> their<00:03:07.060> eye<00:03:07.300> pin<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.080> they

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
when they stick their eye pin in they

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.570 
when they stick their eye pin in they
can't<00:03:08.440> get<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.740> straight<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.200> do<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:11.950> I

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
can't get it straight so what I do is I

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.850 
can't get it straight so what I do is I
poke<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.060> from<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.510> top<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.680> bottom

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
poke it from the top and the bottom

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.770 
poke it from the top and the bottom
would<00:03:18.160> be<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.490> piece<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.910> comes<00:03:19.150> out<00:03:19.420> on<00:03:19.630> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
would be the piece that comes out on the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.130 
would be the piece that comes out on the
wrong<00:03:20.070> like<00:03:21.070> way<00:03:21.700> off<00:03:21.940> but<00:03:22.690> it's<00:03:22.900> still

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
wrong like way off but it's still

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.750 
wrong like way off but it's still
