00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
much right about it falling apart a lot
but<00:01:16.110> mine<00:01:16.290> seems<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.580> more

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but mine seems to be a little bit more

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.460 
but mine seems to be a little bit more
stable<00:01:18.799> than<00:01:19.799> other<00:01:20.009> people's<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:21.470> slings

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
stuff fell apart really easily leave my

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.140 
stuff fell apart really easily leave my
arm<00:01:28.430> flung<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.579> pretty<00:01:29.790> good<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> mean<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
arm flung they pretty good I mean it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.020 
arm flung they pretty good I mean it
pops<00:01:30.329> off<00:01:30.540> pretty<00:01:30.780> easily<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.030> for

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
pops off pretty easily like that but for

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.219 
pops off pretty easily like that but for
the<00:01:33.090> most<00:01:33.210> part<00:01:33.329> when<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:34.079> it's

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the most part when it's on there it's

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.179 
the most part when it's on there it's
not<00:01:34.290> gonna<00:01:34.500> come<00:01:34.680> off<00:01:36.350> but<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.829> detail

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
not gonna come off but just the detail

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.390 
not gonna come off but just the detail
this<00:01:38.970> figure<00:01:39.650> there's<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.950> much<00:01:41.070> better<00:01:41.250> than

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
this figure there's so much better than

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.710 
this figure there's so much better than
any<00:01:41.579> other<00:01:41.700> movie<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.150> row<00:01:42.270> spider-man<00:01:42.689> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
any other movie in a row spider-man I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.179 
any other movie in a row spider-man I
mean<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.259> Marvel<00:01:43.590> legend<00:01:43.829> showdown

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

but I actually don't own a Marvel
Universe<00:01:48.420> spider-man<00:01:49.790> for<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> fact<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.240> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
Universe spider-man for the fact that I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.020 
Universe spider-man for the fact that I
hated<00:01:52.670> pretty<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.850> everything<00:01:54.329> about<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
hated pretty much everything about it I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.569 
hated pretty much everything about it I
just<00:01:57.030> didn't<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.570> way<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:59.399> they

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579

just didn't like the way that they
looked<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> fact<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
looked in like the fact that the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
looked in like the fact that the
articulation<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.640> bad<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:06.270> mean<00:02:06.600> these

and<00:05:19.690> although<00:05:19.780> these<00:05:20.080> both<00:05:20.319> of<00:05:20.680> these<00:05:20.710> figures

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
and although these both of these figures

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.260 
and although these both of these figures
are<00:05:21.659> in<00:05:22.659> my<00:05:22.900> opinion<00:05:23.460> based<00:05:24.460> on<00:05:24.669> articulate<00:05:25.180> if

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
are in my opinion based on articulate if

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.370 
are in my opinion based on articulate if
you're<00:05:25.419> just<00:05:25.539> basing<00:05:25.870> it<00:05:25.960> on<00:05:25.990> articulation

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
you're just basing it on articulation

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.249 
you're just basing it on articulation
alone

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259

alone
these<00:05:29.259> two<00:05:29.620> figures<00:05:30.599> are<00:05:31.599> way<00:05:31.780> better<00:05:31.960> than

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
these two figures are way better than

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.149 
these two figures are way better than
their<00:05:34.680> Marvel<00:05:35.680> Universe<00:05:36.090> counterparts<00:05:37.090> I

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159
