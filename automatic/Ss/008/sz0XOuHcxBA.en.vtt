00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 very good everyone welcome to another skin 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.089
 Nestor is about justice back 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.370
 supreme and let's start with the cries of 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.889
 war in three versions Spanish Latin 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.889
 and English just in the order mentioned 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.770
 this is not a simple massacre is a 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.770
 masterpiece 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.890
 who understands me and they say that my 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.370
 work is routine 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.660
 17 remembered 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.450
 or die and be forgotten 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.220
 die with fear in your heart 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.220
 with blood in your hands 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.930
 learn the subtleties of visceral art 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:03.220
 this is not a massacre 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:08.010
 this is my masterpiece 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.010
 and be remembered as heroes 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.450
 remembered as cowards 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.840
 dark 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:27.359
 with blood in his hands 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.359
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.570
 or 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.560
 they do not vary remaining as vegetable garden 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:47.830
 is the basic of sesma in our web 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.730
 i 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.730
 one wing 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.710
 the world is born 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.710
 truly 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.229
 the dance 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.590
 let's go to the skills let's start with the 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.590
 q 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.890
 easy 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.890
 the w 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.300
 the e 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.510
 and the war 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.510
 together with him 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.849
 and the truth 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.890
 two 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.800
 fear becomes fury 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.500
 the passive and the death 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.540
 Y 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.910
 the critical hits since it's a 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.480
 character depending on the autotaxi 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.480
 plus 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.659
 the record of recovery 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.340
 I want to make it clear that the latter 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.110
 section is a purely opinion 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.030
 personal and does not have to be relevant 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.610
 towards your opinion or your future 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.950
 purchase 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.780
 my opinion about this skin is very basic 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.700
 since if you like to change the theme 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.380
 the character is a good skin since 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.330
 does just the opposite of those that 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.860
 in classic those that in classic what 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.020
 basically it's turning it into a 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.880
 demon knight and in this he does 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.010
 just the opposite makes it 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.019
 a divine knight 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.030
 although if we compare it with sutras kim 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.560
 other mechanics we see that this one stays 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.000
 a little bit back since it does not change the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.189
 character abilities in return to 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.840
 other mechanics yes but of course if you 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.659
 like the theme of one and not the other 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.840
 maybe you know more about accounts in one 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.830
 investor since in addition other mechanics 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.140
 it's a little bit more expensive 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.580
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.410
 they want to give I like to share 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.650
 comment and see you in the next 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.650
 video 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.090
 i 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.390
 yes
