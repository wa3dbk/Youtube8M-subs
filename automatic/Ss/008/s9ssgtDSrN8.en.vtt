00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.279
 another video from me this time it is 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.519
 more information on his 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.759
 repair and that is generally about 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.500
 the people so that the five alps 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 my mother and it only so yes the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.449
 turned this problem occurs more often 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.990
 here it loads with the iphone 6 plus however 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.269
 with the iphone 5 it does not load anymore 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.149
 yes it can be three possibilities 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.230
 Either the chip is the dock connector 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.780
 yourself or something else and indeed 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.350
 something they repair easily 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.270
 lets with his simple yes how and what 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 that's exactly what I show you and 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.090
 Although if you look carefully there is one 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 small gap between the cable and the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.379
 iphone 5 yes this gap may not be 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 Here you can see it exactly this column 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.270
 does not exist here and yes that means there 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.400
 is just dirt in there as the one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.189
 It's best to get out of here 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.420
 first turn off the iphone too 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.930
 wait until it is out and then you can 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.090
 take your simple or toothpick 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 and go upstairs 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.330
 just do not push down and close 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 pull because the connectors 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.310
 Connectors are so keep your 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.680
 simple always up 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.689
 and yes, the stuff is slowly coming out 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.540
 There is really a lot in it 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.119
 you do not believe how much there is 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.229
 clean what's the fault of it 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.140
 is so full 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.500
 This is the fleece jacket of my mom 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.579
 and yes, the whole thing has to be done now 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.259
 dirt out so everything else I have there 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.329
 I did not know with that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.350
 clean your own cable so that it knows 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.079
 vulture what saves all this as 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.160
 then, for the most part, either 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.830
 the three problems but this problem 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.370
 most often just step on it 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.370
 a lot of dirt is in it and keep yours 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.510
 Charging socket just clean 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.940
 Just a quick look at us 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.820
 everything is clean and tried on my own 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:34.130
 your iphone has a charging cable 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:38.840
 ran when it is not flush with 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:42.110
 the cable is yes, then here you can see 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.300
 it is now mature and now that lives 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.380
 even the phone is also right there 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.660
 is not a splitter between and yes so 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.820
 every cell phone what here looks to it 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.660
 there is a lot of dirt in a gap 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.800
 I would often just go in there 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.360
 check if there by my own 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.970
 own cellphone I look more often if the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.160
 Dirt in there is the charging cable 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.950
 if it is not yesterday because 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.660
 I just get the dirt out just like you 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.930
 it all works now once 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.300
 free i hope you have the video 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.600
 like this little information will be 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.060
 I'm looking forward to a thumbs up 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.680
 and yes, think about an abo and me 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.680
