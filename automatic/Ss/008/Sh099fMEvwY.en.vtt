4.2 trailblazer this is the new engine
and<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.679> where<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.070> starter<00:01:29.520> goes<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and that's where that starter goes and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899 
and that's where that starter goes and
you<00:01:30.179> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.750> top<00:01:31.020> bolt<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.649> stud<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you can see that top bolt is a stud so

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.190 
you can see that top bolt is a stud so
when<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.149> have<00:01:33.300> that<00:01:33.479> extension<00:01:33.899> you're

when you have that extension you're

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.169 
when you have that extension you're
taking<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.679> nut<00:01:34.890> off<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.429> then<00:01:35.909> you'll<00:01:36.030> have

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
taking the nut off and then you'll have

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.059 
taking the nut off and then you'll have
to<00:01:36.300> pull<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> starter<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.259> over<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.679> stud

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
to pull that starter out over that stud

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.179 
to pull that starter out over that stud
