00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
minutes all you need to do is have a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.220 
minutes all you need to do is have a
pair<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:22.940> shears<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:23.980> what<00:00:24.980> you'll<00:00:25.660> do<00:00:26.660> is<00:00:26.990> to

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
pair of shears and what you'll do is to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.210 
pair of shears and what you'll do is to
cut<00:00:27.560> on<00:00:27.770> either<00:00:28.039> side<00:00:28.400> of<00:00:28.430> the<00:00:28.730> backbone<00:00:29.240> to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
cut on either side of the backbone to

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.420 
cut on either side of the backbone to
remove<00:00:31.220> it<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.270> just<00:00:32.539> take<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:33.039> pair<00:00:34.039> of<00:00:34.070> really

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
remove it so just take a pair of really

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.220 
remove it so just take a pair of really
hefty<00:00:34.609> scissors<00:00:35.359> or<00:00:35.600> if<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:35.780> have<00:00:35.989> kitchen

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
hefty scissors or if you have kitchen

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.910 
hefty scissors or if you have kitchen
shears<00:00:36.710> go<00:00:37.190> ahead<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:37.520> use<00:00:37.610> them<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.920> snip

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
shears go ahead and use them and snip

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.010 
shears go ahead and use them and snip
out<00:00:40.040> this<00:00:40.280> backbone<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.030> then<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.270> can<00:00:41.480> save

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
out this backbone and then you can save

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.290 
out this backbone and then you can save
it<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.230> use<00:00:42.470> for<00:00:42.530> homemade<00:00:43.130> soup<00:00:46.030> that's<00:00:47.030> one

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
it to use for homemade soup that's one

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.970 
it to use for homemade soup that's one
side<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:47.870> then<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:48.020> think<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.470> easiest<00:00:48.739> thing

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
side and then I think the easiest thing

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.530 
side and then I think the easiest thing
to<00:00:49.010> do<00:00:49.250> is<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:49.730> can<00:00:49.790> either<00:00:50.059> turn<00:00:50.270> it<00:00:50.420> around

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
to do is you can either turn it around

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.700 
to do is you can either turn it around
or<00:00:50.809> just<00:00:50.989> leave<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.170> there

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
or just leave it there

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.889 
or just leave it there
and<00:00:52.300> cut<00:00:53.300> on<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.600> other<00:00:53.630> side<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:56.629> roast

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
and cut on the other side and this roast

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.630 
and cut on the other side and this roast
chicken<00:00:57.379> you<00:00:57.980> know<00:00:58.100> normally<00:00:58.430> if<00:00:58.520> you're

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
chicken you know normally if you're

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.880 
chicken you know normally if you're
roasting<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:59.090> chicken<00:00:59.290> it<00:01:00.290> would<00:01:00.440> take<00:01:00.649> you

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
roasting a chicken it would take you

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.299 
roasting a chicken it would take you
probably<00:01:01.730> at<00:01:02.390> least<00:01:02.629> an<00:01:02.870> hour<00:01:03.020> but<00:01:03.920> this<00:01:04.070> way

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
probably at least an hour but this way

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.649 
probably at least an hour but this way
by<00:01:04.519> removing<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.030> backbone<00:01:05.479> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
by removing the backbone and

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.359 
by removing the backbone and
butterflying<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.469> it'll<00:01:06.799> take<00:01:07.009> you<00:01:07.189> just

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
butterflying it it'll take you just

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.240 
butterflying it it'll take you just
about<00:01:07.670> thirty<00:01:08.149> minutes<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:09.170> we're<00:01:10.010> going<00:01:10.190> to

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
just beat down on it to flatten it a

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.260 
just beat down on it to flatten it a
little<00:01:55.579> bit<00:01:55.729> more<00:01:57.579> see<00:01:58.579> if<00:01:58.640> it's<00:01:58.759> an<00:01:58.909> even

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
little bit more see if it's an even

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.640 
little bit more see if it's an even
thickness<00:01:59.540> it'll<00:02:00.020> do<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.140> heck<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.530> lot

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
thickness it'll do a heck of a lot

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.859 
thickness it'll do a heck of a lot
better<00:02:00.829> job<00:02:01.159> of<00:02:01.189> cooking<00:02:01.670> evenly<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.360> then

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
better job of cooking evenly and then

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.600 
better job of cooking evenly and then
here's<00:02:03.320> what<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:03.500> want<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.799> show<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:03.979> also<00:02:04.250> is
