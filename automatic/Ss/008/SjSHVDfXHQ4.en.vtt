00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Elian Myftiu Reviewer: Helena Bedalli 

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:15.652
 Why do we teach math? 

00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:18.200
 First of all, for three reasons: 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.828
 for calculations, 

00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:21.728
 implementation, 

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:24.415
 and lately, unfortunately, less important 

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:26.520
 in terms of time we devote, 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.442
 inspiration. 

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:30.714
 Mathematics is the science of motives, 

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:34.072
 and we study it to learn how to think logically, 

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:36.599
 through criticism and creativity, 

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.525
 but many of the maths we teach at school 

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.844
 not encouraged, 

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.269
 and when our students ask, 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.944
 "Why are we learning this?" 

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.905
 we often answer that they will need them 

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:50.170
 in one lesson or a subsequent test. 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.972
 But would not it be wonderful 

00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:54.490
 as if we ever learned math 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.439
 just to be fun or beautiful 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.529
 or to harass your mind? 

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:01.251
 Well, I know that many people do not 

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.570
 had the opportunity to see how this could happen, 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.399
 so let me give you a quick example 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.740
 through my favorite number of numbers, 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.468
 Fibonacci numbers. (Applause) 

00:01:10.468 --> 00:01:12.520
 Yes! Fibonacci admirer here. 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.836
 Great. 

00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:15.952
 Now, these numbers can be evaluated 

00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:17.830
 in many different ways. 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.539
 From the point of view of calculations, 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.216
 it's easy to understand 

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.770
 how one and the one that makes two. 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.773
 Then one and two make three, 

00:01:26.773 --> 00:01:29.787
 two and three make five, three and five make eight, 

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:31.312
 and so on. 

00:01:31.312 --> 00:01:33.489
 Indeed, the person we know as Fibonacci 

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.669
 actually called Leonardo Pisano, 

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:39.722
 and these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci" 

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:41.372
 who taught the West 

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.199
 the arithmetic methods we use today. 

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:45.920
 With regard to implementation, 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.103
 Fibonacci numbers are surprisingly displayed 

00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:49.960
 often in nature. 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.700
 Number of petals in a flower 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.562
 is usually a number of Fibonacci, 

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:56.332
 or the number of spirals in a sunflower 

00:01:56.332 --> 00:01:57.743
 or a pineapple 

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:00.137
 also tends to be a Fibonacci number. 

00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:03.640
 In fact, there are more applications of the numbers Fibonacci, 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.200
 but what I find more inspirational about them 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.934
 are the beautiful motives of the numbers they show us. 

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:11.128
 Let me tell you one of my favorites. 

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:13.349
 I guess you like to raise the numbers in square, 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.024
 honestly, who does not like it? (Laughter) 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280
 Let's take a look at the squares 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.131
 of the first numbers Fibonacci. 

00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:22.161
 Then one in square is one, 

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:24.478
 two in square is four, three in square is nine, 

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.651
 five in square is 25, and so on. 

00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:29.552
 Now, it's no surprise 

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:32.380
 since when collects Fibonacci numbers, 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.412
 you find the other number of Fibonacci. Or not? 

00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:35.807
 Thus they are formed. 

00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:37.580
 But you would not expect anything special to happen 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.656
 when collecting squares together. 

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:42.002
 Look at this. 

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:44.003
 One and one gives us two, 

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.765
 one and four gives us five. 

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:48.960
 And four plus nine is 13, 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.173
 nine plus 25 is 34, 

00:02:52.173 --> 00:02:54.832
 and so the motive continues. 

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:56.453
 In fact, here's another one. 

00:02:56.453 --> 00:02:58.297
 Suppose you would like to watch 

00:02:58.297 --> 00:03:00.795
 as the squares of some of the first numbers Fibonacci appear. 

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:02.403
 Let's see what we get. 

00:03:02.403 --> 00:03:04.542
 Then a plus one plus four is six. 

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.547
 We add nine, we get 15. 

00:03:07.547 --> 00:03:09.760
 Add 25, we get 40. 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.551
 Add 64, we get 104. 

00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.203
 Now we see these numbers. 

00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:16.587
 These are not Fibonacci numbers, 

00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:18.466
 but if we look carefully, 

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:20.349
 you will find the numbers Fibonacci 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.527
 hidden within them. 

00:03:22.527 --> 00:03:24.597
 Do you see? I'm telling you. 

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:28.330
 Six is ​​two times three, 15 is three times five, 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.389
 40 is five times eight, 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.317
 two, three, five, eight, whom do we "appreciate"? (wordplay) 

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:34.504
 (Laughter) 

00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:36.659
 Fibonacci! Of course. 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.442
 Now, as long as it's fun to discover these motives, 

00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:42.924
 it is still a pleasure to understand 

00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:44.882
 why these are true. 

00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:46.771
 Let's take the last equation. 

00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:50.639
 Why should the squares of one, one, two, three, five, and eight 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.184
 collected to give eight times 13? 

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:56.145
 I'll show you by drawing a simple painting. 

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:58.832
 We're starting with a one-on-one square 

00:03:58.832 --> 00:04:02.997
 and next to it we put another square one-to-one. 

00:04:02.997 --> 00:04:06.405
 Together, they form a one-to-two rectangle. 

00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:08.954
 Underneath, it will put a square two-to-two, 

00:04:08.954 --> 00:04:11.749
 and the post after him, a three-by-three square, 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.750
 below it, a five-by-five square, 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.662
 and then an eight-to-eight square, 

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.234
 forming a giant rectangle, right? 

00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:20.150
 Now, let me ask you a simple question: 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.806
 what is the surface of the rectangle? 

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:25.777
 From one side, 

00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:28.307
 is the sum of the surfaces 

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:30.173
 squares inside it, right? 

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:31.532
 Just as we created it. 

00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:33.704
 It's one square plus one in square 

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:35.937
 plus two squares plus three squares 

00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:38.536
 plus five in square plus eight in square. Correct? 

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:40.393
 That's the surface. 

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.719
 On the other hand, since it is a rectangle, 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.367
 the surface is as high as its base, 

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:48.414
 and the height is obviously eight, 

00:04:48.414 --> 00:04:51.317
 while the base is five plus eight, 

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:55.255
 or the other number Fibonacci, 13. Exactly? 

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:58.618
 Then the surface is also eight times 13. 

00:04:58.618 --> 00:05:00.880
 Since we have calculated the surface exactly 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.567
 in two ways, 

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.739
 these should be the same number, 

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:08.130
 and behold, the squares of one, one, two, three, five, and eight 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.421
 gathering is eight times 13 times. 

00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:12.795
 If we continue this process, 

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:16.773
 we will produce rectangles of form 13 through 21, 

00:05:16.773 --> 00:05:19.167
 21 to 34, and so on. 

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:20.576
 Look now. 

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:22.769
 If you divide 13 with eight, 

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:24.812
 get 1.625. 

00:05:24.812 --> 00:05:28.239
 And if you divide the largest number with the smallest number, 

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:31.112
 then the report approaches more and more 

00:05:31.112 --> 00:05:33.765
 number 1.618, 

00:05:33.765 --> 00:05:37.066
 recognized by many as the Golden Report, 

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:39.662
 a number that has captivated mathematicians, 

00:05:39.662 --> 00:05:42.908
 scientists and artists for centuries. 

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:45.139
 Now, I tell you all this because, 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.164
 just like many maths, 

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:49.131
 there is also her beautiful part 

00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:51.146
 for which I fear not to get enough attention 

00:05:51.146 --> 00:05:52.713
 through our schools. 

00:05:52.713 --> 00:05:55.546
 We spend a lot of time learning about calculations, 

00:05:55.546 --> 00:05:58.302
 but let us not forget about the implementation, 

00:05:58.302 --> 00:06:01.756
 including, perhaps, the most important of all, 

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:03.832
 learning how to think. 

00:06:03.832 --> 00:06:05.789
 If I could summarize this in one sentence, 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.250
 it would be: 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.610
 Mathematics is not just solved for x, 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.535
 is also to find why. 

00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:15.350
 Thank you very much. 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.757
 (Applause)
