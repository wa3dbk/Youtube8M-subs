00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.080
 drag racing is fast and showtime 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.050
 loud and exhibitionist in almost everyone 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.240
 exclusively the fastest 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.670
 reach on the quarter mile 500 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.980
 hourly kilometers in less than five 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.580
 second racing in the format of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.920
 advertising clips 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.050
 drag racing is the perfect stage for 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.320
 cool cars with built-in 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.110
 speed for muscle cars in 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.760
 once defined an entire era for the usa 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.070
 to have 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.739
 This 70 plymouth roadrunner from factory 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.820
 fast enough for the quarter mile 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.730
 inexpensive enough for the narrow 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.769
 Ball boys purse and horny enough for 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.860
 the ultimate cracks 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.860
 in other words, a classic with 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:13.549
 built-in performance today he belongs 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:16.119
 nobody realized that he was pretty 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.119
 is fast 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.590
 Drag racing is basically American 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.270
 tradition on the one hand might succumb 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 that's why so many fans american 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.120
 classics the delight of the quarter mile 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.460
 On the other hand, the drag racing offers the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.430
 Lovely class for cars with 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.790
 street admission the so-called public 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.790
 racer 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 from the street directly on the strip 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.049
 sounds simple but his quirks because 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.409
 also in the class of the public race 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.810
 results in performance specifications 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.969
 you have to meet a time limit and 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.740
 Just give it everything you want 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.740
 heavy gas foot he gives 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.710
 public race is like the name already 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.289
 says different people are there with 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.330
 different cars from all categories 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.050
 many from the vw scene others from the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.270
 usk scene and at our index of 12.0 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.800
 that's damn fast for one 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.350
 street killer for fraud there you have to 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.540
 already do a lot 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.150
 dirks performance is good for 12 times 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.070
 but racing without digital 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.290
 Management requires mechanical 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.880
 Sensitivity like in the good old days 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.230
 the dare is not wolfsburg but he 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.660
 is not a classic race car 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.670
 gives different components 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.130
 installs it that way to buy then 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.840
 since the essential is the normal one 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.000
 Axle underneath is normal herbs 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.890
 batty in it is normal gear in it 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.230
 that is no cage is not present 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.760
 new chassis there with any coni 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.950
 everything is down 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.510
 certainly not modified 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.400
 complete conversion to a racing car 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.110
 you definitely need one 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.700
 Modification in the transmission that is 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.160
 automatic transmission and so built that 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.870
 you needed many road wisdom 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.910
 Automatic transmission about 210 with one 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.200
 other world-barbie you already have a 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.200
 saved half a second 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.030
 here are the competitors of 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.640
 ticketcorner eg this wolfsburger 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.870
 lastenesel a t 1 year of construction 1966 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.209
 treacherous the fat tachometer 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.660
 next to the spindly original 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.390
 steering column a sure indication for evil 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.709
 until the drive rubber but has the t1 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.709
 really steam under the hood 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:51.120
 36 of this industry engine from the 964s 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.120
 92 with 52 ps series 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.820
 125 newton meters 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.710
 meanwhile, 278 cases have been rebuilt 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.070
 on the ice clutch and air masses 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:11.060
 measuring while dreaming of 350 newton meters 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.590
 and yes, he's pretty quick 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.420
 made wolfsburger belong 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.109
 Traditionally the toughest opponents 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.120
 the american dickschiffe 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.979
 a lot of pressure with little weight makes them 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.360
 fast behind the back missing 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.360
 but then the full torque 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.840
 but the sprint duels are not just 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.009
 about final speed and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.009
 acceleration decided 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.099
 if you are with a thousandth 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.250
 response time so everything with zero 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:46.560
 comma zero starts 505 has now arrived 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.990
 you can first drive away in the front 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.530
 it takes a lot to figure out where to be 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.810
 will be in the semifinals of the public 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.130
 race with the burn out he brings the 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.070
 Ripen on temperature 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.820
 then got a quick start and 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.340
 lies ahead 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.380
 He has twelve seconds to spare 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.720
 and control the race 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.380
 but a loose victorious as it seems 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.060
 Unfortunately , he has made an early start 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.060
 that out for the roadrunner 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.379
 the illumination runs stand out 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.729
 by the fact that at the end of each 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.459
 Run one of the two on the 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.160
 Tragererverein becomes because he finished then 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.140
 is 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.620
 and so does the show in hockenheim without 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.710
 will continue drag racing is colorful fast 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.450
 and loud and it 's exciting because of it 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.580
 technical and driving 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.580
 more demanding than many think 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.690
 oh yes as a real racer filed dirk 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.760
 of course with another 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.470
 American classics at the 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.470
 perfect reaction time
