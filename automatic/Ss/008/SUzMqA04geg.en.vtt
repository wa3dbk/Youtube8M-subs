00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 very good to all that as is 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 welcome back to clash of clans 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.790
 this time we are here in a new 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 episode of a 9 in clash of plants 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.380
 because I just passed from City Hall what 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.820
 you see I have town hall level 8 I know that 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 I have rushed a bit and I already 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.710
 you said yesterday but it was just for 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.119
 give more quality to the videos I was 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.920
 being very stuck in the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.920
 City Hall level 7 in terms of videos 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.170
 ideas and then the town hall level 8 is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.090
 a kind of soda not for the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.730
 channel for both the channel and me 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 for the village but other new things and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.690
 the truth is that I am very very 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.430
 excited in the first place all that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.960
 I'm building the town hall 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.239
 level 8 I'm putting it here near the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.680
 City Hall because I do not know 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.450
 I just want to have this design of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.879
 I spend a little more time until I do 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 a few defenses and such so what 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 what I looked for in this episode really is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.219
 that you tell me good that you help me 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.500
 little that I would have to improve first 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.090
 you know that a cloud even clans was 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 a series that I had when I started to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.989
 play but well it's never too late to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.820
 making a knot is never too late 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.100
 learn something new and I think today is the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.960
 perfect moment the right time to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.460
 to explain some things to me 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.320
 first of all I'm improving the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.970
 ride pigs level 2 that I already said 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.830
 this takes 8 days things and so 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.510
 still the truth is that it is good 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.610
 tortillitas that you have to wait and in 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.320
 when I finish and I will put and improve 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.229
 this have you told me some of the clan 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.850
 improve the laboratory as soon as possible and that 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.950
 same is what I'm going to do by the way 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.729
 greetings to the entire clan here 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 you are some machines the truth is you are 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.869
 machines because the war is the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.220
 war started a good ratillo 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.810
 center I wanted a ratillo of 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.820
 distraction to how many hours but 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 likewise fix four hours ago 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.039
 or less or almost four hours less 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.950
 four minutes so in four hours 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.990
 we have attacked 18 people we have 36 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.970
 stars the enemies I think they are 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.280
 happening the subject they are saying look 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.759
 I spend my time because then that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.440
 we have we have potential or at the moment 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.090
 at the moment quite well and I know 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.920
 I'm glad a lot that the clan 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.259
 go as always I wanted no people who 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.840
 really active people who want 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.759
 be part of the clan not so guys 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.430
 first of all I tell you tell me what 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.120
 better or finishes improving this at the level 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.580
 5 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.560
 I'm going to improve the laboratory in 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.480
 four terms mountains pigs or maybe 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.340
 not before, not because I think it took me a few 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.170
 four days exactly and then it would be 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.810
 lengthen four more days mounts them 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.330
 pigs things that I can not do 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.920
 so guys what I'm going to say I'm 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.659
 around here improving the tower to which it was 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.700
 the level 8 that was one that stayed 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.650
 delayed or is lagging and the pit because 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.030
 I did not realize but good morning 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.560
 the day I'm watching this video and the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.780
 I have the level and I'll start doing 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.720
 other little things so tell me what I do 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.310
 first what I had thought is good 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.440
 I would like to inflate a pretty elixir 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.269
 dark then I will improve what 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.160
 has been the extractor at level 3 and 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.989
 Here I am making another extractor 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.329
 dark isr then the next thing I'm going to 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.549
 do is going to be put defense by the wall 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.319
 but this little bit because because 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.359
 yes or right now I can not I do not have 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.750
 so many resources maybe gold so 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.129
 I have a lot but elixir not 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.840
 so I can not do what comes 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.870
 being the extractor I can not improve it 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.299
 I can not improve is neither that is me 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.459
 it limits a lot not by saying some way 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.200
 so the guys tell me what you would do 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.819
 you having this village I think that 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.950
 it's pretty good to be level 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.629
 good also level 8 starting something 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.180
 What makes me very excited are the 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.549
 skeletons and these seem incredible to me 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.349
 from a face to improve it I'm cool 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.939
 cool a lot so nothing as far as 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.530
 can and I will start to build what 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.629
 it's been the defense is to start 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.639
 build to see what we have here 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.150
 dark barrack too for example is 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.030
 what do you see 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.590
 I am very limited at the time of 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.569
 build something because I do not have resources 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.609
 that is, there is not any resources also 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.099
 I will improve good to improve ourselves 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.810
 build and improve the stores because 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.760
 I see it also quite useful and nothing 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.230
 guys tell me what would you do 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.989
 I think I'm going to get it pretty good 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.430
 what I have in mind or just repeat it in 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.379
 first place now with the money that 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.519
 I have that's what I 'm good at 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.340
 put to improve the tower is of 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.250
 archers that take very little if it takes 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.199
 pretty little and then what to do 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.510
 Well, what I said maybe better 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.939
 bit more wall then I'll get to 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.010
 do this when the 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.530
 laboratories mounts pigs what 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.090
 I will improve exactly and above all 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.829
 I will improve the extractors because I 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.660
 it interests a lot to have a lot being 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.010
 dark to climb the king and to improve 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.050
 dogs 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.030
 3 as soon as they finish the pigs 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.720
 why then because I like to attack by 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.430
 airs 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.260
 Well I would like to show you here the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.890
 troops as I have it and such that if not 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.240
 you have seen him tell you the senator does not 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.460
 It is up to him or think up 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.140
 moment because he did not use them equally 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.820
 the goblins and it breaks walls then 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.880
 it's practically a unit 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.560
 useless for me I practically attack from 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.570
 air and how much better is coming 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.150
 being the barracks aims to improve the 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.220
 balloons the dragon or the balloons the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.050
 minions and dragons in that order and 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.330
 then already little by little and improving 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.370
 others night the spells to improve 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.560
 the rival bar and such so nothing guys 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.850
 we are not going to watch the next video I hope 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.760
 that you really liked many 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.920
 thank you for being there one more day the clan 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.260

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.380
