00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
proportionally right as if I just added

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.770 
proportionally right as if I just added
it<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> bottom<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.450> wouldn't<00:02:36.660> look

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
it to the bottom that it wouldn't look

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.120 
it to the bottom that it wouldn't look
proportionate<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.440> have<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.620> add<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.770> seat

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
proportionate you have to add a seat

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.729 
proportionate you have to add a seat
area<00:02:38.459> had<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.090> add<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> middle<00:02:40.020> yeah

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
area had to add it to the middle yeah

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.540 
area had to add it to the middle yeah
that<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.080> complicated<00:02:43.080> yowza<00:02:43.890> yeah<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
that is so complicated yowza yeah and
