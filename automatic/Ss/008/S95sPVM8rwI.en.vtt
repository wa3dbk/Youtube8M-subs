Daytona<00:03:16.040> USA<00:03:16.129> they<00:03:16.700> used<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:16.970> have<00:03:17.090> four<00:03:17.360> of

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
Daytona USA they used to have four of

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.360 
Daytona USA they used to have four of
these<00:03:17.599> but<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.260> guess<00:03:18.620> two<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:18.890> them<00:03:19.160> just

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
these but I guess two of them just

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.479 
these but I guess two of them just
crapped<00:03:20.060> out<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.629> so<00:03:20.870> they<00:03:21.110> got<00:03:22.010> stuck<00:03:22.340> with

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
crapped out and so they got stuck with

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.699 
crapped out and so they got stuck with
these<00:03:22.700> but<00:03:23.000> they're<00:03:23.510> pretty<00:03:23.690> nice<00:03:23.959> always<00:03:24.680> a

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
these but they're pretty nice always a

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.770 
these but they're pretty nice always a
big<00:03:24.920> moneymaker

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.380 

we're<00:03:28.320> here<00:03:28.730> their<00:03:29.730> Redemption<00:03:30.000> is

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
we're here their Redemption is

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.850 
we're here their Redemption is
definitely<00:03:30.810> not<00:03:30.930> what<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.200> used<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
definitely not what it used to be the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.290 
definitely not what it used to be the
East<00:03:32.010> End<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.250> lot<00:03:32.400> worried<00:03:32.640> that's<00:03:32.910> been<00:03:33.150> here

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
East End a lot worried that's been here

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.699 
East End a lot worried that's been here
here's<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.360> 10x<00:03:36.810> pump<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.260> up

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.330 

I<00:03:40.989> think<00:03:41.989> they<00:03:42.109> took<00:03:42.290> this<00:03:42.560> screen<00:03:42.950> out<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.189> a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
I think they took this screen out of a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.890 
I think they took this screen out of a
crisis<00:03:43.790> zone<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.120> they<00:03:44.269> used<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.569> have<00:03:44.719> here

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
crisis zone that they used to have here

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.509 
crisis zone that they used to have here
and<00:03:45.109> put<00:03:45.379> it<00:03:45.469> into<00:03:45.709> this<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.900> guess

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
and put it into this I guess

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.679 
and put it into this I guess
stepping<00:03:49.519> on<00:03:49.640> these<00:03:49.819> things<00:03:50.090> makes<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.540> lot

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
stepping on these things makes a lot

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.209 
stepping on these things makes a lot
more<00:03:50.870> money<00:03:50.989> than<00:03:51.109> shooting<00:03:51.500> terrorists<00:03:52.099> in

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
more money than shooting terrorists in

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.280 
more money than shooting terrorists in
the<00:03:52.340> face<00:03:52.689> crisis<00:03:53.689> zone<00:03:53.840> was<00:03:53.959> one<00:03:54.140> of<00:03:54.230> my

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
the face crisis zone was one of my

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.929 
the face crisis zone was one of my
favorite<00:03:54.680> games<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.099> they<00:03:55.219> had<00:03:55.370> here<00:03:55.609> so

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
favorite games that they had here so

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.059 
favorite games that they had here so

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.179 
working here back in 1999
different<00:04:34.120> quite<00:04:34.300> a<00:04:34.330> while<00:04:34.949> there's<00:04:35.949> their

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
different quite a while there's their

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.719

I<00:04:39.849> mentioned<00:04:40.270> before<00:04:40.330> they<00:04:40.629> used<00:04:40.809> tokens<00:04:41.349> it's

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
I mentioned before they used tokens it's

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.129 
I mentioned before they used tokens it's
$3.00<00:04:42.839> per<00:04:43.839> token<00:04:44.349> that<00:04:44.759> they've<00:04:45.759> modified<00:04:46.719> it
