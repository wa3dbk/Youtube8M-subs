of a fair keeping let's say third
comments<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:12.600> one<00:01:12.840> common<00:01:13.200> number

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
comments here and then one common number

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.200 
comments here and then one common number
30<00:01:13.650> comments<00:01:13.920> he's<00:01:14.700> pretty<00:01:14.939> much<00:01:15.030> there

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
30 comments he's pretty much there

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.670 
30 comments he's pretty much there
almost<00:01:15.299> guaranteed<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.900> win<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> guess<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
almost guaranteed to win a guess and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
almost guaranteed to win a guess and
that's<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.790> where<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.150> about<00:01:18.360> it's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that's not where it's all about it's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.800 
that's not where it's all about it's
basically<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.259> random<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.570> got<00:01:21.570> problem

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
basically you know random so got problem

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
basically you know random so got problem
with<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.049> tough<00:01:22.729> I'm<00:01:23.729> try<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> make<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.150> fair

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
with it tough I'm try to make it fair

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
with it tough I'm try to make it fair
for<00:01:24.570> everybody<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:25.950> few<00:01:26.280> people

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
for everybody it's just like few people

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.480 
for everybody it's just like few people
that<00:01:26.670> did<00:01:27.060> kind<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.780> overly<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.250> what

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that did kind of overly do it so what

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.960 
that did kind of overly do it so what
I've<00:01:29.549> done<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:30.560> I've<00:01:31.560> got<00:01:31.710> them<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
I've done is I've got them all here it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.929 
I've done is I've got them all here it
ranges<00:01:33.659> between<00:01:34.729> one<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:36.710> 1027<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.790> going

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
ranges between one on 1027 so I'm going

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
ranges between one on 1027 so I'm going
to<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> generator<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.079> first<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
to do a generator for the first one the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
to do a generator for the first one the
way<00:01:41.369> I'm<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.229> let's<00:01:43.229> say

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
way I'm going to do it is let's say

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.460 
way I'm going to do it is let's say
y'all<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:46.009> but<00:01:47.009> see<00:01:47.159> your<00:01:47.340> son<00:01:47.579> /

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
so as an example if it was number 28 27

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.600 
so as an example if it was number 28 27
26<00:01:59.369> or<00:01:59.820> 25<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:01.200> sample<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.799> win<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> case<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.490> an

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
26 or 25 then sample we win a case as an

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.780 
26 or 25 then sample we win a case as an
example<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> next<00:02:04.079> person<00:02:04.320> etc<00:02:04.890> so
