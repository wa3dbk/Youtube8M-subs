00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 I find the product four times less 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.200
 five times less than 7.5 is only multiplying 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.120
 three numbers here some are positive 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.769
 some are negative we can do this 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.969
 in any order but we are from left 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.940
 to the right 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.949
 Let's start with four times minus 5 and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.840
 then multiply the result by 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.039
 minus 7.5 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.970
 Let's write the problem four times. 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.679
 five times less than 7.5 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.899
 You do not need to write this sign here if 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.000
 has only four followed by minus 5 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.500
 means four times minus 5 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.550
 the first thing we need to understand 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.940
 is that more times more equals one more 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.950
 more often - or less often when 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.700
 if it has different signals the result is 1 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.190
 - if we have equal signs - times - 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.920
 We'll also have one more. Let's work. 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.920
 in this problem then we have four times 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.170
 at least 54 times 5 would be 20 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 let me make another color four times 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.030
 5 would be 20 but we have one more times - but 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.270
 being less different signals result in 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.049
 one - so it gets less 20 times less 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.060
 7.5 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.030
 let's find out the result we have 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.270
 multiply 27.5 people can do this 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.689
 out here then 7.5 times 2010 times 500 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.430
 times 7 to 0 puts 10 here because 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.460
 obviously we will not multiply by 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:41.130
 two are actually x 22 times 5 and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:44.939
 10 12 times seven and 14 plus one to give 15 and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.100
 we have 10 and we have 10 and we have 15 I'm just 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.720
 adding here we need the one then 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.630
 You count the numbers after the comma. 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.430
 we only have one digit after the comma 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.680
 the two numbers, then only 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.790
 we put a digit after the comma in the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.600
 our product 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.579
 the answer here is 150 this equals 150 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.950
 now let's think if this is going to be 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.039
 positive or negative 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.630
 we have less times - they are the same signs 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.820
 then a result will be a 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.050
 the positive group our final answer is 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:26.670
 150 if we really want to keep 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.670
 accuracy here we can write 150.0
