00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.580
 hello do not regret first 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:19.949
 you may become in the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.519
 asked last months for weeks 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.769
 why does he actually ride me ? 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.630
 so on the calorie balance around why 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.060
 says the man how he calculated the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.160
 all the time how much calories we eat 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 how much calories we consume 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 calorie balance of this and that in the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.500
 last two or the last few 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 It was also about the videos 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.219
 calorie balance deficit pipapo you become 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.750
 with safety So now you see at 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.879
 the headline what it is here for me 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.940
 Actually, your world is safe 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.079
 have noticed that our head 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.730
 a very powerful weapon 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.160
 or that our head is very 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.039
 a lot of our behavior 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 For example, we control something when we have something 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.280
 do not like to do that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 or if we do something very much 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 then the time comes a little slower 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.350
 before or a little faster before that passes 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 Time goes by incredibly fast 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.490
 if we do what we like to do 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.350
 and if we do not like something 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.960
 then time goes by a lot 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.909
 much slower in our head we 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.439
 then get different feeling because we do that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.680
 whole probably with negative 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.130
 combine thoughts and then passes away 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.430
 the time just not at the doctor 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.320
 waiting or cleaning or waiting room 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.390
 something you do not like to do 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 that always takes longer and everything 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.860
 we like to do that is just like that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.470
 what about the day gone by and how 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.960
 that's the same in nutrition as we are 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 Of course, in the diet, it is necessary 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.460
 just so that we control the whole thing 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.770
 if we only want it in the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.040
 age of smartphones are age 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.710
 of the internet we'll see each other now 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240
 two times a week about youtube im 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.610
 age of the internet 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.450
 that's a lot easier, of course 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.380
 before 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.610
 I want that a little bit 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.819
 represent plastic I have from 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.800
 read a study I have to say 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.780
 I do not know exactly what study is 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.269
 was and where it was exactly that is it 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.209
 may be just as fictional as it is 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.620
 is logical for me and I hold it 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.390
 quite possible 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.959
 one has women on one third on one 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.900
 treadmill but a treadmill and 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.610
 said we're running now 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.010
 run and the scientists run 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.840
 how many calories women knew 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.280
 consume and exactly when they are 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.459
 they have consumed calories 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.590
 said stop and then end so then 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.880
 did you let the women appreciate how 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.709
 you have a lot of calories 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.080
 or have you just burnt in the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.400
 time you have been training there 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.690
 come white house 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:05.010
 they are three to four times as high 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.049
 appreciated yes we do not like it 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.299
 So I have so much 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.160
 calories burned so you have that 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.650
 experiment continued and said 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.950
 if that opens up a room further 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.660
 is a buffet set up 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.030
 from this command could serve you 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.190
 You can eat as much calories as you do 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.470
 believed or as you believe that you 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.180
 but have burnt them, of course 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.850
 yet no numbers called that and that 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.160
 result was then that the people 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.440
 double to triple what they are 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.750
 consumed on the treadmill before 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.130
 have eaten in again 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.480
 that of course sometime into the 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.269
 dilemma lead that was natural then 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.410
 in the quarter hour goes and think 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.700
 somehow nothing moves forward 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.430
 is very clear 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.959
 Of course I have my funny blackboard 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.540
 here again and would like that very briefly 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.639
 represent 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.459
 So they have taken place I take now 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.799
 Just 300 calories, so calories 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.310
 I do not know at 15 percent 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.560
 quarter of an hour increase 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.200
 on the body weight I think about 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.349
 There are 300 calories if these women are so 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.070
 300 calories burned, they thought 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.440
 burned nine to 1200 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.100
 when did they go to eat instead 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.530
 They have 600 to 900 to eat 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.090
 eaten and what comes naturally when 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.040
 under the room under the strokes 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.320
 comes out instead of nine one 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.780
 balanced balance comes out of us 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.010
 have three to 600 calories too much 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.960
 eaten 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.479
 of course it was quite an experiment 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.729
 but that does not show when things are 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.760
 like to do things he would like to do 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.190
 ours are shifting 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.169
 perceptions or our perception of 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.540
 different would be one for ours 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.470
 then the perception shifts 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:00.820
 means create a control organ with you 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:04.260
 fd dp stb fd dp point info with the 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.990
 calorie counter of fat sigrid with 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.970
 notes and paper and a calorie 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.410
 booklet where it really old 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.320
 School is in the age of smartphones 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.410
 Make it as easy as possible 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.710
 to achieve your goals and that's on 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.229
 Best with accounting and of course with 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.240
 trial &amp; error because not every calorie 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.520
 Of course, formula is right for everyone 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.770
 people agree 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.260
 See you at the next video 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.270
 is coming right after this today 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.020
 video because it is only very briefly about one 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.240
 I would like to have answered 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.479
 and I would ask you first 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.250
 how do you do that makes many calories 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.139
 Does not count these if you count them like 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.960
 do you count her please write that to me 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.250
 below in the comments that everyone what 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.900
 We'll see you at the next one 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.940
 maybe again in one 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.940
 victorious few minutes time
