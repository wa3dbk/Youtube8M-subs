00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.390
 m 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.830
 so friends of the sun it goes on with 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.550
 the designs of the week cordially 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.240
 welcome 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.550
 today five something simpler science 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 Nevertheless, they are relatively cool and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.300
 That's why I introduce them here 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.310
 the first design is a unicorn yes who 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 it would have thought that you can see yes 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.000
 first off is the reddot usa ca polo 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.379
 There is another trick down here 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.050
 the thing and that would have in two 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.460
 open different directions 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:45.720
 that is to say you do not mean that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.620
 so open or something but it closes 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.230
 power is one thing in the one thing 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.570
 the other way up and then you have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.670
 very nice feet for the unicorn we 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.050
 go on are second design and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.260
 Although this is a staircase one 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.780
 holistic modern staircase and that 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.110
 Let's go in here and hike the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.870
 off and the cool thing is that I already here 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.310
 the same number I've never tested it that way 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.260
 now that works and is just you 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.729
 You see, she is drumming 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.210
 not so much to say i always want there 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.900
 Saying more than necessary is something 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 However, of course, now is missing 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.430
 a demarcation and maybe that well 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.920
 should be enough so you can as yet 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 I'm doing a fence here now 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 not now but I am here 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.340
 Upper floor is a very cool 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.590
 so if you are completely modern now, 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.860
 build because then that is definitely 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.439
 a recommendation for your living room 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.270
 if you build a slightly different staircase 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.090
 this is also an option for 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.939
 but be careful you can with this 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.140
 design no spiral staircase build the way 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.540
 as it is the case here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.299
 because every level is held here by 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.590
 a pillar and you see me when I am 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.630
 Now here I would 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.879
 now in a pillar are so 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.670
 works here works quite well 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.349
 as it is done here now but 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.420
 Of course you can do that with this method 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.430
 now no 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.440
 stairs do not build anything here either 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.209
 It's great that you jump every time 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.950
 if you want to go up here now 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.739
 but still very partial from so 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.910
 is really cool you can do it 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.910
 meanwhile just decorate with 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.500
 lighting and so on and so forth 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.520
 So I think if you go there and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.650
 Zion made one more 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.360
 lighting unit purely then sees that 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.470
 really cool in your evening 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.330
 bude h 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.880
 ok and now we go to the fifth 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.540
 design this is the fourth design 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.910
 Sorry , that is from the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.630
 rheydter gaming and that is one thing 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.690
 to be a brain exchanger 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.780
 brain switcher I have to do it now 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.250
 take a villager and take it on 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.890
 best such a pig or so you will 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.670
 See what's going on and set it 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.330
 I put it in there and there you go 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.110
 and because, unfortunately, did not fit purely is 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.580
 In any case , you can feel that way 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.230
 Of course you can still imagine 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.299
 another other villager 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.200
 reinmachen the snout shut 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.180
 snout and yes it works 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.579
 so cool so it works completely 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.430
 So cool for action movies or 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.140
 fancy movies in minecraft there it is 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.220
 every case is quite successful 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.900
 so set now where is the fifth 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.880
 design where is that we have to 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.730
 look up there is the fifth 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.190
 North Korea has a design of course 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.859
 also has a presence in minecraft and has 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.690
 again decided new 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.350
 make rocket tests and serve more 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.350
 to celebrate 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:01.569
 this one unfortunately ends up on the 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:04.160
 mainland and that the design is by bbc 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.230
 contribution or whatever 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.890
 and that's a very simple that 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.010
 They look really cool anyway 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.750
 that with the ambos with one 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:20.410
 defiantly I never know it again 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:22.210
 kessel exactly and with a hobby and that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.860
 looks like a rocket like that 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.740
 now flying straight down and here 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.270
 just before that is to strike here 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.820
 That with North Korea of ​​course that was just 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.800
 a joke of love kim jong us a whole 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.750
 nicer those were the fifth science of 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.970
 week I thank you for watching 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.770
 they were relatively simple but me 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.020
 think that still what you what 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.520
 needs something useful with it when 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.460
 now a nursery set up for 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.460
 For example, you can take the unicorn 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.710
 as you make your kumpels from determined 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.570
 happy with that as it was said that was it 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.919
 from me I hope you turn on 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.919
 next to 1 of the week zschau
