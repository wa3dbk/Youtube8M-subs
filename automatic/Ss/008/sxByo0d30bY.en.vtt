00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:05.259
 or if you're going to have a creamy cornbread cake recipe a simple recipe and 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.370
 practice to be done at home 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.080
 - we are going to make a recipe that she does not always have many savannas and one 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.850
 but the fire was different from moacir 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.620
 so let's go to the ingredients 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.710
 to make the goal you will not use 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.859
 4 you four cicadas of the 10h of milk 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.789
 three cups of sugar 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.320
 two tablespoons of margarine 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.540
 I thought 'corn starch face a cup corn cornmeal a spoon' 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 yeast soup to register for grated coconut and explain to me the presence of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.120
 grated cheese 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.840
 now the procedure is very simple, just knock 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.790
 everything in the blender 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.980
 so add 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.450
 all the ingredients 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.150
 to the blender 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.130
 There's no sequence we're putting here in the blender. 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.660
 because 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.740
 Let's hit all the funds. 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.000
 so you do not need 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.040
 the concern 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.310
 It is worth remembering that this is the recipe 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.190
 she gets dem and dough gets pretty wet let's put that the two women 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.610
 of margarine 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.270
 because it is pressing all the ingredients paternal everything in the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 blender 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.530
 but let's try for about a minute until you're sure 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.450
 It's all mixed up right now so you do not have any doubts about the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.680
 Score 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.000
 just marcio 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Let's have a look. 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 Look, I'm just gonna put it in the fortune here. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.230
 then you will not think that at your point is wrong sun correct is this 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.520
 same 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.540
 and another with the ford your blender there goes 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.700
 get full in torrent quite this mass now only take the form well the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.400
 time that I can stay in the form of approximately 35 minutes of course 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.849
 is failing according to your oven 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.319
 now it's still hot but it can already be uninformed 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.569
 that measure we made gave these two forms 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:24.619
 now we go 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.619
 for puppets to inform 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.269
 so it's still hot but we may have to look very creamy 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.229
 nothing to be that traditional cake 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.759
 What do we do with cornmeal? 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:55.039
 so it is already a little unusual to silence 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.269
 p they only give me this texture 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.539
 to count 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:06.329
 gives the marcia that gets much bigger as I showed you have the impression that 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:06.889
 she 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.129
 is wrong look 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.479
 because I am the medium 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.979
 it looks very creamy 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.969
 so we'll have it here 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.749
 the cream cake here 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:22.629
 crunchy too because he will get this training time already to 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.359
 upper class 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.949
 but by an expert 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.439
 can be served 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.290
 in the lunch at the almost lifeless breakfast of the three visits 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.450
 another traditional coffee or the juice 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.749
 very good it's worth you try
