00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
cool trick view is called invisible

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.340 
cool trick view is called invisible
buttons<00:00:05.910> which<00:00:06.420> might<00:00:06.720> not<00:00:06.839> be<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.020> best

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350

you

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
you

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.730 
you
however<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.900> will<00:00:10.019> make<00:00:10.200> your<00:00:10.349> buttons

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
however it will make your buttons

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.890 
however it will make your buttons
invisible<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.090> was<00:00:12.240> sent<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.509> me<00:00:12.690> by<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
invisible so this was sent to me by a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
invisible so this was sent to me by a
subscriber<00:00:13.230> quite<00:00:13.769> some<00:00:13.980> time<00:00:14.219> ago<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
subscriber quite some time ago and I

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.849 
subscriber quite some time ago and I
finally<00:00:15.509> got<00:00:15.719> around<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.080> making<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.560> video<00:00:16.800> on

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
finally got around to making a video on

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.710 
finally got around to making a video on
it<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.640> if<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> look<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
it so if we have a look here we have a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960 
it so if we have a look here we have a
normal-looking<00:00:19.320> wall<00:00:19.740> however<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.699> closer

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
normal-looking wall however on closer

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.849 
normal-looking wall however on closer
inspection<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.869> see<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> texture<00:00:22.769> on

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
inspection you can see the texture on

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.340 
inspection you can see the texture on
this<00:00:22.980> block<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.490> across<00:00:23.900> instead<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> T

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
this block is across instead of the T

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.019 
this block is across instead of the T
shape<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.949> normally<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.519> these<00:00:26.760> box

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
shape that we normally see on these box

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
shape that we normally see on these box
so<00:00:27.750> when<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.199> looking<00:00:28.289> at<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.619> block<00:00:28.890> we

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
so when we're looking at this block we

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.460 
so when we're looking at this block we
get<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> black<00:00:29.519> outline<00:00:29.820> around<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:31.199> show

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
get the black outline around it to show

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.650 
get the black outline around it to show
us<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> outside<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> box<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.510> go

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
us the outside of the box and if we go

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
us the outside of the box and if we go
to<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.960> top<00:00:34.170> left<00:00:34.410> hand<00:00:34.559> corner<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.100> see

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to the top left hand corner you can see

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.370 
to the top left hand corner you can see
that<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.760> disappears<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:37.140> when<00:00:37.350> I

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that that disappears and then when I

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.130 
that that disappears and then when I
right-click<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:38.190> gives<00:00:38.489> me<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> diamond<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.510> so

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
right-click it gives me a diamond and so

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.479 
right-click it gives me a diamond and so
if<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.290> go<00:00:40.440> over<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.860> there's<00:00:41.070> another<00:00:41.309> one

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
if we go over here there's another one

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
if we go over here there's another one
of<00:00:41.579> those<00:00:41.670> crosses<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:42.840> click<00:00:42.870> in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
of those crosses if we right click in

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
of those crosses if we right click in
the<00:00:43.829> top<00:00:44.040> corner<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.550> time<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:45.480> gonna

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the top corner this time you're gonna

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.299 
the top corner this time you're gonna
see<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.110> open<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.590> chest<00:00:46.890> full<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.190> gold

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
see that we open a chest full of gold

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
see that we open a chest full of gold
and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> same<00:00:49.110> thing<00:00:49.379> over

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
and then we can do the same thing over

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.260 
and then we can do the same thing over
here<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.980> well<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.640> stand<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.120> this

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
here as well if we go and stand on this

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.600 
here as well if we go and stand on this
half<00:00:51.539> slab<00:00:51.840> except<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.800> time<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> texture

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
half slab except this time the texture

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
half slab except this time the texture
of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> block<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> line<00:00:55.170> going

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
of the block is just the line going

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.260 
of the block is just the line going
across<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.460> there's<00:00:56.610> no<00:00:56.730> cross<00:00:57.030> or

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
across like that so there's no cross or

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.450 
across like that so there's no cross or
T<00:00:57.420> shape<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> line<00:00:58.559> across<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
T shape it's just the line across the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.950 
T shape it's just the line across the
middle<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.850> if<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.449> bottom<00:01:00.629> left

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
middle and if we go to the bottom left

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.869 
middle and if we go to the bottom left
hand<00:01:01.140> corner<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
hand corner of that you can see the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.369 
hand corner of that you can see the
black<00:01:03.059> outline<00:01:03.300> disappears<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.260> when<00:01:04.350> I

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
black outline disappears and when I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.960 
black outline disappears and when I
right<00:01:04.619> click<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.280> teleported<00:01:05.820> through

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
right click I get teleported through

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.149 
right click I get teleported through
because<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> minecart<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.010> other

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
because there is a minecart on the other

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.330 
because there is a minecart on the other
side<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:10.830> intentional

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
side so this is not an intentional

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.980 
side so this is not an intentional
feature<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.030> quite<00:01:12.270> likely<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.840> would<00:01:12.930> be

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
feature it's quite likely it would be

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
feature it's quite likely it would be
considered<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.560> bug<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> fixed<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> future

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
considered a bug and fixed in the future

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.719 
considered a bug and fixed in the future
but<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.930> trick<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.470> done<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.920> stairs<00:01:17.400> now

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but this trick is done with stairs now

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.160 
but this trick is done with stairs now
you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> any<00:01:18.360> type<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> stairs<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you can do it of any type of stairs that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.380 
you can do it of any type of stairs that
there<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> different

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
there is and you get the different

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.789 
there is and you get the different
texture<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:22.409> we're<00:01:22.560> doing

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
texture there because what we're doing

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
texture there because what we're doing
is<00:01:23.280> we're<00:01:23.549> connecting<00:01:23.970> blocks<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
is we're connecting blocks like that so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
is we're connecting blocks like that so
you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.799> turns<00:01:26.100> into<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.430> cross

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you can see this one turns into a cross

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.070 
you can see this one turns into a cross
and<00:01:27.000> when<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> stairs<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
and when we do it with the stairs the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200 
and when we do it with the stairs the
other<00:01:28.170> way<00:01:28.380> around<00:01:28.500> it'll<00:01:29.400> turn<00:01:29.579> into<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.880> line

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
other way around it'll turn into a line

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.969 
other way around it'll turn into a line
like<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.380> basically<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
like that and so that is basically the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.380 
like that and so that is basically the
trick<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> look<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> over<00:01:33.210> here

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
trick if we have a look at it over here

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
trick if we have a look at it over here
and<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> look<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.430> this

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and you can see that when I look at this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.819 
and you can see that when I look at this
block<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> black<00:01:36.960> outline<00:01:37.200> around<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
block we get the black outline around it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.080 
block we get the black outline around it
and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> look<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> air<00:01:38.880> behind

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and then when I look at the air behind

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749 
and then when I look at the air behind
it<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.290> goes<00:01:40.470> away<00:01:40.680> however<00:01:41.280> when<00:01:41.670> we

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
it and that goes away however when we

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.700 
it and that goes away however when we
put<00:01:41.909> another<00:01:42.119> stairs<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.259> same<00:01:43.500> thing

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
put another stairs here the same thing

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.679 
put another stairs here the same thing
happens<00:01:44.100> when<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.310> look<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> same<00:01:45.090> space<00:01:45.479> so

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
happens when I look in the same space so

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.880 
happens when I look in the same space so
it<00:01:45.780> doesn't<00:01:46.049> account<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> fact<00:01:46.710> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it doesn't account for the fact that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.160 
it doesn't account for the fact that
it's<00:01:47.100> added<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.850> extra<00:01:47.909> bit<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.420> block<00:01:48.899> right

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it's added that extra bit of block right

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.380 
it's added that extra bit of block right
there<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.180> come

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
there and so what we can do is come

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.850 
there and so what we can do is come
around<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> other<00:01:51.899> side<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.470> we<00:01:52.590> look

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
around to the other side and if we look

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.710 
around to the other side and if we look
at<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.640> top<00:01:53.820> right<00:01:54.030> hand<00:01:54.180> corner<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.600> this

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
at the top right hand corner of this

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.209 
at the top right hand corner of this
block<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> line

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
block here you can see when the line

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.289 
block here you can see when the line
goes<00:01:56.430> away<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.850> means<00:01:56.969> we're<00:01:57.210> actually

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
goes away it means we're actually

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.510 
goes away it means we're actually
interacting<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.259> whatever<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
interacting with whatever is on the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280 
interacting with whatever is on the
other<00:01:59.670> side<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.540> left<00:02:00.750> click<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.259> right

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
other side so if I left click or right

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
other side so if I left click or right
click<00:02:01.500> we're<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> interact<00:02:02.490> with

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
click we're going to interact with

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.670 
click we're going to interact with
whatever<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.540> back<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.500> see

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
whatever is back there so you can see

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.959 
whatever is back there so you can see
that<00:02:04.829> I've<00:02:04.920> broken<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.430> block<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
that I've broken the block and the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.600 
that I've broken the block and the
redstone<00:02:06.360> torch<00:02:06.390> has<00:02:07.380> gone<00:02:07.920> away<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.459> can

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
redstone torch has gone away so you can

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.130 
redstone torch has gone away so you can
left-click<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.239> right-click<00:02:09.509> anything

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
left-click and right-click anything

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140 
left-click and right-click anything
behind<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.590> wall<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.400> means<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.819> could<00:02:11.940> use

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
behind the wall this means you could use

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.430 
behind the wall this means you could use
it<00:02:12.300> with<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> bed

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it with a bed

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.230 
it with a bed
or<00:02:13.530> an<00:02:13.800> enchanting<00:02:14.340> table<00:02:14.520> or<00:02:14.850> maybe<00:02:15.060> you've

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
or an enchanting table or maybe you've

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.670 
or an enchanting table or maybe you've
got<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> sink<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.960> need<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.230> break<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
got a sink that you need to break on the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.590 
got a sink that you need to break on the
other<00:02:16.740> side<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> wall<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.910> activate<00:02:18.360> some

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
other side of the wall to activate some

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.540 
other side of the wall to activate some
redstone<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> really

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
redstone so that is it it is a really

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
redstone so that is it it is a really
simple<00:02:20.820> trick<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.390> hope<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.780> enjoy<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.350> if

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
simple trick I hope you enjoy it and if

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.750 
simple trick I hope you enjoy it and if
you<00:02:22.590> want<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.800> watch<00:02:22.920> some<00:02:23.160> more<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.340> my<00:02:23.460> videos
