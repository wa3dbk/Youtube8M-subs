tab characters to become four spaces the
spaces<00:00:39.390> make<00:00:39.600> yml<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> lot<00:00:40.320> happier<00:00:40.739> than<00:00:41.340> ten

characters<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.559> your

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710

characters do so just do that for your
own<00:00:43.829> good<00:00:44.070> otherwise<00:00:44.579> he'll<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> bunch<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
own good otherwise he'll have a bunch of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.510 
own good otherwise he'll have a bunch of
scripts<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.809> loading<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:47.100> banging<00:00:47.430> your

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
scripts not loading and be banging your

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.200 
scripts not loading and be banging your
head<00:00:47.550> against<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> wall<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> first<00:00:50.879> thing

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
head against the wall so the first thing

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
head against the wall so the first thing
to<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.690> when<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.960> make<00:00:52.110> an<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.920> define

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to do when you make an you just define

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
to do when you make an you just define
its<00:00:53.370> name<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.300> case<00:00:54.360> we'll<00:00:54.719> use<00:00:54.750> example

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
its name in this case we'll use example

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
its name in this case we'll use example
script<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:01.190> your<00:01:02.190> next<00:01:02.430> line<00:01:02.699> you're<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
script so your next line you're going to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299 
script so your next line you're going to
find<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> type<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.110> script<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.070> case

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
find the type of the script in this case

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
find the type of the script in this case
we're<00:01:05.519> making<00:01:05.549> interactive<00:01:06.119> F<00:01:06.600> which<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.869> your

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
we're making interactive F which is your

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.789 
we're making interactive F which is your
basic<00:01:07.610> most<00:01:08.610> common<00:01:09.060> type<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> script<00:01:09.799> since

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
basic most common type of script since

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.410 
basic most common type of script since
it's<00:01:11.040> part<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> example<00:01:12.030> script<00:01:12.270> we're

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it's part of the example script we're

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.789 
it's part of the example script we're
going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> indent<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.729> yml<00:01:14.729> use<00:01:14.970> a

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
going to indent it yml use a

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
going to indent it yml use a
parent-child<00:01:16.799> hierarchy<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.479> would<00:01:18.750> be

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
parent-child hierarchy so this would be

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.940 
parent-child hierarchy so this would be
a<00:01:18.930> child<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> example<00:01:20.400> script<00:01:20.750> section<00:01:21.950> so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
a child of the example script section so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.320 
a child of the example script section so
when<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.130> press<00:01:23.280> tab<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.790> actually<00:01:24.119> makes

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
when you press tab it actually makes

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
when you press tab it actually makes
four<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:24.780> spaces<00:01:25.320> which<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.890> just

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
four little spaces which is what we just

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.210 
four little spaces which is what we just
changed<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.439> said<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.710> need<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> find<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
changed like I said we need to find the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
changed like I said we need to find the
type<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.150> case<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
type in this case it's going to be a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.390 
type in this case it's going to be a
interacts<00:01:31.500> crypt<00:01:33.560> next<00:01:34.560> we're<00:01:34.979> gonna<00:01:35.040> skip

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
interacts crypt next we're gonna skip

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800 
interacts crypt next we're gonna skip
the<00:01:35.579> requirement<00:01:36.119> section<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.659> will<00:01:36.750> be

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the requirement section that will be

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.060 
the requirement section that will be
another<00:01:36.960> video<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.680> we're<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.950> get

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
another video and we're going to get

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.469 
another video and we're going to get
right<00:01:38.250> into<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.610> steps<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> script<00:01:41.479> since

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
right into the steps of the script since

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.969 
right into the steps of the script since
this<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> very<00:01:42.990> basic<00:01:43.170> script<00:01:43.590> where<00:01:43.829> I'm

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
this is a very basic script where I'm

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.160 
this is a very basic script where I'm
going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.520> step<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.600> we'll<00:01:45.810> explain

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
going to have one step and we'll explain

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.300 
going to have one step and we'll explain
more<00:01:46.229> about<00:01:46.530> steps<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.250> later<00:01:47.460> video<00:01:47.670> but

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
more about steps in a later video but

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.530 
more about steps in a later video but
for<00:01:50.310> right<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:50.490> we're<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.180> our<00:01:51.210> one

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
for right now we're going to do our one

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.039 
for right now we're going to do our one
step<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:54.149> steps<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
step and the steps are going to be a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.260 
step and the steps are going to be a
child<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> step<00:01:56.369> section<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.119> we're

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
child of the step section so we're

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.770 
child of the step section so we're
indenting<00:01:57.780> again<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:59.270> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> be

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
indenting again and this is going to be

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.010 
indenting again and this is going to be
our<00:02:00.899> first<00:02:01.140> step<00:02:01.500> we'll<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:01.950> call<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.310> one

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
our first step we'll just call it one

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.570 
our first step we'll just call it one
you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.729> different<00:02:05.729> names<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:07.190> steps<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you can do different names for steps and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.169 
you can do different names for steps and
we<00:02:08.670> could<00:02:08.819> call<00:02:08.970> them

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
we could call them

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.759 
we could call them
first<00:02:11.019> step<00:02:11.319> or<00:02:12.010> anything<00:02:12.310> but<00:02:13.290> they<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.469> do<00:02:14.739> a

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
first step or anything but they can do a

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.860 
first step or anything but they can do a
little<00:02:14.950> bit<00:02:15.129> more<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:15.730> default<00:02:16.329> steps<00:02:16.629> and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
little bit more about default steps and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.509 
little bit more about default steps and
blob<00:02:16.989> of<00:02:17.019> loss<00:02:17.319> right<00:02:17.769> now<00:02:17.890> we'll<00:02:18.010> name<00:02:18.129> it<00:02:18.159> one

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
blob of loss right now we'll name it one

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.089 
blob of loss right now we'll name it one
Dennison<00:02:19.239> on<00:02:19.359> though<00:02:19.510> that's<00:02:19.719> the<00:02:20.099> the

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
Dennison on though that's the the

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.399 
Dennison on though that's the the
default<00:02:21.489> step<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:24.489> inside<00:02:24.909> that<00:02:25.150> step<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:26.290> need

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
default step so inside that step we need

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.649 
default step so inside that step we need
to<00:02:26.500> make<00:02:26.590> another<00:02:26.799> child<00:02:27.129> session<00:02:27.609> and<00:02:28.450> we're

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
to make another child session and we're

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.619 
to make another child session and we're
going<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.930> use<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:30.099> click<00:02:30.340> trigger<00:02:30.639> for<00:02:31.510> this

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
going to use the click trigger for this

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.129 
going to use the click trigger for this
example<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.799> we<00:02:32.920> are<00:02:33.069> going<00:02:33.189> to<00:02:33.310> write<00:02:34.139> the

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
example so we are going to write the

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.869 
example so we are going to write the
trigger<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.590> now<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:39.129> knows<00:02:39.159> they<00:02:39.670> click

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
trigger so now it knows they click

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.550 
trigger so now it knows they click
trigger<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.269> part<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.079> first<00:02:41.349> step

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
trigger is part of the first step

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.649 
trigger is part of the first step
because<00:02:41.829> we've<00:02:41.980> indented<00:02:42.549> it

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
because we've indented it

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.339 
because we've indented it
everything<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.530> always<00:02:44.680> indented<00:02:45.129> one<00:02:45.780> tab<00:02:46.780> or

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
everything is always indented one tab or

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.759 
everything is always indented one tab or
four<00:02:47.769> spaces<00:02:48.810> even<00:02:49.810> though<00:02:49.900> sometimes<00:02:50.349> you

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
four spaces even though sometimes you

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.770 
four spaces even though sometimes you
end<00:02:51.010> up<00:02:51.129> with<00:02:51.189> sections<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:52.150> look<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.629> little

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
end up with sections that look a little

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.659 
end up with sections that look a little
funny<00:02:53.019> but<00:02:53.650> they're<00:02:53.859> all<00:02:53.980> aligned<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.639> the

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
funny but they're all aligned on the

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.170 
funny but they're all aligned on the
left<00:02:54.969> side<00:02:55.180> that's<00:02:55.659> very<00:02:55.989> important<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.879> next

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
left side that's very important the next

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.559 
left side that's very important the next
part<00:02:58.719> we<00:02:58.840> need<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.189> script<00:03:00.700> part<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.359> the

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
part we need is the script part of the

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.349 
part we need is the script part of the
trigger<00:03:02.079> so<00:03:02.379> we<00:03:02.469> indent<00:03:02.799> again<00:03:03.159> you<00:03:04.090> have<00:03:04.239> the

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
trigger so we indent again you have the

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.140 
trigger so we indent again you have the
script<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:06.609> where<00:03:06.700> we're<00:03:06.819> going<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:06.969> list

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
script this is where we're going to list

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.699 
script this is where we're going to list
all<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.389> commands<00:03:07.719> that<00:03:07.930> happen<00:03:08.230> when<00:03:08.409> we<00:03:08.560> use

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
all the commands that happen when we use

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.259 
all the commands that happen when we use
the<00:03:08.919> click<00:03:09.129> trigger<00:03:11.340> since<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.669> script<00:03:12.879> part

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
the click trigger since the script part

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.119 
the click trigger since the script part
is<00:03:13.359> a<00:03:13.389> list<00:03:13.689> you<00:03:14.319> don't<00:03:14.500> need<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.829> indent

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
is a list you don't need to indent

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.699 
is a list you don't need to indent
they're<00:03:15.519> part<00:03:15.849> of<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.239> script<00:03:16.540> section<00:03:16.780> so

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
they're part of the script section so

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.460 
they're part of the script section so
each<00:03:18.159> command<00:03:18.609> starts<00:03:18.940> with<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.090> -<00:03:19.479> because

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
each command starts with a - because

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.640 
each command starts with a - because
it's<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.859> list<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.959> command<00:03:23.229> we're<00:03:23.349> gonna<00:03:23.440> use

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
it's a list the command we're gonna use

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.890 
it's a list the command we're gonna use
now<00:03:23.829> is<00:03:24.040> going<00:03:24.159> to<00:03:24.220> be<00:03:24.280> chat<00:03:24.659> and<00:03:25.659> its

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
now is going to be chat and its

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.059 
now is going to be chat and its
arguments<00:03:26.349> we're<00:03:26.439> going<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.650> give<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.889> is

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
arguments we're going to give it is

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.479 
arguments we're going to give it is
hello<00:03:27.579> world<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:32.109> you<00:03:32.290> see<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.620> surrounded<00:03:33.400> it

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
hello world and you see I surrounded it

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.849 
hello world and you see I surrounded it
with<00:03:33.519> double<00:03:33.849> quotes<00:03:33.879> I<00:03:34.419> suggest<00:03:35.169> using

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
with double quotes I suggest using

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.949 
with double quotes I suggest using
double<00:03:36.280> floats<00:03:36.519> whenever<00:03:36.819> you're<00:03:37.120> doing

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
double floats whenever you're doing

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.649 
double floats whenever you're doing
chatting<00:03:38.409> and<00:03:38.939> narrating<00:03:39.939> and<00:03:40.150> things<00:03:40.449> were

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
chatting and narrating and things were

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.289 
chatting and narrating and things were
using<00:03:41.259> a<00:03:41.319> long<00:03:41.530> strings<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.909> that<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.150> can

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
using a long strings so that you can

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.580 
using a long strings so that you can
include<00:03:43.689> single<00:03:44.109> quotes<00:03:44.349> inside<00:03:44.769> of<00:03:44.949> them

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
include single quotes inside of them

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.050 
include single quotes inside of them
just<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.829> can<00:03:48.009> see<00:03:48.669> a<00:03:48.699> couple<00:03:49.000> more

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
just so you can see a couple more

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.390 
just so you can see a couple more
commands<00:03:49.540> we'll<00:03:49.780> use<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.959> weak<00:03:50.259> command<00:03:50.680> which

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
commands we'll use a weak command which

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.920 
commands we'll use a weak command which
will<00:03:51.519> cause<00:03:51.699> it<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:51.849> wait<00:03:52.120> for<00:03:52.329> one<00:03:52.479> second

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
will cause it to wait for one second

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.679 
will cause it to wait for one second
after<00:03:53.049> saying<00:03:53.379> hello<00:03:53.620> world<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.220> then<00:03:55.120> we<00:03:55.540> use

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
after saying hello world and then we use

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:03.679 
after saying hello world and then we use
another<00:03:56.019> check<00:03:56.319> command<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.099> it'll<00:03:57.489> say<00:03:57.870> my

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.270 

now<00:04:04.689> that's<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.109> replaceable<00:04:05.590> tag<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.189> what

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
now that's a replaceable tag and what

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.129 
now that's a replaceable tag and what
happens<00:04:06.609> is<00:04:06.729> when<00:04:06.879> the<00:04:06.970> script<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.930> executed

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
happens is when the script is executed

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.379 
happens is when the script is executed
it'll<00:04:08.919> replace<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.609> with<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:09.970> name<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.269> the

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
it'll replace that with the name of the

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.520 
it'll replace that with the name of the
NPC<00:04:12.449> we'll<00:04:13.449> have<00:04:13.629> probably<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:14.079> whole<00:04:14.229> video

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
NPC we'll have probably a whole video

your scripts but for this we're just I'm
just<00:04:46.560> showing<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.330> two<00:04:48.570> parts<00:04:48.900> of

just showing you the the two parts of
your<00:04:49.200> first<00:04:49.410> example<00:04:49.920> so<00:04:50.670> in<00:04:50.820> your<00:04:51.120> assignment

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
your first example so in your assignment

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.160 
your first example so in your assignment
script<00:04:52.190> is<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.430> want<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.670> be<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.240> type<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:54.840> the

sign is assignment just like the other

sign is assignment just like the other
one<00:05:00.390> was<00:05:00.480> indirect<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:01.080> one's<00:05:01.260> an

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
assignment script this one you're going

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.910 
assignment script this one you're going
to<00:05:05.040> be<00:05:05.160> assigning<00:05:05.670> interact<00:05:06.270> scripts<00:05:06.960> which

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
to be assigning interact scripts which

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.520 
to be assigning interact scripts which
you'll<00:05:08.130> see<00:05:08.450> you<00:05:09.450> mean<00:05:09.660> Lee<00:05:09.930> this<00:05:10.080> is<00:05:10.230> in<00:05:10.440> your

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
you'll see you mean Lee this is in your

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.850 
you'll see you mean Lee this is in your
act<00:05:10.710> script<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:12.570> is<00:05:12.720> another<00:05:12.960> list<00:05:13.290> and<00:05:13.710> all

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
act script this is another list and all

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.220 
act script this is another list and all
we're<00:05:14.010> gonna<00:05:14.130> do<00:05:14.430> is<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:15.300> sign<00:05:17.030> your<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.480> script

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
we're gonna do is a sign your the script

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.030 
we're gonna do is a sign your the script
we're<00:05:19.410> making<00:05:19.710> in<00:05:19.860> that<00:05:19.980> case<00:05:20.160> example<00:05:20.640> script

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
we're making in that case example script

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.620 
we're making in that case example script
you'll<00:05:23.040> see<00:05:23.250> I<00:05:23.280> put<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.520> 10<00:05:23.820> here<00:05:23.850> that's<00:05:24.420> the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
you'll see I put a 10 here that's the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.420 
you'll see I put a 10 here that's the
script<00:05:24.900> priority<00:05:25.470> which<00:05:25.740> isn't<00:05:25.920> relevant

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
script priority which isn't relevant

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.670 
script priority which isn't relevant
right<00:05:26.580> now<00:05:27.140> but<00:05:28.140> when<00:05:28.290> you're<00:05:28.380> assigning

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
right now but when you're assigning

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.320 
right now but when you're assigning
multiple<00:05:29.220> interact<00:05:29.730> scripts<00:05:30.030> they<00:05:30.180> already

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
multiple interact scripts they already

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.160 
multiple interact scripts they already
need<00:05:30.540> a<00:05:30.600> priority<00:05:31.110> later<00:05:31.320> on<00:05:31.910> so<00:05:32.910> that's<00:05:33.690> all

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
need a priority later on so that's all

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.010 
need a priority later on so that's all
there<00:05:34.470> is<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:35.300> just<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.419> go<00:05:36.600> over<00:05:36.810> what<00:05:36.900> we

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
there is to it just to go over what we

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.290 
there is to it just to go over what we
just<00:05:37.140> did<00:05:37.320> so<00:05:37.650> that<00:05:37.860> in<00:05:38.760> confusion

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
just did so that in confusion

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.570 
just did so that in confusion
hopefully<00:05:39.630> we<00:05:39.720> clear<00:05:39.960> it<00:05:40.050> up<00:05:40.169> this<00:05:40.980> is<00:05:41.250> the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
hopefully we clear it up this is the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.430 
hopefully we clear it up this is the
this<00:05:41.940> is<00:05:42.090> one<00:05:42.300> script<00:05:42.600> it's<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:42.900> assignment

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
this is one script it's the assignment

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.650 
this is one script it's the assignment
script<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:43.890> assigns<00:05:44.250> this<00:05:44.730> interact<00:05:45.270> script

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
script it assigns this interact script

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.630 
script it assigns this interact script
to<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.900> NPC<00:05:46.230> and<00:05:48.260> it<00:05:49.260> is<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.800> very<00:05:50.100> small<00:05:50.310> one<00:05:50.520> it

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
to the NPC and it is a very small one it

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.490 
to the NPC and it is a very small one it
has<00:05:50.730> two<00:05:50.910> parts<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.419> type<00:05:51.630> and<00:05:51.930> then<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.290> list

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
has two parts the type and then the list

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.550 
has two parts the type and then the list
of<00:05:52.650> interact<00:05:52.980> scripts<00:05:53.220> at<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.400> designing

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
of interact scripts at the designing

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.530 
of interact scripts at the designing
they're<00:05:55.560> slightly<00:05:55.890> more<00:05:56.220> elaborate<00:05:56.669> later<00:05:57.240> on

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
they're slightly more elaborate later on

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.240 
they're slightly more elaborate later on
give<00:05:57.990> you<00:05:58.110> some<00:05:58.290> more<00:05:58.440> information<00:05:58.560> on<00:05:59.070> those

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
give you some more information on those

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.830 
give you some more information on those
there's<00:05:59.490> actions<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.210> things<00:06:00.300> involved<00:06:00.780> in

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
there's actions and things involved in

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.320 
there's actions and things involved in
assignment<00:06:01.320> strips<00:06:01.560> and<00:06:01.890> then<00:06:02.850> your<00:06:02.970> interact

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
assignment strips and then your interact

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.550 
assignment strips and then your interact
script<00:06:03.570> is<00:06:03.660> another<00:06:03.840> very<00:06:04.050> simple<00:06:04.410> script

it's all in one step with the click
trigger<00:06:07.050> that<00:06:07.260> activates<00:06:08.130> these<00:06:08.310> three
