show you how our antagonistic muscles
inner<00:01:59.610> legs<00:01:59.880> work<00:02:00.179> so<00:02:00.929> there<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.259> two<00:02:01.470> pairs

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
inner legs work so there are two pairs

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.219 
inner legs work so there are two pairs
of<00:02:02.099> antagonistic<00:02:02.819> muscles<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.660> a<00:02:03.780> human<00:02:04.020> leg

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
of antagonistic muscles in a human leg

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.160 
of antagonistic muscles in a human leg
the<00:02:05.099> first<00:02:05.369> pair<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:06.000> located<00:02:06.539> at<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:06.869> upper

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the first pair is located at the upper

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.070 
the first pair is located at the upper
leg<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.800> it's<00:02:08.550> composed<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> hamstring

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
leg and it's composed of the hamstring

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.520 
leg and it's composed of the hamstring
and<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.530> quadricep<00:02:11.630> while<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.840> second<00:02:13.319> pair

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
and the quadricep while the second pair

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.160 
and the quadricep while the second pair
which<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.130> located<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.970> lower<00:02:15.239> leg<00:02:15.599> is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
which is located at the lower leg is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.160 
which is located at the lower leg is
composed<00:02:16.709> as<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> tibialis<00:02:17.370> anterior<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.390> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
composed as a tibialis anterior and the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.490 
composed as a tibialis anterior and the
gastrocnemius<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.250> soleus<00:02:20.790> or<00:02:21.360> simply<00:02:22.020> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
gastrocnemius and soleus or simply the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.850 
gastrocnemius and soleus or simply the
calves<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.450> when<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.720> hamstring<00:02:25.170> contracts

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
calves so when the hamstring contracts

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.300 
calves so when the hamstring contracts
the<00:02:26.550> quadricep<00:02:27.270> relaxes<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.770> leg<00:02:28.950> tends

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the quadricep relaxes so the leg tends

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.730 
the quadricep relaxes so the leg tends
to<00:02:29.520> bend<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:29.970> knee

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.250 

when<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> quadricep<00:02:34.060> contracts<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
when the quadricep contracts the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.720 
when the quadricep contracts the
hamstring<00:02:35.800> would<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.070> course<00:02:36.250> do<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
hamstring would of course do the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.090 
hamstring would of course do the
opposite<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.450> leg<00:02:38.260> would<00:02:38.470> straighten<00:02:38.770> at

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
opposite and the leg would straighten at

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.660 
opposite and the leg would straighten at
the<00:02:39.220> knee<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:40.420> like<00:02:40.570> this<00:02:44.040> let's<00:02:45.040> move<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.520> to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the knee just like this let's move on to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.600 
the knee just like this let's move on to
the<00:02:45.850> lower<00:02:46.030> leg<00:02:46.300> muscles<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.770> same<00:02:47.980> situation

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the lower leg muscles the same situation

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.340 
the lower leg muscles the same situation
happens<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> upper<00:02:50.170> leg

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
happens just like in the upper leg

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.700 
happens just like in the upper leg
muscles<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> when<00:02:52.210> the<00:02:52.330> calves<00:02:52.540> contract<00:02:53.050> the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
muscles so when the calves contract the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.220 
muscles so when the calves contract the
tibia<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.130> interior<00:02:54.430> would<00:02:54.670> relax<00:02:55.230> making

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
tibia this interior would relax making

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.660 
tibia this interior would relax making
the<00:02:56.350> ankle<00:02:56.710> straight<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.220> other<00:03:00.400> hand

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
the ankle straight on the other hand

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.460 
the ankle straight on the other hand
when<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> tipple<00:03:01.240> is<00:03:01.360> anterior<00:03:01.840> what<00:03:02.050> contract

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
when a tipple is anterior what contract

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.210 
when a tipple is anterior what contract
of<00:03:02.860> course<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.940> calves<00:03:04.210> would<00:03:04.450> relax

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
of course the calves would relax

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.190 
of course the calves would relax
thus<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.400> ankle<00:03:06.670> tends<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.120> bend<00:03:07.330> just<00:03:08.020> like

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
thus the ankle tends to bend just like

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.950 
thus the ankle tends to bend just like
this<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.670> what<00:03:12.880> if<00:03:13.090> our<00:03:13.300> antagonistic

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
this but what if our antagonistic

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.480 
this but what if our antagonistic
muscles<00:03:14.380> do<00:03:14.530> not<00:03:14.560> work<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.070> way<00:03:15.100> they<00:03:15.400> are

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
muscles do not work the way they are

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.780 
muscles do not work the way they are
supposed<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:16.170> hmm<00:03:17.170> perhaps<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.160> situation

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
supposed to hmm perhaps the situation

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:35.429 
supposed to hmm perhaps the situation
would<00:03:18.970> look<00:03:19.180> something<00:03:19.390> like<00:03:19.690> this

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.750 

so<00:03:36.439> if<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.709> would<00:03:36.860> want<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.159> stretch<00:03:37.549> out<00:03:37.700> your

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
so if you would want to stretch out your

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.210 
so if you would want to stretch out your
muscles<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.900> would<00:03:39.049> have<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.290> let<00:03:39.409> gravity<00:03:39.680> do

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
muscles you would have to let gravity do

00:03:40.220 --> 00:04:09.410 
muscles you would have to let gravity do
the<00:03:40.250> job

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.770 

nope<00:04:10.420> I'm<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:11.080> emotional
