00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.379 
video but i think you never could you
know<00:03:21.810> play<00:03:22.530> he<00:03:23.069> was<00:03:23.280> probably<00:03:23.579> on<00:03:23.939> two

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389

think actually the music was good about
Lanza<00:03:32.519> but<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.819> think<00:03:33.090> half<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.750> success
