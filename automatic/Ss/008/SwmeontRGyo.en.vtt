00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.540
 let's count because today the dollar went down 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.540
 as much as it had never happened it began 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 the day to the wheel would change on 11 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.039
 with 30 reached a maximum low of 10 with 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.609
 40 and ended up closing at 10 with 70 to what 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.910
 obeys this phenomenon new friends of the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.969
 government went out to offer dollars 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.070
 cheap batches of two prawns as you 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.710
 they say in the charge referring to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.620
 two hundred thousand dollars to ten with 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.700
 sixty went out to offer the square is 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.309
 so dry today that there are no weights then 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.260
 no financial company had more than two 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 million pesos that were needed 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.820
 to buy this batch they left after 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.180
 to lower it to 10 and 50 as there was 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.030
 buyers and again to 10 with 40 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.039
 finally they were only threats with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.700
 threats from government friendly caves 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.790
 they got 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.010
 up to 10 with 40 since nobody had the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.380
 sufficient liquidity in such a square 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.050
 dry weights after Juan Carlos 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.110
 the vacuum cleaner fabregas as they say to the 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.570
 president of the central bank will draw from 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.660
 circulation so far this year 40 thousand 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.570
 million pesos this equals 15 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.510
 percent of the money that is in the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.450
 prison that happened then for the first time 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.000
 in the year the central bank insect silver 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.520
 the sector 540 million pesos in the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.550
 market and this was a symptom that made 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.150
 that then the blues went up a little bit 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.759
 10 with 70 to end the day 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.430
 another factor of why it came down today 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.610
 the bill as they say in the cargo 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.200
 financial is that many companies 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.509
 they sold less they did not bill what 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.940
 enough to cover the 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.220
 costs and now they have to go out and pay 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.470
 salaries that they did not have another 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.100
 remedy that go out to sell the dollars 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.420
 I had 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.230
 saved and this was another of the why 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.870
 that the dollar until lowered 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.200
 bear in mind that today you pay with 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.110
 card abroad or if you buy a 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.780
 tour package or if you buy dollars 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.170
 for what it is to ask you to travel the dollar 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.680
 tourist that is dating 10 with 80 by 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.800
 first time more expensive than the blues that 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.290
 finished at 10 with 70 that's why what 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.050
 many say is that today the ticket is 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.330
 cheap and you have to take advantage of it always and 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.980
 when I finish the days a little bit 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.319
 above the symptom that hardly 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.160
 next day you can get down from 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.680
 turn and another who went right 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.390
 to the government was to narrow the difference 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.420
 with the dollar med the so-called dollar bag 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.709
 the dollar bag caters in 1 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.069
 percent to the parallel market so 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.230
 so much today the difference 10 with 40 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.780
 term the dollar bag 10 with 70 the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.060
 blues is very difficult is not tempting 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.430
 do this financial bicycle and buy 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.180
 dollars in the stock market and sell them in the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.180
 black market
