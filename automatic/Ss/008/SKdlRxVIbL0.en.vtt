00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.690 

so<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.570> see<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.930> timing<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.740> same<00:03:22.040> but<00:03:22.550> my

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
so you see the timing is the same but my

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.700 
so you see the timing is the same but my
strumming<00:03:23.150> I'm<00:03:23.210> going<00:03:23.450> up<00:03:23.570> down<00:03:23.810> down<00:03:24.230> down<00:03:24.680> up

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:49.440 
strumming I'm going up down down down up
down<00:03:24.920> up<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.520> now<00:03:25.640> I'm<00:03:25.700> switching

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.030 

that's<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.690> mute

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280 

they<00:03:57.849> kind<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.120> thank<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:58.450> up<00:03:58.540> but<00:03:59.050> you<00:03:59.170> want

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290

go<00:04:16.390> back<00:04:16.570> forth

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
go back forth

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.990 
go back forth
so<00:04:17.290> you're<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.470> two<00:04:17.769> beats<00:04:17.980> per<00:04:18.070> quart<00:04:18.459> now

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000
