00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to worry about that honestly this scheme

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.100 
to worry about that honestly this scheme
is<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.000> different<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.539> it's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
is just like so different that it's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.860 
is just like so different that it's
pretty<00:00:46.500> fun<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.860> play<00:00:47.629> trickshotting<00:00:48.629> is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
pretty fun to play trickshotting is

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.049 
pretty fun to play trickshotting is
really<00:00:49.350> difficult<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.250> game<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.850> my

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
really difficult in this game in my

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.490 
really difficult in this game in my
opinion<00:00:51.090> which<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.930> why<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.440> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
opinion which is why I see a lot of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
opinion which is why I see a lot of
death<00:00:52.890> match<00:00:53.660> definite<00:00:54.660> clips<00:00:55.520> but<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.579> still

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
death match definite clips but I still

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.950 
death match definite clips but I still
think<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.090> gonna<00:00:57.180> turn<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> great

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
think it's gonna turn out to be a great

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.740 
think it's gonna turn out to be a great
game<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.410> love<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.730> sniper<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.510> use
