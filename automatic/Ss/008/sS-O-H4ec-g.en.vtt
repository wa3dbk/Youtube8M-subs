00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.030
 today in the wine pairing agreement 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.830
 will see the agreement between two products of 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.970
 mashed even nice wine and chocolate 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.360
 but then does it really work 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.820
 well together chocolate is a mixture 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.000
 of cocoa beans from milk sugar 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.199
 of aromatics it is horrified flavored the 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.850
 most of the time he can take a 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.980
 very wide palette of aral 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.019
 it is also characterized by a taste 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.750
 very strong very powerful it has a texture 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.420
 very thick and more or less bitter 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.489
 the cocoa dosage 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.020
 it will therefore tend to mask the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.010
 most dry wines except from time to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.920
 time on a case by case basis 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.230
 so wine is a factor that 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.700
 do who they support this strength 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.800
 and this power of chocolate and 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.239
 generally it will be brought by the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.969
 presence of residual sugar 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.140
 or alcohol strong enough anyway 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.210
 stronger than dry wines 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.039
 that's why chocolate makes 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.500
 generally good with wine 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.840
 fortified or then spirits the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.969
 fortified wines team banyuls maury 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.299
 rivesaltes still the door to the Portuguese 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:09.409
 or rut an Australian glen muscat 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.329
 but nothing better to illustrate you 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.840
 my purpose only to prepare you a 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.840
 small tasting 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.029
 so we have this wine which is a banyuls 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.279
 it is a wine from south west of France 

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:25.159
 with a grape variety, ie a variety 

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:28.189
 of grapes a dominant of grenache and 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.959
 so we will taste it has aromas of 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.219
 cooked fruit denotes a little bit 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.689
 jams and strawberries and 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:38.299
 raspberries coffee chocolate notes 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.009
 and he will very well agree with this 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.479
 chocolate which is a chocolate nut with 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.479
 a red fruit ganache 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.590
 when we eat we always go 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.560
 start with the wine first then the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.080
 chocolate and actually falling in agreement 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.020
 successful it's an agreement or both 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.610
 products will boost each other 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.340
 so it works very well because 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.650
 that chocolate is going to give is going to give the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.600
 liveliness in wine wine 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.880
 because of its sugar will make chocolate 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.140
 black less bitter and both 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.000
 match very very well in terms 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.320
 aroma 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.490
 in front of so much fun attention to the 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.290
 faith crisis and remember them 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.820
 wine pairing is above all to be 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.820
 creative and have fun
