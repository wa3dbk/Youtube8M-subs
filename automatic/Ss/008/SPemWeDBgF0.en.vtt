00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.450
 And "Challenger" Richard Cutland 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.280
 Know the chariot together 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.010
 Panzer 4 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.240
 Münster Chariot Museum, Germany 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.130
 Welcome to Münster 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.570
 German Chariot Museum for this episode 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.570
 "Know the chariot" 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.690
 Today we will come to know this car deeply. 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.940
 Throughout the Second World War 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.040
 German chariot 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.580
 Backbone 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.580
 Chariot 4 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.800
 Pzkw, IV medium tank 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 German war vehicle with the longest service time in World War II 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 From the beginning of service to the end of the war 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.210
 It is derived in total 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.720
 Many models, this is 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.010
 Respect for its solid design 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.310
 Let it be on the sand 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.680
 Face more massive 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.530
 Armor is thicker 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.470
 More powerful firepower 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.320
 Chariot time 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.830
 Can also play its due strength 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.600
 Introduced today 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.980
 Is the late model 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 Called "Ausführung G" or "G type" 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.190
 From mid 1942 to 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.510
 Renewed chariot in mid 1943 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.130
 A total of production before the replacement 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.380
 Nearly 1,700 vehicles 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.600
 Development 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.630
 On the occasion of the war 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.960
 German chariot troops 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 Mostly equipped 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.280
 No. 1 and No. 2 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.810
 But even at the time, these two chariots 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.680
 It’s just 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.990
 Lightweight chariot for training purposes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.480
 The discerning eye can see 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.840
 They need a full dressup 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.340
 And the dressup plan is early 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 Started in 1935 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.550
 3rd and 4th chariots 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.510
 Is the result of the project 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.820
 The third chariot is made up of 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.750
 Made by Daimler 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.750
 The fourth chariot is handed over to Krupp. 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.270
 From the beginning, two chariots 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.280
 Have different plans for each 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.460
 The role of the 4th chariot 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.760
 In the infantry support mission 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.480
 The lighter No. 3 chariot 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.590
 It is to fight against the enemy armored forces. 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.590
 But when the Germans and Russia 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.950
 More difficult chariots after handing over 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.450
 The whole project has changed immediately 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.870
 Krupp's prototype 4 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.960
 Equipped with a 75 mm short gun 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.120
 Armor is quite thin 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.740
 Put into production in 1937 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.930
 But the actual results on the battlefield 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.130
 Immediately highlighted 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.980
 Requirements for protection 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.490
 So since then 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.520
 The armor of the 4th chariot is constantly being upgraded and therefore since then 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.240
 The armor of the 4th chariot is constantly being upgraded. 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.800
 Sometimes take the steel plate 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.600
 The way 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 Sometimes it is to replace the thicker steel plate 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 put up 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.620
 Chariot 4 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.820
 Manufactured in the traditional way at the time 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.720
 Basically, put a piece of steel 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.620
 Flat welded together 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.940
 And like a turret 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.140
 Some parts 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.220
 Created with a bevel 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.900
 To increase the protection of the chariot 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.620
 The fighting power of the chariot comes from three parts. 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.120
 The engine room 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.200
 Including turret 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.160
 Battle room 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.160
 There is also a cab in front 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.020
 During the service of the G-type chariot 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.640
 Armor in front of the body 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.660
 Has been thickened from the original 15 mm to 50 mm 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.960
 After that 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.560
 Added 30 mm steel plate 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.200
 Increase the thickness to 80 mm 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.480
 Side armor and turret armor 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.400
 Both increased from 20 mm to 30 mm 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.860
 In terms of body size 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.980
 Although the fourth chariot 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.640
 Slightly lower than the Sherman 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.660
 But the volume of the two is similar 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.560
 And its height is higher than the T-34-76 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.300
 But the total length is much the same 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.540
 The 4th chariot weighs 25 metric tons 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.900
 Slightly lighter than T-34-76 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.900
 It uses 12 cylinders 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.520
 V12 Maybach HL120 engine 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.040
 Can output about 300 horsepower 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.920
 When driving on the road 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.400
 Extreme speeds up to 42 km/h 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.500
 Off-road speed is 16 km / h 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.760
 Suspension aspect 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.160
 Throughout production 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.060
 Four bogies on each side 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.820
 All have plate springs 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.380
 And adopt the design of the double wheel 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.000
 Effective weight distribution 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.340
 Also conducive to maintenance 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.650
 Firepower 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.660
 Firepower of the 4th chariot 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.660
 Just like its armor 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.980
 During the entire service period 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.420
 After constant upgrade 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.960
 This chariot 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.280
 Using 75mm Kw.K 40 long gun 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.640
 Chariot gun first firepower 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.760
 The longer the barrel 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.800
 The greater the lethality 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.060
 The length of the barrel is 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.740
 Expressed in multiples of the barrel diameter 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.580
 At the beginning 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.220
 The length of the gun is 43 caliber gun 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.480
 Quickly replaced with a 48-caliber gun 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.220
 Its penetrating power 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.000
 Armor that can pass through 97 mm at a distance of 1000 meters 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.110
 Such firepower 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.230
 Sufficient to fight 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.680
 Before the end of the war 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.120
 All Allied chariots 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.880
 Panzergranate 39 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.840
 Is its main ammunition 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.900
 Secondary firepower 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.360
 It is two MG 34 machine guns. 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.360
 One is coaxial with the main gun 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.900
 The other is in front of the body 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.420
 Shot by the radio 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.940
 Group members can easily access 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.220
 Driving and co-pilot 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.780
 Hatch at the top of the head 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.660
 Can be a radio player 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.440
 And machine gunner 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.540
 The turret where the chariot chief is located 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.400
 There is a dome above 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.740
 Gunner and loader 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.680
 There are hatches on both sides of the turret 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.540
 internal 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.020
 Chariot internal configuration 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.180
 Quite traditional 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.060
 My location is inside the turret 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.120
 Chariot long seat 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.320
 Above is the hatch of the chariot 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.020
 You can see the long tower of the chariot 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.980
 Observation hole 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.720
 The space here is quite small 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.340
 You can imagine 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.160
 When loaded with ammunition 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.760
 How crowded there will be 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.100
 Do your best 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.020
 Before the end of the war 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.700
 Germany has built a total 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.640
 More than 8,000 vehicles 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.120
 Therefore in terms of quantity 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.320
 It became the most important chariot of the German army 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.880
 G-type chariot 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.060
 After the H-type and J-type chariots 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.140
 In armor 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.360
 Have better protection 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.820
 And have a simplified design in production 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.620
 But obviously 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.080
 The ability of the 4th chariot has been pushed to the limit. 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.100
 Most conspicuous additional armor 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.960
 Is steel 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.900
 Body side skirt 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.080
 The role is 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.280
 Let the conical charge of the shell 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.580
 Detonate before hitting the car body 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.820
 This design is not favored by the chariot team members. 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.040
 Because walking in rural areas with poor road conditions 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.860
 These side skirts are easily damaged 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.360
 So you have to work hard to remove them. 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.980
 The fine chassis of the 4th chariot 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.480
 Often used as a chassis for other types of vehicles 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.860
 Self-contained 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.300
 With the German Southern Expedition 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.000
 For example, the 4th Assault Gun (Sturmgeschütz IV) 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.400
 Is the chassis 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.400
 Combine the upper half of the No. 3 assault gun 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.120
 Cheetah 4 destroying chariot 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.200
 After a thorough redesign 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.300
 First, use a 75 mm L48 gun. 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.600
 Then replace the L70 gun on the Leopard. 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.140
 Become an anti-war weapon 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.220
 Because of the excellent features of the 4th chariot 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.800
 Let it be after the war 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.220
 Also Bulgaria and Romania 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.820
 Continue to use 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.560
 Even in 1967 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.560
 In the Six-Day War 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.980
 Also sent to the battlefield by the Syrian Army 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.980
 This is the fourth chariot 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.740
 Precise design 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.820
 And carefully crafted chariots 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.820
 Through continuous development 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.280
 Even other models of chariots 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.920
 Have retired from the battlefield 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.020
 It can still smash the battlefield 

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.200
 Actually 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.180
 It should have been used by other chariots 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.000
 To replace 

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.660
 But due to the pressure of war 

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.680
 Plus the German late chariot 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.300
 There is a problem of not getting green 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.540
 Let it bite 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.400
 And become a fighter in all vehicles 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.480
 The only outbreak from war 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.100
 Stick to the end of the war 

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.560
 Chariot
