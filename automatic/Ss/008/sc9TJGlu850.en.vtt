00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
 victory is in our hands 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.789
 it's easy to apply the law 56 minutes 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.789
 and if you want to set it up right away no problem 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.130
 we learn about what you think authentic products this year 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.699

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.060

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.870
 a man 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.870
 a motorcycle 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.640
 the Argentinian took a nice box and in addition no luck helicopter was 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 filming and his services 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.970
 only eads says manaudou have taken the start this year it's not already left 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.030
 more than five and turnover falling to 4% with our soul 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.110
 this is a disease is a motorcycle debate is normally early 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.340
 French newspapers for his canteens 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.370
 our whole life is here 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 the bike and by the bar 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.500
 we all have in our misfortune 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.970
 spare parts 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.290
 in 2000 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.140
 the tent the sleeping bag 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.320
 everything that may be needed for life after the race attracts so if in 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.090
 this manna at this time 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.060
 why am I the dakar 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.630
 for the mythical who dreams 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.420
 foremost for the victim 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 then that's how I wanted to go to war with dams 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.260
 and at any time we find ourselves between us the friends of the motorcycle males and 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.579
 even very late at night it's moving for us 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.409
 sunday we are expecting a mission too which arrive late we 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.409
 fight to get ready all night if necessary 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.769
 bakary i think the dakar is a real adventure 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.519
 it's different from all the other races 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.979
 in fact I would say it's not a race, it's an adventure with 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.699
 yourself 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.689
 the race still had 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.689
 mentally and physically 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.509
 that's why I'm here
