00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hey guys this game cheat 13 here and did

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.370 
hey guys this game cheat 13 here and did
you<00:00:02.520> guys<00:00:02.639> know<00:00:03.000> at<00:00:03.240> one<00:00:03.449> point<00:00:03.480> halo<00:00:04.080> 2

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
you guys know at one point halo 2

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.589 
you guys know at one point halo 2
actually<00:00:04.620> had<00:00:04.950> sprint<00:00:08.269> now<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> lot<00:00:09.480> of

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
actually had sprint now a lot of

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.270 
actually had sprint now a lot of
old-school<00:00:09.929> halo<00:00:10.380> 2<00:00:10.559> modders<00:00:10.950> will<00:00:11.130> think

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
old-school halo 2 modders will think

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.799 
old-school halo 2 modders will think
this<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.519> pretty<00:00:11.700> old<00:00:11.940> but<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.269> really<00:00:12.540> haven't

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
this is pretty old but I really haven't

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.330 
this is pretty old but I really haven't
seen<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.049> post<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.469> anywhere<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.009> figured

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
seen this post in anywhere so I figured

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.519 
seen this post in anywhere so I figured
I'd<00:00:14.429> talk<00:00:14.610> about<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.809> anyway<00:00:16.109> if<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.379> look

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
I'd talk about it so anyway if you look

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.349 
I'd talk about it so anyway if you look
in<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> halo<00:00:16.890> 2<00:00:17.070> tag<00:00:17.369> files<00:00:17.670> you'll<00:00:18.029> find<00:00:18.240> that

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
in the halo 2 tag files you'll find that

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.790 
in the halo 2 tag files you'll find that
some<00:00:18.600> weapons<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.199> first-person

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
some weapons have first-person

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.620 
some weapons have first-person
animations<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.520> sprinting<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> game

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
animations for sprinting and in the game

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.660 
animations for sprinting and in the game
Global's<00:00:22.050> tag<00:00:22.289> you'll<00:00:22.529> also<00:00:22.650> find<00:00:22.980> values<00:00:23.460> for

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
Global's tag you'll also find values for

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.429 
Global's tag you'll also find values for
sprinting<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.930> looks<00:00:25.080> like<00:00:25.199> they<00:00:25.350> were

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
sprinting what it looks like they were

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.839 
sprinting what it looks like they were
going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> do<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.160> walk<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.670> around

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
going to do is have you walk for around

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.640 
going to do is have you walk for around
4<00:00:27.180> seconds<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:27.930> sprinting<00:00:28.380> will<00:00:28.500> just

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
4 seconds and then sprinting will just

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650 
4 seconds and then sprinting will just
kick<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:28.980> if<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.189> kept<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.519> moving<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.630> I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
kick in if you kept on moving now I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.759 
kick in if you kept on moving now I
don't<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> function<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.529> sprint

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
don't know what the function for sprint

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.049 
don't know what the function for sprint
still<00:00:31.949> exists<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.640> did<00:00:32.700> was<00:00:32.880> just

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
still exists so what I did was just

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
still exists so what I did was just
fought<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> first-person<00:00:33.690> animation<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
fought the first-person animation then I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.920 
fought the first-person animation then I
raised<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> walking<00:00:35.940> speed<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.480> lowered<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
raised the walking speed and lowered the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.510 
raised the walking speed and lowered the
acceleration<00:00:37.559> rate<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.860> walking<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
acceleration rate I'm walking so it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.940 
acceleration rate I'm walking so it
looks<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.820> you're<00:00:38.969> leading<00:00:39.239> up<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.510> sprint

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
looks like you're leading up to a sprint

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.229 
looks like you're leading up to a sprint
so<00:00:40.950> you're<00:00:41.070> probably<00:00:41.219> wondering<00:00:41.850> why<00:00:42.059> was

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
so you're probably wondering why was

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
so you're probably wondering why was
this<00:00:42.390> cut<00:00:42.629> well<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.230> don't<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.250> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
this cut well I don't really know so I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.220 
this cut well I don't really know so I
asked<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> art<00:00:44.820> director<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.300> Halo<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.750> Marcus

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
asked the art director of Halo to Marcus

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.350 
asked the art director of Halo to Marcus
Leto<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.829> he<00:00:47.460> said<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> was<00:00:48.000> cut<00:00:48.210> for

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
Leto and he said that it was cut for

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.970 
Leto and he said that it was cut for
pacing<00:00:48.750> issues<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.440> only<00:00:49.590> released

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
pacing issues and it was only released

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
pacing issues and it was only released
in<00:00:50.160> prototype<00:00:50.610> stages<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.449> explain

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
in prototype stages which would explain

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
in prototype stages which would explain
why<00:00:51.750> most<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> weapons<00:00:52.590> newly<00:00:52.920> introduced

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
why most of the weapons newly introduced

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.770 
why most of the weapons newly introduced
in<00:00:53.460> Halo<00:00:53.610> 2<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.329> any<00:00:54.480> sprint

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
in Halo 2 don't have any sprint

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660 
in Halo 2 don't have any sprint
animation<00:00:55.289> also<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.250> first-person

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
animation also the first-person

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.490 
animation also the first-person
animations<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> elites<00:00:57.899> don't<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.350> any

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
animations for the elites don't have any

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.369 
animations for the elites don't have any
sprint<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.750> alright<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.899> now<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.260> move

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
sprint at all alright so now we can move

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.689 
sprint at all alright so now we can move
on<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.859> show<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.070> guys<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> sprint

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
on and I can show you guys the sprint

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
on and I can show you guys the sprint
animations<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.420> each<00:01:03.570> weapon<00:01:03.960> we'll<00:01:04.290> start

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
animations for each weapon we'll start

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.170 
animations for each weapon we'll start
with<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> battle<00:01:04.949> rifle<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
with the battle rifle as you can see the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.730 
with the battle rifle as you can see the
animations<00:01:06.689> are<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> jumping<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.619> little

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
animations are kind of jumping a little

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
animations are kind of jumping a little
bit<00:01:07.979> choppy<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.640> mean<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.060> should<00:01:09.240> be

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
bit choppy I mean that should be

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.820 
bit choppy I mean that should be
expected<00:01:09.689> since<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.200> were<00:01:10.260> prototype

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
expected since they were prototype

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.690 
expected since they were prototype
animations

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
animations

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.100 
animations
there's<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:12.479> much<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.840> say<00:01:12.990> about

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
there's not really much to say about

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.390 
there's not really much to say about
these<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.560> I'm<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> slide<00:01:14.220> through

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
these so I'm just going to slide through

00:01:14.400 --> 00:02:00.929 
these so I'm just going to slide through
the<00:01:14.520> different<00:01:14.820> animations

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:17.350 

here<00:02:01.939> we<00:02:02.030> go<00:02:02.180> here<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.450> go<00:02:02.570> now

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:31.710 

Canobie<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.570> advancing

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:59.760 

our<00:02:32.720> quotas<00:02:33.560> on

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.720 

so<00:03:00.770> those<00:03:00.920> are<00:03:01.040> kind<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.280> cool<00:03:01.340> but<00:03:01.640> my

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
so those are kind of cool but my

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.340 
so those are kind of cool but my
favorite<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.150> probably<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.600> dual<00:03:02.840> SMG

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
favorite is probably the dual SMG

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.040 
favorite is probably the dual SMG
animation<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.330> looks<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.630> if<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.840> try<00:03:05.959> to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
animation so it looks like if you try to

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.320 
animation so it looks like if you try to
do<00:03:06.260> wheel<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.680> SMGs<00:03:07.310> then<00:03:07.640> sprint<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.240> was

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
do wheel to SMGs then sprint it was

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.880 
do wheel to SMGs then sprint it was
going<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.510> drop<00:03:08.750> one<00:03:09.020> or<00:03:09.230> both<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.410> them<00:03:09.680> and

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
going to drop one or both of them and

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.280 
going to drop one or both of them and
then<00:03:10.670> proceeded<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.000> flip<00:03:11.270> you<00:03:11.390> off<00:03:11.420> I'm

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
then proceeded to flip you off I'm

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.660 
then proceeded to flip you off I'm
pretty<00:03:12.530> sure<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.800> middle<00:03:13.070> finger<00:03:13.100> was<00:03:13.520> just

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
pretty sure that middle finger was just

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.190 
pretty sure that middle finger was just
a<00:03:13.760> joke<00:03:13.940> one<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.300> animators<00:03:14.810> put<00:03:15.050> in

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
a joke one of the animators put in

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.390 
a joke one of the animators put in
although<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.740> would<00:03:15.830> have<00:03:15.860> been<00:03:16.040> pretty<00:03:16.190> fun

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
although it would have been pretty fun

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.800 
although it would have been pretty fun
to<00:03:16.520> flip<00:03:16.700> people<00:03:16.820> often<00:03:17.180> matchmaking<00:03:17.600> when

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
to flip people often matchmaking when

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.220 
to flip people often matchmaking when
they<00:03:17.900> take<00:03:18.050> your<00:03:18.170> sniper<00:03:18.440> rifle<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:21.110> that's

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
they take your sniper rifle so that's

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.690 
they take your sniper rifle so that's
pretty<00:03:21.380> much<00:03:21.530> all<00:03:21.680> like<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.920> fine<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.280> havel<00:03:22.550> to

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
pretty much all like a fine on havel to

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.220 
pretty much all like a fine on havel to
sprint<00:03:23.030> if<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.270> find<00:03:23.540> anything<00:03:23.750> else<00:03:24.020> I'll

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
sprint if I find anything else I'll
