slash wait and then you put the time of

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.530 
slash wait and then you put the time of
the<00:01:04.019> skill<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.890> skill<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:06.390> most

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
of my combat skills it is about two

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.300 
of my combat skills it is about two
point<00:01:09.180> four<00:01:09.420> eight<00:01:09.600> two<00:01:09.810> point<00:01:10.049> four<00:01:10.290> nine<00:01:10.320> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
point four eight two point four nine so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.770 
point four eight two point four nine so
you<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> put<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.970> about<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> second<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:12.720> two

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you want to put it about a second or two

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.859 
you want to put it about a second or two
above<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> actual<00:01:14.520> weight<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.939> just

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
above what the actual weight is just

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.060 
above what the actual weight is just
because<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> seems<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> few<00:01:16.920> issues

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
so as you can see you can pretty much

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.270 
so as you can see you can pretty much
and<00:02:07.210> as<00:02:07.299> you<00:02:07.450> doing<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:07.990> can<00:02:08.140> also<00:02:08.319> tap

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and as you doing that you can also tap

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.339 
and as you doing that you can also tap
all<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.489> skills<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.899> in<00:02:11.709> between<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.790> macro

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
all the skills so in between the macro

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.690 
all the skills so in between the macro
actually<00:02:14.349> this<00:02:14.530> game<00:02:14.890> does<00:02:15.130> not<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.400> fraps

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
actually this game does not like fraps

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.120 
actually this game does not like fraps
so<00:02:16.060> it's<00:02:16.900> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.230> hard<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.800> might<00:02:17.980> look

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
so it's going to be hard it might look

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.290 
so it's going to be hard it might look
lagging<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:18.790> not<00:02:19.000> when<00:02:19.180> you're

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
lagging but it's not when you're

lagging but it's not when you're
actually<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.630> game<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.410> fraps<00:02:20.709> messing

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130
