00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.620
 a day today with the mail I took new 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.499
 I suggest to see the package 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.059
 will be the same immediately that you are here sending 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:18.330
 there is everything for design and build 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:19.800
 nails low weight about 100 grams i 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.460
 I understand that there are 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 acrylic powder three pieces of white 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:40.610
 transparent and pink well yes I was right 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:45.870
 they have real volume because first 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:49.620
 which they were by volume very 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.739
 it turned out to be small 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.739
 All phases are actually acrylic powder 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.800
 It was in a jar about here so much 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.300
 that is, here it is a small amount 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.710
 probably a gram of a family can 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.719
 even less written here 30 grams 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.149
 let's see how it fits 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.159
 reality is not reality 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:20.539
 at least managed just because the tip 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:26.119
 little knife oh yes here is more here but 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.119
 Christmas trees-stick is not 30 grams ok 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:40.700
 until the world more than act in jars 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 who were first so what was the matter 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:56.360
 did not understand not poured saved on me and 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:40.350
 here save further here pictures 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.560
 there were slightly other colors there were two 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.120
 Whites because of this, I decided the daily 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.650
 make this order what is there 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.299
 such nice shades 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.450
 In general , these colors are much better than 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.720
 those paints that I bought in the store and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.980
 they are cheaper i don't know maybe u 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.170
 I stayed some 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:12.220
 but did the little one buy the very first 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:21.900
 then I will show these colors at all 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:21.900
 It does not cost further here with Lena and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:42.340
 it was a sale therefore learned 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:45.480
 very very cheap maybe three 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.139
 with half a maximum of 4 dollars for these 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.139
 wonderful jars 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.430
 separately show what it is 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.900
 it remains to buy gel paint 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.900
 to translate 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.640
 such 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.210
 hide yourself 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:57.900
 slightly opened by sight 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.410
 will lead the gel 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.930
 less saturated but still 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:09.180
 have to overlap the nail two layers 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:17.490
 Here again, I do not remember the colors 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:19.560
 Any allocation such familiar here 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.880
 such a set do not remember the taste is worth the number 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:34.760
 for rubles 900 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:38.539
 but he did not get maybe on it 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.500
 asset prices products for now finish 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.500
 thank you all for watching
