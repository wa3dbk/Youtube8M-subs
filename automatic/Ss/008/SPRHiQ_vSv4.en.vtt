00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
tutorial and what is a motherboard this

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.320 
tutorial and what is a motherboard this
is<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.029> picture<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.449> a<00:00:15.719> motherboard

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
is a picture of a motherboard

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.480 
is a picture of a motherboard
motherboard<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.510> basically<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.199> foundation

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
motherboard is basically the foundation

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.630 
motherboard is basically the foundation
that<00:00:20.490> your<00:00:20.670> computer<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.359> built<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:22.640> this

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
that your computer is built on this

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.359 
that your computer is built on this
right<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.329> the<00:00:24.869> socket<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.740> your<00:00:25.949> central

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
right here is the socket or your central

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.029 
right here is the socket or your central

processing unit or CPU gets plugged in
these<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:30.060> expansion<00:00:30.720> slots<00:00:31.019> where<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> can

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
these are expansion slots where you can

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.430 
these are expansion slots where you can
put<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.669> cards<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.720> will<00:00:33.900> give<00:00:34.260> your

put in cards that will give your

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.780 
put in cards that will give your
computer<00:00:34.680> other<00:00:35.100> functions<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.420> very<00:00:36.720> early

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
computer other functions the very early

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.980 
computer other functions the very early
motherboards<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.030> here's<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.660> from

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990 
motherboards and here's one from

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.980 
motherboards and here's one from
Commodore<00:00:40.830> from<00:00:41.070> 1982<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.360> same<00:00:42.600> year<00:00:42.810> the

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
Commodore from 1982 the same year the

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.760 
Commodore from 1982 the same year the
personal<00:00:43.650> computer<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.100> released<00:00:44.520> by<00:00:44.700> IBM

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
personal computer was released by IBM

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.260 
personal computer was released by IBM
motherboards<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.920> printed<00:00:47.370> circuit<00:00:47.550> board<00:00:47.970> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
motherboards a printed circuit board so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.760 
motherboards a printed circuit board so
you<00:00:48.330> can<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.630> the<00:00:48.750> printed<00:00:49.020> circuits<00:00:49.470> on<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you can see the printed circuits on it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.100 
you can see the printed circuits on it
you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.130> see<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.490> little<00:00:50.760> chips<00:00:51.090> here's<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you can see some little chips here's the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.230 
you can see some little chips here's the
process<00:00:52.530> he<00:00:52.650> needed<00:00:52.920> over<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:54.120> it's

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
process he needed over here but it's

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.430 
process he needed over here but it's
really<00:00:54.420> very<00:00:54.780> simple

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
really very simple

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.860 
really very simple
and<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.950> early<00:00:56.220> motherboards<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.360> had<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and the early motherboards you had to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.550 
and the early motherboards you had to
install<00:00:58.860> all<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.150> facilities<00:01:01.080> for

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
install all of the facilities for

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.800 
install all of the facilities for
peripherals<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.160> floppy<00:01:02.700> disks<00:01:03.150> hard<00:01:03.420> disks

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
peripherals like floppy disks hard disks

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.399 
peripherals like floppy disks hard disks
and<00:01:03.930> everything<00:01:04.290> else<00:01:04.439> sound<00:01:05.250> graphics<00:01:06.409> if

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and everything else sound graphics if

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.410 
and everything else sound graphics if
you<00:01:07.530> look<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.979> motherboard<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.180> 10

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you look at a motherboard from just 10

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.020 
you look at a motherboard from just 10
years<00:01:09.659> later<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.110> 1992<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.730> see<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
years later in 1992 you can see that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.670 
years later in 1992 you can see that
there's<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.450> more<00:01:12.480> going<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.409> there's

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
there's a lot more going on here there's

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.810 
there's a lot more going on here there's
more<00:01:13.920> capacitors<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> resistors<00:01:15.020> more<00:01:16.020> chips

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
more capacitors and resistors more chips

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.120 
more capacitors and resistors more chips
bigger<00:01:17.820> processor<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.440> thing<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.010> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
bigger processor the thing is is that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.270 
bigger processor the thing is is that
today's<00:01:20.460> motherboards<00:01:21.680> take<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> whole

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
today's motherboards take on a whole

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.330 
today's motherboards take on a whole
range<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:24.060> functions<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:25.050> providing<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
range of functions by providing the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.800 
range of functions by providing the
sound<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.420> graphics<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:29.390> drivers<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
sound the graphics the drivers for the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.280 
sound the graphics the drivers for the
hard<00:01:31.440> drive<00:01:31.560> floppy<00:01:32.370> drive<00:01:32.820> DVD<00:01:33.270> drives<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
hard drive floppy drive DVD drives and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.850 
hard drive floppy drive DVD drives and
lots<00:01:34.470> more

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
lots more

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.440 
lots more
so<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.030> motherboard<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.890> computer<00:01:38.370> is<00:01:38.580> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
so the motherboard of a computer is the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.180 
so the motherboard of a computer is the
basis<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.409> foundation<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:43.010> everything<00:01:44.010> else

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
basis the foundation and everything else

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.330 
basis the foundation and everything else
that<00:01:44.790> goes<00:01:44.850> into<00:01:45.890> what<00:01:46.890> makes<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.310> your

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that goes into what makes up your

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.590 
that goes into what makes up your
computer<00:01:48.740> rests<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.670> installed<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.330> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
computer rests and is installed on that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.859 
computer rests and is installed on that
motherboard<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> that's<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:54.180> motherboard<00:01:54.510> and

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
motherboard so that's a motherboard and

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.130 
motherboard so that's a motherboard and
that's<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.979> it
