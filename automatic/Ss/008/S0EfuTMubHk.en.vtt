 most of the jedi 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.460
 to enter the planet tgv schedules and booking chris service 

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.220
 traffic information 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.240
 and geolocation that by the menu or simply by a direct access

 on the homepage ap 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.150
 exactly 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.480
 this client consults her e-mail and decides to respond to 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.130
 a mail 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.720
 she will be able to enjoy full internet access her request to take the path 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.870
 main ground-to-board links ie from the computer to the wifi antenna 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.090
 travelers placed in the false ceiling of the car then to the switches 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.640
 associated networks 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.030
 to the neighboring car through the radio antennas via a link 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.620
 ethernet along the car to the car of the embedded servers and the 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.280
 antenna globe 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.880
 from the satellite antenna on the roof of the prostate train and the stationary idiot 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.120
 then the satellite club 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.890
 from there the training is moving towards the internet access platform on 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.290
 the pedals went to the addressee who sent his acknowledgment of 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 receiving by the reverse path 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.530
 those who have meanwhile seems to be interested in geolocation 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.720
 of a click the request is processed by the embedded servers that are 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.760
 permanently powered by gps satellites 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.420
 the servers calculates positioning and the speed of the ream it returns the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.440
 computer training 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.860
 of course the screen will then display the path map the positioning of the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.880
 rowing and speed we can find along the route information about 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.100
 this same card 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.950
 after working a while a little distraction 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.270

 in this case as for the news and videos she will be able to enjoy 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.880
 directly from the portal's richness the demand being not fully addressed 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.099
 locally the crossing points are the same 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.799
 the wifi passenger antenna 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.159
 the network switch the antennas into radio 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.259
 from the eternal license 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.259
 like that up to embedded servers 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.149
 the available games are regularly updated to 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.149
 distance seamlessly for customers 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.569
 on his side surfing the portal the customer discovers a news

 satellite on the provider's site 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.379
 the train then enters a tunnel no problem the system adapts 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.030
 automatically and the ground-to-board link switches to the wi-fi network of the tunnel 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.629
 the signal is then transmitted by the terrestrial network to the platform 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.519
 access to the internet which keeps the user on the site of 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.409
 booking 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.219
 at the exit of the tunnel the dedicated acknowledgment of receipt is then returned 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.569
 another traveler by the saw on the ground not priority the satellite 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.349
 m

 this new portal of internet access services 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.139
 it is mobility if the tgv
