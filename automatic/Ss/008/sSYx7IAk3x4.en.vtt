00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.790 

I<00:02:23.840> think<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.410> best<00:02:25.530> we'll

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
I think I like this one the best we'll

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.360 
I think I like this one the best we'll
stick<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:31.560> laggy<00:02:31.860> here<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.250> there

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
stick to it little laggy here and there

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.090 
stick to it little laggy here and there
but<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:32.850> beta<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.540> what<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.870> cool<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.380> it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
but it is a beta and what is cool is it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.910 
but it is a beta and what is cool is it
also<00:02:38.520> works<00:02:38.850> with<00:02:40.310> 512<00:02:41.480> megabyte<00:02:42.480> devices<00:02:42.990> so

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
also works with 512 megabyte devices so
