limited articulation in the arms because

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.020 
limited articulation in the arms because

time<00:05:01.670> I<00:05:01.820> forgot<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.360> split<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.840> tail<00:05:03.560> over

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
time I forgot to split the tail over

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.710 
time I forgot to split the tail over
here<00:05:03.920> for<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.310> back<00:05:04.490> does<00:05:05.150> give<00:05:05.360> it<00:05:05.480> a<00:05:05.540> little

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
here for the back does give it a little

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.800 
here for the back does give it a little
extra<00:05:05.900> support<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:07.460> see<00:05:08.120> has<00:05:08.630> this

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
extra support and see has this

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.490 
extra support and see has this
weird-looking<00:05:10.060> ankle<00:05:11.060> joint<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:12.260> knee

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
weird-looking ankle joint and the knee

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.680 
weird-looking ankle joint and the knee
is<00:05:12.860> about<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.490> boat's<00:05:13.670> articulated<00:05:14.330> but<00:05:14.420> even

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
is about the boat's articulated but even

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.070 
is about the boat's articulated but even
that<00:05:14.840> doesn't<00:05:15.260> move<00:05:15.350> that<00:05:15.560> much<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:17.750> I<00:05:18.020> don't

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
that doesn't move that much so I don't

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.030 
that doesn't move that much so I don't
like<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.500> design<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:19.220> really<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:19.880> mean<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:21.710> is
