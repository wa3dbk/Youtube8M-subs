00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.049
 will show you how to make a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.069
 paper horse so first of all he 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.569
 you need a sheet a4 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.400
 so it will turn into squares 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.320
 in you go foot of that sense there and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.969
 you go to cut the end that exceeds at 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.889
 chisel if possible since it will be more 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.179
 aesthetic later so then he 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.070
 will always have the share of the summit more 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.400
 late so here we go we get a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.869
 square and we're going to fold it in half 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 then learns the brave foot for 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.800
 to have the traces of the folds hop here at 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.330
 simply toes 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.689
 now you foot in the direction 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.149
 vertical will have a cup and that's it my 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.340
 door since it's a square that's the same 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.550
 dimension everywhere so here we get 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.489
 this now we have to flap it the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.680
 right down hop on return 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.250
 do the same thing 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.399
 here you open at best I opened the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.260
 middle here is here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.800
 and then you get a square that is 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.489
 more stable 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.230
 here to train the horse you need 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.350
 the tail and the head so we will form the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.060
 grid is right away you need everything 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.970
 just the end that goes over there 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:16.070
 can open it will bend it with sense 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:20.939
 rain so a hundred times here so voila 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.080
 you do the same thing to the left and 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.250
 you do the same thing behind 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:33.140
 it's super simple for now and 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.479
 now you get this now 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.750
 you have to open it and you have to cut it 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 the butter here to make the legs 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.799
 so here in the middle up here 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.689
 so we will do it we go 39.6 high and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.000
 we will discover it right if 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.710
 possible to form equal pasta 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.189
 so you cut it up and then after 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.010
 you can find 35 to the measurements and 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.050
 then here 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.230
 here you have your success so no 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.190
 we do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:17.160
 simply hop 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:18.530
 take your scissors so we also resume 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.250
 measures 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.820
 I was almost and here you are now 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.920
 get this with the trait at best 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.810
 now we simply have to 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.400
 fold them back to the back up if possible 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.510
 it is pointed so did it the same 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.510
 thing on all four sides 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.200
 here you go, this is 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.270
 now you have to read rabat like 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.960
 there is already the trace of the country if you 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:03:03.470
 just do it while the pasta 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:06.780
 be that here and behind also 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.910
 and here is your horse is my 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.459
 language must form the debt is there that 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.680
 here is the tail so it's super nice 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.030
 as well 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.320
 and the head are shaped like water 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.269
 the home but a firefighter 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.269
 and then as the horses have no 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:28.440
 pointed nose so we will round the end 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:33.410
 underneath here is our paper horse 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.410
 and hold on the spot here is ciao
