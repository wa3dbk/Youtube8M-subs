00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
remember this on the sixaxis but I've
only<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.810> use<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> sixaxis<00:01:46.770> once<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> there's

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
only to use the sixaxis once so there's

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.980 
only to use the sixaxis once so there's
no<00:01:50.520> bottom<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.030> them<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.479> when<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> compare

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
