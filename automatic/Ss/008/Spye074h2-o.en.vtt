00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
i'll try to achieve for example this is

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.779 
i'll try to achieve for example this is
the<00:05:32.320> third<00:05:32.919> time<00:05:32.949> I've<00:05:33.310> been<00:05:33.340> doing<00:05:33.760> this

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
the third time I've been doing this

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.040 
the third time I've been doing this
commentary<00:05:34.150> because<00:05:34.419> I've<00:05:34.630> listened<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:34.930> the

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
commentary because I've listened to the

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.659 
commentary because I've listened to the
other<00:05:35.169> two<00:05:35.320> back<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:36.160> don't<00:05:36.340> think<00:05:36.430> it<00:05:36.580> was

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
other two back and I don't think it was

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.430 
other two back and I don't think it was
good<00:05:36.820> enough<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.210> I've<00:05:37.870> got<00:05:38.169> a<00:05:38.199> lot<00:05:38.410> of

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
good enough and I've got a lot of

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.170 
good enough and I've got a lot of
experience<00:05:38.949> with<00:05:39.010> commentary<00:05:39.580> and<00:05:39.940> I<00:05:40.120> know

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
experience with commentary and I know

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.029 
experience with commentary and I know
that<00:05:40.539> the<00:05:40.960> first<00:05:41.110> time<00:05:41.349> you<00:05:41.500> do<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.680> commentary

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
that the first time you do a commentary

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.580 
that the first time you do a commentary
probably<00:05:42.490> isn't<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.000> best<00:05:43.090> one<00:05:43.539> because<00:05:44.410> you

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
probably isn't the best one because you

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.350 
probably isn't the best one because you
forget<00:05:45.010> something<00:05:45.130> to<00:05:45.280> say<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:45.669> releases<00:05:46.210> for

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
forget something to say it releases for

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.850 
forget something to say it releases for
me<00:05:46.510> this<00:05:46.720> is<00:05:46.840> consistent<00:05:47.169> with<00:05:47.349> me<00:05:47.530> but<00:05:47.680> anyway

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
me this is consistent with me but anyway

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.469 
me this is consistent with me but anyway
because<00:05:48.400> it's<00:05:48.639> the<00:05:48.729> end<00:05:48.849> of<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.940> video<00:05:49.090> if<00:05:49.389> you

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
because it's the end of the video if you

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.939 
because it's the end of the video if you
got<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.660> gameplay<00:05:50.050> that<00:05:50.169> you<00:05:50.260> want<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.560> be<00:05:50.620> I
