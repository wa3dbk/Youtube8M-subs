00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
all right we pulled into a little cut

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.150 
all right we pulled into a little cut
here<00:00:02.610> we're<00:00:03.540> out<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.929> wind<00:00:04.080> we've<00:00:04.950> got<00:00:05.130> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
here we're out of the wind we've got a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.140 
here we're out of the wind we've got a
lot<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.430> wood<00:00:05.759> in<00:00:05.790> here<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:07.429> it's<00:00:08.429> also<00:00:08.639> fairly

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
lot of wood in here and it's also fairly

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.549 
lot of wood in here and it's also fairly
shallow<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.660> here<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:09.929> there<00:00:10.080> could<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.380> lot

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
shallow in here so there could be a lot

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.249 
shallow in here so there could be a lot
of<00:00:10.590> largemouth<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.309> moved<00:00:11.519> up<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.849> here<00:00:12.259> I've

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
of largemouth that moved up in here I've

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.340 
of largemouth that moved up in here I've
switched<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> jig

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
switched to a jig

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.680 
switched to a jig
it's<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.500> 3/8<00:00:16.890> ounce<00:00:17.100> jig<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:18.449> tipped

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it's a 3/8 ounce jig and it's tipped

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.160 
it's a 3/8 ounce jig and it's tipped
with<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> piece<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.170> plastic<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.840> reason

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
with a piece of plastic and the reason

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.160 
with a piece of plastic and the reason
I've<00:00:22.320> done<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.949> because<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:24.720> there<00:00:24.779> in

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
I've done that is because out there in

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.349 
I've done that is because out there in
the<00:00:25.260> wind<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:26.070> fish<00:00:26.279> may<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.580> more<00:00:26.910> active

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
the wind the fish may be more active

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.150 
the wind the fish may be more active
they<00:00:27.900> seem<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.410> biting<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.740> spinner<00:00:28.949> bait

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
they seem to be biting the spinner bait

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.630 
they seem to be biting the spinner bait
fairly<00:00:29.550> well<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.570> where<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.840> kamar

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
fairly well but in here where it's kamar

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.729 
fairly well but in here where it's kamar
spinner<00:00:32.640> bait<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.690> isn't<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.350> lure<00:00:34.530> of

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
spinner bait really isn't the lure of

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.130 
spinner bait really isn't the lure of
choice<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:36.090> gonna<00:00:36.239> try<00:00:36.480> flipping<00:00:36.719> some<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
choice so I'm gonna try flipping some of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
choice so I'm gonna try flipping some of
these<00:00:37.200> trees<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.829> little<00:00:38.129> jig<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
these trees with this little jig and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
these trees with this little jig and
we'll<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.450> if<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.750> come<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.469> few

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
we'll see if we can come up with a few

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.100 
we'll see if we can come up with a few

something<00:01:28.080> really<00:01:28.439> nice<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.009> solitude

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
something really nice about the solitude

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.359

seems<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.759> me<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.540> rest<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> world

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
seems to me that the rest of the world

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
seems to me that the rest of the world
just<00:01:34.409> sort<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> melts<00:01:35.009> away<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.520> you're<00:01:35.670> out

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790

just sort of melts away when you're out
on<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> water<00:01:36.240> by<00:01:36.450> yourself<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.380> don't<00:01:37.530> have

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
on the water by yourself you don't have

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.679 
on the water by yourself you don't have
to<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:37.890> about<00:01:38.040> anything<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.060> yourself<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689
