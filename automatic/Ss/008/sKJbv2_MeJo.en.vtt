00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.920 
five man crew so at any given location
any<00:02:14.620> given<00:02:14.950> shot<00:02:15.190> has<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> net<00:02:16.269> 11<00:02:16.660> minus

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
any given shot has a net 11 minus

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.800 
any given shot has a net 11 minus
effects<00:02:17.290> team

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.660 

so<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.170> big<00:02:21.350> kind<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.130> effect<00:02:22.430> shots

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
so one of the big kind of effect shots

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.730 
so one of the big kind of effect shots
I've<00:02:22.880> got<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.900> s<00:02:24.050> affecting<00:02:24.530> kind

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
I've got to do is the s affecting kind

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.080 
I've got to do is the s affecting kind
of<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:24.920> really<00:02:25.100> great<00:02:25.310> idea<00:02:25.370> which<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:25.970> to

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
of this really great idea which is to

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.200 
of this really great idea which is to
get<00:02:26.210> a<00:02:26.270> 35<00:02:26.750> by<00:02:26.960> 35<00:02:27.440> meter<00:02:27.890> cloth<00:02:28.190> Draper<00:02:28.850> out<00:02:29.000> in

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
get a 35 by 35 meter cloth Draper out in

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.350 
get a 35 by 35 meter cloth Draper out in
a<00:02:29.570> quarry<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.340> coat<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.520> entire<00:02:31.550> surface<00:02:32.150> of

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
a quarry and coat the entire surface of

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.330 
a quarry and coat the entire surface of
that<00:02:32.450> with<00:02:32.600> different<00:02:32.720> color<00:02:32.990> petals<00:02:33.380> and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
that with different color petals and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.800 
that with different color petals and
waft<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.300> get<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.540> kind<00:02:35.750> of

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
waft it so that you get this kind of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.710 
waft it so that you get this kind of
undulating<00:02:36.260> bubbling<00:02:37.220> surface<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.910> we've

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
undulating bubbling surface and we've

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.240 
undulating bubbling surface and we've
just<00:02:38.750> unload<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.410> take<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.890> at<00:02:40.070> different

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
just unload to take to that at different

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.010 
just unload to take to that at different
speeds<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.030> we're<00:02:41.240> going<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.540> kind<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.810> tile

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
speeds and we're going to kind of tile

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.080 
speeds and we're going to kind of tile
that<00:02:42.200> up<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.830> then<00:02:43.100> track<00:02:43.460> that<00:02:43.700> into<00:02:44.000> the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
that up and then track that into the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.140 
that up and then track that into the
moving<00:02:44.240> helicopter<00:02:44.750> shows<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.050> we've<00:02:45.200> done

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
moving helicopter shows that we've done

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.780 
moving helicopter shows that we've done
my<00:02:47.150> overall<00:02:47.750> ambition<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.740> guess<00:02:49.280> was<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.520> try

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
my overall ambition I guess was to try

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.300 
my overall ambition I guess was to try
to<00:02:49.850> do<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.420> real<00:02:50.450> as<00:02:51.290> much<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:51.740> possible

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
to do it for real as much as possible

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.510 
to do it for real as much as possible
and<00:02:52.460> also<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.120> go<00:02:53.420> as<00:02:53.840> big<00:02:54.080> as<00:02:54.140> possible

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.340 

it's<00:03:00.030> been<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> fun<00:03:00.570> shoot<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:00.990> been<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> great

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
it's been a fun shoot it's been a great

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.590 
it's been a fun shoot it's been a great
show
