00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
there it's exactly the same concept but

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.410 
there it's exactly the same concept but
the<00:01:19.230> reality<00:01:19.800> is<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.640> rocks<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.390> boat

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the reality is it just rocks the boat

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.650 
the reality is it just rocks the boat
big<00:01:21.840> time<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> people<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:24.150> fortunate

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
big time a lot of people are fortunate

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.090 
big time a lot of people are fortunate
that<00:01:24.690> there's<00:01:25.260> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> positive<00:01:26.070> changes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that there's a lot of positive changes

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.430 
that there's a lot of positive changes
so<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.120> can<00:01:27.300> go<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.260> more

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
so they can go out and do more

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.780 
so they can go out and do more
activities<00:01:28.800> with<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> they're<00:01:29.550> probably

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
older than to play with their children

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.440 
older than to play with their children
right<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.490> why<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> lot<00:01:32.760> of<00:01:32.910> people<00:01:33.240> come<00:01:33.420> in

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
in the first place

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.000 
in the first place
but<00:01:35.370> some<00:01:35.700> people<00:01:36.180> knowingly<00:01:37.020> or<00:01:37.170> not<00:01:37.470> choose

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
but some people knowingly or not choose

the<00:02:51.959> security<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.129> sometimes<00:02:53.579> -<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.790> will<00:02:54.030> say

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the security and sometimes - I will say

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.300 
the security and sometimes - I will say
sometimes<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> best<00:02:55.140> intentions<00:02:55.920> yeah

and I think even comfy relationships
will<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.829> but<00:02:59.400> often<00:02:59.579> times<00:03:00.060> when

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
will have that but often times when

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.860 
will have that but often times when
marriages<00:03:01.530> are<00:03:01.560> built<00:03:02.129> on<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:03.150> insecurity

says it's like you know like I don't had
more<00:06:23.050> feelings<00:06:23.350> because<00:06:23.980> they<00:06:24.100> felt<00:06:24.340> like

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
more feelings because they felt like

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.520 
more feelings because they felt like
that<00:06:24.550> was<00:06:24.880> all<00:06:25.180> I<00:06:25.510> was<00:06:25.690> gonna<00:06:25.870> get<00:06:26.170> that<00:06:26.410> was

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
that was all I was gonna get that was

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.250 
that was all I was gonna get that was
where<00:06:26.680> my<00:06:26.800> options<00:06:27.340> ended<00:06:27.960> another<00:06:28.960> thing

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
where my options ended another thing

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.930 
where my options ended another thing
that<00:06:29.410> we<00:06:29.530> could<00:06:29.710> said<00:06:29.890> was<00:06:30.100> that<00:06:30.250> they<00:06:30.400> you

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
that we could said was that they you

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.630 
that we could said was that they you
know<00:06:30.970> after<00:06:31.390> surgery<00:06:31.870> they<00:06:32.440> didn't<00:06:33.340> realize

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
know after surgery they didn't realize

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.400 
know after surgery they didn't realize
that<00:06:33.670> they<00:06:33.940> were<00:06:34.150> gonna<00:06:34.390> have<00:06:34.870> their<00:06:35.050> stomach

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
that they were gonna have their stomach

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.000 
that they were gonna have their stomach
cut<00:06:35.650> but<00:06:35.920> grow<00:06:36.100> a<00:06:36.130> backbone<00:06:36.400> and<00:06:37.270> so<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:38.350> they

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
cut but grow a backbone and so the they

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.400 
cut but grow a backbone and so the they
became<00:06:39.310> more<00:06:39.580> assertive<00:06:40.120> yes<00:06:40.510> so<00:06:40.930> when<00:06:41.170> they

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
became more assertive yes so when they

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.260 
became more assertive yes so when they
weren't<00:06:41.680> necessarily<00:06:42.310> in<00:06:42.610> the<00:06:42.760> mood<00:06:42.970> for

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
weren't necessarily in the mood for

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.940 
weren't necessarily in the mood for
having<00:06:43.570> sex<00:06:43.840> it<00:06:44.020> in<00:06:44.140> the<00:06:44.230> past<00:06:44.500> would<00:06:44.830> have

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
having sex it in the past would have

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.770 
having sex it in the past would have
said<00:06:45.100> all<00:06:45.310> right<00:06:45.340> now<00:06:45.580> right<00:06:45.940> now<00:06:46.180> they're

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
said all right now right now they're

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.800 
said all right now right now they're
more<00:06:47.050> likely<00:06:47.290> to<00:06:47.590> speak<00:06:47.830> their<00:06:48.070> mind<00:06:48.310> maybe

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
more likely to speak their mind maybe

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.210 
more likely to speak their mind maybe
and<00:06:49.810> then<00:06:49.990> there's<00:06:50.200> some<00:06:50.410> research<00:06:50.800> that<00:06:50.830> said

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
and then there's some research that said

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.560 
and then there's some research that said
that<00:06:51.340> there<00:06:51.490> might<00:06:51.670> be<00:06:51.700> something<00:06:52.090> hormonal

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
that there might be something hormonal

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.200 
that there might be something hormonal
going<00:06:53.050> on<00:06:53.230> too<00:06:53.560> I<00:06:53.740> believe<00:06:54.130> that<00:06:54.580> the<00:06:54.700> fat

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
going on too I believe that the fat

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.500 
going on too I believe that the fat
cells<00:06:55.510> and<00:06:55.840> estrogen<00:06:56.730> but<00:06:57.730> that<00:06:57.910> again<00:06:58.300> that's

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
cells and estrogen but that again that's

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.030 
cells and estrogen but that again that's
an<00:06:58.630> area<00:06:58.780> that<00:06:58.900> hasn't<00:06:59.230> got<00:06:59.740> a<00:06:59.770> lot<00:06:59.980> of

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.040 
an area that hasn't got a lot of

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.190 
an area that hasn't got a lot of
research<00:07:00.550> attention<00:07:01.240> play<00:07:01.450> but<00:07:01.720> I<00:07:01.750> found<00:07:02.050> it

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.200 
research attention play but I found it

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.510 
research attention play but I found it
really<00:07:02.290> interesting<00:07:02.590> because<00:07:03.040> I<00:07:03.220> think<00:07:03.280> that

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
really interesting because I think that

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.180 
really interesting because I think that
people<00:07:04.000> in<00:07:04.330> the<00:07:05.110> world<00:07:05.380> would<00:07:05.650> think<00:07:05.920> oh<00:07:06.070> you

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
people in the world would think oh you

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.540 
people in the world would think oh you
get<00:07:06.520> skinny<00:07:06.850> you've<00:07:07.060> had<00:07:07.180> better<00:07:07.420> sex<00:07:08.550> not

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
get skinny you've had better sex not

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.370 
get skinny you've had better sex not
