and<00:02:21.860> now<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.010> galaxy<00:02:22.489> has<00:02:22.580> four<00:02:22.849> stock<00:02:23.300> camera

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
and now the galaxy has four stock camera

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.130 
and now the galaxy has four stock camera
and<00:02:24.590> it's<00:02:24.739> got<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.069> no<00:02:25.280> lag<00:02:25.989> actually<00:02:26.989> by

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
and it's got that no lag actually by

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.509 
and it's got that no lag actually by
just<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> little<00:02:27.830> bit<00:02:27.920> more<00:02:28.099> than<00:02:28.280> what<00:02:28.430> I'm

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
just a little bit more than what I'm

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.039 
just a little bit more than what I'm
used<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:30.200> let's<00:02:30.590> see<00:02:30.769> what<00:02:30.980> else<00:02:31.840> if<00:02:32.840> you

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
used to so let's see what else if you

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.270 
used to so let's see what else if you
hold<00:02:33.260> down<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.590> screen<00:02:33.830> you're<00:02:33.980> gonna<00:02:34.069> get

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
hold down the screen you're gonna get

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.460 
hold down the screen you're gonna get
some<00:02:34.400> options<00:02:36.489> gonna<00:02:37.489> get<00:02:37.700> exposure<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:39.260> just

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
some options gonna get exposure you just

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.509 
some options gonna get exposure you just
kind<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.650> move<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:39.860> from<00:02:40.160> left<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.459> right<00:02:42.519> hold

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
kind of move it from left to right hold

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.850 
kind of move it from left to right hold
that<00:02:43.580> again<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.810> have<00:02:44.900> more<00:02:45.110> options

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
that again you have more options

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.229 
that again you have more options
we<00:02:46.010> got<00:02:46.160> location<00:02:47.140> countdown<00:02:48.140> timer<00:02:49.239> picture

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
we got location countdown timer picture

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.839 
we got location countdown timer picture
size<00:02:50.890> white<00:02:51.890> balance<00:02:54.340> just<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.430> lot<00:02:55.640> of

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
size white balance just a lot of

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.050 
size white balance just a lot of
different<00:02:56.209> lighting<00:02:56.959> options<00:02:57.910> come<00:02:58.910> back

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
different lighting options come back

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.420 
different lighting options come back
down<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.420> go<00:02:59.540> back<00:02:59.810> over<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:01.099> can<00:03:01.250> do<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
down to go back over and you can do the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.970 
down to go back over and you can do the
front<00:03:01.670> camera<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:03.590> pretty<00:03:03.739> neat<00:03:03.950> that

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
front camera so it's pretty neat that

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.110 
front camera so it's pretty neat that
you<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.400> hold<00:03:04.489> down<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> screen<00:03:05.000> and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
you can just hold down the screen and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.890 
you can just hold down the screen and
get<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.329> options

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
get the options

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.270 
get the options
it<00:03:06.500> seems<00:03:06.709> pretty<00:03:06.860> quick<00:03:08.739> I'm<00:03:09.739> curious<00:03:10.129> about

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
it seems pretty quick I'm curious about

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.850 
it seems pretty quick I'm curious about
the<00:03:10.549> picture<00:03:11.000> size<00:03:11.239> because<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.170> has<00:03:12.349> a<00:03:12.379> 13

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
the picture size because this has a 13

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.009 
the picture size because this has a 13
megapixel<00:03:13.010> camera<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.450> still<00:03:14.660> does<00:03:14.840> that

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
megapixel camera and it still does that

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.400 
megapixel camera and it still does that
so<00:03:15.170> that's<00:03:15.349> really<00:03:15.379> cool<00:03:16.359> it<00:03:17.359> adjusts<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.989> your

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
so that's really cool it adjusts to your

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.430 
so that's really cool it adjusts to your
camera<00:03:19.299> megapixel<00:03:20.299> size<00:03:20.600> that's<00:03:21.019> installed

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
camera megapixel size that's installed

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.330 
camera megapixel size that's installed
and<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.639> know<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.910> galaxy<00:03:23.150> s4<00:03:23.660> has<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.380> 13

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and as you know the galaxy s4 has a 13

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.479 
and as you know the galaxy s4 has a 13
megapixel<00:03:25.459> camera<00:03:29.440> you've<00:03:30.440> seen<00:03:30.829> so<00:03:31.340> you've

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
megapixel camera you've seen so you've

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.830 
megapixel camera you've seen so you've
got<00:03:31.609> party<00:03:32.389> mode<00:03:32.920> sunset<00:03:33.920> none<00:03:34.340> night<00:03:35.299> and

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
got party mode sunset none night and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.930 
got party mode sunset none night and
action<00:03:36.410> action<00:03:36.799> is<00:03:37.160> probably<00:03:37.549> gonna<00:03:37.760> be<00:03:37.849> one

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
action action is probably gonna be one

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.470 
action action is probably gonna be one
of<00:03:38.090> those<00:03:38.299> kind<00:03:39.019> of<00:03:39.280> options<00:03:40.280> for<00:03:43.329> keep<00:03:44.329> them

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
of those kind of options for keep them

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.949 
of those kind of options for keep them
blurs<00:03:44.720> down<00:03:45.079> so<00:03:45.849> photosphere<00:03:46.849> of<00:03:46.970> tips<00:03:47.299> keep

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
blurs down so photosphere of tips keep

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.770 
blurs down so photosphere of tips keep
the<00:03:48.109> camera<00:03:48.440> Center<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:48.980> move<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.310> around

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
the camera Center to move it around

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.289 
the camera Center to move it around
works<00:03:50.780> best<00:03:51.139> with<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.560> scene<00:03:51.919> at<00:03:52.190> least<00:03:52.730> 30<00:03:53.060> feet

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
works best with a scene at least 30 feet

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.490 
works best with a scene at least 30 feet
away<00:03:53.389> so<00:03:53.930> we<00:03:54.079> don't<00:03:54.109> have<00:03:54.380> that<00:03:54.440> option<00:03:56.500> this

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
away so we don't have that option this

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:06.620 
away so we don't have that option this
is<00:03:57.680> definitely<00:03:57.980> different<00:03:58.790> a<00:04:00.069> line<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.400> start

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.980 

you<00:04:07.170> kind<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.560> see<00:04:07.710> this<00:04:07.830> two<00:04:08.280> little<00:04:08.550> dots<00:04:08.990> let

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
you kind of see this two little dots let

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.880 
you kind of see this two little dots let
you<00:04:10.170> line<00:04:10.440> up<00:04:10.470> together<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.470> that's<00:04:13.650> kind<00:04:13.830> of

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
you line up together so that's kind of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.420 
you line up together so that's kind of
neat<00:04:14.930> store<00:04:15.930> location<00:04:19.010> see<00:04:20.010> we've<00:04:20.340> got

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430
