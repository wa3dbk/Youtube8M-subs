doing the ScreenFlow on my computer to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.460 
doing the ScreenFlow on my computer to
hopefully<00:00:18.330> make<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.720> audio<00:00:19.080> sound<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> little

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
bit better right now I'm just using my

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.910 
bit better right now I'm just using my
can<00:00:21.449> vixia<00:00:21.900> camera<00:00:22.289> which<00:00:22.439> has<00:00:22.590> pretty<00:00:22.769> good

can vixia camera which has pretty good
audio<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.550> hopefully<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.150> will<00:00:24.300> give

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
audio in it but hopefully this will give

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.029 
audio in it but hopefully this will give
it<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.630> little<00:00:24.720> more<00:00:24.960> professional<00:00:25.289> feel<00:00:25.830> when

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
we see that a loom case looks like a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.370 
we see that a loom case looks like a
nice<00:02:00.060> aluminum<00:02:00.240> case<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> handle<00:02:01.290> on

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the box set this down here for a second

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.350 
the box set this down here for a second
of<00:02:10.979> course<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.400> look<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> box<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.300> here

of course we look in the box right here
we<00:02:12.720> have

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we have

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.980 
we have
documentation<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.760> think<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.330> yes

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
documentation and I think that's it yes

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.450 
documentation and I think that's it yes
I<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:16.290> about<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.860> box<00:02:17.040> will<00:02:17.250> throw

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
I was about it for the box will throw

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.120 
I was about it for the box will throw
that<00:02:17.640> off<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.880> side<00:02:18.650> documentation<00:02:19.650> has<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that off to the side documentation has a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.100 
that off to the side documentation has a
bunch<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.490> caution<00:02:21.150> probably<00:02:21.690> stuff<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
bunch of caution probably stuff that I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.940 
bunch of caution probably stuff that I
probably<00:02:22.320> shouldn't<00:02:22.650> do<00:02:22.710> with<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
probably shouldn't do with the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.100 
probably shouldn't do with the
microphone<00:02:23.660> which<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.900> kind<00:02:25.050> of

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
microphone which you can kind of

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.630 
microphone which you can kind of
attached<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.830> shock<00:02:26.070> mountain<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.490> pop

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
attached to it a shock mountain a pop

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.840 
attached to it a shock mountain a pop
filter<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.200> we'll<00:02:28.500> shove<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.490> off<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
filter so we'll shove this off to the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.240 
filter so we'll shove this off to the
side<00:02:29.910> as<00:02:30.390> well<00:02:30.900> let's<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:31.680> back<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.890> Big

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
side as well let's get back the Big

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.560 
side as well let's get back the Big
Kahuna<00:02:32.400> hear<00:02:32.820> everything<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:33.300> going<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
Kahuna hear everything that's going to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.750 
Kahuna hear everything that's going to
be<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.530> guy<00:02:34.740> right<00:02:34.980> here<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.370> aluminum

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
be in this guy right here the aluminum

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.030 
be in this guy right here the aluminum
case<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.990> if<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.350> figure<00:02:37.470> how<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> open<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
case so if I can figure how to open this

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.020 
case so if I can figure how to open this
it's<00:02:38.580> right<00:02:38.730> here<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.060> sign<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:41.580> we<00:02:41.640> just

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it's right here the sign and we just

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.170 
it's right here the sign and we just
kind<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.270> drift<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.380> open<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:44.610> doesn't<00:02:45.060> look

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
kind of drift that open it doesn't look

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.840 
kind of drift that open it doesn't look
like<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.360> nice<00:02:45.570> case<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:46.080> really<00:02:46.350> lightweight

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
like a nice case it's really lightweight

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.850 
like a nice case it's really lightweight
so<00:02:47.850> I'm<00:02:47.910> hoping<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.300> does<00:02:48.480> serve<00:02:48.720> my<00:02:49.500> purpose

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
so I'm hoping it does serve my purpose

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.740 
so I'm hoping it does serve my purpose
is<00:02:50.010> well<00:02:50.190> flying<00:02:50.520> use<00:02:50.910> before<00:02:51.060> we're<00:02:51.690> just

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
is well flying use before we're just

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.590 
is well flying use before we're just
gonna<00:02:51.870> flip<00:02:52.230> within<00:02:52.530> these<00:02:52.650> latches<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.600> you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
gonna flip within these latches and you

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.860 
gonna flip within these latches and you
didn't<00:02:54.900> hear<00:02:55.110> analogous<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.739> open<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.220> up<00:02:56.870> kind

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
didn't hear analogous to open it up kind

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.440 
didn't hear analogous to open it up kind
of<00:02:57.959> um<00:02:58.200> pecky<00:02:58.860> foam<00:02:59.190> here<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.610> top<00:02:59.760> really
