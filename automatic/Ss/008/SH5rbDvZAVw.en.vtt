00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.279
 and then personal beauty but starting here 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.970
 a video the shadow of the colossus the 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.160
 secret and is not and that after so much 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.110
 time I come and I'm recording again 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 This here I do not even know is if I like that 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:41.310
 Records do not know if we speak out the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.310
 video this time let's talk about dreams 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.489
 first in the last video I 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:04.059
 I did because during the video 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:08.100
 I ended up imitating there so I ask 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.100
 Excuse this will not happen again 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.660
 so come on 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 good then today's theory is that the game is 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:30.790
 goes from a dream just a theory 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:33.160
 it seemed at last I'll explain what part until 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.980
 where it is a dream where it began and 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.660
 The dream is over because reality is what 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.950
 reality has to do with this dream 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:47.710
 So anyway, let's go in 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.750
 first place is where it starts where everything 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.210
 it is only a dream and it only has to 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:58.950
 to be someone then whose dream is this 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.950
 vander is water is sleep 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.959
 so that would be sleeping when 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.879
 this dream begins it starts as soon as 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.650
 We started to play then I can not 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.600
 know right when it starts then 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.840
 When 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.470
 Mercadante already goes a dream is already a 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.380
 dream and when it ends when we see 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.350
 love not getting up after the fight 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:34.350
 against the drop tenths 7x colossus is 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.520
 we see the monkey waking up resuscitating 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.980
 in quotes right 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.080
 and this here would be the real thing 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.170
 they are just sleeping and woke up 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.140
 image of dreams and how it is reality 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.490
 vander the rich that i actually believe 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.880
 But that's where I'm going to explain. 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:00.770
 because then you're just a baby 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.770
 monkey son with the sleeping 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.870
 I'll explain it too. 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.620
 Finally it's just a little baby too 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:18.270
 that I was taking in the shower in the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:20.550
 ag she sells good and finally agro is a 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.590
 bruised horse maybe he had 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.010
 some accident has already been this way 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.820
 anyway he does not run does not jump and just 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:35.130
 Manca and Mono is very sad because of 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.440
 the bridge connecting the castle to the 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.560
 of forbidden lands he is 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.230
 totally broken is not known if the UN 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.390
 already born there with the broken bridge or 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.130
 sleep broke someone broke but 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.290
 bridge is totally broken place is 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.110
 totally desert there is no one 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.590
 She is the only person who lives there 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.740
 meet with a baby 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.550
 then this would be the reality of the morning 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.850
 so now let's go to the difference between 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.290
 reality is a dream 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.629
 how I talked about the curriculum 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.269
 he is just a little baby and in the dream that 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:24.010
 kept him a grown boy 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:27.380
 strong and brave would kill good giant garbage 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.190
 because that in her dream and that she has no 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.560
 horns as it is in fact because rich 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.889
 He's a pain in the ass. 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.940
 monkey does not like to sleep so the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.419
 colossi 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.030
 It's like they 're part of the sleep. 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.800
 really or even dora sleeps and she wanted 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.050
 that vander become a boy 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.120
 very dumb to the icon the story of a 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.660
 very strong group so that he could kill 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.780
 sleep they live happily ever after 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.120
 so the dream it has no horns 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.880
 because that would just be a memory 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.600
 that he is the son of a dora who is not a 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:10.280
 cool souvenir then do not dream it does not 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:14.240
 has horns referring to sleeping not 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.289
 have no influence on it now 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.930
 a very strong horse that jumps fast 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.880
 act like she really would like the 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.300
 euro was for real 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.360
 the bridge is perfect had well 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:34.370
 built on the methods of feeling well 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.349
 the pretty little regret because she has 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.620
 the dream of leaving that place 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.990
 it is then in the dream that she had the bag 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.919
 it was perfect had it ready for 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:49.520
 anyone comes to the light we see in the 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:52.610
 probably coming from the sun would be 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.690
 a small trace of reality in the dream 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.690
 a small real-world light that would 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:03.639
 He sleeps wanting and starts to influence 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:07.120
 the club and so he begins to have 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:10.729
 shifts throughout the dream 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.090
 already near the end when Andrew defeated 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.250
 the 16 th colloquiums that would still be in 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.139
 of the dream 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.240
 He sleeps he was already having so much 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.630
 influence in the dream reality was already 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.080
 winning both 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.460
 the kimono woke up and could not stand it any more 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.200
 that dream because he was 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.720
 turning it into a nightmare 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.760
 Good, I guess that was enough. 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.990
 to show you the basics of this 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.970
 theory 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.600
 in the future I can bring as I did 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:42.090
 with world bringing a two talking dream 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.710
 about a conclusion about this 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.120
 subject and talking about other theories 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:50.640
 related to this but despite the video 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.890
 being through short take long to 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.450
 me make this video if you notice a long 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:07:00.000
 Video my tone and clarity to 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:04.740
 Mike changed enough recorded this 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.230
 video with three different microphones but 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.260
 anyway, how have you always behaved? 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.680
 take so long and now be short and I 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.390
 I can not say that the next one will be 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.370
 It's going to be kind tomorrow, I can not anymore. 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.730
 It's probably going to take a while because I 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.900
 I have to write, I have here. 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.520
 sums up everything I wrote because the 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.640
 that I write is not a little write 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.770
 relatively large and then 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.840
 to summarize I have to go from a 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.450
 organized way to talk about the video 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.440
 That's when I said it all and recorded a million 

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.390
 of times 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.020
 but I will not complain about it because 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.580
 I think cool is from the church so much 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.590
 Thank you all, thank you very much for the 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.140
 two thousand subscribers 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.720
 I'm going to make a special day and I'll 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:52.050
 So that's it, thank you very much to everyone and 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.200
 see you later one more thing is 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:57.810
 I wanted you to say that you 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.300
 find after each time after you do 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.340
 a sheldon video about some secret one 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.670
 theory of the boss or make a live 

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.530
 a day later until the same day talking 

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:12.330
 on that subject of debate debating 

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:14.100
 on that subject with you in the case 

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.810
 So tell me what you think of this idea. 

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.950
 beauty, now, yes, yes, now it's okay 

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.950
 said too much
