00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hi my name is Cole with expert village

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.309 
hi my name is Cole with expert village
we'll<00:00:03.330> be<00:00:03.389> talking<00:00:03.540> about<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.899> buoyancy

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
we'll be talking about the buoyancy

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.299 
we'll be talking about the buoyancy
compensator<00:00:04.830> device<00:00:05.100> or<00:00:05.339> also<00:00:05.819> BCD<00:00:07.309> BCD

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
compensator device or also BCD BCD

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.540 
compensator device or also BCD BCD
basically<00:00:09.620> looks<00:00:10.620> pretty<00:00:10.830> technical<00:00:11.040> but

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
basically looks pretty technical but

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.100 
basically looks pretty technical but
it's<00:00:11.700> nothing<00:00:11.880> more<00:00:12.150> than<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.360> glorified<00:00:12.389> life

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
it's nothing more than a glorified life

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.279 
it's nothing more than a glorified life
preserver<00:00:13.559> at<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.700> surface<00:00:14.969> it's<00:00:15.719> inflated

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
preserver at the surface it's inflated

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.080 
preserver at the surface it's inflated
using<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.619> blue<00:00:16.830> buttons<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.880> float

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
using this blue buttons so we can float

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.519 
using this blue buttons so we can float
there<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.510> hang<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.779> nice<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.109> easy<00:00:19.320> you

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
there and hang out nice and easy you

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.510 
there and hang out nice and easy you
don't<00:00:19.560> hit<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> kick<00:00:19.980> or<00:00:20.130> struggle<00:00:20.430> or

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
don't hit the kick or struggle or

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.859 
don't hit the kick or struggle or
anything<00:00:20.550> then<00:00:21.270> when<00:00:21.390> you're<00:00:21.510> ready<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.779> go

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
anything then when you're ready to go

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.109 
anything then when you're ready to go
down<00:00:22.080> press<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.130> black<00:00:23.340> button<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.910> it

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
down press the black button and it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.089 
down press the black button and it
deflates<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.650> sink<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.070> down<00:00:27.349> now<00:00:28.349> one

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
deflates and you sink on down now one

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.310 
deflates and you sink on down now one
thing<00:00:29.130> also<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> used<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
thing also that it is used for is to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
thing also that it is used for is to
make<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.369> diver<00:00:32.579> neutrally<00:00:33.239> buoyant

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
make it the diver neutrally buoyant

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
make it the diver neutrally buoyant
underwater<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.170> you're<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.530> banging<00:00:34.980> against

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
underwater so you're not banging against

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
underwater so you're not banging against
the<00:00:35.430> reef<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.510> floating<00:00:36.840> back<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the reef and not floating back up to the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.260 
the reef and not floating back up to the
surface<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.879> usually<00:00:39.149> by

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
surface and so you do that usually by

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
surface and so you do that usually by
just<00:00:39.540> tapping<00:00:39.719> little<00:00:40.170> bits<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> air<00:00:40.649> into<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
just tapping little bits of air into the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.380 
just tapping little bits of air into the
jacket<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.550> inflating<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.680> also<00:00:43.829> be

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
jacket and inflating it it can also be

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
jacket and inflating it it can also be
manually<00:00:45.390> inflated<00:00:45.539> should<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.070> mechanism

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
manually inflated should the mechanism

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
manually inflated should the mechanism
start<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.030> fail<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> hose<00:00:48.899> become<00:00:49.289> cut

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
start to fail or the hose become cut

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.330 
start to fail or the hose become cut
whatever<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:55.559> when<00:00:55.829> we're<00:00:55.980> ready<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> go

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
whatever and then when we're ready to go

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.010 
whatever and then when we're ready to go
down<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:57.030> simply<00:00:57.239> press<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> black<00:00:57.989> button

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
down we simply press the black button

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.080 
down we simply press the black button
and<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> water<00:00:59.070> pressure<00:00:59.280> squeezes<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.059> air

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and the water pressure squeezes the air

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
and the water pressure squeezes the air
out<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> jacket<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.289> sink<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.710> down

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
out of the jacket we can sink on down

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.609 
out of the jacket we can sink on down
real<00:01:02.070> nice<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> slow<00:01:02.930> most<00:01:03.930> species<00:01:04.140> also

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
real nice and slow most species also

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
real nice and slow most species also
have<00:01:05.010> D<00:01:05.489> rings<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> attach<00:01:06.689> various

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
have D rings on them to attach various

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.630 
have D rings on them to attach various
accessories<00:01:07.320> such<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.369> slates<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.520> also

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
accessories such as slates you can also

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.480 
accessories such as slates you can also
attach<00:01:11.909> us<00:01:12.740> signaling<00:01:13.740> devices<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.340> stuff

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490

the<00:01:44.970> weight<00:01:45.380> integrated<00:01:46.380> pouches<00:01:46.799> which<00:01:47.100> are

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the weight integrated pouches which are

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
the weight integrated pouches which are
really<00:01:47.520> nice<00:01:47.640> because<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.149> weights<00:01:48.329> slide

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
really nice because the weights slide

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
really nice because the weights slide
right<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.549> slides<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.060> into<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
right in here this slides right into the

right in here this slides right into the
pouch<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:53.960> nowadays<00:01:54.960> lots<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.560> use

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
pouch and nowadays lots of them use

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
pouch and nowadays lots of them use
clips<00:01:56.130> instead<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.700> velcro<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
clips instead of just velcro this is a
