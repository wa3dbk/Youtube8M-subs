00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello, little Japanese, I just arrived from 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.220
 school today I had a meeting with my 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.260
 Teacher of English because he's like me. 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.269
 I told you I'm beyond life 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.370
 doing several things at the same time and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.220
 next month I had to present a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.710
 split in English a while ago I wrote the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.350
 text to energy teacher would be 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 holding weekly meetings with the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.910
 teachers and prepare for the month that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 comes the presentation there in the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.009
 kind of a lot of people in place 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.960
 huge and I'm going to tell you today 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.960
 a curiosity about the teachers of the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.059
 Japanese school is not because it is vacations 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.640
 school teachers will not 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.469
 work there as I told you 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.820
 for you in other school videos 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.469
 japanese 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.590
 On vacation students go to school 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.480
 to make bo kate are extra clubs 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.320
 curricular and of course that people have 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.030
 to be there right? 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.070
 together with the students but the work of 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.989
 teachers on vacation goes beyond that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.699
 When you talk about teachers, you make a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.079
 lots of things I do not think in Brazil 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.550
 it's like that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.860
 students enter the holiday 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.020
 teachers also have vacations that way 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.909
 so sure but it gets quality to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 You guys are a very interesting thing to 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.140
 speak the professors of japan in search 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.420
 all the time supporting the student so much that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.210
 the English teacher did not determine 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.030
 a certain time to set up at school 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.619
 how much at school on vacation is the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 schedule I'm available 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.890
 I checked today to go to school at 10 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.049
 6 islaine the texts came teacher 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.560
 Native American teacher 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.470
 did the pronunciation test and such and I stayed 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.299
 there until about 11 40 in the morning lasted 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.640
 enough time and then another curiosity 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.710
 all Japanese school have teacher 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.990
 native speaker who teaches english 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.540
 it's not the whole language written in my 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 school is once a week taking the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.759
 time of tests in the other school was 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.640
 a Canadian teacher 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.110
 In this school, he is an American teacher. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 very similar to that face that sings 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.420
 that song 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.340
 This mark reminds of the summer now it is 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 similar to that singer and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.280
 Japanese teachers of English all 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.920
 they exchange to learn 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.780
 even learn the right pronunciation and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.940
 then get a load like 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.770
 Teacher here in Japan I've heard a lot 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.069
 people say that English teachers 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.560
 do not teach me the right way. 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.080
 I was very lucky so there are not so many 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.250
 japanese attack but a best teacher 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.959
 English teacher was the teacher of 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.850
 gym his presence was very good 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.040
 or it looks like it was Japanese already this 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.530
 that he suffers from it. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.030
 He is tongue -tied and caught but the lessons 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.769
 they are good 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.840
 there's something that I could not do 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.140
 stop talking here is that I just 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.819
 get a kit gon jaconÃ© zico it me 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.019
 thus saith the laugh of what may be 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.390
 giving moral in the video to insist on the ball 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.370
 When I watched there, I watched. I stayed. 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.709

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.230
