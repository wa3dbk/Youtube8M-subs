00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.289 
every single time to the point when I
didn't<00:03:38.780> have<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.349> would<00:03:40.190> your<00:03:40.310> unerring<00:03:41.030> for

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
didn't have it I would your unerring for

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.870 
didn't have it I would your unerring for
it<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.599> would<00:03:41.870> look<00:03:42.049> for<00:03:42.319> it<00:03:42.440> because<00:03:43.099> I<00:03:43.489> felt

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
it I would look for it because I felt

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.430 
it I would look for it because I felt
like<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.209> was<00:03:44.329> nothing<00:03:44.630> without<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:44.989> abuse
