00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.640
 We have this game time ever 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.830
 lost 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 I think I can not do that on me 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.019
 let's get it now 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.000
 win 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.289
 that's offensive extremely strong of the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.670
 He only has one direction 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.900
 it does not matter if it is 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 individual contributions would be if I 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 then as winner then go out then 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.120
 I would be happy 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.120
 I think I played 1 1 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.540
 yes cool 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.950
 No 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.340
 the work was send in the lab 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.340
 yes that can still 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:33.940
 the things are so berner 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.940
 that comes requirement 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.010
 is a header tremendous 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.800
 so my days of head header 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.510
 enormous 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.770
 in the end I might have one more 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.510
 a little more lucky that I'll stop then 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.709
 finally a goal was scored 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.110
 just not at the height 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.760
 Stuttgart was the best chance remember what 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.349
 strong midfield on his position 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.340
 was hard to come by 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.340
 the gate was nice but played out 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.340
 earned
