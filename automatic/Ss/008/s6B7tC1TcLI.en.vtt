a quarter cut our quarter turn
it's<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.850> 45-degree<00:02:31.850> angle<00:02:31.880> right<00:02:32.600> there

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
it's a 45-degree angle right there

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.400 
it's a 45-degree angle right there
45-degree<00:02:33.800> angle<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.400> then<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.630> 25<00:02:36.200> degree

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
45-degree angle and then a 25 degree

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.630 
45-degree angle and then a 25 degree
turn<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.459> first<00:02:38.000> cut<00:02:38.239> one<00:02:38.590> turn<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.680> 25<00:02:40.100> degrees

turn so first cut one turn it 25 degrees

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.940 
turn so first cut one turn it 25 degrees
cut<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.300> keeping<00:02:41.750> your<00:02:41.840> quarter<00:02:42.200> your<00:02:42.530> works

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
cut it keeping your quarter your works

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.080 
cut it keeping your quarter your works
on<00:02:43.570> going<00:02:44.570> here<00:02:45.220> it's<00:02:46.220> used<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.640> lot<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.880> times

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
on going here it's used a lot of times

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.810 
on going here it's used a lot of times
for<00:02:47.390> stir-fry<00:02:47.830> keeping<00:02:48.830> your<00:02:48.950> 45-degree

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
for stir-fry keeping your 45-degree

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.330 
for stir-fry keeping your 45-degree
angle<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.530> doesn't<00:02:51.769> really<00:02:51.860> matter<00:02:52.070> what

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
angle so it doesn't really matter what

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.340 
angle so it doesn't really matter what
size<00:02:52.549> it<00:02:52.580> cut<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.390> idea<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.870> giving<00:02:54.230> it

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
size it cut it is the idea is giving it

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.620 
size it cut it is the idea is giving it
all<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.160> same<00:02:55.340> size<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.180> cooks<00:02:56.420> at<00:02:56.600> the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
all the same size so it's cooks at the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.550 
all the same size so it's cooks at the
same<00:02:56.720> rate<00:02:58.510> one<00:02:59.510> good<00:02:59.720> thing<00:02:59.750> about<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.320> cut

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560
