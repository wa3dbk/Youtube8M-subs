00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
in which is very good as well so it's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
in which is very good as well so it's
got<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.260> good<00:00:43.379> all-round<00:00:43.770> stats<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> only

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
got really good all-round stats the only

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.950 
got really good all-round stats the only
thing<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.850> does<00:00:45.000> let<00:00:45.210> him<00:00:45.300> down<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.780> his

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
thing that does let him down is his

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.080 
thing that does let him down is his
speed<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.710> little<00:00:47.039> bit<00:00:47.160> slow<00:00:47.460> but

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
speed which is a little bit slow but

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.310 
speed which is a little bit slow but
part<00:00:48.390> from<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.079> good

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
part from that is a really good

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
part from that is a really good
goalkeeper<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.219> cost<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.670> about

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
goalkeeper and it will cost you about

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.299 
goalkeeper and it will cost you about
four<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.420> half<00:00:51.480> thousand<00:00:52.020> coins<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.920> he<00:00:53.190> is

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
four and a half thousand coins so he is

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.770 
four and a half thousand coins so he is
actually<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.789> cheapest<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.539> all<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
actually the cheapest out of all the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.389 
actually the cheapest out of all the
goalkeepers<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.680> am<00:00:56.059> saying<00:00:57.059> about<00:00:57.360> today

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
goalkeepers that I am saying about today

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.430 
goalkeepers that I am saying about today
so<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> next<00:00:59.760> fourth<00:01:00.480> best<00:01:00.719> goalkeeper<00:01:01.260> i

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
so the next fourth best goalkeeper i

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.560 
so the next fourth best goalkeeper i
think<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.420> manuel<00:01:03.420> neuer<00:01:03.600> he<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.470> 90<00:01:04.920> dive<00:01:05.100> in
