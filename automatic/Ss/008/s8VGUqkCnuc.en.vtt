 "Never forget what you are, and the rest of the world will not wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you." - Tyrion Lannister 

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:14.023
 The game of thrones is the adaptation of TV from the fairy tales "Song of Ice and Fire" 

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:21.090
 By George RR Martin. Nearly 200 nominations and 59 awards, including the Golden Globe Awards, were written 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.058
 Guild, Critics Choice, Screen Actors Guild, Amy and others. The books were 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.098
 Translated into more than 30 languages ​​and reached the New York Times 

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.087
 Best seller lists. 

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:39.112
 It's a fascinating epic story, full of complexity and realism. Located in seven fictional kingdoms 

00:00:40.012 --> 00:00:45.084
 From Westeros, the series tells the violent conflicts between the royal dynasties 

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:51.085
 Families to control the Iron Throne. But along this way, it becomes about much more. 

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:56.167
 Through the words and actions of these captivating characters, there are hidden lessons that can be drawn. 

00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:02.024
 In life, we play every game of thrones in one way or another. Life is a game, for 

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:08.096
 Either win or lose but no tie. This world can be cruel, people can be cruel to you than you. 

00:01:09.024 --> 00:01:12.072
 But you must build this, says Tyrion Lannister: I never forget 

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.117
 What you are, for sure the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be 

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:22.035
 Your weakness. Shield yourself into it, and it will never be used to hurt you. Understanding 

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:26.036
 Your limitations are used correctly for your benefit. What people think about you 

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:31.127
 Did not matter. If the lion loses sleep over the view of the sheep, it should not you. 

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:36.051
 Wear your so-called double as a badge of pride and find beauty in your uniqueness. 

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:41.090
 If it hurts, remember that pain is the lesson, and each lesson makes us better. 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:48.833
 Books show many times reminiscent of "valar morghulis". It means all men must die. 

00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:54.040
 Death comes to all. It can be tomorrow, or it can be in many years from now, 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.415
 But all men must die. People die at dinner tables. People die in their family. 

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.042
 People die squatting on their room pots. Everyone dies sooner or later. 

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:04.128
 But do not worry about your death. 

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:09.070
 Take care of your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.420
 Because death is a final decision so, while life is full of possibilities. So while alive, make 

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:22.251
 Every moment count but do not rush. Enjoy your time. As Salladhor SAAN said: It is that 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.687
 He races through life to his grave. 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.215
 Do what you love, spend time with their loved ones and be grateful, because, as Martin relentlessly 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.363
 Shows, any moment can be the last in your life. 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.700
 Take the ropes of your life and take action. Do not just talk because the words are wind, 

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:43.009
 The wind always blows at the wall, John Snow reminds us that the words are in themselves 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.018
 It makes no sense unless we put the work behind it. 

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:53.086
 Act now and do not let fear control you. As Aria Stark knows the man who fears losing 

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:59.118
 Already lost. Cuts deeper fear of swords. Courage easy when you have no fear. 

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:03.091
 It's those who are brave in the face of it, and who stand above the rest. 

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:08.192
 Chaos is not a hole. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb up fail and did not get on 

00:03:09.092 --> 00:03:14.150
 Try again. The fall breaks them. Some chance is given on the climb. They refused, 

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:21.057
 They cling to a world or gods or love. Illusions. Just a real ladder. 

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:28.054
 Boarding is all there is. Now is the time to climb. Where there is a way, there is a way out. 

00:03:29.048 --> 00:03:30.051
 morghulis Valar.
