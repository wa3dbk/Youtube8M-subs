00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.130 
used to make beer for not actually going
to<00:00:16.189> brew<00:00:16.340> a<00:00:16.369> batch<00:00:16.580> right<00:00:16.849> now<00:00:17.029> we<00:00:17.720> also<00:00:17.869> have

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
to brew a batch right now we also have

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.749 
to brew a batch right now we also have
another<00:00:18.349> video<00:00:18.680> showing<00:00:18.980> how<00:00:19.099> our<00:00:19.399> software

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
another video showing how our software

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.940 
another video showing how our software
works<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:20.660> that<00:00:20.930> is<00:00:21.079> a<00:00:21.110> separate<00:00:21.649> one<00:00:21.770> from

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
works and that is a separate one from

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.769 
works and that is a separate one from
this<00:00:22.160> video<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:23.090> what<00:00:23.239> we're<00:00:23.360> going<00:00:23.450> to<00:00:23.540> do<00:00:23.630> now

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
this video so what we're going to do now

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.210 
this video so what we're going to do now
is<00:00:24.020> begin<00:00:24.290> by<00:00:24.439> heating<00:00:24.619> up<00:00:24.800> our<00:00:24.919> straight

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
is begin by heating up our straight

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.429 
is begin by heating up our straight
water<00:00:25.430> for<00:00:26.119> example<00:00:26.480> some<00:00:26.689> recipes<00:00:27.169> call<00:00:27.410> for

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
water for example some recipes call for

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.429 
water for example some recipes call for
a<00:00:27.649> single<00:00:28.009> infusion<00:00:28.369> mash<00:00:28.759> at<00:00:29.050> 153<00:00:30.050> degrees

a single infusion mash at 153 degrees
based<00:00:31.369> on<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:31.640> results<00:00:32.000> of<00:00:32.059> our<00:00:32.180> strength

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
based on the results of our strength

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.209 
based on the results of our strength
temperature<00:00:32.870> calculator<00:00:33.380> we<00:00:33.649> will<00:00:33.890> need<00:00:34.070> to

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
temperature calculator we will need to

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.400 
temperature calculator we will need to
heat<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.520> water<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:34.880> 163<00:00:35.780> in<00:00:35.960> order<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.260> hit

heat the water to 163 in order to hit
that<00:00:36.560> target<00:00:36.830> so<00:00:37.520> we<00:00:37.700> will<00:00:37.820> enter<00:00:37.940> that<00:00:38.180> into

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
that target so we will enter that into

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.590 
that target so we will enter that into

I<00:02:00.950> really<00:02:01.340> had<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.490> tell<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:01.880> was<00:02:02.000> how<00:02:02.150> much

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
I really had to tell it was how much

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.510 
I really had to tell it was how much
water<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:02.600> have<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:03.200> what<00:02:03.350> temperature<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.800> want

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.580

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
ok can I start now yeah it's the heat

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.620 
ok can I start now yeah it's the heat

some<00:02:21.170> bubbles<00:02:21.320> coming<00:02:21.740> off<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.980> heating

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
some bubbles coming off the heating

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.970 
some bubbles coming off the heating
element<00:02:25.930> like<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.080> shows<00:02:27.260> here<00:02:27.530> how<00:02:27.650> much<00:02:27.770> time

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
element like it shows here how much time

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.980 
element like it shows here how much time
is<00:02:28.100> left<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.460> what<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> temperature<00:02:29.150> is

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.630 

you'll<00:02:36.620> need<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.860> stir<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.190> water<00:02:37.400> with

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
you'll need to stir the water with

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.460 
you'll need to stir the water with
something<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.900> order<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.200> get<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.440> best

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
something in order to get the best

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.320 
something in order to get the best
temperature<00:02:40.070> measurement<00:02:40.490> it's<00:02:40.820> common<00:02:41.240> to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
temperature measurement it's common to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.970 
temperature measurement it's common to
develop<00:02:41.720> hot<00:02:41.870> spots<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.440> your<00:02:42.590> temperature

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
develop hot spots and your temperature

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:56.110 
develop hot spots and your temperature
probe<00:02:43.190> might<00:02:43.370> not<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.910> one

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.509 

okay<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.170> should<00:02:57.230> almost<00:02:57.470> be<00:02:57.680> done<00:02:57.950> there's

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
okay it should almost be done there's

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.850 
okay it should almost be done there's
just<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.790> few<00:02:58.970> seconds<00:02:59.299> left<00:02:59.739> okay<00:03:00.739> I'm

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
just a few seconds left okay I'm

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.420 
just a few seconds left okay I'm
stirring<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.250> up<00:03:01.340> how<00:03:01.549> did<00:03:01.610> we<00:03:01.790> do<00:03:02.650> 30<00:03:03.650> 163<00:03:04.400> I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
stirring it up how did we do 30 163 I

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.729 
stirring it up how did we do 30 163 I
think<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.760> got<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.080> excellent<00:03:06.080> now<00:03:06.590> if<00:03:06.650> we

think you got it excellent now if we

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.199 
think you got it excellent now if we
were<00:03:06.890> really<00:03:07.040> making<00:03:07.250> beer<00:03:07.640> we<00:03:07.909> would<00:03:08.030> put

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
were really making beer we would put

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.030 
were really making beer we would put
this<00:03:08.299> into<00:03:08.510> our<00:03:08.599> mash<00:03:08.900> tun<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.739> can<00:03:09.890> see

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
this into our mash tun so you can see

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.680 
this into our mash tun so you can see
this<00:03:10.190> was<00:03:10.340> very<00:03:10.430> easy<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.879> do<00:03:11.030> without<00:03:11.360> using

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
this was very easy to do without using

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.720 
this was very easy to do without using
