00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
his life which is a very bizarre thing

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.890 
his life which is a very bizarre thing
to<00:01:39.920> do<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.060> course<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.690> thing<00:01:41.870> about

performing<00:01:42.710> life<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.430> every<00:01:44.500> situation

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
performing life is that every situation

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.530 
performing life is that every situation
is<00:01:45.560> slightly<00:01:45.710> different<00:01:46.130> every<00:01:46.970> audience<00:01:47.270> is

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
is slightly different every audience is

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.810 
is slightly different every audience is
different<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.140> think<00:01:49.070> sometimes<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.520> audience

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
different I think sometimes the audience

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.550 
different I think sometimes the audience
forget<00:01:50.150> how<00:01:50.299> much<00:01:50.510> of<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.780> part<00:01:51.049> they<00:01:51.260> play

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
forget how much of a part they play

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.550 
forget how much of a part they play
certainly<00:01:52.490> with<00:01:52.670> me<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.119> really<00:01:53.990> really<00:01:54.290> rely

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
certainly with me I really really rely

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.100 
certainly with me I really really rely
on<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.920> audience<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.390> feed<00:01:56.780> off<00:01:56.930> the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
on the audience and to feed off the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.010 
on the audience and to feed off the
audience<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.799> make<00:01:57.979> each<00:01:58.220> evening<00:01:59.020> different

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
audience to make each evening different

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.649 
audience to make each evening different
to<00:02:00.950> make<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.340> vibe<00:02:01.580> in<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.880> atmosphere<00:02:02.330> every

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
to make the vibe in the atmosphere every

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.590 
to make the vibe in the atmosphere every
evening<00:02:02.810> unique<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.580> for<00:02:04.909> example<00:02:04.970> plane<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.540> a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
evening unique so for example plane to a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.969 
evening unique so for example plane to a
seated<00:02:05.900> audience<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.439> very<00:02:06.680> different<00:02:06.830> to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
seated audience is very different to

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.050 
seated audience is very different to
plant<00:02:07.280> with<00:02:07.460> standing<00:02:07.850> audience<00:02:09.489> so<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:10.939> know

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
plant with standing audience so you know

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.429 
plant with standing audience so you know
some<00:02:11.299> nights<00:02:11.540> can<00:02:11.870> be<00:02:12.939> more<00:02:13.939> routine<00:02:14.540> than

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
some nights can be more routine than

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.710 
some nights can be more routine than
others<00:02:15.739> but<00:02:16.430> if<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.670> audience<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.180> special

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
others but if the audience is special

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.539 
others but if the audience is special
then<00:02:18.049> they<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.439> really<00:02:18.650> lift<00:02:18.830> us<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.280> give<00:02:19.430> us

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
then they can really lift us to give us

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.449 
then they can really lift us to give us
special<00:02:19.989> special<00:02:20.989> performance<00:02:21.500> with<00:02:22.280> their

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
special special performance with their

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.190 
special special performance with their
particular<00:02:22.670> place<00:02:23.030> where<00:02:23.269> using<00:02:23.840> through

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
really changed and I think we were all

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.210 
really changed and I think we were all
very<00:04:10.629> disappointed<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.470> band<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.919> the<00:04:12.010> label

very disappointed the band and the label
and<00:04:12.790> then<00:04:13.720> suddenly<00:04:14.229> I<00:04:14.349> think<00:04:14.739> things<00:04:14.979> started

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
and then suddenly I think things started

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.409 
and then suddenly I think things started

independent label but I don't

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.709 
independent label but I don't

necessarily think that it was because of
that<00:04:34.959> I<00:04:34.989> think<00:04:35.110> actually<00:04:35.499> it's<00:04:35.889> down<00:04:36.129> to<00:04:36.369> down

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
that I think actually it's down to down

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.409 
that I think actually it's down to down
to<00:04:37.089> a<00:04:37.119> couple<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.479> things<00:04:37.589> firstly<00:04:38.589> I<00:04:39.419> think

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.839 
to a couple of things firstly I think
there<00:04:40.509> has<00:04:40.659> been<00:04:40.869> a<00:04:40.929> very<00:04:41.110> strong<00:04:42.069> shift<00:04:42.550> in
