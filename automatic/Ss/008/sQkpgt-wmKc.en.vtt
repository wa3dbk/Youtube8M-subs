00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 and what happens lead to that through and home 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.040
 we are here in the world of ironman and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.400
 Well, let's make a snow generator 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.990
 as you saw in the title this many no 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.519
 they know how to do it and then there is one 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.020
 they wrote the chapter here of how 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.850
 do the generator so we're going to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.439
 do it for those who do not know our 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 new the line on the channel no and that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.720
 they are looking for a snow generator 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.580
 infinite for survival so 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.900
 basically we're going to busy I say and we're going 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.380
 to occupy the materials that are in my 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.800
 hand 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.020
 the slab the peak the snow the pumpkins 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 and obviously the shovel to be able 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.270
 pick up the snow 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.760
 this tutorial is simple, that's why 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.980
 I do not take long but it has a small 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.199
 problem if we do it outside look at it 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.570
 It has to be like this we put two snow 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.690
 around we place the slabs in the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.059
 snow from above 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.320
 and obviously we put what is the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.320
 head to make the cole 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.829
 but the problem is that if 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.780
 we do outdoors in these hours and 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.070
 that in this update the golems are 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.070
 die, look 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.970
 if they die alone by the same sun it is not 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.100
 say for the sun or for being the air 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.960
 free but I wanted to do the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.940
 It shows that we are a bit short for the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.140
 generator that is this remove a level at 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.590
 around where the goal is 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.159
 example here here we go to a square of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.069
 3 x 3 no 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.319
 already removing this we would have the swimmer 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.390
 ready does not do is place the golem inside 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.190
 and then the golem will always give us what 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 what is this infinite snow 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.730
 we remove it with the shovel and then never 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.560
 the golem will die and pure snow 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.780
 to be able to have what snow is 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.330
 finite we have to go to a cave in the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.340
 caves do not die the goals but let's go 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.890
 to place here 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.619
 here he had already made another generator and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.689
 done is already very golden friend this what 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.030
 we occupied for my ironman house series 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.289
 what are we doing so well 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.359
 let's kill him so they can see that there's no 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.000
 scams that maybe this I've 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.039
 thrown or something because now we're going to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.030
 put the 12 snows and the pumpkin for 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.640
 that they see that there is no jump to this 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.970
 same side and we already have our friend 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.160
 golem and then the tutorial is done 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.750
 this is for xbox I do not know if 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.299
 also work for pc but that 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.849
 that does not hold you anymore here comes the 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.459
 snow will never stop decaying 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.440
 because the golem is stepping in there and then 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.620
 practically the golem leaves paths of 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.569
 snow as you will know 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.730
 and well, well, I hope there will be 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.209
 liked this tutorial will serve them something 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.170
 to the new ones who are seeing these 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.560
 I suggest that you subscribe because there 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.150

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.830
 which we all get in a little time 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.480
 here I had many things to be 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.940
 well, thanks for watching the video 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.739
 I'm homes and I want more tutorials 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.870
 as well you can grab to know in the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.510
 comments and then a little hand up 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.030
 it would help a lot in the channel and nothing 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.519
