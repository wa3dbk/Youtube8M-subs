a second now his dreadlocks are
basically<00:00:32.040> ties<00:00:35.780> on<00:00:36.780> both<00:00:37.320> sides<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
I think does a deadlock I don't know

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.900 
I think does a deadlock I don't know
what<00:00:44.430> they're<00:00:44.550> called<00:00:44.809> care<00:00:46.640> that's<00:00:47.640> right

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
tripod and then you draw a light line

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.499 
tripod and then you draw a light line
under<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.379> the<00:02:08.649> opposite<00:02:09.190> side<00:02:09.640> way<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.360> the

under it the opposite side way of the
last<00:02:10.750> top<00:02:11.470> card<00:02:11.709> I<00:02:11.920> make<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.790> light<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.810> his

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
last top card I make it light and his

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.440 
last top card I make it light and his
nose<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.799> slanted<00:02:15.340> down<00:02:15.549> line<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.239> his

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.660 
nose is just a slanted down line and his
mouth<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:17.250> perf<00:02:18.250> line<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:23.650> his<00:02:24.129> hat<00:02:24.340> which

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
mouth is perf line now for his hat which

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.220 
mouth is perf line now for his hat which
you<00:02:24.849> just<00:02:25.000> branch<00:02:25.299> off<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.780> make<00:02:25.959> one<00:02:26.200> little

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
you just branch off you make one little

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.630 
you just branch off you make one little
curve<00:02:27.190> area<00:02:28.379> then<00:02:29.379> you<00:02:29.560> bring<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:30.010> down<00:02:30.190> round

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
curve area then you bring it down round

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.140 
curve area then you bring it down round
it<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:32.319> here<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.129> have<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.400> basically<00:02:33.640> make

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
it and here you have to basically make

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.210 
it and here you have to basically make
sort<00:02:34.569> of<00:02:34.660> like<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.930> triangle<00:02:35.260> at<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.590> end<00:02:35.860> to

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
sort of like a triangle at the end to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.150 
sort of like a triangle at the end to
make<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.549> look<00:02:36.730> like<00:02:36.879> it's<00:02:37.090> bending

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
make it look like it's bending

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.970 
make it look like it's bending
now<00:02:39.160> for<00:02:39.430> his<00:02:39.549> body<00:02:39.819> you've<00:02:40.299> drawn<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.599> triangle

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
now for his body you've drawn a triangle

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.830 
now for his body you've drawn a triangle
symbolizing<00:02:41.980> hand<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.250> back<00:02:42.480> from<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.599> side

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
symbolizing hand the back from the side

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.539 
symbolizing hand the back from the side
of<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.440> draw<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.620> curved<00:02:45.069> line<00:02:45.190> coming

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
of that you draw a curved line coming

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.920 
of that you draw a curved line coming
down<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.150> make<00:02:46.840> sugar<00:02:47.110> sleeves<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:47.890> his<00:02:48.010> arms

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
down and make sugar sleeves for his arms

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.500 
down and make sugar sleeves for his arms
I'll<00:02:49.930> be<00:02:50.109> drawing<00:02:50.290> us<00:02:50.470> arm<00:02:50.680> bend<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
I'll be drawing us arm bend it so the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.599 
I'll be drawing us arm bend it so the
rectangle<00:02:53.349> then<00:02:53.530> curved<00:02:53.859> at<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.099> end<00:02:54.250> and

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
rectangle then curved at the end and

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.030 
rectangle then curved at the end and
then<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:54.879> that<00:02:55.000> rectangle<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.900> his<00:02:56.560> hands

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
then in that rectangle and his hands

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.130 
then in that rectangle and his hands
because<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:58.180> you've<00:02:58.390> seen<00:02:58.569> any<00:02:58.750> other<00:02:58.870> I

because if you've seen any other I

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.990 
because if you've seen any other I
described<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.829> with<00:02:59.980> being<00:03:00.160> popsicle<00:03:00.730> sticks

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
described it with being popsicle sticks

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.680 
described it with being popsicle sticks
on<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.269> rectangle<00:03:03.120> from<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.239> letters<00:03:04.480> leave

the middle and another inside then is
Outernet<00:03:14.859> I<00:03:15.099> drew<00:03:15.459> facing<00:03:15.970> out<00:03:16.150> since<00:03:17.019> this<00:03:17.109> is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
Outernet I drew facing out since this is

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.030 
Outernet I drew facing out since this is
a<00:03:17.260> long<00:03:17.440> triangle

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
a long triangle

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.699 
a long triangle
I'm<00:03:18.130> not<00:03:18.430> triangle<00:03:18.819> rectangle<00:03:19.470> fabric<00:03:20.470> shapes

I'm not triangle rectangle fabric shapes

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.099 
I'm not triangle rectangle fabric shapes
apparently<00:03:21.250> then<00:03:22.030> another<00:03:22.269> hand<00:03:22.540> except<00:03:22.989> this

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
apparently then another hand except this

then<00:03:59.819> you<00:03:59.970> do<00:04:00.150> chin<00:04:00.750> linked<00:04:01.079> thanks<00:04:01.739> for

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
then you do chin linked thanks for

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:10.190 
then you do chin linked thanks for
