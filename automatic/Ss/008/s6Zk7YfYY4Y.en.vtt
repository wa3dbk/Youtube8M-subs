00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.610
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.860
 welcome to this new video speaks to you 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.080
 about 3.001 and good on this occasion 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.090
 I have a guy or a council 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.920
 for those who already have installed in 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.690
 your computer the new operating system 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.180
 from windows 8 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.760
 well I think that most of them will be 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.760
 realized what happens when shutting down 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.320
 windows 8 what 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.670
 good 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.890
 all he does is put the system 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.520
 of the wintering state as well 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.829
 say what I mean with this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.090
 windows 8 to its new features 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.670
 that according to brings has said that this 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.830
 new system turns on and off 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.620
 much faster than any other 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:59.860
 windows system this good in such 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.020
 degree is a lie because because 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.870
 when you turn off your windows 8 the only thing 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.240
 you are doing is to put you 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.550
 your computer in hibernation or 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.410
 is suspending it only but the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.270
 computer never turns off the computer 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.160
 still on 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.250
 it's as if you just closed session and 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.600
 ready ok some will have noticed 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.560
 some did not know this but good is a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.200
 feature that comes by default 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.980
 windows 8 when installing it ok and obviously 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.020
 because this is consuming you more more this 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.090
 electricity and all this and it's something that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.830
 we do not want truth because in 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.170
 this case we would have all the time 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.410
 our computer turned on so 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.410
 good for those who did not know well here 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.150
 is this information and well I will show you 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.770
 how to do so that when you 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.530
 give the turn off button on your windows 8 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.440
 shut off completely and do not enter a 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.400
 state of suspension of the mass ok and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.660
 good 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.460
 disable this option let's go to 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.400
 here to the top right of 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.760
 our computer and let's go to the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.960
 last part where it says configuration 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.840
 now we're going to go to the option of 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.680
 this control panel window 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.600
 control Panel 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.120
 let's go where the system says and 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.280
 security should not have to see 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.750
 category if you do not have with the big 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.520
 small icons change the category 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.710
 so they can follow these steps that 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.230
 I'm giving them ok we're going to go to 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.370
 system and security here we are going to enter 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.320
 to the option that says energy options 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.660
 once being in this window we are going to 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.970
 go from the left side in the categories 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.920
 that we have here in the third that says 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.770
 choose the behavior of the buttons 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.080
 Start and stop 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.080
 ok now this is the window that we 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.370
 interested to us as you can see here 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.830
 it says when you press the start button 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.020
 off we will shut down the computer because 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.330
 As I tell you this is a lie only 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.010
 will suspend it by pressing the button 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.700
 of suspension is not going to suspend is what 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.500
 same ok 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.750
 what we want is that what 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.150
 turn off completely and not have to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.180
 be spending electricity now here 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.670
 down has an option that says in 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.170
 off configuration that there is a 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.020
 option that says activate quick start 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.690
 what is recommended or what does that put you 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.630
 windows 8 but as I told you it's a lie 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.160
 you just follow these steps allows 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.960
 start your team faster 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.120
 after the shutdown does not affect the 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.830
 restart because it says it does not affect the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.260
 restart because when restarting obviously 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.120
 if the computer is turned off completely and 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.430
 have to reload everything and the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.650
 put us to pay only us 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.810
 suspend the computer we can the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.210
 computer is still on at the moment 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.060
 of re- igniting the supposedly 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.980
 you do not need to upload files again 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.650
 it makes surprises faster I hope that I 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.380
 is explaining well but good now 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.200
 we see that this option we can not 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.220
 mark the uncheck for now what 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.050
 we have to do is 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.360
 in the here to the top part where 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.310
 he says change the configuration 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.740
 currently not available what would this be 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.920
 we give you a click and it will allow us 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.230
 change some continuations ok now 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.680
 what we are going to do is deactivate this 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.690
 option that I told you before 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.519
 so that the equipment is turned off normally 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.000
 now we are going to give you in saving changes 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.600
 and we will return to this window 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.480
 previous 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.130
 let's go again to choose 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.460
 behavior of the start buttons 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.470
 and off and we see that down here we do not 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.060
 let's change nothing again the 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.270
 configuration but we already have it 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.840
 disabled so by turning our 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.120
 system let's turn it off completely 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.630
 it is not going to be suspended anymore, as I say it is 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.630
 energy saving enough because 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.360
 Well, I'm going to extend it longer and 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.190
 I explained how to have that state this but 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.400
 as you can see it is quite useful this 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.500
 this guy this advice that I bring you 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.360
 and well I told you for those who do not 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.689
 they knew then I hope they take into account and 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.330
 do these steps 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.490
 Ah yes yes 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.710
 undo the video, do not forget 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.250
 leave your like leave a comment 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.139
 and good any doubt anything 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.020
 that does not work for you or something let me know 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.560
 and if I can do something if you can the other 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:25.979
 video I gladly do it and good 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.979
 see you until the next video chao
