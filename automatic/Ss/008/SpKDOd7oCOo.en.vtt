 good this week's video is for 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.710
 that between you and me we discover 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:23.990
 We deciphered why we do so many 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.150
 boludeces and yet with doing 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.130
 we repeat them and sometimes in the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.019
 same course of one minute we repeat 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.699
 times three million times more or 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.920
 less for that reason today I bring you the five 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.629
 more boludas things that we do all and 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.309
 we all do 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.840
 and I want the comments to leave me 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.879
 some explanation of why we do 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.039
 these bullshit and the answers more 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.289
 I'm going to read them in a video in 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.670

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.620

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.510
 account if there was visibility like this 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.480
 as of the boludeces is undoubtedly 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.210
 would be the first commandment is like the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 universal law you will open the refrigerator and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.160
 you are looking for something that you obviously do not have but 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.559
 it does not end there high that you hit average 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.780
 turn around and go back to look for something that 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.790
 you looked and you did not have and for 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.470
 make sure you go back to look for it and 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.450
 obviously 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.500
 what are you looking for in paparulo fridge 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.660
 you are looking for the chocotorta that you 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.160
 draw that there is not nothing enough cut it 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.810
 the second you want to do the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.150
 rapier and I'm not talking about the diop program 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.190
 or if a little kiss in case I talk about you 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.380
 you put this on your ex and you commit the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.150
 error that error that commits if it ends 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.060
 everything starts this wants your ex and you 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.680
 it goes wrong it nails you to be seen and you say no 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.050
 I put him like the fucking mother and not 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.970
 happy with that you get the likes and 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.650
 because that's a asshole you turn it to 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.590
 put you only have to be locked in alive 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.300
 and very down far down very down because 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.820
 Even if you take it out, your heart gets there 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.180
 and see it in this he declared me totally 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.880
 I'm fan like that with a fan 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.369
 I'm a fan of like a topic discover a 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.479
 new theme of some band and listen 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.550
 once many times 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.410
 you listen a thousand times in an hour 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.900
 I had been dreaming the next day 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.450
 days a day the next day I do it myself 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.429
 you are up to date a day the next day you 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.630
 you turn disgust I do not want you to 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.280
 there is sounding the theme so get me out 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.140
 the extra Nestor theme 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.420
 the house of the chinese gastro person the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.290
 phone attend and you start to 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.100
 you walk walked walking walking 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.080
 walking walking walking walking walking 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.730
 walking in my opinion is because we want 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.080
 that the insurance grip more pointed than the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.190
 our brain starts to carburize more 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.540
 quick because acting that costs me so much 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.250
 sometimes record the videos because it is not 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.930
 walking is still can not record 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.550
 when you stand still presidents or walk 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.120
 the words leave me faster and 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.220
 stigmas and the last of these five that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.650
 suit in which I declare myself totally 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.709
 guilty you buy a horror movie 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.950
 of those that you shit even in the legs 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.000
 and what makes you wash your 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.040
 two in the afternoon, full day and there with everything 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.300
 your family turning around you 're never going to 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.610

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.470
