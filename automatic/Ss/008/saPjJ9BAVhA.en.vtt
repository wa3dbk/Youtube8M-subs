00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
that I made recently the only thing that

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.420 
that I made recently the only thing that
does<00:00:16.109> make<00:00:16.379> them<00:00:16.619> similar<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:18.380> yellow<00:00:20.180> grey

does make them similar is yellow grey

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:35.990 
does make them similar is yellow grey
blue<00:00:24.140> water<00:00:27.320> yeah<00:00:34.460> if<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.820> haven't

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
recognized them yet edit this is a g1

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.459 
recognized them yet edit this is a g1
sea<00:00:45.989> spray<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:47.640> modified<00:00:48.450> quite<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
sea spray but modified quite a bit and

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.020 
sea spray but modified quite a bit and
here<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:54.020> g1<00:00:55.020> completely

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
here we have g1 completely

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.020 
here we have g1 completely
unrecognizable<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.109> fact<00:00:59.030> punch

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
unrecognizable but it is in fact punch

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
unrecognizable but it is in fact punch
counterpunch<00:01:03.110> ok<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.830> since<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.820> sort<00:01:06.030> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
counterpunch ok so since this is sort of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.090 
counterpunch ok so since this is sort of
a<00:01:06.210> combined<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:08.450> I'm<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.740> to

a combined with you I'm just going to
skip<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> transformations<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
skip the transformations and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.320 
skip the transformations and

spray<00:01:20.690> in<00:01:20.930> his<00:01:21.590> robot<00:01:22.040> for<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:23.650> surprisingly

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
spray in his robot for and surprisingly

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.140 
spray in his robot for and surprisingly
he<00:01:24.979> has<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.190> large<00:01:26.320> gun<00:01:27.320> right<00:01:27.619> here<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:28.040> know<00:01:28.640> sea

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
he has a large gun right here I know sea

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.020 
he has a large gun right here I know sea
spray<00:01:29.390> doesn't<00:01:29.540> have<00:01:29.840> one<00:01:30.050> but<00:01:31.030> the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
spray doesn't have one but the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.830 
spray doesn't have one but the
transformation<00:01:32.690> I<00:01:32.780> figured<00:01:33.110> out<00:01:33.460> he<00:01:34.460> did<00:01:34.840> this

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
transformation I figured out he did this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.740 
transformation I figured out he did this
slid<00:01:36.830> between<00:01:37.040> this<00:01:37.550> gap<00:01:37.850> right<00:01:38.060> here<00:01:38.119> in<00:01:38.540> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
slid between this gap right here in the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.410 
slid between this gap right here in the
vehicle<00:01:39.440> mode<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:41.560> yeah<00:01:42.560> racing<00:01:43.340> flag<00:01:43.580> still

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420

where it was and if you don't like that

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.540 
where it was and if you don't like that
take<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.550> off<00:01:46.640> hold<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.390> down<00:01:48.039> you<00:01:49.039> wouldn't

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
take it off hold this down you wouldn't

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.779 
take it off hold this down you wouldn't
notice<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:50.149> there<00:01:50.300> ever<00:01:50.479> was<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.869> flag<00:01:51.789> except

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
notice that there ever was a flag except

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:01.169 
notice that there ever was a flag except
for<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.500> flag<00:01:56.740> now<00:01:58.720> punch<00:01:59.720> counterpunch

from<00:03:21.019> animated<00:03:23.050> syndrome<00:03:24.050> here<00:03:24.379> a<00:03:25.220> smaller

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
from animated syndrome here a smaller

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.720 
from animated syndrome here a smaller
more<00:03:27.050> compact<00:03:27.290> robot<00:03:28.010> turn

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
more compact robot turn

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.589 
more compact robot turn
being<00:03:29.030> into<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> more<00:03:29.720> lanky<00:03:30.170> taller<00:03:30.470> robot<00:03:32.260> so

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599
