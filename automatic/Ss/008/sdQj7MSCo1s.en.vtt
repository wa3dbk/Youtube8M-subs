00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.510
 here we have the hard disks 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.220
 and now let's see how we are going to comment 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.829
 here we have a first hard drive that is 40 pounds is a follow 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.079
 The first thing we want to see is 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.300
 in what way this law this mode 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.019
 master you see here 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.560
 this end 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.579
 what to see what the union marked 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.869
 indicates that this bet as master master 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.980
 as we know because here there is an inscription a serigraphy 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.690
 to see if you can see there is highly 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.410
 that describe how it has to be and how it has to work and where it fell 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.540
 for the pin to work as master of little ballack mosley 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.929
 here you can see better piece 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:44.060
 in this other is a cane 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.609
 and ethically explains no 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.629
 then in this case it has no fixed pins 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.510
 it does not have any pins placed because it is in what slave mode a fear is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.980
 reads vale 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 and it's not to connect these two hard drives 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.470
 let's do a practical demonstration 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.710
 what we do is connect the first one like this 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.540
 how am I doing and now 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.210
 and then the next 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.870
 to suppose one of the buses over 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.870
 and has connected like this 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.370
 this would be the clear master configuration 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.300
 I know that this is more seen than what was operated 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.860
 there will be people who had not seen it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.310
 it is already connected 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.730
 then we inside the pc 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.650
 you have to have it like that 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.560
 how am I doing it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.140
 the first is the teacher 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.180
 and the second one is the slave worth 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.870
 and both are connected to the motherboard 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.329
 by the data strip 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.230
 for the lille are worth 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.290
 remember that the one above 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.510
 oo 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.750
 if what you need what you put them under you have to twist the belt but 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.930
 it is better to put it like that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.420
 because if you do not suffer the fringe you do not have to have any 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.909
 no put together 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.359
 that would work as is law 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.640
 the red mayor of merlo 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.070
 to work as a master 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 and now to connect them inside 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.709
 so for the construction they are efe 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.709
 so now we take it out 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.749
 we do not take out 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.749
 we practice very carefully 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.699
 what we are going to do is mount the first hard drive 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.509
 as I said before 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:28.230
 we had put a fan so that precisely exclude level 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.209
 so that it closes the hard drive 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.879
 if the hard drive stays cooler 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.229
 working us 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.629
 this is a hard drive testing 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.409
 See how it looks 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.369
 does not touch and loose do not worry because 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.169
 here there are no distracting measures 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.529
 what I started where he came by the ankle 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:52.469
 and to what extent the driver himself did not exist even though he no longer plays the league 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.199
 local in quito 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.339
 6 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:58.439
 there 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.439
 he squeezed 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.889
 we already have the speech here 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.129
 Now we put the following in Shanghai 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.779
 I shared harris stage 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.159
 we put on the same thing 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.269
 with a screw 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.429
 we fix 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.429
 to where it has to be 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:24.869
 let's cosmos its pulse 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.269
 with one with his tremendous 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.549
 and we already have a fixed 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.549
 our second album 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.029
 I think we have to do is cut the hands of data 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.569
 and the ivie 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.109
 the primary to see if we can do it 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.219
 otherwise to make it look clearer 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.379
 so a lot of light 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.669
 so I would like 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.669
 modest 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.899
 moment 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.439
 good night the rail days fine 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.449
 antecedent 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.679
 to see if we can see it from the sel the blue slot 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.249
 but who knows 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.929
 sometimes not 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.419
 Well that's where we're going to get through cable and 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.180
 if we do not put 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.180
 apple because you have to hand 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.180
 to understand is that we were very difficult 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.660
 I have a lot of practice pedro, I'm not god either, there are my 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.289
 if you can not see comfortably 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.099
 there is 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.529
 he is already 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.840
 here we have a puncture lunge and pith 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.080
 you have to make sure that every day 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.180
 and now as I told you the same configuration that you lived outside 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.120
 we are born inside sales 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.349
 what we are going to do is going to be now 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.349
 the ine 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.610
 we promise 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.099
 analysis with a hand costs a lot to make these things 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.740
 understand it 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.129
 so no 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.240
 a few demanding months 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.949
 that some say oo please 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.949
 what is being done with one hand 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.499
 with 'the warm' of the works 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.919
 we just want to share 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.740
 remember the closest one leaves the motherboard 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.289
 and is that here in this case 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.849
 if it gets here it's first because after which it was another one you see and then 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.800
 hangs a small one that is for the floppy disk drive but as we are not going to use 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.270
 floppy drives because they are out of phase 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.789
 because we use the first one, we connect it to the hard disk just like 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.809
 I do 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:39.120
 no problem 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.120
 there was plugged in many and the next 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:46.930
 the following also in fact famous above 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.930
 we already have connect our hard drives worth 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.919
 Attentive eye we are missing 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.289
 the fans 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.800
 no fans are missing 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.990
 we have a couple of lying adores 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.080
 which are the ones that are going to benefit and we have them with this one 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.080
 create it's time for us to leave here again 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.529
 we have one of them then 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:12.529
 we take this I can hardly do so 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.759
 the bucks 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.080
 moment 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.080
 see good note here I think it's 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.569
 this year we're going 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.589
 we are not going to agree 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:30.789
 with a bit of luck entrance 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.389
 and up to here we have our first connected fan I do not know if not 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.360
 you can see 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.430
 the shock is already connected 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.510
 the fan the first with stays second act 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.919
 we connect it here 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.329
 but that told you that always check the connectors some you know 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.759
 and these electrical connections then do not do with contract because of a pointer 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.520
 of the b heads and especially if these 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.200
 we also medium social fund will go in movements and leave then it is not worth 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.330
 also the hard drives in this case we will not have any problem because 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.389
 it is for 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.099
 to see for fans so we managed to connect very carefully 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:12.210
 and it is that we have see how it has come out 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.210
 you have to come back eternal 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.580
 these some are 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.540
 terrible 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.719
 I swear 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:24.719
 let's hope this is not consulted 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:28.740
 you have to have a certain ability to get this 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.559
 so with this 

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:34.559
 now now guys 6 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:37.629
 life 

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:40.199
 there it is already with him 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:43.199
 and they are already connecting these hard drives 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:45.249
 quietly 

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:47.770
 as can be seen 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.610
 friends the tc 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.619
 practically not 

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:53.550
 as can be seen 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.559
 statute 

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:56.949
 Although it seems a real mess of cables 

00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:59.059
 everything is completely flooded 

00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:02.050
 and it seems to be living to prove it 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.310
 so until next chapter that's where we're going to try the pc 

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.900
 we will install an operating system
