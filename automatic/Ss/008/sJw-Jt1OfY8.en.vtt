you look at this card - for me there is

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.480 
you look at this card - for me there is
in<00:01:06.490> slow-mo<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:08.290> wouldn't<00:01:08.650> find<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:09.100> circuit

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
in slow-mo you wouldn't find a circuit

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.890 
in slow-mo you wouldn't find a circuit
anywhere<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.150> could<00:01:10.270> actually<00:01:10.390> run

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
anywhere that you could actually run

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.800

object like this again this is done for

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.380

that car so the chassis rails the engine
all<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.509> stuff<00:01:22.840> has<00:01:23.080> left<00:01:23.680> an<00:01:23.860> imprint<00:01:24.580> on

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
all of that stuff has left an imprint on

get data from that to create the
information<00:01:42.580> they<00:01:42.700> need<00:01:42.940> now<00:01:43.090> what<00:01:43.270> they'll

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
information they need now what they'll

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.240 
information they need now what they'll
do<00:01:43.600> from<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:43.929> test<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.649> I'll<00:01:44.830> actually<00:01:44.979> go

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
do from this test is I'll actually go

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.160 
do from this test is I'll actually go
and<00:01:45.399> build<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.729> little<00:01:45.880> trolley<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:46.569> that

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
and build a little trolley and that

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.380 
and build a little trolley and that
trolley<00:01:47.530> will<00:01:47.860> replicate<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.729> forces<00:01:49.240> that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
trolley will replicate the forces that

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.899 
trolley will replicate the forces that
that<00:01:49.539> car<00:01:49.780> has<00:01:49.960> put<00:01:50.170> into<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.710> wall<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.759> then

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
that car has put into the wall so then

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.999 
that car has put into the wall so then
they<00:01:52.060> can<00:01:52.119> use<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:52.929> trolley<00:01:53.229> for<00:01:53.740> further

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
they can use that trolley for further

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.919 
they can use that trolley for further
research<00:01:54.550> without<00:01:55.030> having<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.360> use<00:01:55.569> cars<00:01:55.780> and

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
research without having to use cars and

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.359 
research without having to use cars and
look<00:01:56.050> at<00:01:56.140> this<00:01:56.259> they<00:01:56.619> actually<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.009> glass

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
look at this they actually have a glass

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.580 
look at this they actually have a glass
floor<00:01:57.850> underneath<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.450> car<00:01:58.659> so<00:01:58.869> they<00:01:59.289> can<00:01:59.440> see

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
floor underneath the car so they can see

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.109 
floor underneath the car so they can see
what's<00:01:59.770> happening<00:02:00.069> with<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.310> gearbox<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
what's happening with the gearbox the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.510 
what's happening with the gearbox the
engine<00:02:01.840> now<00:02:02.320> as<00:02:02.469> we<00:02:02.590> get<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.860> up-close<00:02:03.280> shot

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
engine now as we get the up-close shot

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.280 
engine now as we get the up-close shot
from<00:02:03.850> underneath<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.390> car<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.750> can<00:02:04.899> see<00:02:05.140> the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
from underneath the car you can see the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.660 
from underneath the car you can see the
different<00:02:05.560> components<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.159> car<00:02:06.399> look<00:02:06.610> at

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
different components of the car look at

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.120 
different components of the car look at
that<00:02:06.729> very<00:02:07.630> specifically<00:02:08.290> leaving<00:02:08.709> imprint

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
that very specifically leaving imprint

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.520 
that very specifically leaving imprint
and<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.489> important<00:02:10.060> data<00:02:10.360> on<00:02:11.140> different

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and that important data on different

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.970 
and that important data on different
parts<00:02:12.070> of<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.280> wall

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.590 

the<00:02:20.980> fascinating<00:02:21.430> thing<00:02:21.580> for<00:02:21.970> me<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.450> that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
the fascinating thing for me is that

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.660 
the fascinating thing for me is that
that<00:02:22.870> research<00:02:23.260> test<00:02:23.710> was<00:02:23.920> not<00:02:24.070> about<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.310> car

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that research test was not about the car

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.760 
that research test was not about the car
or<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:24.970> dummy<00:02:25.300> inside<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.290> was<00:02:26.470> purely

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
or the dummy inside it it was purely

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.160 
or the dummy inside it it was purely
about<00:02:26.890> leaving<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.640> fingerprint<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.630> forces

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
about leaving that fingerprint of forces

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.680 
about leaving that fingerprint of forces
on<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.440> wall<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.580> further<00:02:30.880> research<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.600> be

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
on that wall so further research can be

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.960 
on that wall so further research can be
done<00:02:31.870> all<00:02:32.320> in<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.800> name<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.040> Motorsports

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
done all in the name of Motorsports

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.020 
done all in the name of Motorsports
safety<00:02:34.390> gotta<00:02:34.780> love<00:02:34.990> it
