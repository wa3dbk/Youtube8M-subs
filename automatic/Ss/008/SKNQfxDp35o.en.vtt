pretty much the full roster here in
taking<00:00:13.600> up<00:00:13.719> their<00:00:13.840> heroes<00:00:14.110> but<00:00:14.289> this<00:00:14.920> is

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
taking up their heroes but this is

the<00:00:18.789> Central<00:00:19.060> Ward<00:00:19.210> they<00:00:19.360> won't<00:00:19.600> get<00:00:19.750> the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
the Central Ward they won't get the

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.750 
the Central Ward they won't get the
glimpse<00:00:20.680> they<00:00:20.800> have<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.100> dust<00:00:21.280> them<00:00:21.490> but

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
glimpse they have to dust them but

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.700 
glimpse they have to dust them but
conducting<00:00:22.450> kinetic<00:00:22.780> field<00:00:22.870> still<00:00:23.230> enough<00:00:23.470> to

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
conducting kinetic field still enough to

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.530 
conducting kinetic field still enough to
lock<00:00:23.830> out<00:00:24.310> up<00:00:24.460> for<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.640> first<00:00:24.820> flood<00:00:25.060> and

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
lock out up for the first flood and

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.780 
lock out up for the first flood and
that's<00:00:26.440> going<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:26.620> be<00:00:26.740> just<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.100> pretty<00:00:27.430> solid

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
that's going to be just a pretty solid

along<00:00:47.230> with<00:00:47.470> them<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:49.660> it's<00:00:49.870> just<00:00:50.230> a<00:00:50.320> two

for<00:00:50.649> one<00:00:50.710> for<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.070> carry<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:51.370> say<00:00:51.760> that<00:00:51.970> ihtt

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
for one for the carry I say that ihtt

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.780 
for one for the carry I say that ihtt
are<00:00:53.170> almost<00:00:53.530> happy<00:00:53.890> with<00:00:54.040> that<00:00:54.160> but<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.579> fact

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
are almost happy with that but the fact

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.610 
are almost happy with that but the fact
that<00:00:54.850> they<00:00:55.000> committed<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.450> mid-rotation<00:00:56.110> but

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
that they committed a mid-rotation but

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.250 
that they committed a mid-rotation but
there<00:00:57.160> should<00:00:57.430> be<00:00:57.579> a<00:00:57.610> lawful<00:00:58.360> be<00:00:58.600> workable

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
there should be a lawful be workable

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.380 
there should be a lawful be workable
yeah<00:01:00.010> laughter<00:01:00.489> I<00:01:00.550> click<00:01:00.730> come<00:01:00.910> through<00:01:01.180> and

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
yeah laughter I click come through and

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.150 
yeah laughter I click come through and
it's<00:01:01.989> going<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.140> get<00:01:02.260> some<00:01:02.410> good<00:01:02.559> momentum

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
it's going to get some good momentum

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's going to get some good momentum
back<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.610> way<00:01:03.790> so<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:05.619> all<00:01:05.740> those<00:01:05.860> cool<00:01:06.040> guns

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
back that way so see all those cool guns

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.130 
back that way so see all those cool guns
expense<00:01:06.579> on<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:07.180> back<00:01:07.540> on<00:01:07.719> and<00:01:07.899> they're<00:01:07.990> like

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
expense on the back on and they're like

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.469 
expense on the back on and they're like
fine<00:01:08.680> by<00:01:08.860> me<00:01:08.890> we're<00:01:09.400> gonna<00:01:09.520> go<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.850> dive<00:01:10.270> you

fine by me we're gonna go in dive you

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.030 
fine by me we're gonna go in dive you
and<00:01:10.659> we're<00:01:10.750> gonna<00:01:10.840> kill<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.409> fat<00:01:11.710> but<00:01:11.950> we're

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
and we're gonna kill a fat but we're

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.789 
and we're gonna kill a fat but we're
limb<00:01:12.159> for<00:01:12.280> F<00:01:12.400> well<00:01:12.640> too<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:14.170> good<00:01:14.380> play<00:01:14.620> there

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
limb for F well too so good play there

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.680 
limb for F well too so good play there
if<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.400> glimpse<00:01:15.940> hadn't<00:01:16.270> been<00:01:16.360> using<00:01:16.630> the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
if the glimpse hadn't been using the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.149 
if the glimpse hadn't been using the
bounty<00:01:16.900> hunter<00:01:16.930> earlier<00:01:17.380> they<00:01:17.830> might<00:01:18.130> not

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
bounty hunter earlier they might not

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.800 
bounty hunter earlier they might not
have<00:01:18.400> found<00:01:18.490> such<00:01:18.760> a<00:01:18.790> clean<00:01:19.060> set<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.330> kills<00:01:19.540> but

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
have found such a clean set of kills but

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.930 
have found such a clean set of kills but
they<00:01:20.140> do<00:01:20.200> end<00:01:20.590> up<00:01:20.710> doing<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.190> air<00:01:21.340> tanks

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
they do end up doing it and air tanks

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.399 
they do end up doing it and air tanks
the<00:01:22.030> tower<00:01:22.180> so<00:01:22.390> pretty<00:01:22.570> how<00:01:22.690> can<00:01:22.900> live<00:01:23.080> even

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
the tower so pretty how can live even

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.230 
the tower so pretty how can live even
give<00:01:23.530> them<00:01:23.650> bottles<00:01:23.950> up<00:01:24.100> here<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.850> that's<00:01:25.030> fine

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
give them bottles up here so that's fine

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.270 
give them bottles up here so that's fine
back<00:01:25.479> in<00:01:25.630> mid<00:01:25.780> we<00:01:26.260> do<00:01:26.380> see<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.619> dust<00:01:26.979> come<00:01:27.159> out

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
back in mid we do see a dust come out

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.340 
back in mid we do see a dust come out
onto<00:01:27.700> Kyle<00:01:27.880> Kyle<00:01:28.090> whoa-ho<00:01:28.510> he<00:01:28.869> drops<00:01:29.170> quickly

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
onto Kyle Kyle whoa-ho he drops quickly

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.469 
onto Kyle Kyle whoa-ho he drops quickly
now<00:01:29.650> Westbrook<00:01:30.130> with<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.580> clap<00:01:30.940> now<00:01:31.210> going

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
now Westbrook with the clap now going

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.000 
now Westbrook with the clap now going
for<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.630> split<00:01:31.930> he'll<00:01:32.260> be<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.409> support<00:01:32.860> kill

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
for the split he'll be a support kill

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.620 
for the split he'll be a support kill
but<00:01:33.190> can<00:01:33.369> they<00:01:33.549> get<00:01:33.700> more<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:33.970> think<00:01:34.180> it's<00:01:34.390> super

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
but can they get more I think it's super

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.179 
but can they get more I think it's super
sticks<00:01:34.840> around<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.380> might<00:01:35.590> be<00:01:35.680> able<00:01:35.740> tornado
