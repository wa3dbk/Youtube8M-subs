card and then just brush it over it to
smoothen<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:44.900> out<00:03:45.080> but<00:03:45.650> be<00:03:45.770> careful<00:03:46.160> not<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.400> do

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
smoothen it out but be careful not to do

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.010 
smoothen it out but be careful not to do
one<00:03:46.700> of<00:03:46.730> these<00:03:46.880> numbers<00:03:47.120> were<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.630> like<00:03:47.810> this

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
one of these numbers were you like this

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.410 
one of these numbers were you like this
I<00:03:48.290> think<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.040> want<00:03:49.190> like<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:50.000> then<00:03:50.150> you

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
I think you want like that and then you

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.870 
I think you want like that and then you
pull<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:51.020> like<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.980> then<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:52.700> have<00:03:52.790> to

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
pull it like that and then you have to

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.010 
pull it like that and then you have to
push<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.120> because<00:03:53.480> that's<00:03:53.570> kind<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.840> obvious

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
push it because that's kind of obvious

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.410 
push it because that's kind of obvious
you<00:03:54.380> just<00:03:54.530> kind<00:03:54.770> of<00:03:54.830> want<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.790> make<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.150> nice

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
you just kind of want to make it a nice

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.590 
you just kind of want to make it a nice
smooth<00:03:57.050> motion<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.860> that<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.970> then<00:03:59.330> what<00:03:59.510> is

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
smooth motion like that and then what is

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.570 
smooth motion like that and then what is
going<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.810> show<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.020> earlier<00:04:00.440> it's<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.310> same

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
going to show you earlier it's the same

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.260 
going to show you earlier it's the same
thing<00:04:01.610> like<00:04:02.120> i<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:02.270> did<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:04.280> get<00:04:04.550> a<00:04:04.580> random

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
thing like i just did you get a random

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.350 
thing like i just did you get a random
card<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.989> then<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:07.010> doubled<00:04:07.850> card<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.209> have

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
card and then the doubled card you have

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.449 
card and then the doubled card you have
which<00:04:08.630> is<00:04:08.660> in<00:04:09.050> my<00:04:09.170> case<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.440> king<00:04:09.800> and<00:04:10.010> then

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
which is in my case the king and then

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.180 
which is in my case the king and then
you<00:04:10.580> put<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.760> other<00:04:10.940> King<00:04:11.239> on<00:04:11.420> top<00:04:12.010> but<00:04:13.010> you

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
you put the other King on top but you

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.560 
you put the other King on top but you
they<00:04:13.340> don't<00:04:13.400> see<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.760> obviously<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:14.480> you

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
they don't see this obviously so you

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.979 
they don't see this obviously so you
just<00:04:14.690> put<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.050> cards<00:04:15.380> like<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.810> you

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
just put the cards like this and you

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.890 
just put the cards like this and you
have<00:04:18.169> want<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.560> have<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:19.070> King<00:04:19.400> on<00:04:20.090> bottom

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
have want to have the King on bottom

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.210 
have want to have the King on bottom
okay<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:22.850> walk<00:04:23.060> up<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.330> someone<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.810> say

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
okay so you walk up to someone you say

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.710 
okay so you walk up to someone you say
okay<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.490> top<00:04:25.730> card<00:04:26.060> is<00:04:26.390> the<00:04:27.200> king<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.740> clubs

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
okay the top card is the king of clubs

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.110 
okay the top card is the king of clubs
and<00:04:29.810> then<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:30.560> do<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.800> same<00:04:31.040> thing<00:04:31.340> obviously

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
and then you do the same thing obviously

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.390 
and then you do the same thing obviously
kings<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.750> bottom<00:04:33.140> just<00:04:33.770> going<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.070> brush
