00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.939
 very good to all and senators that such 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.799
 how are you welcome, welcome 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.539
 more time to your technology channel and 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.180
 senna code and good guys today I want 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.070
 talk about the latest version of iOS 8.1 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.170
 point 2 that we received it does 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.090
 few hours is not a version that we 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.410
 they bring very little things really to 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.150
 all those you ask deserve the 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.070
 Not worth updating is not worth it 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.230
 update is a bug fix 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.849
 minimum is a minor update but 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.560
 yes it is true that it brings one thing that 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.480
 it is quite important for all 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.190
 those especially if you buy shades of 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.680
 call on iTunes you know that in 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.690
 iTunes sell music apps and 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.940
 movies is digital but also also 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.170
 They sell ringtones not according to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.700
 makes an error change that when you 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.590
 you bought a ringtone with the 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.470
 time you disappeared good because this 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.870
 IOS version 8.1 point 2 as highlighted 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.700
 Paul comes to correct explicitly 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.320
 this failure so really if you are 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.360
 in previous versions and this failure does not 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.890
 you have suffered it or you do not buy tones in 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.240
 iTunes hears you do not have to 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.190
 update jce do not make any sense 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.660
 okay guys if you want 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.670
 you have this problem of the shades of 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.869
 call obviously if it is a 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.390
 annoyance for you you have to 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.460
 update to 8.1 point 2 and in 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.310
 description of the video I leave a link 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.600
 where giving you there you are going to recover 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.430
 the ringtones you had 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.690
 bought in addition and good value but 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.220
 what about the jailbreak because many 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.470
 of you will surely be good 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.850
 the tie-break time works and if so 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.190
 green tea works which time a 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.570
 principle the official tool does not 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.759
 it worked because they had to 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.350
 update the exploits with which 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.090
 they do the jailbreak they are the same 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.159
 they just had to do some 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.170
 small modification to the application of 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.090
 type therefore we can already say that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.009
 this type jailbreak is perfectly 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.770
 compatible with this latest version of 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.479
 ios 8.1 point two use the same 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.460
 exploits agree that is something 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.649
 that it was easy to detect from some 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.390
 way not though we all did not have them and 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.460
 there was some hacker there 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.229
 had said quite popular that there was 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.670
 made several jailbreaks as it said 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.470
 that was not compatible but good at 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.270
 final has been shown to be yes and that is 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.070
 and in the end he has modified his tool 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.560
 so everything works perfectly 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.450
 but as I say this update of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.130
 ios 8.1 point 2 is an update 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.440
 minor therefore 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 Japan has not covered the exploits that 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.310
 I made the jailbreak in versions 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.489
 previous with the type tool 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.819
 presupposes that when I take out apple ios 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.319
 8.2 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.689
 that maybe we will not see it soon 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.579
 much to see it close the exploits that 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.430
 has used thay and therefore stay the 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.290
 brete time would not be viable in any 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.569
 case we'll see to see if there are more 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.060
 exploit hopefully yes I would like 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.010
 nuance that in the other video I put a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.689
 little to give birth to time and I think 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.760
 just because I think he got a 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.189
 jailbreak at a time where nobody 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.150
 I needed the latest versions of ios 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:46.969
 8.1.1 and 8.1 point 2 do not really contribute 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.439
 nothing ipad 2 yes lapuerta tidbits 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.659
 because it really works a little 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.790
 better but to iphone 4s for all 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.439
 those who still have doubts us 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.739
 Sana'a on the computer we tested code 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:00.019
 8.1.1 and really contribute very little 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.239
 performance improvements for the iphone 4s 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.459
 practically works the same is very 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.199
 sensitive the difference if there is 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.400
 but not good because of this to me - 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.949
 that makes a little bit that had left 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.419
 this is always in a moment that with 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.609
 I at least considered that nobody 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.930
 I needed not then I thought and why 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.699
 They have taken this time and why have 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.769
 saved these exploits to get a 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.959
 good time in helps 8.2 that 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.819
 surely it is more necessary than in 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.890
 these versions 8.1 point 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.540
 but then well I came to think that 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.060
 there could be some kind of malware it seems 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.439
 that they look for is quickly what they did before 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.659
 after that upload the video by 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.999
 course then good said he was 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.530
 sure the time server did not have any 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.109
 type of malware so for the moment 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.900
 it's safe to use it so just 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.010
 I would also like to correct this 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.870
 information that many have thrown to 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.760
 the jugular without knowing or without having 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.159
 mind that I made the video before 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.599
 that we had that information and nothing 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.159
 guys just this inform you a 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.319
 little bit of the actuality of the jailbreak 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.780
 in ios 8 with is here with these 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.519
 tools and nothing that we say goodbye 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.109
 until next time I hope you can 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.120
 support with a I like you already know that we 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.120
 we see in that in puntocom chao spirit
