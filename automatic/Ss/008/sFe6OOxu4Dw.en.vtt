 that we started with the arrival of new 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.150
 titles to our country is a consumer 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.010
 we see ourselves in several dilemmas like that 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.540
 quinteros buy since not all 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.490
 we have the purchasing power to 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.760
 buy all the comics that we like 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.100
 so that gives us three options 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.280
 one to get an employee all that you 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.260

 buy all the titles you like 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.499
 interest to finish watching this video that 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.149
 reflections on well before 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.699
 start if good well identify without 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.710
 class of consumers since we have 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.870
 who bought a correct both for 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.030
 the cover as for the writers 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.460
 by the company or simply because 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.960
 you're a fan of that character so a 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.750
 once you identify what kind of 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.660
 Buyers 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.670
 yes 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.800
 before buying a comment to read 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.510
 internet reviews on the internet you can 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.000
 find hundreds of reviews that you 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.670
 they help a lot to buy a good 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.680
 material and do not waste your money here 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.240
 in the top as we always try to make them 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.030
 of article reviews that ask us 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.700
 so I know our page and see that 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.130
 it suits you two to check the prices 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.080
 normally companies give a list 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.360
 of the price of about the titles that 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.560
 they handle so more and less you give yourself a 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.990
 idea of what you are going to spend 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.970
 weekly or monthly so that it does not 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.260
 you stay without your bus started preferred 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.330
 try to buy in stores 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.460
 specialized in eating I know it is 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.980
 quite complicated for many people 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.470
 who do not live in the df or live in 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.970
 provinces but they must consider the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.710
 next if they buy it in positions of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.500
 newspapers and I do not say that all the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.270
 most people use them they use comics as if 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.490
 they were hanging clothes with 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.190
 tweezers and that obviously mistreats the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.100
 product besides they are exposed 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.650
 in the sun and as you know the sun deteriorates 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.170
 much the ink of the comic and obviously 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.820
 reduces the quality of life of your korrika 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.459
 4 as an additional expense I suggest 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.040
 who buy protective bags to eat 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.310
 and cartons 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.370
 if you do not know more or less how it consists 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.709
 this process of taking care of your comics is 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.810
 natural spiral recently made a video 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.519
 about how all the so do you 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.160
