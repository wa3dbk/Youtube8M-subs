kill death ratio and skill is built game

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.380 
kill death ratio and skill is built game
by<00:01:44.649> game<00:01:44.890> by<00:01:45.159> adding<00:01:45.369> or<00:01:45.670> subtracting<00:01:45.700> from

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
by game by adding or subtracting from

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.139 
by game by adding or subtracting from
your<00:01:46.509> starting<00:01:46.899> skill<00:01:47.170> in<00:01:47.470> other<00:01:48.070> words<00:01:48.340> you

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
your starting skill in other words you

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.670 
your starting skill in other words you
have<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.390> have<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.689> starting<00:01:50.020> skill<00:01:50.380> number

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
have to have a starting skill number

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.770 
have to have a starting skill number
then<00:01:50.890> add<00:01:51.189> in<00:01:51.430> data<00:01:51.640> for<00:01:51.880> game<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:52.659> can

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
then add in data for game and you can

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.289 
then add in data for game and you can
find<00:01:53.020> out<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.380> resulting<00:01:53.860> skill<00:01:54.130> number<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
find out the resulting skill number the

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.850 
find out the resulting skill number the
way<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.570> works<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.990> by<00:01:56.170> normalizing<00:01:56.649> your

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
way this works is by normalizing your

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.649 
way this works is by normalizing your
score<00:01:57.159> per<00:01:57.310> minute<00:01:57.340> kills<00:01:58.030> per<00:01:58.240> minute<00:01:58.509> and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
score per minute kills per minute and

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.569 
score per minute kills per minute and
killed<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.170> death<00:01:59.200> ratio<00:01:59.560> for<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.100> given<00:02:00.369> round

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
killed to death ratio for a given round

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.490 
killed to death ratio for a given round
against<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.540> max<00:02:01.750> value<00:02:02.079> set<00:02:02.320> in<00:02:02.350> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
against the max value set in the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.010 
against the max value set in the
calculation<00:02:03.070> parameters<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:04.570> value<00:02:04.930> is

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
calculation parameters this value is

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.929 
calculation parameters this value is
then<00:02:05.170> weighted<00:02:05.530> twice<00:02:05.860> once<00:02:06.430> for<00:02:06.670> your<00:02:06.759> old

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
then weighted twice once for your old

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.880 
then weighted twice once for your old
skill<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.539> again<00:02:07.840> for<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.140> new<00:02:08.320> round<00:02:08.560> data

skill and again for the new round data

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.949 
skill and again for the new round data
then<00:02:09.640> added<00:02:10.000> together<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.450> calculate<00:02:10.630> your

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
then added together to calculate your

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.440 
then added together to calculate your

this mean sir buckeyes sums this all up
for<00:02:21.670> us<00:02:21.790> at<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.030> end<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.269> post<00:02:22.450> by<00:02:22.720> saying

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
for us at the end of the post by saying

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.800 
for us at the end of the post by saying

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
basically each game you play is compared

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.050 
basically each game you play is compared
to<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.989> theoretically<00:02:26.650> perfect<00:02:27.130> game<00:02:27.790> a
