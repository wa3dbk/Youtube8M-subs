00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
really distracting like I said about the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.390 
really distracting like I said about the
Canadians<00:03:00.960> in<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.170> Bruins<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.710> Hawks<00:03:02.010> took

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
Canadians in the Bruins the Hawks took

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.330 
Canadians in the Bruins the Hawks took
Vancouver<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.300> game<00:03:03.600> 7<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.320> overtime<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.130> little

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
Vancouver to game 7 in overtime a little

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.500 
Vancouver to game 7 in overtime a little
something<00:03:05.610> here<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.820> little<00:03:05.970> something<00:03:06.360> there

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
something here a little something there

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.760 
something here a little something there
and<00:03:06.570> they<00:03:06.810> could<00:03:07.050> have<00:03:07.140> been<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.380> final

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
and they could have been in the final

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.930 
and they could have been in the final
and<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.040> doubt<00:03:08.220> they're<00:03:08.370> going<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.580> finish<00:03:08.820> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
and I doubt they're going to finish the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.610 
and I doubt they're going to finish the
eighth<00:03:09.060> seed<00:03:09.330> again<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.930> Corey<00:03:10.170> Crawford

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
eighth seed again because Corey Crawford

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.860 
eighth seed again because Corey Crawford
didn't<00:03:10.920> exactly<00:03:11.220> play<00:03:11.640> start<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.240> finish<00:03:12.630> last

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
didn't exactly play start to finish last

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.710 
didn't exactly play start to finish last
year<00:03:13.230> with<00:03:13.410> him<00:03:13.650> as<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.040> undisputed<00:03:14.970> starter

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
year with him as the undisputed starter

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.199 
year with him as the undisputed starter
Hawks<00:03:16.440> gotta<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:17.040> by<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.550> mean<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.760> really

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
Hawks gotta and by it I mean a really

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.520 
Hawks gotta and by it I mean a really
good<00:03:18.360> starting<00:03:18.750> goaltender<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.320> Hawks

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
good starting goaltender in the Hawks

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.320 
good starting goaltender in the Hawks
did<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.830> really<00:03:20.130> good<00:03:20.310> job<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.580> holding<00:03:20.880> on<00:03:21.090> all

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
did a really good job of holding on all

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.820 
did a really good job of holding on all
their<00:03:21.510> key<00:03:21.720> guys<00:03:21.959> when<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.350> were<00:03:22.470> having<00:03:22.770> a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
their key guys when they were having a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.330 
their key guys when they were having a
lot<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:22.980> cap<00:03:23.250> issues<00:03:23.600> Kane<00:03:24.600> taves<00:03:25.340> Seabrook

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
lot of cap issues Kane taves Seabrook

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.760 
lot of cap issues Kane taves Seabrook
Keith<00:03:26.940> even<00:03:27.360> Patrick<00:03:27.810> Sharp<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.620> think

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
Keith even Patrick Sharp so I think

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.500 
Keith even Patrick Sharp so I think
they're<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.130> contender<00:03:29.640> every<00:03:30.030> year<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.420> this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
they're a contender every year and this

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.210 
they're a contender every year and this
could<00:03:30.690> be<00:03:30.810> very<00:03:30.840> dangerous<00:03:31.290> for<00:03:31.560> me<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.040> say

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
could be very dangerous for me to say

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.100 
could be very dangerous for me to say
because<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.640> think<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.209> division<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.810> keeps

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
because I think this division just keeps

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.080 
because I think this division just keeps
getting<00:03:34.500> better<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.190> Hawks<00:03:35.489> could<00:03:35.790> win<00:03:35.970> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
getting better the Hawks could win the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.610 
getting better the Hawks could win the
central<00:03:36.450> division<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:36.900> year<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.230> think<00:03:37.440> one

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
central division this year I think one

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.320 
central division this year I think one
two<00:03:37.830> three<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.280> West<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.700> no<00:03:38.820> particular

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
two three in the West and no particular

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.090 
two three in the West and no particular
order<00:03:39.360> could<00:03:39.750> be<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.020> Kings<00:03:40.320> Canucks<00:03:40.920> and

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
order could be the Kings Canucks and

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.280 
order could be the Kings Canucks and
hawks<00:03:41.489> last<00:03:41.880> question<00:03:42.360> it's<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.690> big<00:03:42.959> one<00:03:43.110> have

with him to Afghanistan if he doesn't

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.490 
with him to Afghanistan if he doesn't

read<00:04:26.789> into<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> curse<00:04:27.330> because<00:04:27.539> pretty<00:04:27.870> much

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
read into the curse because pretty much

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.869

everyone's<00:04:28.680> gone<00:04:28.889> from<00:04:29.189> back<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:29.580> but<00:04:29.699> look

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
everyone's gone from back then but look

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.719 
everyone's gone from back then but look
I<00:04:30.120> think<00:04:30.389> Shen<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.169> such<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.710> key<00:04:32.069> player<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.699> the

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
I think Shen is such a key player to the

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.640 
I think Shen is such a key player to the
Leafs<00:04:32.999> last<00:04:33.659> year<00:04:33.990> he<00:04:34.020> might<00:04:34.409> have<00:04:34.530> been<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
Leafs last year he might have been the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.260 
Leafs last year he might have been the
best<00:04:35.009> defenseman<00:04:35.550> certainly<00:04:35.969> the<00:04:36.150> most

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
best defenseman certainly the most

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.779 
best defenseman certainly the most
consistent<00:04:36.900> but<00:04:37.680> here's<00:04:38.189> something<00:04:38.400> else<00:04:38.580> as

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
consistent but here's something else as

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.249 
consistent but here's something else as
bad<00:04:39.029> as<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.240> would<00:04:39.330> be<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.479> see<00:04:39.689> Luke<00:04:39.870> Schenn<00:04:40.080> go

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
bad as it would be to see Luke Schenn go

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.110 
bad as it would be to see Luke Schenn go
do<00:04:40.379> you<00:04:40.439> have<00:04:40.529> any<00:04:40.770> idea<00:04:40.830> how<00:04:41.159> entertaining<00:04:41.699> it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
do you have any idea how entertaining it

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.119 
do you have any idea how entertaining it
would<00:04:42.240> be<00:04:42.389> to<00:04:42.719> see<00:04:42.870> an<00:04:42.960> RFA<00:04:43.349> stolen<00:04:43.710> from<00:04:43.860> berk

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 
would be to see an RFA stolen from berk

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.339 
would be to see an RFA stolen from berk
again<00:04:44.669> except<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:45.240> time<00:04:45.389> he<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.199> the
