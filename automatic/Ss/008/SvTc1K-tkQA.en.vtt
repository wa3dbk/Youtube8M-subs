00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.150
 Hey folks, let's continue the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.030
 I study the manga face and now I'm going 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.750
 pass to you is the penultimate module 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.970
 of the manga face that is the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.850
 character looking up and following 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.619
 this sequence here only that it will be 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.109
 Looking up, he'll come to him in a 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.390
 right profile right 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.220
 So, how do we do it there? 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.080
 You'll have to make the flight more or 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.080
 less on the slope you need 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:45.710
 the uac beauty and you will pull the line 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.719
 here central in the case of the central 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.160
 nose and mouth that is the center of the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.199
 eyes 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.850
 the central line of the face is not mine 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.789
 central download who stay downtown and 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.350
 will stay here on the field you will pull the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.030
 eye line 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.030
 through her like that here O 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.750
 same 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.890
 it's the bottom up in semi 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.890
 this angle which is also not 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.620
 very much used in this intensity or 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.390
 make it very strong and usually the 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.350
 Staff does but does a little bit more 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.430
 weak 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.220
 the intensity of the angle making this 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.150
 intensity that just to see you is like 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.960
 it works 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.540
 would work to do and some challenges 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.130
 they have because of the same problem 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.530
 What happens here right? 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.420
 chin distance between the mouth 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.630
 chin if you leave the right distance 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.500
 It's very strange, so it 's gotta 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.710
 twist here also do the eye sketch 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.710
 on here 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.149
 so here they are going to make the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.510
 demarcation here that eye of the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.180
 side of the line is gonna be okay 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.200
 tighter because of the angle 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.190
 so you have to pay close attention 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.550
 when making your adaptations of 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.310
 proportion because of the angles 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.870
 It is very important also careful percent 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:36.870
 that's not to distort the right way 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 ends up getting weird is the nose 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:47.100
 will also follow is this distortion 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:51.900
 here he is going to come here is his mouth too 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:58.320
 The eyebrow is coming up here. Come here. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:00.480
 and another would only be born here is going to be a 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.640
 Similar control when you profile me 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.980
 He will come here. 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.750
 The same idea is we will not pull the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.500
 chin accompanying here 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.310
 because this outline here kills the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.590
 mangai face getting ridiculous of fair no 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.330
 can do what we do 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:25.650
 invest in here and make it longer 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.150
 the distance between his chin to stay 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.810
 a tip 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.489
 Then we can solve the problem. 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.489
 the ear will stay here in the whole little corner 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.680
 this distance that how much the ear will 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.439
 get in 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.840
 It's over, you have to train because 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:49.730
 does not have a lot of hint and how much tone 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.409
 more for being my profile but she is going 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.079
 Come in then give it to you but I had 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.459
 for base here right? 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.829
 while it's near here you 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.010
 move here are both here as well 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.639
 You play the same distance here from 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.840
 suddenly something that can help you to 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:10.060
 know why you play very ear 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.230
 next here will also get weird 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.230
 then just do the neck 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.570
 He is not going to stay so strange. 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.840
 how much would it be if we did 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.550
 Way right here beauty so this is the 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.099
 main tip you have regarding 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.509
 This angle here is the same as me. 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.919
 I have already explained in that angle here, which is 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.680
 only from the bottom up 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.449
 the shift from what I showed to 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 You too in the video that gets very 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.270
 strange because you have to do this 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:48.169
 distortion here is to watch this 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.389
 in the manga that you accompany when 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.500
 designers use these angles here 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.150
 this adaptation they make 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.960
 only as I normally said the 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.229
 angle this angle from below to 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.389
 top along with profile acm usually is 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.419
 used the smoother the character never okay 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.190
 looking upwards so the angle 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.050
 precisely because of these distortions 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.460
 those usually neighbors and end up 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.180
 avoiding this rule that is a defect 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.830
 so the show itself has in the manga 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.900
 case 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.810
 the manga has a very beautiful aesthetic 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.409
 but in some angles it does not work 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.870
 whenever we use any 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.720
 drawing is tending to happen there not 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.750
 It will work just as well. 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.300
 in all angles right now because there are many 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.550
 drawings you see that it is always in 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.200
 a semi-profile or he is always 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.600
 because from other angles and not 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.190
 will work now 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.500
 so I hope the video helped 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.230
 Can you understand this angle? 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.170
 Thank you very much for your attention. 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.580

 If you helped, you're sure to help. 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.540
 other people too 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.550
 and do not forget to join the group 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.010
 of facebook that is in the description of the 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.170
 video for you to post your work on 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.170
 Thank you and until the next personal video
