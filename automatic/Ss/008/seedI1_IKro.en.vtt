 this is the story of when it fell 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.800
 he learned to skate happened in a cold 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.870
 winter day similar to today's 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.519
 who fell saw a hockey game on 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.369
 ice with his dad and his mom wanted 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.560
 skate so his dad made him a 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.690
 skating rink in the garden and you 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.690
 I buy your first skates 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.270
 I say 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.930
 I want to be a good hawking player 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.540
 but first you have to learn to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.540
 the world's fastest skater skater 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.260
 so skating and with the champion of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.260
 coming world 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.940
 why 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.470
 look soon you will know how to skate like this 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.070
 well the first thing you have to learn 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.020
 is to stand up - I have discovered 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.740
 that skating was not as easy as 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.740
 I imagined 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.509
 take until you get the hang of it 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.150
 and now you're ready to skate 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.520
 low 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.590
 I want to skate more green more 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.890
 I know it's not easy son but I'm 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.619
 very proud of you for trying 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.380
 try it again I was sick of 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.880
 fall again and again but I felt like 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.880
 to go back to try his dad 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.970
 I like it that way 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.120
 doing very well 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.210

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:43.930
 you are cooking for real 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.930
 and who wants a little chocolate 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:53.090
 after falling many times at the end 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.090
 He fell the trick except 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.150
 here 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.290

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.939

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.939
 in buying a hockey stick
