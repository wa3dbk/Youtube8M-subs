00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.640
 [Music] 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.130
 hello youtube friends this is another one of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.050
 the tutorial videos but in this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.869
 occasion I will bring you about a game that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 Many people expect this game to be 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 flame plants against zombies 2 this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.279
 about time I tell you that for now 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.890
 unfortunately it has not only come out 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.680
 for ipod and pad and it puts android and others 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.989
 cell phones or something similar but for the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.090
 computer but not yet 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.890
 worry happily I will tell you that if 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.739
 there is a way to play it in our 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.719
 operating system of our pc the good thing 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.600
 is that it is in Spanish that all the people 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.550
 what is looking for in that language only 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 can play with an emulator that is called 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.620
 bluestacks that serves to open games 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.690
 of Android let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.800
 first let's start our 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.379
 browser 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.659
 next mind copy this link that 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.640
 I will leave in the description of the video only 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.840
 They should show more 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.030
 surely you already know how 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 download but I do this out there 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.820
 some do not wait for 5 seconds 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.009
 write in the text and I pause it 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.550
 click here and start downloading 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.260
 automatically 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.260
 I cancel it because I already have it 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.690
 download the three files all 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.640
 I will leave in the description the last two 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.730
 they are megabytes in case they do not know how 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.000
 downloading would be too much but the same 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.000
 I will do it 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.540
 click here and download is 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.370
 too easy and wait for it to finish 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.370
 I pause the download 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.310
 As you can see, the download is over 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.470
 download and the other said that they no longer 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.970
 I will explain why it is also mega 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.970
 which is the same procedure 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.100
 then downloaded they go to the folder where 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.620
 they kept all their files safely 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.740
 in downloads, they go there and we'll start 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.010
 with the bluestacks right click and extract 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.010
 here 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.670
 and then open the file setup 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.230
 running as administrator or 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.230
 simply by double clicking 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.190
 I get this message because I already have it 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.170
 installed in my system I know what it says 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.050
 that's because it's a message in Spanish 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.750
 means bluestacks is already installed 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.970
 in your system or something like that but to you 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.340
