00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.519
 naturist 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.390
 that's this one 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.599
 but because we think so too 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.130
 clear below to intervene at the so-called ima system 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:24.279
 the motorcycle and party 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.759
 in fact it had total 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.759
 and the set seemed 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.999
 and the cr z and now also devices 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.149
 the chance of this driving more electrically under certain circumstances 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.890
 we go to the viewer how clean 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 been a nice young 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.000
 all in this because this tire was created to save the economy except 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.480
 the previously discussed electric motor we also see equipped with a start stop 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.680
 system 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.060
 and on the speedometer you can bit almost about safety or not if you 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.190
 good result makes it great if you change color there normally goes yes 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190
 because he is not very safe anymore 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.020
 in the middle of the speedometer 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.300
 is a computer screen on it you can see it economical to drive when you get to one 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.410
 drug conspiracy allows you to drive optimally economically the navigation system is one of them 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.120
 the better is unknown 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.250
 the integrated system then costs an additional 1100 euros 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.450
 these parts swimming competition very predictable handling also 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.830
 experience 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.410
 the next month in a point 4 liter engine 88 hp strong enough but there is also 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.830
 another electric motor district 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.220
 supposedly shorten the coffee is 10 hp at the throw 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.360
 well if you give full gas really does have for the car 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.520
 aardenburg in this version coupled with a she has b 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.170
 it has a few advantages but also to the earth 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.620
 the car is that when you separate them 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.770
 that must be a few years 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.850
 a former ens 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 he knows different positions 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.590
 it can also handle a sporting battle 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.380
 m can also switch manually 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.429
 nao as usual we also go to the dts one 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.379
 training center in this car 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.559
 where funeral instructor and netherlands this test goes the investigation 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.749
 under the hammer 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.749
 h 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.779
 also did from a trial 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.339
 car comes from a little understeer and heavy upset with 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.339
 evade right left steering movement when evasive 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.639
 without a player watching what the car does without electronic on system 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.819
 and then you see that moment that the back perishes I think because of that 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.039
 his creative long wheelbase 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.039
 best managed company at the end of March and can be kept clean 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.619
 alto in the slalom he sends nice and light 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:57.969
 so its untrue 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.499
 only drawback is that if you send quickly 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:05.259
 with short movements, low speed, the power steering does not work 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 but for the rest the to invest the Rhine 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.310
 this three meter 90 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.130
 the longer the honda jazz happens to the jewelery of the rear passengers 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.089
 we have a very comfortable place 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:21.089
 furthermore, you are still a bit of the boxes and the boxes 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.039
 you can lose everything 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:26.409
 and if you are behind the luggage compartment that is already quite embarrassed 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.709
 is enough then you can always very easily fold the rear seat down and 2 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.179
 uneven parts 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:35.790
 the honda jazz hybrid 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.229
 it is exempt from bpm and motor vehicle tax 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.309
 an addition of 14 percent applies to business drivers 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.699
 despite these benefits, the incident is not in its purchase price 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:48.759
 cheap 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:52.579
 in this geese version or are 21,500 euros 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.959
 this online version letter is not disappointing 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.589
 he performs quite well with thanks also to the electric motor that still 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.269
 cooperated a little extra 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.289
 it is reasonably safe 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:06.669
 in a fortress 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.909
 The only thing I do a little field is because of the high rate hero who is in the 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.499
 turns a bit about 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.889
 but beyond
