bit cramped you see the steering wheel

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.779 
bit cramped you see the steering wheel
can't<00:01:38.619> turn<00:01:38.799> because<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.130> loot<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.549> window

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
can't turn because the loot the window

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.149 
can't turn because the loot the window
itself<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.210> actually<00:01:40.479> pressing<00:01:40.930> down<00:01:41.109> but<00:01:41.890> you

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
itself is actually pressing down but you

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.099 
itself is actually pressing down but you
really<00:01:42.430> don't<00:01:42.729> need<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.060> window<00:01:43.359> to<00:01:43.750> turn<00:01:43.930> in

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
really don't need the window to turn in

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.719 
really don't need the window to turn in
this<00:01:44.229> case<00:01:44.500> or<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.070> wheel<00:01:45.189> to<00:01:45.369> turn<00:01:45.520> in<00:01:45.609> this

this case or the wheel to turn in this

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.639 
this case or the wheel to turn in this
case<00:01:45.939> because<00:01:46.299> you<00:01:46.990> can't<00:01:47.200> really<00:01:47.320> fit<00:01:47.560> your

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
hands inside now a minifigure cannot sit

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.200 
hands inside now a minifigure cannot sit
straight<00:01:50.829> up<00:01:50.950> because<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.609> very<00:01:51.880> low

straight up because it is a very low
roof<00:01:52.539> so<00:01:53.200> what<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.439> do<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.799> when<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.039> place

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
roof so what you do is when you place

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.370 
roof so what you do is when you place
the<00:01:54.399> minifigure<00:01:54.909> inside<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.869> if<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.079> need<00:01:56.259> to

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
the minifigure inside and if you need to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.310 
the minifigure inside and if you need to
remove<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.969> window<00:01:57.969> on<00:01:58.210> this<00:01:58.329> you<00:01:58.450> can<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
remove the window on this you can the

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.969 
remove the window on this you can the
minifigure<00:01:59.799> sits<00:02:00.039> down<00:02:00.219> just<00:02:00.579> like<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:01.979> now

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
minifigure sits down just like that now

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.709 
minifigure sits down just like that now
you<00:02:03.039> can<00:02:03.340> adjust<00:02:03.429> his<00:02:03.729> arms<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.240> then<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.539> can

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
you can adjust his arms and then you can

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.050 
you can adjust his arms and then you can
move<00:02:04.899> them<00:02:05.079> up<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.259> little<00:02:05.350> bit<00:02:05.619> just<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.280> go

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
move them up a little bit just to go

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.290 
move them up a little bit just to go
along<00:02:07.240> with<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.689> rest<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.050> car<00:02:09.060> roof<00:02:10.060> goes

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
along with the rest of the car roof goes

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.130 
along with the rest of the car roof goes
right<00:02:10.600> down<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:10.869> top

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.230 

and<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.190> see<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.550> very<00:02:14.580> snug

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and as you can see it's a very snug

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.400 
and as you can see it's a very snug
interior<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:18.660> designed<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
interior and it's designed so that the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.960 
interior and it's designed so that the
minifigure<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:20.010> lean<00:02:20.190> back<00:02:20.220> all<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.820> way

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
minifigure can lean back all the way

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.880 
minifigure can lean back all the way
hopefully<00:02:21.900> future<00:02:22.200> models<00:02:22.680> allow<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
hopefully future models allow the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.670 
hopefully future models allow the
minifigure<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.700> sit<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> little<00:02:24.060> more<00:02:24.300> erect<00:02:24.680> so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
minifigure to sit a little more erect so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.230 
minifigure to sit a little more erect so
that's<00:02:25.860> basically<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> inside<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:26.970> front<00:02:27.180> of

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
that's basically the inside in front of

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.740 
that's basically the inside in front of
the<00:02:27.300> car<00:02:27.540> onto<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> back<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.710> car<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.880> the

now<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.290> may<00:02:49.410> have<00:02:49.440> noticed<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> bricks

of these the front and the back hook on

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.270 
of these the front and the back hook on
to<00:02:51.989> our<00:02:52.110> different<00:02:52.380> colors<00:02:52.709> they<00:02:53.100> don't

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
to our different colors they don't

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.979 
to our different colors they don't
really<00:02:53.400> matter<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.480> can't<00:02:54.810> really

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
really matter because you can't really

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.380 
really matter because you can't really
see<00:02:55.230> them<00:02:55.350> when<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> cars<00:02:55.770> on<00:02:56.060> view<00:02:57.060> from<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
see them when the cars on view from the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.540 
see them when the cars on view from the
bottom<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.470> built<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.860> custom<00:02:59.250> chassis

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
bottom this is built on a custom chassis

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.100 
bottom this is built on a custom chassis
this<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.390> built<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.930> city<00:03:01.170> chassis<00:03:01.620> and

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
this is not built on a city chassis and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.960 
this is not built on a city chassis and
so<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.920> new<00:03:05.070> lego<00:03:05.310> coupe<00:03:05.640> in

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
so that is the new lego coupe in

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.960 
so that is the new lego coupe in
comparison<00:03:06.780> with<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.020> old<00:03:07.230> lego<00:03:07.530> coupe<00:03:07.970> much

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
comparison with the old lego coupe much

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.110 
comparison with the old lego coupe much
wider<00:03:09.300> much<00:03:09.780> bigger<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.290> more<00:03:10.410> detail<00:03:11.120> it's

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
wider much bigger and more detail it's

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.810 
wider much bigger and more detail it's
longer<00:03:12.540> as<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.470> can<00:03:13.620> see<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.980> basically<00:03:14.550> hides

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
longer as you can see it basically hides

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.030 
longer as you can see it basically hides
most<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.450> coupe<00:03:15.709> facts<00:03:16.709> are<00:03:17.010> different

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
most of the coupe facts are different

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.449 
most of the coupe facts are different
license<00:03:17.940> plates<00:03:18.209> are<00:03:18.390> different<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:20.280> roof

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
license plates are different the roof

the<00:03:31.380> 1<00:03:31.530> by<00:03:31.680> 6<00:03:31.950> model<00:03:32.280> more<00:03:32.489> it's<00:03:32.850> much<00:03:33.090> bigger

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
the 1 by 6 model more it's much bigger

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.130 
the 1 by 6 model more it's much bigger
and<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:34.380> much<00:03:34.620> more<00:03:34.860> versatile<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.989> is

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
and it's much more versatile so that is
