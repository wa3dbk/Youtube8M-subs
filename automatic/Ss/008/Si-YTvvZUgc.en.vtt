00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.010
 Hello, this is a review of the game pledge 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.670
 slide us control of smartphones 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.120
 so percentage 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.559
 I launched and already in the past all 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.580
 work without any problems vodka 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.959
 Tarbosaurus here kidneys and no speech but 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.699
 you need to consider that the game is still 2d and not very 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:17.800
 demanding 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.699
 should go to any device 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.470
 so m 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.109
 the meaning of the game will be known to those who played 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.269
 era scorched fruit horse game on 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.499
 computer 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.499
 and almost identical and brainchild 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.810
 so cops we have music there so 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.700
 let's go do them 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.440
 imagine and creams choose complexity 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.220
 the minimum is 0 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.300
 maximum is children 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.430
 so take 2 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.690
 here so 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 the more average thing is that the more he 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 difficult the more the lives of enemies 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.430
 very fewer areas, respectively 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.500
 less 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.490
 2 so the same 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.260
 health and with us and with 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.310
 at our rival 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.650
 so let's leave 2 but not 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.950
 less is it yet 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.520
 nothing really helped 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.990
 so everything game started here goes first 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.820
 pippo x 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.910
 first era and this 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.980
 and here is such an ancient world prehistoric 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.440
 where were you 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 cavemen various 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.530
 they passed with bits for example and 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.690
 rode on mammoths of march 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.430
 so tells us the game anyway 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.560
 But over time, we get the gold experience 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.270
 them 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.210
 get enough experience 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.130
 since we got experience 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.190
 show 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.620
 data numbers and scale that is, we now have 15 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.740
 of experience 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.700
 but she did not rock the rock 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.770
 is displayed 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.660
 ii is money 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.600
 km we have them at the moment 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.299
 80 but each one has more murder 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.720
 experience more money 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.200
 so we usually have you all times 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.400
 About such a scheme 2 one warrior one 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.350
 shooter 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.499
 and for now something more powerful 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.629
 here's kind of mom edge 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.579
 or in the future they will be 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.209
 robots tanks 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.129
 but so far we have 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.079
 and on the right we have a special weapon 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.919
 applying it 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.529
 without the deed that the father is the most powerful 0 to 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:28.609
 for example 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.319
 shelled all enemy warriors or else 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.369
 something 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.569
 ohh here we have a person spawns on 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.009
 by helicopter 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
 and so to speak shelling burnout 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.959
 a lot of angels on the second difficulty 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.299
 play 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.779
 easy 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.329
 so if you increase the difficulty 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.909
 2 and this is about the resonance version of apuk full 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.569
 version of the pier why pump out the opposite 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.979
 stamps but 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.689
 this system costs money 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.459
 can also 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.729
 instead of this 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.499
 download this yagrom via computer 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.469
 and install on the phone and then 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.559
 there will be no problems at all 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.499
 so let's use already 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.649
 specially repelled already 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:15.899
 crew 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.419
 man nand 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.849
 prehistoric helicopter that sounds 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.069
 very strange 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.079
 does not kill enemies with the first shot 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.789
 here 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.559
 so we can we buy guns 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.269
 clean up pushkin 9 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.639
 slot for guns 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.729
 remove various searches coming 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.089
 new epochs 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.879
 so there is a principle of the game actually 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.499
 tiger interesting and capable skulich on 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:45.679
 some time 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.999
 cube but we can get bored but rather 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.999
 of all the books you come back again 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.839
 so how interesting is this game 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.209
 days are not in vain 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.309
 moved 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.309
 from the computer this phone 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.729
 Well it was not in the review of the game 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.429
 smartphone lg optimus one and on other android 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:06.419
 devices 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.529
 all the best and goodbye
