Liz<00:04:05.190> beyond<00:04:05.580> belief<00:04:05.970> but<00:04:08.959> it<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.910> matches<00:04:11.910> so

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
Liz beyond belief but it it matches so

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.650 
Liz beyond belief but it it matches so
nicely<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:14.959> then<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:15.990> have<00:04:16.830> pinned<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.430> up<00:04:17.660> in

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
nicely and then I have pinned it up in

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.229 
nicely and then I have pinned it up in
the<00:04:18.870> back<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.080> course<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.580> so<00:04:20.940> much

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
the back of course but I have so much

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.200 
the back of course but I have so much
hair<00:04:21.480> my<00:04:21.660> hair<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:22.049> grew<00:04:22.410> mad<00:04:23.310> crazy<00:04:23.850> ever

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
hair my hair just grew mad crazy ever

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.730 
hair my hair just grew mad crazy ever
since<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.720> started<00:04:24.990> wearing<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.650> pieces

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
since I started wearing the pieces

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.890 
since I started wearing the pieces
and<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.919> think<00:04:26.979> it's<00:04:27.310> because<00:04:27.699> I<00:04:28.000> allow<00:04:28.330> my<00:04:28.569> real

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
and I think it's because I allow my real

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.180 
and I think it's because I allow my real
hair<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.530> rest

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
hair to rest

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:49.620 
hair to rest
oh<00:04:46.889> I'm<00:04:47.889> just<00:04:48.190> playing<00:04:48.430> on<00:04:48.759> it<00:04:49.180> rewind

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
oh I'm just playing on it rewind

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.180 
oh I'm just playing on it rewind
and<00:04:49.930> listen<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.530> part<00:04:50.740> again

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
and listen to that part again

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.870 
and listen to that part again
but<00:04:51.580> anyway<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:55.949> it's<00:04:56.949> like<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.160> Superman

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
but anyway so it's like a Superman

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.360 
but anyway so it's like a Superman
superhero<00:04:58.750> blue-black<00:04:59.970> look<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:03.039> colors

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
superhero blue-black look the colors

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.010 
superhero blue-black look the colors
number<00:05:03.699> one<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:05.880> think<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.270> maintenance<00:05:07.810> would

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
number one I think it maintenance would

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.749 
number one I think it maintenance would
be<00:05:08.229> easy<00:05:11.009> reviving<00:05:12.009> the<00:05:12.099> weight<00:05:12.280> if<00:05:12.460> they<00:05:12.490> ever

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
be easy reviving the weight if they ever

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.450 
be easy reviving the weight if they ever
got<00:05:13.060> older<00:05:13.509> ready<00:05:13.810> any<00:05:14.349> time<00:05:14.500> soon<00:05:15.039> would<00:05:15.280> be

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
got older ready any time soon would be

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.149 
got older ready any time soon would be
fairly<00:05:15.820> easy<00:05:16.289> well<00:05:17.289> there's<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.680> lot<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:17.949> things
