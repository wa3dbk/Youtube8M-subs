00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.660 
pit you just come over to the right a
little<00:02:31.540> bit<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.040> eventually<00:02:33.040> if<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.310> keep<00:02:33.400> it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
little bit and eventually if you keep it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.860 
little bit and eventually if you keep it
going<00:02:33.880> right<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.690> fall<00:02:34.900> down<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:36.720> you're<00:02:37.720> now

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
going right you fall down and you're now

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.750 
going right you fall down and you're now
underneath<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.410> map<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.650> never<00:02:39.069> really<00:02:39.670> hit

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
underneath the map you never really hit

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.610 
underneath the map you never really hit
the<00:02:39.880> ground<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.300> had<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.140> going<00:02:41.410> for<00:02:41.530> like

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
the ground I had this going for like

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.370 
the ground I had this going for like
five<00:02:41.920> minutes<00:02:42.390> just<00:02:43.390> straight<00:02:43.660> trig<00:02:44.230> going

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
five minutes just straight trig going

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.470 
five minutes just straight trig going
without<00:02:44.470> having<00:02:44.920> died<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.640> mean<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:46.239> gets

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
without having died so I mean it gets

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.090 
without having died so I mean it gets
really<00:02:46.630> small<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.260> can't<00:02:47.500> let<00:02:47.620> see<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.890> but

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
really small so you can't let see it but

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.710 
really small so you can't let see it but
it's<00:02:48.690> bottomless<00:02:49.690> pit<00:02:49.959> glitch<00:02:51.420> if<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.540> like
