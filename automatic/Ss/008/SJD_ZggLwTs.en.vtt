musical tone and the funny thing about

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980 
musical tone and the funny thing about
it<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.549> most<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.210> us<00:02:03.329> were<00:02:03.509> exposed<00:02:03.899> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
it is that most of us were exposed to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.569 
it is that most of us were exposed to
this<00:02:04.140> by<00:02:04.290> third<00:02:04.590> grade<00:02:04.619> remember<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.310> song

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
we just forgot about it because it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.260 
we just forgot about it because it
didn't<00:02:09.660> apply<00:02:09.899> at<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> time<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.910> I've<00:02:12.030> come

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
didn't apply at the time so I've come

I've<00:02:12.540> come<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.020> technique

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
I've come up with this technique

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.100 
I've come up with this technique
call<00:02:13.879> tonal<00:02:14.879> tuning<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:15.989> are<00:02:16.050> the

we're going to talk about and if for no
other<00:02:27.959> reason<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.560> great<00:02:29.010> ear<00:02:29.160> training

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
us but I've always been willing to work

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.229 
us but I've always been willing to work
hard<00:02:40.860> at<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.069> because<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.400> intuitively<00:02:42.000> knew

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
hard at it because I intuitively knew

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.339 
hard at it because I intuitively knew
that<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.629> is<00:02:42.750> worth<00:02:43.019> it

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
that it is worth it

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.949

and<00:02:43.860> if<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.099> can<00:02:44.310> do<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.120> do<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.450> so

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
and if I can do it you can do it so

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.809 
and if I can do it you can do it so
let's<00:02:46.170> go<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.739> sing<00:02:47.310> part<00:02:48.150> 2<00:02:48.450> lessons

that's a singing I suggest playing a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.600 
that's a singing I suggest playing a
secondary<00:02:52.560> instrument<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.130> piano<00:02:53.459> or

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
guitar you know pianos more visual it's

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.780 
guitar you know pianos more visual it's
easy<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.860> learn<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.040> guitar<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.579> very

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
serious thought into this before

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.490 
serious thought into this before
investing<00:03:00.569> your<00:03:00.629> time<00:03:00.900> into<00:03:01.170> it

the boogie now hear this

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.600 
the boogie now hear this
hey<00:03:09.349> let's<00:03:10.349> identify<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.829> pitch<00:03:11.129> in<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.370> drum

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
hey let's identify a pitch in a drum

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.430 
hey let's identify a pitch in a drum
okay

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
okay

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.750 
okay
strike<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.560> drum<00:03:13.680> not<00:03:14.129> with<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> drumstick

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
strike the drum not with a drumstick

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.789 
strike the drum not with a drumstick
because<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.090> drumstick<00:03:15.450> will<00:03:15.629> will<00:03:16.200> create

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
because the drumstick will will create

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.199 
because the drumstick will will create
multiple<00:03:17.099> pitches<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.609> use<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.910> tip<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.180> your

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
multiple pitches to use the tip of your

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.710 
multiple pitches to use the tip of your
finger<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.780> tap<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.319> very<00:03:19.530> lightly<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.720> sing

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
finger and tap it very lightly and sing

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.960 
finger and tap it very lightly and sing
as<00:03:21.959> quickly<00:03:22.290> as<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.530> can<00:03:25.519> that's<00:03:26.519> what<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.730> hear

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
as quickly as you can that's what I hear

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.500 
as quickly as you can that's what I hear
but<00:03:27.150> how<00:03:27.600> do<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.750> know<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:28.139> note<00:03:28.319> is<00:03:28.470> right<00:03:28.709> and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
but how do I know that note is right and

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.759 
but how do I know that note is right and
not<00:03:30.510> only<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.720> how<00:03:30.989> do<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.170> know<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.470> note<00:03:31.620> it

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
not only that how do I know what note it

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.420 
not only that how do I know what note it
is<00:03:31.920> okay<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:33.150> need<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.329> fixed<00:03:33.750> fix<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.829> fixed

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
is okay you need a fixed fix a fixed

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.430 
is okay you need a fixed fix a fixed
pitch<00:03:35.790> instrument<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.930> know<00:03:37.049> at<00:03:37.290> your

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
pitch instrument you know at your

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.890 
pitch instrument you know at your
disposal<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> keyboard<00:03:38.340> guitar<00:03:39.090> can't

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
disposal like a keyboard guitar can't

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.150 
disposal like a keyboard guitar can't
can't<00:03:40.079> depend<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.590> could<00:03:40.739> be<00:03:40.799> out<00:03:40.889> of<00:03:40.950> tune

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
can't depend on it could be out of tune

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.449 
can't depend on it could be out of tune
so<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.269> use<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:43.079> guitar<00:03:43.620> tuner<00:03:43.829> because<00:03:44.130> it's

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
so I use a guitar tuner because it's
