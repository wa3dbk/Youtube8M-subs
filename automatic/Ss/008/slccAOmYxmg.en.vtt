earlier and the fact that says vast

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.940 
earlier and the fact that says vast
match<00:01:27.510> which<00:01:27.720> gives<00:01:27.960> me<00:01:28.050> an<00:01:28.140> idea<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.620> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
match which gives me an idea that this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.260 
match which gives me an idea that this
is<00:01:29.100> probably<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.550> have<00:01:29.670> bigger<00:01:30.000> maps

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
is probably going to have bigger maps

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.060 
is probably going to have bigger maps
than<00:01:30.510> aftermath<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.170> probably<00:01:31.409> smaller<00:01:31.799> maps

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
than aftermath but probably smaller maps

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.860 
than aftermath but probably smaller maps
an<00:01:32.220> armored<00:01:32.520> kill<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:33.479> would<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.720> made<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
an armored kill they would have made a

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.240 
an armored kill they would have made a
big<00:01:34.049> deal<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.620> it<00:01:34.770> had<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.190> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
big deal of it if it had one of the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.710 
big deal of it if it had one of the
biggest<00:01:35.430> battle<00:01:35.909> maps<00:01:36.150> ever<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.600> they've

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
biggest battle maps ever but they've

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020 
biggest battle maps ever but they've
just<00:01:36.960> said<00:01:37.170> vast<00:01:37.440> maps<00:01:37.790> another<00:01:38.790> interesting

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
just said vast maps another interesting

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.280 
just said vast maps another interesting
thing<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.630> mentioned<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.080> new

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
thing that they mentioned is the new

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
thing that they mentioned is the new
lightweight<00:01:40.680> AAA<00:01:41.159> vehicles<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> current

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
lightweight AAA vehicles now the current

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.969 
lightweight AAA vehicles now the current
AAA<00:01:42.510> vehicles<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.229> lab<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.830> that

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
AAA vehicles are the lab and all that

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.500 
AAA vehicles are the lab and all that
kind<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.280> thing<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.270> lightweight

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
kind of thing so this lightweight

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.880 
kind of thing so this lightweight
version<00:01:46.049> makes<00:01:46.200> me<00:01:46.350> think<00:01:46.530> there's<00:01:46.560> probably

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
version makes me think there's probably

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.710 
version makes me think there's probably
gonna<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> jeep<00:01:47.580> with<00:01:47.790> some<00:01:48.360> sort<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
gonna be like a jeep with some sort of

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.810 
gonna be like a jeep with some sort of
like<00:01:48.960> AAA<00:01:49.229> attachment<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> back<00:01:50.340> which

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
like AAA attachment on the back which

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.719 
like AAA attachment on the back which
sounds<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.330> cool<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.220> ties<00:01:53.549> in

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
sounds kind of cool and it also ties in

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.100 
sounds kind of cool and it also ties in
with<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> fast<00:01:54.299> paced<00:01:54.570> action<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.020> we're

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
with the fast paced action that we're

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.180 
with the fast paced action that we're
talking<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.470> earlier<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> paragraph

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
talking about earlier in the paragraph

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.770 
talking about earlier in the paragraph
where<00:01:56.580> these<00:01:56.940> lightweight<00:01:57.240> vehicles<00:01:57.659> going

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
where these lightweight vehicles going

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.630 
where these lightweight vehicles going
to<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.900> able<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.110> travel<00:01:58.350> faster<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:59.460> through

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to be able to travel faster get through

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.890 
to be able to travel faster get through
enemy<00:01:59.909> lines<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.240> stuff<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
enemy lines and stuff like that so you

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.210 
enemy lines and stuff like that so you
can<00:02:01.020> take<00:02:01.229> out<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.950> different<00:02:02.189> things

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
can take out all the different things

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.490 
can take out all the different things
out<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> sky<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.380> something<00:02:04.380> I'm<00:02:04.470> really

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
out the sky and something I'm really

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.140 
out the sky and something I'm really
interested<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.400> new<00:02:05.549> game<00:02:05.760> mode<00:02:06.000> which

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
interested in is the new game mode which

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.460 
interested in is the new game mode which
I<00:02:06.299> mentioned<00:02:06.450> further<00:02:06.900> down<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.260> bottom

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
I mentioned further down in the bottom

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.749 
I mentioned further down in the bottom
of<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> paragraph<00:02:07.890> which<00:02:08.159> is<00:02:08.280> capture<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
of the paragraph which is capture the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.059 
of the paragraph which is capture the
flag<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.140> much<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.319> new<00:02:10.590> game<00:02:10.830> mode

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
flag it's not so much a new game mode

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.010 
flag it's not so much a new game mode
more<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.610> returning<00:02:12.300> game<00:02:12.480> mode<00:02:12.720> from

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
more of a returning game mode from

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
more of a returning game mode from
previous<00:02:13.410> battlefield<00:02:13.830> titles

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
previous battlefield titles

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.860 
previous battlefield titles
I'm<00:02:14.970> really<00:02:15.239> looking<00:02:15.450> forward<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.690> that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
I'm really looking forward to that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.390 
I'm really looking forward to that
because<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.200> infantry<00:02:16.620> based<00:02:16.890> team<00:02:17.190> work

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
because all infantry based team work

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.070 
because all infantry based team work
days<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.849> it's<00:02:17.940> going<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.599> be<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:18.989> good

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
days then it's going to be a really good

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.720 
days then it's going to be a really good
game<00:02:19.230> modes<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.590> think<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.099> bring<00:02:20.190> back<00:02:20.430> into

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
game modes I think to bring back into

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.490 
game modes I think to bring back into
the<00:02:20.819> battlefield<00:02:21.209> series<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.110> finally<00:02:22.410> we

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
the battlefield series and finally we

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.780 
the battlefield series and finally we
come<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> something<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.099> was<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> little<00:02:23.580> bit

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
come to something that was a little bit

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.430 
come to something that was a little bit
unexpected<00:02:24.000> i<00:02:24.480> guess<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:25.110> called<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.349> new

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
unexpected i guess it's called the new

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.070 
unexpected i guess it's called the new
drop<00:02:25.769> ship<00:02:26.069> which<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.849> where<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.900> going<00:02:27.989> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
drop ship which is where you're going to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.920 
drop ship which is where you're going to
have<00:02:28.489> rapid<00:02:29.489> deployment<00:02:29.819> air<00:02:30.239> drops<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.690> troop

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
have rapid deployment air drops of troop

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.750 
have rapid deployment air drops of troop
transports<00:02:31.590> which<00:02:32.069> basically<00:02:32.340> means<00:02:32.580> it's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
transports which basically means it's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
transports which basically means it's
gonna<00:02:32.849> be<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> bit<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.360> an<00:02:33.510> ac-130<00:02:34.230> where<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
gonna be a bit like an ac-130 where it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.170 
gonna be a bit like an ac-130 where it
drives<00:02:34.920> around<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.310> map<00:02:35.459> i<00:02:35.640> guess<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:36.090> it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
drives around the map i guess and it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.520 
drives around the map i guess and it
circles<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.930> i'm<00:02:36.989> guessing<00:02:37.140> you're<00:02:37.380> going

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
circles it and i'm guessing you're going

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.680 
circles it and i'm guessing you're going
to<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.130> sort<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.790> take<00:02:39.150> control<00:02:39.540> of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
to have to like sort of take control of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.170 
to have to like sort of take control of
the<00:02:40.050> flag<00:02:40.349> point<00:02:40.769> or<00:02:41.099> is<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.790> going<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.030> be<00:02:42.150> like

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the flag point or is it going to be like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.210 
the flag point or is it going to be like
a<00:02:42.450> killstreak<00:02:42.959> kind<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.530> thing<00:02:43.709> I'm<00:02:43.980> not

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
a killstreak kind of thing I'm not

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.650 
a killstreak kind of thing I'm not
really<00:02:44.430> sure<00:02:44.519> but<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.239> going<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.420> drive

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
really sure but it's going to drive

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.780 
really sure but it's going to drive
around<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.989> map<00:02:46.170> i<00:02:46.319> guess<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.769> or<00:02:47.459> fly<00:02:47.670> around

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
around the map i guess and or fly around

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.400 
around the map i guess and or fly around
the<00:02:48.000> map<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.019> be<00:02:49.140> dropping

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the map and it's going to be dropping

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.780 
the map and it's going to be dropping
sort<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.000> transport<00:02:51.000> down<00:02:51.630> onto<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.560> ground

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
sort of transport down onto the ground

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.280 
sort of transport down onto the ground
which<00:02:53.790> kind<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.239> sounds<00:02:54.450> bit<00:02:54.569> dangerous<00:02:54.720> but

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
which kind of sounds bit dangerous but

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.170 
which kind of sounds bit dangerous but
