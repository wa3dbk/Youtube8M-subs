00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.010
 It's a strong something I think I that I myself was once again s in everything's 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:13.570
 I could see a glimpse of eight such people like this

 My goal is now 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.230
 I think that this will not be worthwhile in the throw error with this error even after this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.770
 Had become this in 3-to-0 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.420

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.329

 I've put it on-Ikue's extra-large shot from the back of these two times 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.400
 I hit a wall 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:14.060
 No. 1 This is 3 to 1 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.060

 Gather in the middle and assume 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:43.770
 Because the book that I was able to reduce it was just another way to beat it 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.409
