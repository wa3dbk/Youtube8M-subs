00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.130
 the kitchens those always said that 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.639
 that's good, you give me joy 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.230
 of my life in that is very good 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.120
 write a lot of properties very 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.920
 Interesting 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.170
 in almost all varieties of cheese 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 It has a very high nutritional value and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.830
 what gives it the different forms 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.769
 to eat it and so on is its content in 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.710
 fat there are many many differences 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.960
 between the fat content of the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.619
 cheeses for example the lean cheeses that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.230
 they are the least fatty they have less 25% of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.059
 fat compared to the cheeses that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.160
 this can be up to double fat that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.410
 they have more than 60% fat but 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 it's really because of the fat so it 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 Usually cheeses are divided or classified 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.010
 that is what gives him perhaps the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.469
 cheese the feature a little bit more 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.289
 less beneficial to patients or 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.550
 People who have HDL cholesterol or 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.440
 bad for cholesterol for 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 people who have their car of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.820
 olive or fatty in people who 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.699
 they have bad cholesterol however it is a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.350
 contribution of very important proteins 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.360
 because in the greater the nutritional value 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.370
 fundamental of the cheese is that it has 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.200
 a high percentage of protein because 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.470
 really the cheese comes from the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.540
 processing of natural milk a high 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.630
 lipid percentage healthy lipids 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
 which are the fats vitamins and minerals 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.150
 what the cheese does not have is hydrates 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.830
 carbon then the most ideal way to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.410
 combine the cheese would be with a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.650
 little piece of bread so that the 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.750
 protein with the carbon data already with 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.710
 a dynamic of feeding the day with 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.660
 bread and christ 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.030
 would be able to legend say that 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.009
 only with bread, cheese and fruit 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.930
 could live an organism so that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.150
 really the cheese has some 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.759
 very nutritious and healthy properties 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.740
 important against has always been 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.360
 heard of good because certain 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.600
 cheeses may or may not produce pains 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.729
 head is true effectively and gases 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.619
 good thing about gases depends on everything 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.660
 the maturation process not all 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.360
 cheeses produce gases the pain of 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.830
 head is very much related 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.750
 because there are certain cheeses especially 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.310
 mature who release a series of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.420
 substances that are called amines like 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.920
 happens for example with chocolate 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.630
 also and those are substances 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.540
 inflammatory and vasodilator 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.830
 can cause a migraine if 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.470
 we abuse a lot 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.270
 there are many varieties of cheeses and then 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
 from the point of view of its maturation 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.980
 and elaboration the caloric contribution also 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.750
 changes a lot, for example, cheese 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.150
 cool the life of the burgos 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.220
 villalón etcetera these cheeses are usually 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.500
 provide almost 100 grams nothing 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.870
 more and forgiveness at 100 calories per 100 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.420
 grams nothing more compared to the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.330
 more mature cheeses more sworn than almost 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.190
 arrive at which 400 calories 4 to 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.230
 distances calories per 100 grams of 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.180
 cheese and cured cheese however the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.430
 For example, Burgos are only 100 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.430
 grams 2 minutes here 2 hours ago 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.160
 to 400 videos are followed if we look 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.380
 100 grams how much and be nadien grams 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.420
 well then well be about this 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.340
 cheese that look good they have perfect 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.200
 they are cheeses that I have brought because 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.060
 within the variety of cheese you can 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.460
 choose the most processed prisoners and 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.770
 others or the German cheeses smell them are 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.020
 cheeses from cantabria cheeses from pito and are 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.980
 habilis channels has neither additives nor 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.690
 cow goat preservatives and really this 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.970
 is specifically have something so 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 that I have brought it and it is that you can eat 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.410
 until the shell because they are processed 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.260
 with a natural mode then well then 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.230
 many are consumed 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.880
 goat cheese that is cow's blends 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.640
 what is better 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.470
 it really does not matter if it's true that 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.930
 the goat is a little bit more greasy the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.880
 milk cheese more fat therefore the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.430
 Fattest cheese would be the sheep first 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.870
 then the goat and then the cow in 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.270
 people with whom they have to take care of a 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.800
 little line your best cow in people 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.360
 who do not care 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.460
 if they like the goat the bee too 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.560
 it changes a lot in the taste that's a 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.090
 little bit stronger and also that can 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.220
 produce that they have digestion is more or 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.370
 less heavy and that's why it's possible that 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.040
 many heavier digestion cheeses 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.630
 produce gases so the cow is more 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.110
 light is the lightest is the most 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.110
 digestible 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.910
 I never say it then that I forgot 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.850
 conscious because it walks beltrán is the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.160
 director of the clinic bad and that you go 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.080
 and personally he tells you why we talk 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.490
 in the study you have to take into account 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.290
 the people who hear us and who we 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.770
 they say it is true that each one after 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.960
 because you have the difficulties or a 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.760
 different metabolism you would have to each 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.070
 one men that all people are 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.200
 absolutely different and obviously not 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.390
 you can say for all out the cheese or 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.370
 if the one we see always rules 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.110
 generals are general and always 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.970
 we talk about healthy people I try 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.770
 always saying what things are good are 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.170
 bad for certain pathologies because the 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.270
 who are listening to us are not interested 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.620
 but in general it is a life because always 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.290
 very general 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.180
 thank you very much thanks to Carmen who is 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.180
 very good 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.699
 today he sends us dice what do you think 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.040
 where is carmen santo sunday thursday 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.600
 holy sunday and we're going to make a 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:36.350
 dish of your land if your land is called 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.500
 wrapped child let's change the name 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.570
 we have put sacks of vegetables of 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.840
 vegetables and rice which is what you did 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.470
 to the children of miami and have been what 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.580
 I say it's a way that the cabbage 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.560
 Normally if you say for a child or not 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.390
 he does it and the truth is that this one 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.400
 love and also that you can prepare 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.710
 in the previous day take out alcohol or we 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.330
 will serve to make the wrapper and 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.660
 inside we are going to put Carmen 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.820
 vegetables minced meat becomes a stir-fry 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.100
 with red pepper green pepper one 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.920
 onion and when you handcuffed 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.910
 it is mixed with the meat the rice is cooked 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.800
 and when it 's cooked it mixes more 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.960
 drag the rice with the meat and with 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.400
 all the vegetables and the wraps are 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.760
 cabbage rolls 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.710
 is not a food 25 years I have left 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.110
 delighted with the clear recipe because it is 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.520
 very healthy it has hardly any fat and it 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.260
 cook in the oven then there is one thing 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.560
 I love what it is 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.560
 over 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:42.240
 this is the most fatty but it gets 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:45.540
 so little so it really is not 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.350
 you have to dose the dish very healthy and 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.350
 very healthy 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:00.270
 tell me these tests is done with rum 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.900
 white if the 100 orange juice itself 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:07.890
 it hurts me and great me bernadina see 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.350
 orange juice strawberries and grenadine and rum 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.500
 yes and a lot of ice and you can get ice 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.500
 of ice 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.330
 and we will offset both then 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.270
 no longer see because then and dance bachata 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.270
