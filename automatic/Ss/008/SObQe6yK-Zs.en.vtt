00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
create a new folder name it shader packs

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.970 
create a new folder name it shader packs
you<00:00:40.290> drag<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.100> packs<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.940> folder<00:00:42.980> and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
what I had to do now you just run it it

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.270 
what I had to do now you just run it it
should<00:02:44.590> open<00:02:44.680> up<00:02:44.920> two<00:02:45.220> screens<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.650> not<00:02:48.010> then

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
