00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.300
 therefore the most convenient way to 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.519
 visiting several beaches is 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.879

 ebbs though I think the most popular 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.829
 for shantom remains not crowded even 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.170

 stony and standing next to the shore 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.679
 the lighthouse adds a special charm to this beach 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.409
 and just south of the opposite 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.450
 side of the lighthouse 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.850

 its length is approximately two kilometers 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.110
 at high tide the shoreline 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.510
 disappears completely 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.310
 and the water is almost right 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.220
 stone located in the main entrance 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.989
 on the beach the sand is the same as on the beach on

 populous even the high season is not here 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.989
 so many hotels and coastal restaurants 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.849
 there are no huge boulders on the shore 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.849

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.290
 beach cool club extends to 4 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.300
 kilometers

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.550
 co it is located north of the form nyang 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.080
 a distinctive feature of the beach doll 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.330
 is the almost complete absence 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.760
 holidaymakers even at the peak of the season 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.760
 as well as a variety of landscapes and sand 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.720
 in the northern part of the cape, while rank beach 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.819
 strewn with fragments of coral on the beach 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.640
 boulders sticking out of the water 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.920
 this beach can be admired to swim 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.049
 here is very problematic other his 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.140
 parts excellent cleanest deserted 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.140
 beaches 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.299
 further talk about the beach kalak white 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.860
 sandwich due to the proximity of coral 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.230
 reef and cape bye rank 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.540
 the sand on the beach is whiter as it turns off 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.879
 yourself an admixture of milled coral but it 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.470
 purely tourist lure on the main 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.139
 the road almost every corner you can 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.269
 see signs white sandwich on the shore 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.669
 it is worth renting a restaurant 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.070
 a sea of people on the sand and not quite 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.610
 white but whiter than the beaches we 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.610
 already told 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.100
 and now the winner of our review is the beach 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.050
 bang step find it easy with 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.389
 the main road will be signs 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.940
 its length is approximately three kilometers 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.340
 this is the northernmost beach of cola co 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.680
 there are no hotels and white tourists at all 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.199
 beautiful coniferous promenade with benches 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.930
 the beach is wide and the sand is as white as 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.490
 and on the beach is white and the main minus is 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.569
 significant distance from the central 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.360
 areas of cola co 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.440
 about 15 kilometers but to the next 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.870
 cities of this kind 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.520
 and puppet islands are near at hand 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.620
 cessna this beach is right 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.720
 opposite to the right where to go 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.210
 Irung only at this crossroads you 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.680
 need to turn left to the beach here yet 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.690

 impossible to miss 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.970
 this is the place we liked 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.970
 most 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.770
