00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.589
 yes, go get it now Porter today i want to show you the crux 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.670
 Sextäter stops 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.320
 Even people who count here once counts or 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.599
 Fought for success, this pattern drops that I'm shouting at her 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.219
 Post it copy by simply percent and insert is one year 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.490
 that's about ten big whole that has a little more on one's own 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.800
 Server around 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.189
 as it is on our server August that you also have to unlock 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.789
 Sievers that duo other people can decide freely if we were someone 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.610
 Place of performance is coming 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.670
 so that ends the woman wore 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.000
 around 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.650
 and percent can therefore reduce nothing 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.920
 Percent after the port gate list -1 it says he can break down x if I have him 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.010
 on 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 make the assembly 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 He can break it down because it's a tenth way and he can do more things 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.409
 Although everything here is here 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.040
 z oo around Rome Cat 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.040
 Desinger's orders can 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.830
 the cover as soon as the foot but only this one two three 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.010
 enter four commands 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 then the excavation can indeed this 1 2 3 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.020
 but do not enter here 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.330
 Colon the researchers took it is yes can be exactly the same as the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.510
 opening act 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.030
 So now at o 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.160
 what's up with them 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.800
 enter the commands 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.460
 Both commands are faulty 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460
 Ruppel can be entered here as well 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.730
 Deuce I love livestock Apia is nothing separating 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.310
 However, that's exactly what the construction and the v2 group can do this year 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.370
 Dürer's bad luck massive building came the need we can the DVD 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 here at the doctors in Stade is one percent 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.300
 an asterisk that means he can do everything 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.160
 giving all the commands can do it all 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.210
 that's exactly what happened at the a4 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730
 around 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.510
 as complicated thing as al-qaida when now to Bernd 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.009
 Percent, you know what it is 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.110
 and he can kick in East Berlin as well 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.480
 Vevey RKI can offer these channels RTL special rights as previously specific cancer 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 or what a student what Wonnemann like the Toolbar make 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.620
 yes the coupe is devastating it can not show a format 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.969
 Prince ever but on it 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.969
 we'll look at each other 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.509
 is looking forward to the server Connected 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.689
 and now he succeeds 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.599
 and coking plant is happy 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.869
 that's exactly how it is 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.189
 if I was in hydraulic engineering now, thanks again 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.509
 unknown grandma percent write something then we see 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.179
 the signature is exciting 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.469
 broken neck for each child number from the server below 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.309
 so now we have the percent again 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.169
 Cupcakes go 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.609
 and around 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.489
 Wegelin offshoot - only end is the v2 due to the - France I could 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.429
 do nothing 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.789
 if not now 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.779
 what agreement wants that must be in the assembly 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.289
 as I enter another group 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.409
 you do not have to open the user textile 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.209
 and now I have to enter my name 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.759
 Halici so the names that unlock a colon and 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.539
 then 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.429
 I can also order now 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.589
 there's no kee 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.259
 first key 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.759
 or to 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.859
 Adam release him 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:40.789
 that is then 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.789
 so that counts exactly the same as typing 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.419
 here in the kuk takes 10 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.669
 how you stand 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.109
 namely that we are in front 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.269
 Tasci had to enter here as well 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.269
 Now I could just enter exactly the commands you need to file 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.110
 that's it so easy normal WikiBay Red 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.839
 just go wife go 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:04.620
 Percent free 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.209
 go the assembly 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.029
 continue that too easy 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.029
 and percentages 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:18.320
 I wanted to say that as I said with my eyes lift off my writing two 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.739
 Pen 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.759
 that is because of this go 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.490
 here it is every fire an Eder front here would be close in there then 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.559
 four namely the colors are not checked minimum 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:32.580
 just to see here then what Faber is dozens of now theirs 

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:35.989
 Percent I do not know at 14 write for example 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.379
 then I am red 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.789
 he would like to cook percent I would have to be in the assembly about that 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.789
 means I should actually be yellow now 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.289
 that's it a people it's about on the server and a lot less 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.809
 so now more users again and around 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.900
 she could beat the media package 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.589
 and there we see 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:03.039
 Percent royalties 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.779
 I can still collect that 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:08.969
 legally can also build if the hit is not fixed percent of all and 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:09.499
 what not 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:10.360
 to evict 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.099
 because she wants the black and yellow 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.679
 yes, if malware value percent at my name double scored Finther cried 

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:20.039
 then he would have also taken for Euros and I can enter more command 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.150
 You can also enter in 8/11 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.570
 and as you can see from the movie the man can enter the Limmat one holds 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.620
 Home Sweet Home that two levels of kuk TXT can also be seen 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.150
 which falls like aki or percent mods who I can I liked it 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.419
 enter 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.949
 At that time even worse percent maybe we were finally back 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.500
 should we go back here too he is correct in showing how to command percent 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.150
 can register with it 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.830
 the group leaders can perform 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.659
 namely against the 1 therefore one 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.159
 if now was nice 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.450
 that we Haiti 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.430
 because the devils have donated fire back where it reached Part 6 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.020
 desire 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.189
 For example, demanded 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.360
 I'm here 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.599
 with that in the line and makes here the command 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.089
 tt-line 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.099
 wanted more numbers 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.139
 We also wanted to really in which they can give the tips 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.139
 it made after the comma 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.270
 and percent yes now theoretically even if they are in the group 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.999
 are these 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.599
 enter 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.740
 just important is that here in the 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.690
 User Text Eternal but took the received 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.539
 the pocket 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.039
 Remmel board 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.610
 and then saw 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.930
 the happy one 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.939
 and then always important that in fact Inter makes 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:42.819
 So enter-key Meinig 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.819
 that was the second line then it is 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.569
 yes which you liked would be glad if you have a review 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.160
 2 in Arbon will delight like car and we'll see you in 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.189
 the other videos job
