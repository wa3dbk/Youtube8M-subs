 will paste on the desktop 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.070
 now you're going to come here in that style 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.860
 pin-right click 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.270
 mouse properties will look if this 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.640
 box is marked 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.100
 if you have uncheck apply and click 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.310

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.330
 so to be faster and I did not come 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.940
 here is the number that was formed in the 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.110
 work open file 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:49.110
 I'm going to say everything that marks this. 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:52.890

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.690
 now we will install the translation and the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.930
 dubbing the game 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.959
 so the staff pay close attention 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.970
 because this part is quite a bit like this 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.090
 more or less difficult but if you make a mistake 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.280
 a game file will no longer open 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.959

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.780
