so<00:00:41.980> let's<00:00:42.280> get<00:00:42.430> started

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.050 

so<00:00:45.680> for<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.100> basics<00:00:46.520> of<00:00:46.610> competitive

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060

so for the basics of competitive
gymnastics<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:48.170> takes<00:00:48.440> a<00:00:48.530> lot<00:00:48.740> of<00:00:48.770> commitment

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
gymnastics it takes a lot of commitment

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.770 
gymnastics it takes a lot of commitment
more<00:00:49.400> than<00:00:49.640> my<00:00:49.760> creation<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:50.210> gymnastics

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
more than my creation on gymnastics

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.330 
more than my creation on gymnastics
because<00:00:50.920> recreational<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.040> don't<00:00:52.190> really

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
because recreational you don't really

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.430 
because recreational you don't really
learn<00:00:52.460> any<00:00:52.730> routines<00:00:53.150> I<00:00:53.480> mean<00:00:54.020> sometimes<00:00:54.230> you

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
learn any routines I mean sometimes you

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.440 
learn any routines I mean sometimes you
do<00:00:54.650> but<00:00:55.010> like<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:58.400> odds<00:00:58.790> are<00:00:59.030> G<00:00:59.210> join

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
do but like and odds are G join

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.820 
do but like and odds are G join
competitive<00:00:59.960> gymnastics<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.470> wouldn't<00:01:00.740> have

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
competitive gymnastics you wouldn't have

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.490 
competitive gymnastics you wouldn't have
to<00:01:00.950> practice<00:01:01.340> a<00:01:01.460> lot<00:01:01.580> more<00:01:02.080> so<00:01:03.080> like<00:01:03.260> it's

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
to practice a lot more so like it's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.740 
to practice a lot more so like it's
gonna<00:01:03.830> be<00:01:04.070> different<00:01:04.460> from<00:01:04.760> like<00:01:05.180> gym<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.720> gym

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
gonna be different from like gym to gym

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.970 
gonna be different from like gym to gym
like<00:01:06.020> some<00:01:06.290> gyms<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.650> might<00:01:06.770> have<00:01:06.890> to

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
like some gyms you might have to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.280 
like some gyms you might have to
practice<00:01:07.340> like<00:01:07.520> 20<00:01:08.450> hours<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.750> week<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.170> then

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
practice like 20 hours a week and then

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.470 
practice like 20 hours a week and then
some<00:01:09.500> gyms<00:01:09.800> like<00:01:09.950> our<00:01:10.700> gym<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.150> only<00:01:11.240> have<00:01:11.390> to

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
some gyms like our gym you only have to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.450 
some gyms like our gym you only have to
practice<00:01:11.840> four<00:01:12.140> hours<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> week<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.280> really

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
practice four hours a week so it really

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.390 
practice four hours a week so it really
it<00:01:14.360> came<00:01:14.510> like<00:01:14.690> vary<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.230> lot<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.250> can

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
it came like vary a lot and that can

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.609 
it came like vary a lot and that can
also<00:01:16.520> affect<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:17.180> different<00:01:17.510> like<00:01:17.630> prices

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
also affect that different like prices

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.300 
also affect that different like prices
and<00:01:19.220> stuff<00:01:19.700> like<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:20.360> back<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.350> prices

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
and stuff like that so back to prices

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.910 
and stuff like that so back to prices
obviously<00:01:22.640> if<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.750> know<00:01:23.840> more<00:01:24.110> serious<00:01:24.650> gyms

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920

we're gonna have a larger price and then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.719 
we're gonna have a larger price and then

a<00:01:40.369> gym<00:01:40.580> or<00:01:40.610> an<00:01:40.790> Olympian<00:01:41.180> train<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.540> you're

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
a gym or an Olympian train that you're

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.600 
a gym or an Olympian train that you're
going<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:41.930> have<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.800> prices<00:01:43.190> go<00:01:43.340> through<00:01:43.400> the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
going to have the prices go through the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.310 
going to have the prices go through the
roof<00:01:43.790> rather<00:01:44.060> than<00:01:44.360> just<00:01:44.570> going<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.840> like<00:01:45.110> a

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
roof rather than just going to like a

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.340 
roof rather than just going to like a
small<00:01:45.560> town<00:01:45.830> gym<00:01:46.150> so<00:01:47.150> that's<00:01:47.570> kind<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:47.869> cost<00:01:48.140> we

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
small town gym so that's kind of cost we

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.600 
small town gym so that's kind of cost we
can't<00:01:48.500> really<00:01:48.590> give<00:01:48.800> you<00:01:48.830> an<00:01:49.009> exact<00:01:49.399> price

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
can't really give you an exact price

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.400 
can't really give you an exact price
because<00:01:50.030> again<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.450> varies<00:01:50.479> for<00:01:50.899> each<00:01:50.960> gym

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
because again it varies for each gym

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.219 
because again it varies for each gym
plus<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.340> price<00:01:52.490> will<00:01:52.700> also<00:01:52.910> include

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
plus the price will also include

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.130 
plus the price will also include
leotards<00:01:54.229> warm-ups<00:01:54.800> gym<00:01:55.729> bags<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.990> guess

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
leotards warm-ups gym bags and I guess

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.900 
leotards warm-ups gym bags and I guess
travel<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.770> guess<00:01:57.920> could<00:01:58.190> be<00:01:58.310> included<00:01:58.490> since

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
travel I guess could be included since

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.910 
travel I guess could be included since
you<00:01:59.000> have<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.179> travel<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.539> lot<00:01:59.690> for<00:01:59.929> competitive

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
you have to travel a lot for competitive

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.320 
you have to travel a lot for competitive
gymnastics<00:02:01.069> so<00:02:01.700> that's<00:02:01.880> something<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.149> think

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
gymnastics so that's something to think

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.880 
gymnastics so that's something to think
about<00:02:02.450> before<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.929> start<00:02:03.020> competitive

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
about before you start competitive

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.090 
about before you start competitive
gymnastics

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.650 

next<00:02:07.340> thing<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.760> like<00:02:07.939> road<00:02:08.209> trips<00:02:08.539> and

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
next thing is like road trips and

gym has this but I don't know and then
most<00:04:35.540> gyms<00:04:35.720> also<00:04:35.990> have<00:04:36.140> warm-ups<00:04:36.500> but<00:04:36.740> not

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
have to be kind of included with the

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.790 
have to be kind of included with the
price<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:40.610> competitive<00:04:41.270> gymnastics<00:04:41.330> our<00:04:42.050> gym

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
price of competitive gymnastics our gym

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.130 
price of competitive gymnastics our gym
it<00:04:42.980> has<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.460> same<00:04:43.640> Leone<00:04:43.970> Leo<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:44.810> warm-ups

for<00:04:45.410> two<00:04:45.560> years<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:45.980> then<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.220> switch<00:04:46.520> but<00:04:47.360> I

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
for two years and then I switch but I

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.090 
for two years and then I switch but I
mean<00:04:47.660> some<00:04:47.870> gyms<00:04:48.110> might<00:04:48.350> switch<00:04:48.530> every<00:04:48.800> year

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
mean some gyms might switch every year

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.880 
mean some gyms might switch every year
so<00:04:49.910> I<00:04:49.970> might<00:04:50.180> have<00:04:50.210> them<00:04:50.600> for<00:04:50.780> a<00:04:50.840> long<00:04:50.990> time<00:04:51.260> it

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
so I might have them for a long time it

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.640 
so I might have them for a long time it
just<00:04:52.160> all<00:04:52.370> depends<00:04:52.850> also<00:04:53.540> something<00:04:53.990> extra<00:04:54.470> is

after the meat you go to a separate
place<00:06:20.350> usually<00:06:20.590> and<00:06:21.070> then<00:06:21.850> they<00:06:21.970> give<00:06:22.270> you

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
score so it takes a lot of it's more

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.250
