00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 Hello, I already told you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:14.400
 yarn attack like weed and now this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.910
 video i will show how to knit from this yarn 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.619
 let me remind you that in the first 3 the same 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.529
 fit alone us for two strings 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.590
 our yarn itself and in this case it 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:34.200
 acrylic thread next we knit a column 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.719
 with one nakid for both walls and it is necessary 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.559
 always consider that we have a facial 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.920
 side 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.700
 it is more fluffy polyester 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 purl here our villi much 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.270
 less than what is a bag 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.140
 cuttings is that when we knit 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.219
 double crochet I see with us in 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.850
 mostly all our 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:09.990
 villus goes back 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.420
 if we knit the front side then we need them 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.979
 here is a little bit swollen 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 bend on the other side of which she 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.790
 I must show you again, because they 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.790
 go back 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.829
 we bend the leg with them 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.600
 and therefore it turns out that one side 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:54.829
 we are more fluffy 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.829
 inside out and so fluffy 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:10.480
 this is with regard to face look 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:15.530
 here is our facial here is purse knit 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:19.519
 crybag here mom now show that u 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:24.260
 we from the wrong side with him knit here much 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:31.420
 easier because the villi themselves have 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:35.709
 we go back here you can see them there 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.959
 back a lot of candy 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:44.890
 so when you knit the front side 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:49.030
 we villi straighten the output a 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.790
 when we knit the wrong side but its just 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.730
 provyazyvaya because by themselves 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.209
 villi so go to that side which 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.209
 we need 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:19.620
 and here we have 3 facial when 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:26.239
 the product is connected to my simplest 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:30.690
 a little swelled here we get 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:36.019
 knit everything with pleasure and meet 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.019
