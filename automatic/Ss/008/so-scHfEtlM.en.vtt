00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.070
 networks everything is very simple to get you started 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.679
 need to download warcraft 3 itself 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.900
 I leave a reference in the description of this I 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.590
 poured so everything is fine here everything 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.460
 no viruses even have some cards when 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.630
 you download this rar archive 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.820
 there again everything is just you just need 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.790
 razor hero vat it and throw it at dante 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.489
 he will look like that 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.230
 need to do further go to the site 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.989

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 download the garen itself and install it 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.930
 the process so be it I'll show you 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.399
 deliberately deleted himself garen to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.510
 show because some people 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.600
 ask and on fingers explain pretty 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.609
 it is difficult to install further here 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.939
 way wherever you want and set 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.800
 it will be convenient for me personally to disk to disk 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.740
 but 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.720
 doesn't want it so have to manually fine 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:21.500
 so drive d we will have program files 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:30.080
 kei is so good 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:33.360
 tired of beating ladies so is not empty 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.420
 but apparently I have left from the past 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.420
 garena rest set 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.760

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.990

 there are a lot of games not only warcraft 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.950
 from tab 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:47.060

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.450
 lpg exactly lpg list choose your 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.940
 The country in my case is Russia 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.160
 choose a room of rooms here very much 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.900
 watched a lot what do you want to play if 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.900
 in dota well, yes, that is exactly 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.340
 want a sign. playing debt in warcraft 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.340
 well, okay someone still plays 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.340
 farther 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.520
 here is rp dvd 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.400
 here I think decide depending on which 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.120
 genre do you want to play either this lpg 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.520
 either tower defense here's the level 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.010
 the entrance is your level burned here by me 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.780
 he is already 54 I am sending him 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.710
 I have done a few years so it is typed 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.710
 in principle, not very long 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.970
 at first you will only be available 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.950
 first level rooms in principle them 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.050
 quite a lot so it's time to dream than he 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.720
 there are certainly fewer people but now 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.850
 surely 4 am for these people 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.880
 not at all and so there are a hundred people 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.620
 Fifty sits normally you can play in 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.750
 the window should of course always play here 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.290
 here you see written new host 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.770
 boards 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.430
 it means that 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.470
 There are no bots in this room which castes 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.650
 cards even with bots, too, in principle 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.200
 possible because they are hasta and you 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.930
 all rooms immediately after too pretty 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.350
 convenient to play with bots as 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.970
 present leader so much so how are you 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.320
 understand how many people you can 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.890

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.730

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.060

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.300
 account can be bought for crystals 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.849
 stopped rushing for being in 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.819
 In Garen itself, that is, well, I personally 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.400
 I advise you just never fold 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:45.849
 by the way, yes, the warcraft version and 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.360
 1.26 is required and this is in case 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.599
 my link doesn't work just type in 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.000
 google warcraft 3 version 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:59.819
 1.26 and everything will work the same for you 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.259

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.580
 dota tunnel 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:09.970
 he's a penalty everything is fine that is if 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.500

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.900

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.630
 be it under the cross about the body tunnel and 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.789
 in a minute he should appear only 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.030

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.740
