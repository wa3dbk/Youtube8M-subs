okay<00:00:02.010> now<00:00:02.280> it<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.580> true<00:00:02.850> that<00:00:02.879> it<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.689> all

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
okay now it is true that it is all

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay now it is true that it is all
programming<00:00:04.470> but<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:04.859> we<00:00:05.040> want<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.370> do<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.759> to

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
programming but what we want to do is to

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.970 
programming but what we want to do is to
evolve<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.450> programs<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.410> want<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.799> create

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
evolve the programs we want to create

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.580 
evolve the programs we want to create
new<00:00:08.340> ideas<00:00:08.550> new<00:00:09.030> concepts<00:00:09.780> which<00:00:10.230> will<00:00:10.440> become

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
new ideas new concepts which will become

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.070 
new ideas new concepts which will become
new<00:00:11.040> programs<00:00:11.639> but<00:00:11.969> again<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.660> must<00:00:12.870> continue

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
new programs but again we must continue

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.980 
new programs but again we must continue
to<00:00:13.440> evolve<00:00:13.950> these<00:00:14.309> programs<00:00:14.820> these<00:00:15.509> rituals

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
to evolve these programs these rituals

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.939 
to evolve these programs these rituals
other<00:00:16.440> way<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.310> these<00:00:17.490> rituals<00:00:17.880> otherwise

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
other way and these rituals otherwise

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.279 
other way and these rituals otherwise
stagnation<00:00:19.949> sets<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.390> suffocate<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
stagnation sets in and we suffocate the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.660 
stagnation sets in and we suffocate the
vehicle<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.490> body<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:24.320> we<00:00:25.320> also<00:00:25.560> limit<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
vehicle the body as we also limit the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.000 
vehicle the body as we also limit the
expansion<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.380> word<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.740> very

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
expansion and that word is very

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.840 
expansion and that word is very
important<00:00:29.720> expansion<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:31.070> our<00:00:32.070> consciousness

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
important expansion of our consciousness

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060 
important expansion of our consciousness
I<00:00:33.059> choose<00:00:33.540> my<00:00:33.570> words<00:00:33.960> very<00:00:34.140> carefully<00:00:34.350> because

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
I choose my words very carefully because

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.130 
I choose my words very carefully because
I<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:36.000> good<00:00:36.360> or<00:00:36.660> bad<00:00:37.280> I<00:00:38.540> am<00:00:39.540> i'm<00:00:39.899> all

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
I don't do good or bad I am i'm all

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.450 
I don't do good or bad I am i'm all
about<00:00:40.290> evolving<00:00:41.300> something<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> I'm<00:00:43.170> not

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
about evolving something so that I'm not

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.970 
about evolving something so that I'm not
discarding<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.239> experience<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.739> has

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
discarding the experience and what has

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
discarding the experience and what has
been<00:00:47.160> brought<00:00:47.399> from<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.059> experience<00:00:48.660> because

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
been brought from the experience because

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.680 
been brought from the experience because
we<00:00:49.050> tend<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.399> rid<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
we tend to do that just get rid of that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.389 
we tend to do that just get rid of that
what<00:00:51.690> did<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:52.110> from<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.250> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
what did I get from it because if you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.880 
what did I get from it because if you
don't<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.480> got<00:00:54.750> from<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
don't know what you got from it then it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
don't know what you got from it then it
will<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.250> been<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.520> vain<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.480> everything

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
will have been in vain and everything

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.529 
will have been in vain and everything
you've<00:00:58.379> done<00:00:58.620> once<00:00:58.920> again<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.489> bringing<00:01:00.270> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
you've done once again is bringing you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
you've done once again is bringing you
to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> next<00:01:01.320> level<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.579> next<00:01:03.059> moment<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.400> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to the next level the next moment and so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.219 
to the next level the next moment and so
um<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.090> anyway<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.810> we're<00:01:07.080> talking<00:01:07.260> about

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
um so anyway so we're talking about

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.480 
um so anyway so we're talking about
limiting<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.560> expansion<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.340> our

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
limiting the expansion of our

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
limiting the expansion of our
consciousness<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> take<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
consciousness and then I want to take a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.539 
consciousness and then I want to take a
look<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> word<00:01:13.530> consciousness<00:01:16.369> okay<00:01:17.369> in

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
look at the word consciousness okay in

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.929 
look at the word consciousness okay in
the<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.909> scene<00:01:18.240> from<00:01:18.570> men<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.380> black<00:01:19.939> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the in the scene from men in black the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.749 
the in the scene from men in black the
universe<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.920> don't<00:01:22.920> remember<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.430> scene<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
universe I don't remember the scene is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.280 
universe I don't remember the scene is
in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> locker<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.869> remember<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.259> remember

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
in the locker you remember you remember

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.899 
in the locker you remember you remember
that<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:26.009> did<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.250> thought<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.700> really

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that really did I thought it was really

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.730 
that really did I thought it was really
neat<00:01:27.180> where<00:01:27.360> they<00:01:27.570> thought<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.560> was

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
neat where they thought that that was

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.230 
neat where they thought that that was
their<00:01:28.920> whole<00:01:29.100> world<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> locker<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
their whole world was in the locker that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.530 
their whole world was in the locker that
that<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.869> us<00:01:31.400> our<00:01:32.400> universe<00:01:32.729> might<00:01:33.240> be

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
that would be us our universe might be

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.690 
that would be us our universe might be
on<00:01:33.810> top<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.680> pinhead<00:01:35.070> how<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
on top of a pinhead how do we know that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.260 
on top of a pinhead how do we know that
it's<00:01:36.360> probably<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.689> top<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> pinhead<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's probably on top of the pinhead of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.370 
it's probably on top of the pinhead of
some<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.979> expanded<00:01:40.979> being<00:01:42.200> some<00:01:43.200> other

some other expanded being some other

some other expanded being some other
being<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.299> way<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.409> expansive<00:01:47.070> than<00:01:47.100> we

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
being that is way more expansive than we

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.670 
being that is way more expansive than we
could<00:01:48.119> ever<00:01:48.149> imagine<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.079> exist

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
could ever imagine and they do exist

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.630 
could ever imagine and they do exist
they<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.579> exist<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.310> should

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
they do exist and that's what you should

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.209 
they do exist and that's what you should
be<00:01:53.820> trying<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.210> figure<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.570> how<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.619> how<00:01:56.159> do

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
be trying to figure out how to do how do

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.800 
be trying to figure out how to do how do
I<00:01:56.579> become<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.840> expansive<00:01:58.500> create<00:01:59.280> or<00:01:59.810> we

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
I become a more expansive create or we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.660 
I become a more expansive create or we
don't<00:02:01.140> look<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.860> what<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.549> know

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
don't look at that what we you know

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.709 
don't look at that what we you know
where<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.030> stop<00:02:03.469> we<00:02:04.469> stop<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.360> many<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.630> in

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
where we stop we stop at many of you in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.600 
where we stop we stop at many of you in
the<00:02:06.780> room<00:02:06.810> probably<00:02:07.170> don't<00:02:07.590> stop<00:02:07.860> at<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.129> but

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the room probably don't stop at that but

to see this I want to know because life

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.170 
to see this I want to know because life
kicks<00:04:34.850> ass<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.630> it's<00:04:35.900> harder<00:04:36.650> when<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.669> less

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
kicks ass and it's harder when the less

kicks ass and it's harder when the less
you<00:04:38.449> know<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:39.320> harder<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:39.979> sometimes

it does is kick your ass anyway the more

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.780 
it does is kick your ass anyway the more
you<00:04:42.500> know<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.710> more<00:04:42.949> it<00:04:43.340> does<00:04:43.520> game<00:04:45.790> because

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
you know the more it does game because

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.480 
you know the more it does game because
you<00:04:46.820> can't<00:04:47.270> what<00:04:48.169> you<00:04:48.260> have<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.470> try<00:04:48.650> two<00:04:48.710> now

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
you can't what you have to try two now

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.900 
you can't what you have to try two now
operate<00:04:49.760> in<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.930> matrix<00:04:51.410> without<00:04:52.130> operating

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
operate in the matrix without operating

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.510 
operate in the matrix without operating
in<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.120> matrix<00:04:53.540> and<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.620> you're<00:04:55.010> learning<00:04:55.430> how

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
in the matrix and so you're learning how

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.189 
in the matrix and so you're learning how
to<00:04:55.580> do<00:04:55.820> that<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.210> having<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.540> learn<00:04:56.720> how<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.990> be

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
to do that you having to learn how to be

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.040 
to do that you having to learn how to be
invisible<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.310> system<00:04:58.820> and<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.539> this<00:04:59.990> a

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
invisible to the system and is this a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.140 
invisible to the system and is this a
whole<00:05:00.350> other<00:05:00.800> thing<00:05:00.979> you're<00:05:01.490> learning<00:05:01.970> you

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
whole other thing you're learning you

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.230 
whole other thing you're learning you
know<00:05:02.300> this<00:05:02.720> is<00:05:02.870> what<00:05:03.050> we<00:05:03.199> call<00:05:03.410> magic<00:05:04.370> but<00:05:05.030> this

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
know this is what we call magic but this

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.000 
know this is what we call magic but this
magic<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.900> science<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.530> what<00:05:06.650> we're<00:05:06.800> learning

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
magic is science and what we're learning

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.260 
magic is science and what we're learning
is<00:05:07.370> science<00:05:07.729> we're<00:05:07.910> learning<00:05:08.000> that

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
is science we're learning that

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.800 
is science we're learning that
everything<00:05:08.690> is<00:05:08.870> based<00:05:09.470> on<00:05:09.710> on<00:05:10.430> science<00:05:11.000> so<00:05:11.570> I'm

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
everything is based on on science so I'm

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.430 
everything is based on on science so I'm
all<00:05:12.590> about<00:05:12.770> taking<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.729> lid<00:05:14.090> off<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.840> fluffy

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
all about taking the lid off the fluffy

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.770 
all about taking the lid off the fluffy
stuff<00:05:16.160> and<00:05:16.400> if<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:16.669> must<00:05:16.940> if<00:05:17.270> that<00:05:17.419> makes<00:05:17.660> you

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
stuff and if that must if that makes you

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.360 
stuff and if that must if that makes you
feel<00:05:17.810> good<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:18.500> that's<00:05:18.680> what<00:05:18.860> you<00:05:18.979> want<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.250> do

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
feel good and that's what you want to do

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.790 
feel good and that's what you want to do
fine<00:05:19.639> that<00:05:19.940> means<00:05:20.150> you're<00:05:20.300> not<00:05:20.449> ready<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:21.229> you

the word expanded I use a word expanded

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.850 
the word expanded I use a word expanded
because<00:06:29.449> that's<00:06:29.930> really<00:06:30.199> important<00:06:30.830> because

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
because that's really important because

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.200 
because that's really important because
when<00:06:31.280> i<00:06:31.340> say<00:06:31.669> expanded<00:06:32.919> expanded<00:06:33.919> is<00:06:34.210> is

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
when i say expanded expanded is is

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.900 
when i say expanded expanded is is
saying<00:06:35.810> you're<00:06:36.770> just<00:06:37.280> becoming<00:06:38.150> larger

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
saying you're just becoming larger

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.910 
saying you're just becoming larger
into<00:06:40.690> who<00:06:41.350> you<00:06:41.410> are<00:06:42.180> not<00:06:43.180> I'm<00:06:43.630> just<00:06:43.690> not<00:06:44.500> better

just more expansive and so it's really

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.520 
just more expansive and so it's really
important<00:06:48.700> when<00:06:49.150> we<00:06:49.300> choose<00:06:49.600> our<00:06:49.780> words<00:06:50.050> how

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
important when we choose our words how

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.500 
important when we choose our words how
we<00:06:50.590> say<00:06:51.010> it<00:06:51.040> what<00:06:51.370> we<00:06:51.550> say<00:06:53.250> okay<00:06:54.250> so<00:06:54.360> expand<00:06:55.360> it

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
as I say it's an important word yes we

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.600 
as I say it's an important word yes we
are<00:06:57.910> all<00:06:58.180> conscious<00:06:59.140> beings<00:06:59.620> because<00:07:00.250> we<00:07:00.400> hear

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
are all conscious beings because we hear

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.460 
are all conscious beings because we hear
that<00:07:00.820> yes<00:07:01.090> we<00:07:01.270> are<00:07:01.390> all<00:07:01.420> conscious<00:07:02.080> beings

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
that yes we are all conscious beings

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.470 
that yes we are all conscious beings
everything<00:07:03.400> is<00:07:03.550> consciousness<00:07:04.090> and

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480 
everything is consciousness and

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.210 
everything is consciousness and
consciousness<00:07:05.140> is<00:07:05.830> simply<00:07:06.550> being<00:07:07.210> self-aware

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
consciousness is simply being self-aware

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.590 
consciousness is simply being self-aware
very<00:07:09.220> important<00:07:09.760> that<00:07:09.910> we<00:07:09.940> understand<00:07:10.480> it

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
very important that we understand it

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.630 
very important that we understand it
because<00:07:10.660> we<00:07:10.840> use<00:07:10.990> that<00:07:11.170> word<00:07:11.410> loosely<00:07:11.920> when<00:07:12.580> we

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
because we use that word loosely when we

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.790 
because we use that word loosely when we
talk<00:07:12.820> about<00:07:12.850> consciousness<00:07:13.690> you<00:07:14.410> know<00:07:14.560> our

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
talk about consciousness you know our

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.430 
talk about consciousness you know our
Earth's<00:07:15.280> who's<00:07:16.120> more<00:07:16.450> conscious<00:07:17.020> and<00:07:17.230> who's

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
Earth's who's more conscious and who's

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.040 
Earth's who's more conscious and who's
not<00:07:17.620> more<00:07:17.890> conscious<00:07:18.460> and<00:07:18.670> all<00:07:19.090> of<00:07:19.270> that<00:07:19.300> it

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
not more conscious and all of that it

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.130 
not more conscious and all of that it
consciousness<00:07:20.920> is<00:07:21.160> really<00:07:22.140> self-awareness

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
consciousness is really self-awareness

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.610 
consciousness is really self-awareness
it's<00:07:23.980> different<00:07:24.400> levels<00:07:25.210> of<00:07:25.620> self-awareness

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
it's different levels of self-awareness

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.120 
it's different levels of self-awareness
different<00:07:27.340> levels<00:07:27.820> of<00:07:27.940> being<00:07:28.360> aware<00:07:28.750> of<00:07:29.130> who

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.130 
different levels of being aware of who

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.330 
different levels of being aware of who
you<00:07:30.310> are<00:07:30.550> as<00:07:30.910> a<00:07:31.140> creator<00:07:32.140> that<00:07:33.040> that's

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:33.340 
you are as a creator that that's

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.600 
you are as a creator that that's
basically<00:07:33.910> what<00:07:34.270> it<00:07:34.300> is<00:07:34.540> so<00:07:34.870> you<00:07:34.960> are<00:07:35.610> evolving

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610 
basically what it is so you are evolving

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.650 
basically what it is so you are evolving
evolving<00:07:37.300> and<00:07:37.650> expanding<00:07:38.650> into<00:07:39.660> greater

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660 
evolving and expanding into greater

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.190 
evolving and expanding into greater
levels<00:07:41.650> of<00:07:41.740> consciousness<00:07:42.250> of<00:07:43.000> who<00:07:43.780> you<00:07:43.990> are

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.200 
levels of consciousness of who you are

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.800 
levels of consciousness of who you are
and<00:07:44.560> what<00:07:44.950> you<00:07:45.220> could<00:07:45.640> possibly<00:07:45.670> be<00:07:46.390> but

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810 
and what you could possibly be but

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.410 
and what you could possibly be but
you're<00:07:46.990> doing<00:07:47.290> it
