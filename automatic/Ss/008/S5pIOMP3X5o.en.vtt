does bump a total height of the fence up
just<00:01:00.660> over<00:01:00.960> 6<00:01:01.199> feet<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.640> much<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just over 6 feet but not so much that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.260 
just over 6 feet but not so much that
you're<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.870> violation<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.860> zoning<00:01:05.790> or

4 is damaged when you lead whacking you
know<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.520> easy<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.880> replace<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.390> than<00:01:21.600> one

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
know it's easy to replace that than one

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.160 
know it's easy to replace that than one
of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.409> fence<00:01:23.960> stockades

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
of the the fence stockades

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
of the the fence stockades
and<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:26.250> particular<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.850> yard<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.210> be

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
and this particular back yard will be

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.969 
and this particular back yard will be
completely<00:01:27.750> fenced<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> third

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
completely fenced in it's about a third

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.630 
completely fenced in it's about a third
of<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.220> acre<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.820> quite<00:01:30.000> nice<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:31.400> we<00:01:32.400> went

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
of an acre it's quite nice and we went

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.300 
of an acre it's quite nice and we went
with<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:34.320> budget-conscious<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.130> this

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
with a little budget-conscious on this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.330 
with a little budget-conscious on this
so<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.270> went<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.570> posts<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.229> roughly<00:01:37.860> 8<00:01:38.100> foot

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so we went with posts on roughly 8 foot

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.230 
so we went with posts on roughly 8 foot
centers<00:01:39.200> instead<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> 4<00:01:40.829> foot<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.340> often

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
centers instead of 4 foot like I often

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.760 
centers instead of 4 foot like I often
do<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.840> an<00:01:42.930> investment<00:01:43.290> property

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
do but this is an investment property

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.639 
do but this is an investment property
and<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:44.880> no<00:01:45.060> small<00:01:45.810> children<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> lot

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and there are no small children or a lot

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
and there are no small children or a lot
of<00:01:46.770> activity<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> could<00:01:47.460> damage<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.450> not

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
of activity that could damage your not

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.999 
of activity that could damage your not
the<00:01:48.720> fence<00:01:48.930> over<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.380> 8<00:01:49.530> foot<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.890> pretty

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the fence over so 8 foot is pretty

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.550 
the fence over so 8 foot is pretty
acceptable<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.329> also<00:01:51.450> or<00:01:52.079> gates<00:01:52.380> are

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
acceptable I like to also or gates are

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.499 
acceptable I like to also or gates are
at<00:01:52.649> elected<00:01:53.009> double<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.970> four<00:01:54.149> by<00:01:54.270> fours

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
at elected double up with four by fours

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.830 
at elected double up with four by fours
so<00:01:55.229> essentially<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> 4<00:01:56.040> by<00:01:56.189> 8<00:01:56.390> all<00:01:57.390> those

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
so essentially get a 4 by 8 all those

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.249 
so essentially get a 4 by 8 all those
all<00:01:58.710> those<00:01:59.070> posts<00:01:59.610> will<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.909> trimmed<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.229> fit

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
all those posts will be trimmed to fit

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.170 
all those posts will be trimmed to fit
once<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> fence<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> completely<00:02:02.790> installed

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
once the fence is completely installed

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.080 
once the fence is completely installed
I'll<00:02:03.930> walk<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:04.740> where<00:02:05.579> John<00:02:05.850> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
I'll walk you back here where John is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.040
