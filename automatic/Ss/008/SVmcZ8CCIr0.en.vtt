00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
those two Center pipes and when we pull
that<00:01:52.619> they're<00:01:53.040> gonna<00:01:53.130> automatically<00:01:53.640> open

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that they're gonna automatically open

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060 
that they're gonna automatically open
and<00:01:54.180> stay<00:01:54.420> open<00:01:54.810> until<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.500> fuse<00:01:55.710> goes<00:01:55.860> back

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
and stay open until that fuse goes back

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.520 
and stay open until that fuse goes back
in<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.520> all<00:01:56.909> times<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.869> we're<00:01:58.200> gonna<00:01:58.290> pull<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
in at all times so we're gonna pull that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.959 
in at all times so we're gonna pull that
it's<00:01:58.890> instantly<00:01:59.219> gonna<00:01:59.340> change<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> note<00:01:59.880> of

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's instantly gonna change the note of

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.060 
it's instantly gonna change the note of
the<00:02:00.030> car<00:02:02.360> it's<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.479> got<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> lot<00:02:03.780> deeper<00:02:04.070> we're

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the car it's just got a lot deeper we're

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.289 
the car it's just got a lot deeper we're
gonna<00:02:05.189> put<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:05.939> safekeeping

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
gonna put this up here for safekeeping

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.820 
gonna put this up here for safekeeping
in<00:02:06.630> these<00:02:06.780> little<00:02:06.990> holders

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
in these little holders

in these little holders
push<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.670> in<00:02:09.729> there<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.780> put<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.140> back<00:02:11.380> now

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
push it in there and put that back now

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.570 
push it in there and put that back now
we're<00:02:12.460> gonna<00:02:12.550> put<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.880> back<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:17.580> go

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
we're gonna put this back and this go

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.420 
we're gonna put this back and this go
back<00:02:18.730> out<00:02:18.880> here<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:20.020> what<00:02:21.010> you'll<00:02:21.130> be<00:02:21.220> able<00:02:21.250> to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
back out here and what you'll be able to

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.320 
back out here and what you'll be able to
hear<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:23.050> vast<00:02:23.530> difference<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.190> sound<00:02:24.580> it's

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
hear is a vast difference in sound it's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.420 
hear is a vast difference in sound it's
a<00:02:25.390> lot<00:02:25.630> deeper<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.350> now<00:02:26.860> there's<00:02:27.070> exhaust

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
a lot deeper and now there's exhaust

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.790 
a lot deeper and now there's exhaust
coming<00:02:27.790> out<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.120> these<00:02:28.300> Center<00:02:29.260> ones<00:02:29.470> as<00:02:29.620> well

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
coming out of these Center ones as well

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.340 
coming out of these Center ones as well
so<00:02:30.460> all<00:02:30.670> four<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.510> if<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:31.990> in<00:02:32.140> there

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
so all four and if you can see in there

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.590 
so all four and if you can see in there
the<00:02:32.590> flap<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.130> actually<00:02:33.520> open<00:02:33.940> I'm<00:02:34.300> not<00:02:34.480> sure

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
the flap is actually open I'm not sure

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.390 
the flap is actually open I'm not sure
you<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.810> see<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.350> then<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.770> actuators

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
you can see that and then the actuators

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.230 
you can see that and then the actuators
are<00:02:36.520> open<00:02:36.730> as<00:02:36.820> well

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
are open as well

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.910 
are open as well
so<00:02:37.450> now<00:02:37.540> exhaust<00:02:37.900> point<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.350> all<00:02:38.530> forward

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
so now exhaust point you all forward

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.590 
so now exhaust point you all forward
these<00:02:39.010> tailpipes<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.180> now<00:02:40.300> what<00:02:40.450> we're<00:02:40.540> gonna

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
these tailpipes so now what we're gonna

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.210 
these tailpipes so now what we're gonna
do<00:02:41.400> go<00:02:42.400> into<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.670> car<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:44.290> if<00:02:44.650> we<00:02:44.800> rev<00:02:45.040> it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
do go into the car and if we rev it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.390 
do go into the car and if we rev it
you'll<00:02:46.210> hear<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.750> get<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.290> lot<00:02:47.709> louder<00:02:48.040> than<00:02:48.250> it

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
you'll hear it get a lot louder than it

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.870 
you'll hear it get a lot louder than it
was<00:02:48.580> before

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.120 

it's<00:02:57.510> easily<00:02:57.900> twice<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.620> long<00:02:58.740> as<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.010> was

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
it's easily twice as long as it was

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.160 
it's easily twice as long as it was
before<00:02:59.280> now<00:03:00.060> if<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.360> actually<00:03:00.570> own<00:03:00.900> this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
before now if you actually own this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.470 
before now if you actually own this
vehicle<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:02.130> can<00:03:02.310> make<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.090> there's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
vehicle you can make it so that there's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.180 
vehicle you can make it so that there's
actually<00:03:03.930> electronics<00:03:04.410> which<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:04.890> can<00:03:05.040> put

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
actually electronics which you can put

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.350 
actually electronics which you can put
in<00:03:05.280> an<00:03:05.340> aftermarket<00:03:05.610> switch<00:03:05.910> whether<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.240> put

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
in an aftermarket switch whether you put

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.850 
in an aftermarket switch whether you put
it<00:03:06.420> over<00:03:06.570> here<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:06.900> your<00:03:06.930> dash<00:03:07.170> or<00:03:07.410> down<00:03:07.560> here

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
it over here on your dash or down here

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.590 
it over here on your dash or down here
below<00:03:08.160> your<00:03:08.310> dash<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:09.270> open<00:03:09.420> that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
below your dash and you can open that

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.320 
below your dash and you can open that
electronically<00:03:10.470> back<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.490> forth<00:03:11.760> see<00:03:12.210> what

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
electronically back and forth see what

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330 
electronically back and forth see what
happens<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.840> now<00:03:13.290> when<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:13.740> have<00:03:13.830> that<00:03:14.010> open

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
happens is now when we have that open

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.650 
happens is now when we have that open
like<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.520> with<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> fuse<00:03:15.090> pulls<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.480> we're<00:03:15.570> on

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
like that with a fuse pulls and we're on

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.570 
like that with a fuse pulls and we're on
the<00:03:15.720> highway<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.440> very<00:03:16.680> loud<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:16.950> booming

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
the highway it's very loud and booming

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.070 
the highway it's very loud and booming
so<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.030> makes<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.240> difficult<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.690> speak<00:03:18.930> to

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
so it makes it difficult to speak to

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.660 
so it makes it difficult to speak to
someone<00:03:19.320> inside<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.860> car<00:03:20.040> with<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> top<00:03:20.460> up

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
someone inside the car with the top up

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.580 
someone inside the car with the top up
or<00:03:20.910> down<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.720> actually<00:03:21.840> become<00:03:22.230> kind<00:03:22.560> of

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
or down so it actually become kind of

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.200 
or down so it actually become kind of
annoying<00:03:23.010> at<00:03:23.130> some<00:03:23.280> points<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.090> own

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
annoying at some points so if you own

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.310 
annoying at some points so if you own
the<00:03:24.360> car<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.690> may<00:03:24.810> want<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.020> have<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.200> ability

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
the car you may want to have the ability

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.740 
the car you may want to have the ability
to<00:03:25.500> shut<00:03:25.680> open<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.580> close<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.910> at<00:03:27.480> your<00:03:27.720> own

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
to shut open it and close it at your own

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.370 
to shut open it and close it at your own
choice<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.860> we'll<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.900> last<00:03:31.080> thing<00:03:31.260> we'll

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
choice and we'll so the last thing we'll

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.070 
choice and we'll so the last thing we'll
talk<00:03:31.530> about<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.830> when<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.490> have<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.790> open<00:03:33.090> when

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
talk about is when you have it open when

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.840 
talk about is when you have it open when
it's<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.350> lower<00:03:34.500> rpms<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.160> you're<00:03:35.280> going<00:03:35.550> down

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
it's in lower rpms and you're going down

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.680 
it's in lower rpms and you're going down
in<00:03:36.180> speed<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.440> engine<00:03:38.010> revs<00:03:38.580> it'll<00:03:39.300> have<00:03:39.480> some

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
in speed and engine revs it'll have some

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.540 
in speed and engine revs it'll have some
overrun<00:03:40.230> you'll<00:03:40.710> hear<00:03:40.860> some<00:03:40.980> crackling<00:03:41.370> and
