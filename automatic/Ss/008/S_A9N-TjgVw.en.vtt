00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.890
 computer 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.500
 ok they have to pay attention to the unit 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.200
 of your device since this is going to 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.470
 serve in the program and mine in this 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.990
 case is the head unit now we insert 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.030
 our divide which contains the 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.030
 game that we want to pass to our usb 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.380
 ok as you can see is the unit and let's go 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.800
 to work with the 2014 game for 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.810
 playstation2 because we open the game that 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.310
 I suppose you downloaded or no longer 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.590
 they had is the useful usb 2.1 and we're going to 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.210
 the option to create game from 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.240
 divide 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.510
 in game mode we give you divide and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.890
 let's patch the two tics in the 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.420
 game options made we will 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.610
 select games since what 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.690
 we want to pass it directly to the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.960
 usb we title the game to your liking as 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.960
 want 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.700

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.790
 ok we select it look where we're going 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.750
 to keep mine is the g this is the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.750
 content of my memory 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.459
 I think he already has several games he has 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.940
 two hand games I'm with this would be 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.069
 three ok then it will start to transform 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.569
 and I'm going to cut this part of the video already 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.569
 which is a fairly long process 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.700
 ok we have almost ready the process of 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.170
 to pass our game to our 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.170
 pendrive 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.080
 little is missing and then we will only have 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.489
 march what are the picks we have 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.290

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.000
 well without any problem with our 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.000
 free macbook in our play 2 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.210

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.180

 pendrive as you can see I have three 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.709
 games on that pendrive 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.450
 and we can check it by going to 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.049
 directly to the root of our 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.540
 memory and we look for the vÃ©lez file as 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.489

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.150
 of the three games that I have in my 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.220
