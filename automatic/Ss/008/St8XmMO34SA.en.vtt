good vibes and tell you about a great
manifesting<00:00:09.900> trick<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> recently

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
manifesting trick that I recently

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.190 
manifesting trick that I recently
learned<00:00:11.070> may<00:00:12.000> or<00:00:12.059> may<00:00:12.179> not<00:00:12.210> know<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> read<00:00:13.019> books

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
learned may or may not know I read books

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.379 
learned may or may not know I read books
on<00:00:13.440> manifesting<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.460> wrote<00:00:14.820> one<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> first

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
on manifesting I wrote one of the first

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.510 
on manifesting I wrote one of the first
books<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.900> frequencies<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.130> science<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
books on frequencies and the science of

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.599 
books on frequencies and the science of
frequencies<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:19.020> course<00:00:19.289> as<00:00:19.800> Tesla<00:00:20.369> says

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
frequencies and of course as Tesla says

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.490 
frequencies and of course as Tesla says
if<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.119> want<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> study<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.750> universe<00:00:21.900> study

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
if you want to study the universe study

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.890 
if you want to study the universe study
vibration<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.189> frequency<00:00:23.670> anyway<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
vibration and frequency anyway it

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.320 
vibration and frequency anyway it
intrigued<00:00:25.350> me<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.529> much<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.250> wrote<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> book<00:00:27.180> on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
intrigued me so much I wrote a book on

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.599 
intrigued me so much I wrote a book on
it<00:00:27.390> went<00:00:27.990> into<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> rainforest<00:00:29.189> as

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it went into the rainforest as

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.240 
it went into the rainforest as
scientists<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.359> studied<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.260> anyway

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
scientists and studied it and anyway

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.979 
scientists and studied it and anyway
finds<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.360> only<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> world

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
finds out that not only is the world

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.630 
finds out that not only is the world
made<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.440> frequencies<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.399> use

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
made up of frequencies but you can use

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
made up of frequencies but you can use
them<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.300> get<00:00:36.450> things<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
them to get things that you want and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.240 
them to get things that you want and
it's<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.540> Illuminati<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:40.290> quantum<00:00:40.890> physics

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it's not Illuminati it's quantum physics

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.510 
it's not Illuminati it's quantum physics
so<00:00:42.090> that's<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> write<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:42.989> books<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
so that's what I write my books on and I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.810 
so that's what I write my books on and I
have<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> five<00:00:45.600> step<00:00:45.989> simple<00:00:46.559> way<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.399> help

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
have a five step simple way that I help

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880 
have a five step simple way that I help
my<00:00:47.910> clients<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.590> kind<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
my clients do that because it's kind of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.920 
my clients do that because it's kind of
like<00:00:49.980> riding<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.940> bicycle<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.600> seems<00:00:51.809> really

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
like riding a bicycle it seems really

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.600 
like riding a bicycle it seems really
hard<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.289> first<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.190> might<00:00:53.340> need<00:00:53.460> some

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
hard at first and you might need some

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.840 
hard at first and you might need some
help

but<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.120> soon<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.420> learn<00:00:54.629> how<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
but as soon as you learn how to do it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
but as soon as you learn how to do it
it's<00:00:55.289> natural<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.640> breathing

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it's natural it's it's like breathing

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's natural it's it's like breathing
because<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:58.050> gravity<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:59.930> it's<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
because like gravity it's it's here it's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
because like gravity it's it's here it's
real<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.399> part<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.760> our<00:01:02.850> science<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.600> part

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
of our world and you can use it it's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
of our world and you can use it it's
being<00:01:06.570> used<00:01:06.869> every<00:01:07.170> day<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:07.979> without<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
being used every day with or without you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.670 
being used every day with or without you
and<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> problem<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.840> lot<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> times

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and that's the problem a lot of times

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
and that's the problem a lot of times
people<00:01:10.860> aren't<00:01:11.100> using<00:01:11.280> their<00:01:11.520> own<00:01:11.549> power<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
people aren't using their own power and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
people aren't using their own power and
they're<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.540> using<00:01:12.810> their<00:01:13.080> own<00:01:13.110> frequency

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
they're not using their own frequency

they're not using their own frequency
attunement<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.270> want<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.960> I'm

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
attunement to get what they want so I'm

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.090 
attunement to get what they want so I'm
trying<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> tree<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.009> you're

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
trying to get the tree in here if you're

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.200 
trying to get the tree in here if you're
wondering<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> heck<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.820> doing<00:01:18.060> here

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
wondering what the heck I'm doing here

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.030 
wondering what the heck I'm doing here
it<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.659> looks<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.049> beautiful<00:01:19.229> especially

so happy anyway besides what I've
learned<00:01:25.200> myself<00:01:26.420> through<00:01:27.710> things<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.799> were

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
learned myself through things that were

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.460 
learned myself through things that were
given<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.280> me<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.110> lectures<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.140> I've<00:01:31.320> given
