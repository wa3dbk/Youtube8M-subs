but I'm sure you probably already know
that<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> stumble<00:00:53.940> across<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.329> video

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that if you stumble across this video

raising artifice 1 through 400 is going
to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.320> somewhat<00:00:58.739> costly<00:00:58.949> costly<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.059> uses<00:01:00.390> an

to be somewhat costly costly it uses an

to be somewhat costly costly it uses an
archaeology<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.640> well<00:01:02.640> archeology<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
archaeology so well archeology is the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.850 
archaeology so well archeology is the
main<00:01:03.629> component<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.350> you're<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> be

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
main component that you're going to be

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.690 
main component that you're going to be
using<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> raise<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.790> skill<00:01:06.060> um<00:01:07.640> anyway<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
using to raise the skill um anyway you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
using to raise the skill um anyway you
probably<00:01:09.390> already<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
probably already know of that you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.390 
probably already know of that you
probably<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> raise

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
probably just want to know how to raise

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920 
probably just want to know how to raise
the<00:01:11.640> skill<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.750> fun

into that ok 1 through 44 artifice

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
into that ok 1 through 44 artifice
you're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.020> making<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.470> I'm

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
you're going to be making what I'm

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.109 
you're going to be making what I'm
