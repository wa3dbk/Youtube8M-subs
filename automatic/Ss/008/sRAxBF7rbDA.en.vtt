00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.189
 the work of two beautiful teams leading the bédarieux body 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.550
 and the work of gerard garnier dede who is an essential partner in 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.589
 guitar development development 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:19.720
 It's done 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.930
 we are able to respond to very specific requests from some 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.439
 artists in what they do I still thought 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.039
 certainly the most acute 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.980
 in the judgment by the application in relation to that hassan shehata politeness 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.469
 so containing a little bit the history of this i40 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.509
 help and your needs and why the summer construction of this site 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.520
 the cia and cognac 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.430
 if we want to be friendly 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.800
 there is something family I think install 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.140
 and fighting first of all when I see media images page 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.060
 whole in a few years I'm very happy to share this with 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.680
 you this great team 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.860
 and therefore also for the state in fact it is the fruit of their work the madness one 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.640
 did together as well from michel 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.100
 the month and especially 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 those who are there behind alain gibert yesterday the tools 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.270
 and then if we show exemplary patience because that and I am a 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.960
 little boring 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.680
 I am aware of it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 and so we finally came to this after 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.970
 four prototypes 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.770
 but had a lot more 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 and so spending time actually is the culmination of many years of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.800
 research work 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 then go in a very specific sense in terms of sound and style 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.490
 it is true that it is even if the oriental and still orientated one goes 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 say to the metal 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.620
 very good face to nestea that me what I particularly like 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.180
 but I feel great versatility is one of the things we wanted 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.230
 work 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.870
 and then we go there and the first thing to say so if I'm really happy 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.480
 obviously silverman here that we pushed profiling 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.130
 for up to 100 euros 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.980
 so the body is really really super fine 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.030
 in europe and on the principle of an airplane wing that is to say that she is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.450
 very thin on the edges 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.220
 for 100 th to give an idea of ​​the shortcomings and a dynamic to the form and 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.020
 the cabinet from 6 am regular at the center 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.320
 which makes it possible to have the system of the mass and to allow 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.740
 first in brief the bronze the original employees of microphones dimarzio 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.670
 the work that was done also on the sleeve and is particular since 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.870
 stéphan needs you could see these few notes 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.789

 so much worse he needs to have a play facility% 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.499
 so we did a very fine round that were rare that was armed to 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:26.860
 inside two years 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.479
 by adjusting both 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.259
 four titanium reinforcements which is an extremely stable material that is 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.559
 used in aeronautics 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.560
 which actually allows to have 1 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.810
 a very strong handle very stable 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.099
 and she completely% 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.359

 plus the fact that this guitar you do not see you are so this 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.320
 freight 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.759
 which makes it really a very long handle that needs you
