00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.940
 hello i am lennart and today review 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.990
 I can feel the colombia reactor 25 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.730
 mummy 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.260
 two weeks there well I have more 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.670
 stored away for a while to leave you 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.260
 see what the format is like in the 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.150
 compression bag you have of course 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.920
 not to mention here the links to the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.480
 exterior with which just that 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.110
 can put on an extra piece for whatever 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.110
 make it more compact 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.980
 this sleeping bag has a mummy model and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.340
 has a maximum person length of 1 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.980
 meters and 83 centimeters it is a two 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.440
 seasonal model and that means that 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.360
 is suitable for the spring up to and including the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.190
 early fall he has a comfort 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.380
 temperature of 5 degrees and limit 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.990
 temperature of minus 1 in an extreme 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.000
 temperature of minus 16 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.460
 that makes him a little better suited for 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.130
 colder conditions than the model 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.980
 reactor 35 is the outer cover of 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.190
 water-repellent nylon like you in the fog 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.810
 or in the morning dew water droplets 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.260
 here on it for my it derived there 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.570
 just from 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.860
 a sleeping bag completely dry 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.259
 taxi to and that means he does too 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.600
 nice and light stays naturally dry 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.600
 is always better to fall asleep to the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.509
 look inside then we see this 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.100
 to that shield reflective coating that 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.170
 are all small silver 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.789
 dots and it works as it were 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.079
 mirrors that reflect your 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.359
 body heat back inside 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.469
 so you stay nice and warm 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.139
 oh I also like this one myself 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.969
 sleeping bag i have big feet and like the 

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:31.600
 sleeping bag the completely pointed salt 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.679
 walk 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.899
 you actually have little space for you 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.270
 feet you see him here this 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.100
 whole surface is actually the bottom 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.749
 which means you are just right on your back 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.909
 can lie with your feet up without 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:45.159
 that actually insisted a bit 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.499
 touches and for some extra warmth you have 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.509
 of course also this hood that you what 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.649
 Closer to close your head with this 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.679
 drawstring 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.009
 and this draft strip that is behind the 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.929
 zipper 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.569
 which provides some extra heat 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.759
 and is covered with a somewhat harder fabric 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.859
 which ensures that no material 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.450
 gets stuck in year zipper here 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.579
 at the top you have then 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 a box because valuables 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.750
 keep close to you and all this 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.720
 material is breathable so that it 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.170
 surplus heat can escape from you 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.490
 sleeping bags but also moisture 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.590
 can be drained so that you feel good 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.380
 comfortable in sleeping bags and lying 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.750
