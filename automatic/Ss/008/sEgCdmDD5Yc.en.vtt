00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.039
 SOLA and the World Bedouin Group are offering you 

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:06.018
 Youth Link, Collaborative Video Project 

00:00:09.618 --> 00:00:13.757
 My children and I 

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:18.116
 A film produced by a group of girls from the Middle School of Marifat 

00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:32.372
 The roads of our town are full of children playing with stones and sticks. 

00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:42.678
 When I cross the gate of my school, I see my colleagues who have come with great enthusiasm to learn. 

00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:48.102
 "Anyone who answers the wrong answer will lose her point" 

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:49.815
 "What does 'letter' mean?" 

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.145
 "'Letter' means a message." 

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:52.163
 "Right!" 

00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:54.041
 "Give it a point." 

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.093
 "Merciful?" 

00:00:55.113 --> 00:00:56.093
 "Merciful." 

00:00:57.706 --> 00:01:01.536
 This is the room we study every day. 

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:09.470
 At the end of the school day, a large number of these students go to factories and shops 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.750
 To learn careers and earn money to help their families. 

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:29.206
 On the night of the war, we went to Kabul without bringing our clothes. 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.521
 Some people could not bring their shoes and left their homes barefoot. 

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:37.263
 Some of my colleagues went to foreign countries where they worked out. 

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.865
 They put them harder because they can not study. 

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:44.855
 Instead of studying, they must work to support their families in their country. 

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:49.425
 We were lucky in our town. But we are no longer lucky because there is no good work here. 

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:54.785
 I can not earn enough money to support my family. 

00:01:58.461 --> 00:01:59.851
 "How much does it cost?" 

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:00.528
 "Hi" 

00:02:00.528 --> 00:02:01.076
 "Hi" 

00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:02.794
 "How much does that cost?" 

00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:07.444
 The Spirit of God is one of the children who came to Kabul because of the war. 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.748
 This is a war refugee camp. 

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:29.204
 Wali, a 13-year-old boy, lives in this camp with the rest of his family. 

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:33.364
 In addition to studying, Wali learns sewing. 

00:02:51.023 --> 00:02:54.583
 On TV, I always watch the news of war and conflict. 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:59.801
 I hope that our country will achieve peace one of these days 

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:06.711
 So that 70 percent of the girls and 50 percent of the remaining children who do not go to school can go and learn like me. 

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:48.981
 We and my friends started an active group at the school to discuss these various issues. 

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:53.544
 "I think we should talk about the situation of the Afghan people ..." 

00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:57.024
 "Yes ... and we have to talk about children too ..." 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:06.159
 "For example: those who put them good and those who put them bad." 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.333
 "For example, the boys from Helmand who came here after being driven from their homes ..." 

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.795
 "Then we can talk about children who put them well." 

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:24.709
 "These Afghan children who have migrated to work ... their displacement is a very difficult task for their parents." 

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:30.849
 "I feel sad about immigrant boys because they can not study properly." 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.440
 "We feel about our immigrant brothers and sisters as we feel about our true brothers and sisters." 

00:04:38.368 --> 00:04:44.778
 "They work and study ... showing their strength and self-sufficiency." 

00:04:45.242 --> 00:04:50.842
 "They saw the violence ... expecting them to be depressed ... but they are not!" 

00:04:50.913 --> 00:04:59.453
 "You always see them as positive and working with all their might to rebuild their country and create a bright future for themselves." 

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:10.671
 We want to build a state with a future where children are not harmed.
