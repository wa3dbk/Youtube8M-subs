00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
they cook the chicken this is like they

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.289 
they cook the chicken this is like they
strip<00:01:07.249> all<00:01:07.399> the<00:01:07.520> chicken<00:01:07.819> off<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.090> bones

strip all the chicken off the bones

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.270 
strip all the chicken off the bones
they're<00:01:08.810> using<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:09.319> for<00:01:09.469> whatever<00:01:09.679> you<00:01:10.130> know

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
they're using it for whatever you know

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.459 
they're using it for whatever you know
they're<00:01:10.490> gonna<00:01:10.609> make<00:01:10.819> chicken<00:01:11.119> breasts<00:01:11.569> or<00:01:11.719> or

they're gonna make chicken breasts or or
whatnot<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:13.729> know<00:01:13.819> then<00:01:14.060> they<00:01:14.240> then<00:01:14.869> they

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
whatnot you know then they then they

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.230 
whatnot you know then they then they
they<00:01:15.770> want<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.100> get<00:01:16.219> every<00:01:16.520> last<00:01:16.700> scrap<00:01:17.029> of

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
they want to get every last scrap of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.779 
they want to get every last scrap of
meat<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.469> they<00:01:18.529> could<00:01:18.799> possibly<00:01:19.009> sell<00:01:19.549> off

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
meat that they could possibly sell off

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.749 
meat that they could possibly sell off
this<00:01:20.029> chicken<00:01:20.469> so<00:01:21.469> once<00:01:21.950> they<00:01:22.130> once<00:01:22.520> they've

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
this chicken so once they once they've

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.019 
this chicken so once they once they've
got<00:01:22.939> all<00:01:23.149> of<00:01:23.329> that<00:01:23.359> meat<00:01:24.279> rendered<00:01:25.279> off<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.850> the

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:26.029 
got all of that meat rendered off of the

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.959 
got all of that meat rendered off of the
bone<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.569> know<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.920> know<00:01:28.069> the<00:01:28.759> raw

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
bone you know the you know the raw

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.749 
bone you know the you know the raw
chicken<00:01:29.380> then<00:01:30.380> they<00:01:30.560> take<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:30.979> bones<00:01:31.249> and

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
chicken then they take the bones and

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.639 
chicken then they take the bones and
they<00:01:32.509> throw<00:01:32.749> them<00:01:32.869> in<00:01:32.959> a<00:01:32.990> hopper<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.529> they

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
they throw them in a hopper and they

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.639 
they throw them in a hopper and they
crunch<00:01:33.950> them<00:01:34.130> up<00:01:34.929> then<00:01:35.929> they<00:01:36.139> throw<00:01:36.409> that

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
crunch them up then they throw that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.819 
crunch them up then they throw that
crunched-up<00:01:37.069> chicken<00:01:37.670> bone<00:01:38.439> concoction<00:01:39.439> into
