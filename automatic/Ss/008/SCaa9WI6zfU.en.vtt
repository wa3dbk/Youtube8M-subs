00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.790
 we are super well I think that everyone 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.559
 let's start the classes so I do not know 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.259
 I had a better idea that you speak 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.910
 again the video back to school 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:23.860
 but you know super improved and updated 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.989
 like some really good tips that are going to 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.830
 help to be much better 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:32.700
 so let's start at once 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.590
 tip number 1 effort a little bit more in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.900
 buy all the supplies you 're going to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.640
 use so that you put lots of 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.760
 more desire when studying 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.710
 is in my backpack is a lot more 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.930
 sober of colorism and simple is that 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.690
 a point that is the black and the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.200
 camel and good is cloth and super 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.900
 portable in truth so I love 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.240
 in the first part I have the first 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.960
 toilet paper pockets as you already 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.390
 I said I have allergies my lips and for 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.790
 supposedly black to be able to pay the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.320
 mobility of which I am going and the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.520
 another I have 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.850
 my phone 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.850
 and my hearing aids that is the most basic 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.140
 and we do not have to do much and here 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.930
 also the domestic ones and we open and ready 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.810
 The first thing we have are my glasses 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.409
 Sun my wallet in case I need some 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.450
 document me cosmetiquera that has what 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:47.120
 simplest really that has the most 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 simple has therefore the compact a rumor 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.289
 a mascara 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.930
 like a lip balm in this case is 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.220
 the baby 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.830
 the little arrow to steal 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.320
 and a list to kill my hair for 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.060
 If it was already taken loose and nothing else 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.970
 that 's all I think the university that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.540
 does not go with a mask and with one side as if 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.970
 that base or supports and nothing else my 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.160
 cartridge belt that I'm really in love with 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.700
 of my cartridge belt I love says big 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.650
 hozone boyacÃ¡ to be leaving this 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.430
 part of the holster much more 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.330
 close so they can see and well by trying more 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.810
 simple 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.380
 I bring a rubber jumper scissor in the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.540
 Ecuador 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.690
 nor colored pencils like I had them 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.110
 said to be able to take notes pairs 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:45.770
 and some fossils just the easiest 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.510
 now there are more basic I have this 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.460
 booklet to take notes very 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.470
 important are very punctual and I 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.140
 I love them I'm going to leave you too 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.300
 improvised here is super nice and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.460
 has the white sheets 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.260
 and finally came to my notebook to 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.570
 take notes that in this case no longer 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.720
 has as many as five in the classroom and 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.690
 also clouds the inclusion 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.220
 and in the last pocket in here in 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.430
 here what I bring is the charger of my 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.610
 cellular with its two adapters one for 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.160
 the car and the other to plug in normal 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.160
 in an outlet and my memory 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.960
 and nothing more 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.600
 backpack this type number 2 looks for garments 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.850
 Simple beautiful and comfortable to create 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.220
 a better environment when studying 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.170
 for example these shirts are very 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.060
 easy to combine and you can 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.180
 use with shorts or pants 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.610
 besides these funny phrases that bring 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.140
 Make your look a lot more 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.140
 cheerful and fun 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.540
 tip number 3 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.970
 prepare a schedule or a task chart 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.549
 as in this case I did something super 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.170
 improvised that is from Monday to Saturday and 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.480
 where I'm going to put all the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.790
 tasks or things that I have to do you'll see 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.329
 that way you do not miss anything and you meet 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.329
 with everything 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.000
 tip number 4 either in class or at home 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:27.530
 take notes of the most important just 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.930
 of what you think is really 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.030
 important because if not your notebook is 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.699
 will fill many things and it will be done to you 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.919
 much heavier to study remember 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.379
 put it in colors or highlight it with 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.479
 colors to make it easier if 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.879
 are you investigating on the computer I 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.830
 I recommend that you first take note of 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.500
 the key parts and points very 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.449
 important in your notebook after that 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.400
 when you have read all the information 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.129
 you can copy it and paste it to some 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.110
 Word document and finally tip 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:01.969
 number 5 seeks a clean environment 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.159
 nice where you feel comfortable 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:06.680
 and you like what you see around and 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:09.440
 course very well ventilated and fresh 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.690
 so that you can have a lot more 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.360
 concentration and it does not stay so boring 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.969
 study 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.830
 I really like this video that 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.199
 have helped and if they put in 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.909
 practice can not can not 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.340
 comment gave me and put me down here 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.229
 I would also like to see what they want to see 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.090
 the video of this goal that I have here that 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.219
 They asked me what I actually am 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.349
 super attentive to all my social networks 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.659
 that as always I leave them under the 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.699
 information caps are not in giving it 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.949
 like the little engine here in red that 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.289
 says to subscribe to be able to grow 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.930
 much more as a family and if that 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.789
 he liked it of course with previous 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.969
 let's see that in the next video there 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.669
 there's more so let's start with 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:54.189
 this super tags is called helping 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.009
 youtube and good the first question is 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:59.710
 what motivated you to make videos on youtube 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:03.960
 well I started always had this 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.960
 idea to teach make up
