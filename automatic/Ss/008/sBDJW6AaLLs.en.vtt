00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.940 
earthing rod up to that cable and the to
just<00:01:03.539> plug<00:01:03.839> together<00:01:08.030> if<00:01:09.030> connected<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.720> rod

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
just plug together if connected the rod

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.609 
just plug together if connected the rod
cable<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.820> white<00:01:12.329> cable<00:01:12.990> from<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.380> sheet

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.490 
cable and the white cable from the sheet
together<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.719> just<00:01:15.990> open<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
together and now if we just open the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.670 
together and now if we just open the
window<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:19.909> feed<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.329> rod<00:01:21.570> cable<00:01:22.350> through

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
window and feed the rod cable through

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.730 
window and feed the rod cable through
the<00:01:23.070> window<00:01:26.539> position<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.570> cable<00:01:27.899> in<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the window position the cable in the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
the window position the cable in the
hinge<00:01:29.039> corner<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.789> window<00:01:30.149> so<00:01:30.899> that's<00:01:31.020> on

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
hinge corner of the window so that's on

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
hinge corner of the window so that's on
the<00:01:31.289> other<00:01:31.530> side<00:01:31.649> Joe<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> tends<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the other side Joe and then it tends to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.429 
the other side Joe and then it tends to
stay<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.479> place<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.340> then<00:01:39.140> after<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.259> have

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
stay in place and then after we have

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
stay in place and then after we have
dropped<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.799> cable<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.179> simply

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
dropped the cable down we can simply

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.169 
dropped the cable down we can simply
close<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.170> window<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.369> stays<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.909> place

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
close the window and it stays in place

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.499 
close the window and it stays in place
the<00:01:46.079> cable<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.590> very<00:01:46.619> robust<00:01:47.429> we<00:01:48.179> have<00:01:48.329> had<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the cable is very robust we have had a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719 
the cable is very robust we have had a
cable<00:01:48.780> installed<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.679> over<00:01:49.920> three<00:01:50.189> years<00:01:50.460> and

cable installed for over three years and

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
cable installed for over three years and
we<00:01:51.270> open<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.719> close<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.109> window<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.679> least

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
we open and close the window at least

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.580 
we open and close the window at least
once<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.460> day<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.670> air<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> room<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:55.109> check<00:01:55.439> the
