00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
the Yamaha guys are here we're getting a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:35.190 
the Yamaha guys are here we're getting a
chance<00:00:18.710> to<00:00:18.890> ride<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.390> 2015<00:00:20.680> yz250<00:00:21.680> fm

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.050 

so<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.320> new<00:00:36.440> FX<00:00:36.950> is<00:00:37.220> a<00:00:37.340> little<00:00:37.640> bit<00:00:37.760> different

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
so the new FX is a little bit different

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.200 
so the new FX is a little bit different
it's<00:00:38.180> based<00:00:38.390> off<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.810> yz250<00:00:39.500> f<00:00:39.920> but<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.730> has<00:00:40.910> a

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
it's based off the yz250 f but it has a

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.690 
it's based off the yz250 f but it has a
wider<00:00:41.450> ratio<00:00:41.900> transmission<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.920> little<00:00:43.580> bit

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
wider ratio transmission a little bit

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.520 
wider ratio transmission a little bit
different<00:00:44.030> mapping<00:00:44.480> it's<00:00:44.780> got<00:00:44.900> an<00:00:45.020> 18<00:00:45.350> inch

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
different mapping it's got an 18 inch

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.250 
different mapping it's got an 18 inch
rear<00:00:45.710> wheel<00:00:46.010> but<00:00:46.790> basically<00:00:47.570> based<00:00:47.810> off<00:00:48.080> the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
rear wheel but basically based off the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.420 
rear wheel but basically based off the
yz250<00:00:48.860> f

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
yz250 f

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.400 
yz250 f
this<00:00:50.000> bike<00:00:50.180> is<00:00:50.330> actually<00:00:50.510> really<00:00:50.870> good<00:00:51.140> both

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
this bike is actually really good both

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.070 
this bike is actually really good both
on<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.890> moto<00:00:52.100> moto<00:00:52.790> track<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.810> trail

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
on the moto moto track and on the trail

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.350 
on the moto moto track and on the trail
it's<00:00:54.380> got<00:00:54.590> a<00:00:54.620> little<00:00:54.830> bit<00:00:55.040> less<00:00:55.370> hit<00:00:55.790> when<00:00:56.270> it

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
it's got a little bit less hit when it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.330 
it's got a little bit less hit when it
comes<00:00:56.510> right<00:00:56.690> off<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.960> bottom<00:00:57.320> then<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.650> 250

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
comes right off the bottom then the 250

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.580 
comes right off the bottom then the 250
F<00:00:58.490> does<00:00:58.730> but<00:00:59.120> it's<00:00:59.270> got<00:00:59.420> really<00:01:00.140> good<00:01:00.350> power

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
F does but it's got really good power

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:14.370 
F does but it's got really good power
trackable<00:01:01.490> power<00:01:01.670> on<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.120> trip

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.080
