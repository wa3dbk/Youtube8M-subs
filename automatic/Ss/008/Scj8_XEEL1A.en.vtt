00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
little bit of a delay when you do it

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.910 
little bit of a delay when you do it
it's<00:00:44.330> not<00:00:44.480> real<00:00:44.840> good<00:00:45.020> at<00:00:45.080> that<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.710> stuff

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920

it's not real good at that the stuff
it's<00:00:46.100> better<00:00:46.340> at<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:47.650> this<00:00:48.650> kind<00:00:48.890> of<00:00:48.950> stuff<00:00:50.890> for

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
it's better at is this kind of stuff for

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.590 
it's better at is this kind of stuff for
you<00:00:52.040> flipping<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:52.670> turning<00:00:52.820> on<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.120> dime<00:00:53.210> as

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
you flipping and turning on a dime as

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.120 
you flipping and turning on a dime as
opposed<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.110> having<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.440> collective<00:00:54.950> change

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
opposed to having the collective change

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:03.760 
opposed to having the collective change
on<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.400> dime<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:02.690> I<00:01:02.720> can<00:01:02.900> turn<00:01:03.050> inside<00:01:03.500> out<00:01:03.530> and

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
on the dime so I can turn inside out and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.850 
on the dime so I can turn inside out and
just<00:01:04.309> about<00:01:04.460> any<00:01:04.699> space<00:01:05.440> without<00:01:06.440> taking<00:01:06.770> up

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
just about any space without taking up

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.490 
just about any space without taking up
any<00:01:07.790> power

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.690 

so<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.070> different<00:01:14.250> style

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so it's just kind of a different style

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
so it's just kind of a different style
