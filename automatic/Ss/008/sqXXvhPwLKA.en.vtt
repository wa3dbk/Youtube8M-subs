00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.640
 the world is facing many people 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 of course they can be challenged 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 so I want it is our strength 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.749
 the few texts all the way 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.289
 let's act now 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.289
 but to make our contribution to the building 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.819
 sarah palin made a synthesis 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.499
 sectors 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:31.759
 and the last outings 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:32.950
 of course 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.780
 youth 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.910
 if necessary 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.470
 between two stands 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.210
 they are the ones who bring answers 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.090
 the means of our ambitions 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.030
 proposing solutions 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 and electrical repairs 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.380
 we can not remain indifferent 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.200
 in France things have changed 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.250
 three sessions 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.600
 it is in this logic 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.360
 we organized the pan-African youth forum to identify 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.020
 the next weeks 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.870
 identify them 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.850
 Le Havre were pampered 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.300
 although we do 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.300
 let's build together this building site under construction 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.190
 we are in the process of writing a book 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.610
 the collective and participative 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.070
 which is getting worse 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.070
 at the origin of the youth exhibition 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.950
 for that we need table 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.040
 for writing 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.210
 another chapter 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 augustine 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.080
 the room 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.079
 cause of the crisis 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.079
 reuters it could rise to 6 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.170
 France-evening
