00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.920

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.219
 opportunity in the channel 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.629
 I believe there is an opportunity left to the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.640
 games and then already depending on if I 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.289

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.750
 Greetings days from almería and if I go to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.430
 climb more then be it I know there are people 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.400
 in the channel every one who does not like the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.690
 pain but 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.640
 for the moment everything that I have uploaded has 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.890
 liked and has support as I said in the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.540
 previous video the videos of 2 the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.160
 tried to do in a way that although you 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.930
 do not know how to play what you know 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.680
 entertain yourself or you laugh 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.510
 I will never climb in professional mode or 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.490
 I do not know if you understand me but not 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.200
 you know play what I try to do is that 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.150
 there are things that I will keep going up 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.550
 lol and as I say you are liking 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.620
 quite and then support it is that I believe 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.050
 what is important so if for that 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.000
 part yes see well very well 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.310
 Juanes Tyler asks us what are you going to do 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.860
 waves or you follow or good or videos in the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.450
 all-star responded because it was that if you go 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.310
 to make waves in the long this game 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.500
 has many ways to troll greetings 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.420
 from argentina I am one of those who think 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.479
 that to troll first you have to know 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.160
 playing and knowing how to play olé is complicated 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.840
 I believe that once time passes and 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.600
 know how to play and know what I can do 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.340
 the game maybe trolling my style but 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 I doubt that right now I put another lear 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.119
 basically because I do not know how to play 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.040
 that as I say to you I think you have to 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.869
 know how to play to be able to read another 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.149
 in him as in the can so nothing 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.310
 for the moment he left there like that where the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.980
 Good question, I am going to give my 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.970
 opinion 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.459
 and I in this game do not see either that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.090
 be much you need it does not make you either 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.900
 missing is the diamond to troll level 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.569
 26 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.840
 good but what are called trolls 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.849
 fix do not take one and you adapt 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.709
 the good this for people who do not 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.400
 understand very well but how good that yes 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.599
 that you could do something but good 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.690
 good good you want 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.640
 come dj that cox asks us hello jose 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.870
 they would call me group I am 13 years old and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.890
 I wanted to ask you how you can stand 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.670
 the stress of the videos 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.670
 a boy of 13 years 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.860
 well there are times that it is true that 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.840
 it generates more stress or less but as 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.820
 you know step from being my hobby to doing this 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.680
 a job for me and to be a job 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.930
 Well, I have to dedicate a few hours to 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.760
 day then for apart from that for me 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.980
 for you and yes it is true that a 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.290
 Sometimes I generate stress but fuck is my 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.880
 work and let's go I think I have the fucking 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.250
 best job in the world at least 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.960
 for what I like so I 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.130
 not a good time can not complain 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.200
 minecraft mine because I could honestly 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.970
 question will you upload minecraft your second 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.910
 channel if it's like that when you greet 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.400
 Argentina when it is Argentine minecraft 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.220
 in his time I liked and he follows me 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.080
 liking but as I say goes they are games 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.820
 passengers that I try them I like those 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.500
 there was and then stopped them going up without further 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.480
 by technological playing like what 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.400
 better it happens to me with the likes I upload it 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.380
 but then although you like it a lot 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.510
 happened with minecraft if it does not call me 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.220
 I'm not convinced to upload it, I'm not going to 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.170
 keep going up so I think the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.700
 base is what I like and that I 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.250
 like you but in principle that 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.560
 I had I been doing 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:03.200
 but who knows 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.090
 banzai asks when you make a video 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.040
 you have a script or everything is improvised in 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.440
 the case of improviser the dialogues are 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.120
 great to see a script for the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.650
 dialogues we do not have yes it is true that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.900
 we have I think there is a pattern to what 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.970
 better me when I go to gta in my head 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.350
 I have thought that is what we are going to 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.120
 do for example the challenges that 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.799
 we do or what is some things but 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.020
 yes it is true that the great 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.330
 mostly all improvised but as I say 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.220
 we have some bases that we try 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.050
 carry out well as for example 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.730
 they will ask questions and answers that I take 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.890
 We take the questions and do the 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.710
 the answers no matter what everything is 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.270
 improvised but if there are some little things 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.400
 that we do have in mind that we want 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.160
 do and then everything else is already but 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.350
 good is referring to actions and I think 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.450
 that this subscriber was referring to the 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.080
 nonsense that you say to us the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.080
 words 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.840
 I think it would be very forced and I do not know no 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.000
 it would be equal 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.639
 well let's see with the next but 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 the interested man asks what 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.740
 company or alias sale and if it is the best 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.380
 of those who think about their 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.139
 professionalism playing is number one 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.639
 of the ghosts the world knows it is the 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.990
 fucking that is the ghosts 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.280
 it's a ghost fucking when you put 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.240
 balance there is a character called 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.490
 ghost to set and company after 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.440
 this sale is pretty good 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.449
 character puts the last stanza on the map 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.349
 then you throw it away and it does not do anything 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.839
 A) Yes 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:37.029
 in that question my dear friend 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.469
 necessary because you want me to think 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:41.050
 that you have to play starts with one 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:43.119
 chile and you want to shoot yourself for 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.159
 both times because it 's little complicated 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:47.229
 play with that one whatever it is is that 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.780
 even the parchís is difficult to play 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.090
 get 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.910
 and I understand that she is a very girl 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.910
 and that is also very good in everything 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.270
 loves me to have the time to 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.889
 cardboards that ends video so no 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.270
 there is more to remember as always 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.040
 You can leave your questions in the 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.760
 twitter hashtag or in the 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.590
 comments 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.060
 and nothing we do the most interesting 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.710
 we always try to put so I know 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.970
 that there is a little bit of humor and that 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.500
 some that are interesting or that 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.090
 have to do with in Canada and how 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.380
