00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.820
 Hello and welcome grant to today from the 200 we are under 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.739
 the detainees one of the shortcomings 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.659
 Marcus Hellwig and knights for nuclear power binding as chocolate and comes 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.819
 usually from Switzerland what makes my life a trump card in Ditzingen 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.540
 These are machines are engineering 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.120
 which equipment to improve 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.460
 Hansen, the mechatronics engineer or mechatronics technician, knows this today 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.490
 and they need for what the punching machine to be quiet 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.400
 Rudolf Strommer Volmer a tenant from the post was Kramer from the outside 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 but right now it's all works out 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.330
 Alois Ortner &amp; Ortner condemned a Upper Austrian, Michael gripped 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.900
 Employee 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.310
 a turnaround that's what you need 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.030
 it happened to me that way 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 I'll turn the 15 everything does not change 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.190
 especially nice that we stay here in their apartment in London 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.780
 of course, make 6 inches a month to properly tackle and break 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.620
 Stadtfeld and with other important occupations and not in the showcases 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.290
 his 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.479
 for municipalities and five millimeters 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.000
 So exactly where are these laser snowing heads of the readers machines 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.100
 So nothing goes wrong so these must be tested 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 before they are put into a machine 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.119
 because of the inaccuracy that shows such a reader to a depth of 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.810
 4000 degrees 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.700
 for Melzer does not stop by 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.210
 a fire destroyed with food 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.510
 can be programmed for every conceivable form 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 Company logo down to the smallest ridiculous Philippsthal 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.030
 because a mechatronics engineer does not only work then works for us 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.160
 a punching machine continues here but before commissioning one more 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.440
 Son action days are performed 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.720
 With 1000 Volt voltage is tested whether all lines in the machine 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.340
 operate faultlessly or withstand this voltage 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:15.339
 Like the reader, resistance can fall into any imaginable form 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.259
 Budget to be incorporated 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.719
 however, something is combined about it that can 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:26.179
 as the profession of mechatronics technician from the profession of mechanic and electronics 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:30.299
 Computer scientist is it is not surprising that with such a 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.539
 Machine must also create hand during assembly 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.259
 and 8 from start to finish 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.299
 During the three-and-a-half year training, the trainees receive several 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.609
 Such machines and have the task to complete them 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.609
 a task that shows how versatile your profession is 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.599
 like insiders from the electronics sector 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.319
 represents very very extensive are manifold 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.939
 big machines work 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.209
 then in different areas 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.209
 especially in my opinion is not a luxury 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.499
 especially now that's fine 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:10.729
 the special thing about the job 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.789
 Israel is to vaccinate the SNM several occupations 110 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.679
 on the one hand it is the mechanics 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.829
 Dr asked is forgiven for the second time 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.229
 and go to peace only by luck 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:25.739
 what if I met the outer walls now 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.909
 Great prospects for the future or what will happen then? 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.529
 or training opportunities are in the report that makes more 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.039
 formats 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.030
 the technician 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.009
 in the report and of course 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.689
 the study could 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.909
 the Steirer many thanks for the information 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.909
 the viewers are allowed to be a lot more versatile 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:46.459
 the children 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.629
 I say goodbye for today and it was nice 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.279
 Until next time
