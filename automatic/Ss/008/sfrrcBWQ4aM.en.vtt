tool<00:03:14.879> and<00:03:17.090> actually<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.859> have<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.009> remember

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
tool and actually you have to remember

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.469 
tool and actually you have to remember
to<00:03:21.150> create<00:03:21.659> and<00:03:22.729> collision<00:03:23.729> sphere<00:03:24.150> inside

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
to create and collision sphere inside

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:29.170 
to create and collision sphere inside
your<00:03:25.079> head<00:03:25.379> before<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:26.099> create<00:03:26.759> the<00:03:27.259> the<00:03:28.259> this

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
your head before you create the the this

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.679 
your head before you create the the this
constraint<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:31.079> actually<00:03:31.799> you<00:03:32.329> create<00:03:33.329> both

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
constraint so actually you create both

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.289 
constraint so actually you create both
constraints<00:03:34.500> at<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> same<00:03:34.919> time<00:03:35.159> both<00:03:35.939> the

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
constraints at the same time both the

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.749 
constraints at the same time both the
transform<00:03:36.870> constraint<00:03:37.409> then<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.009> select

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:38.759 
transform constraint then you select

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.390 
transform constraint then you select
your<00:03:39.060> rest<00:03:39.930> position<00:03:40.500> curves<00:03:40.829> again<00:03:41.159> and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
your rest position curves again and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.869 
your rest position curves again and
create<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:43.590> one<00:03:43.829> here<00:03:45.500> colitis<00:03:46.500> fear<00:03:46.949> so

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
create the this one here colitis fear so

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.830 
create the this one here colitis fear so
when<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.509> move<00:03:49.079> your<00:03:49.379> transform<00:03:50.189> backwards

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
when you move your transform backwards

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.209 
when you move your transform backwards
your<00:03:51.840> hair<00:03:52.259> will<00:03:52.560> stay<00:03:52.979> out<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.729> the<00:03:54.329> head

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:55.219 
your hair will stay out of the head

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:02.390 
your hair will stay out of the head
instead<00:03:56.219> of<00:03:56.370> going<00:03:56.639> through<00:03:56.969> it<00:03:58.879> and<00:04:01.400> when

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
instead of going through it and when

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.640 
instead of going through it and when
you're<00:04:02.639> done<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:03.120> can<00:04:03.479> if<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.259> like<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
you're done you can if you like the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.899 
you're done you can if you like the
position<00:04:05.189> of<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:06.019> hair<00:04:07.019> in<00:04:07.609> certain<00:04:08.609> frame

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
position of the hair in certain frame

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.080 
position of the hair in certain frame
during<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.689> interactive<00:04:10.319> playback<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:11.699> can

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
during the interactive playback you can

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.640 
during the interactive playback you can
press<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:12.989> Cape<00:04:13.530> key<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.299> then<00:04:15.299> go<00:04:15.719> select

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
press this Cape key and then go select

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.420 
press this Cape key and then go select
your<00:04:16.680> hair<00:04:17.099> and<00:04:17.340> go<00:04:17.759> to<00:04:17.820> hair<00:04:18.949> set<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.099> start

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
your hair and go to hair set the start

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.510 
your hair and go to hair set the start
position<00:04:20.609> from<00:04:21.239> current<00:04:22.580> what<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.699> does<00:04:23.940> he

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
position from current what it does he

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.219 
position from current what it does he
to<00:04:24.900> when<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.139> go<00:04:26.560> back<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.860> your<00:04:27.099> first<00:04:27.639> frame

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
to when you go back to your first frame

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.850 
to when you go back to your first frame
the<00:04:29.229> hair<00:04:29.770> will<00:04:29.949> stay<00:04:30.340> like<00:04:30.580> this<00:04:31.289> and<00:04:32.289> you<00:04:32.650> can

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
the hair will stay like this and you can

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.960 
the hair will stay like this and you can
continue<00:04:33.009> tricking<00:04:34.000> your<00:04:34.120> hair<00:04:34.479> and<00:04:35.970> combine

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
continue tricking your hair and combine

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.230 
continue tricking your hair and combine
it<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.960> can<00:04:38.169> also<00:04:38.379> do<00:04:39.159> something<00:04:39.759> like<00:04:40.030> this

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
it you can also do something like this

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.189 
it you can also do something like this
if<00:04:40.479> you<00:04:40.750> go<00:04:41.139> to<00:04:41.199> display<00:04:42.190> rest<00:04:42.879> position<00:04:43.449> you

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
if you go to display rest position you

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.350 
if you go to display rest position you
can<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.830> can<00:04:45.099> remember<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:45.970> can<00:04:46.180> actually

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
can you can remember you can actually

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.830 
can you can remember you can actually
take<00:04:47.229> a<00:04:47.289> few<00:04:47.590> curves<00:04:47.889> and<00:04:48.159> then<00:04:48.400> go<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.840> control

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
take a few curves and then go to control

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.740 
take a few curves and then go to control
vertex<00:04:50.229> and<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:51.580> can<00:04:51.789> actually<00:04:51.970> change<00:04:52.599> the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
vertex and you can actually change the

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.570 
vertex and you can actually change the
shape<00:04:53.289> of<00:04:53.560> your<00:04:54.419> hair<00:04:55.419> stand<00:04:55.840> by<00:04:56.800> modifying

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
shape of your hair stand by modifying

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:05.520 
shape of your hair stand by modifying
the<00:04:59.069> day<00:05:00.870> curve<00:05:01.870> here<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.840> it's<00:05:04.990> something<00:05:05.199> you

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
the day curve here so it's something you

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.909 
the day curve here so it's something you
should<00:05:05.919> remember<00:05:06.310> as<00:05:06.759> well<00:05:07.319> and<00:05:08.319> thing<00:05:08.800> is

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
should remember as well and thing is

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.399 
should remember as well and thing is
that<00:05:09.159> even<00:05:09.310> if<00:05:09.699> it<00:05:09.940> is<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.360> little<00:05:10.960> bit<00:05:11.139> of<00:05:11.169> a

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
that even if it is a little bit of a

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.300 
that even if it is a little bit of a
time-consuming<00:05:11.949> process<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:14.620> me<00:05:14.830> it's<00:05:15.039> better

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
time-consuming process to me it's better

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.930 
time-consuming process to me it's better
than<00:05:15.610> using<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.330> one<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:17.110> worry<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:18.460> used<00:05:18.789> to

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
than using the one you worry you used to

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.499 
than using the one you worry you used to
make<00:05:19.300> your<00:05:19.599> hair<00:05:20.169> right<00:05:20.500> now<00:05:20.849> because<00:05:21.849> on<00:05:22.240> this

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
make your hair right now because on this

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.129 
make your hair right now because on this
method<00:05:24.000> first<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.240> all<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.539> hair<00:05:25.870> will<00:05:26.110> look

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
method first of all the hair will look

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.520 
method first of all the hair will look
like<00:05:26.590> it<00:05:26.979> grows<00:05:27.430> from<00:05:28.240> inside<00:05:28.870> your<00:05:29.139> skull

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
like it grows from inside your skull

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.839 
like it grows from inside your skull
rather<00:05:30.430> than<00:05:30.729> flowing<00:05:31.419> along<00:05:32.409> it<00:05:32.620> as<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.639> does

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
rather than flowing along it as it does

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.860 
rather than flowing along it as it does
on<00:05:33.880> your<00:05:34.419> method<00:05:34.979> but<00:05:35.979> each<00:05:36.250> to<00:05:36.550> its<00:05:36.699> own<00:05:36.969> if

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
on your method but each to its own if

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.860 
on your method but each to its own if
you<00:05:38.319> continue<00:05:38.710> using<00:05:39.430> your<00:05:39.849> method<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.509> thing

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
you continue using your method the thing

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.120 
you continue using your method the thing
that<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:42.300> think<00:05:43.300> you<00:05:43.630> should<00:05:43.930> do<00:05:44.199> is<00:05:44.440> something

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
that I think you should do is something

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.459 
that I think you should do is something
like<00:05:45.430> this<00:05:45.610> this<00:05:46.029> is<00:05:46.210> actually<00:05:47.139> one<00:05:47.289> of<00:05:47.319> the

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
like this this is actually one of the

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.939 
like this this is actually one of the
curves<00:05:47.889> you<00:05:48.250> used<00:05:48.810> so<00:05:49.810> what<00:05:49.960> I'm<00:05:50.080> doing<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:50.680> I

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
curves you used so what I'm doing is I

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.809 
curves you used so what I'm doing is I
am<00:05:51.960> bending<00:05:52.960> it<00:05:53.319> so<00:05:53.620> it<00:05:53.770> looks<00:05:54.039> like<00:05:54.310> it<00:05:54.580> comes

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
am bending it so it looks like it comes

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.769 
am bending it so it looks like it comes
from<00:05:55.029> inside<00:05:55.659> the<00:05:55.719> school<00:05:56.610> skull<00:05:57.610> I'm<00:05:58.449> sorry

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
from inside the school skull I'm sorry

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:04.499 
from inside the school skull I'm sorry
and<00:05:59.909> yeah<00:06:01.889> looks<00:06:02.889> like<00:06:03.009> it<00:06:03.400> comes<00:06:03.729> from<00:06:03.969> inside

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
and yeah looks like it comes from inside

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.510 
and yeah looks like it comes from inside
the<00:06:04.569> scalp<00:06:05.080> here<00:06:06.069> and<00:06:07.529> do<00:06:08.529> that<00:06:08.740> for<00:06:09.099> the<00:06:09.340> rest

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
the scalp here and do that for the rest

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.769 
the scalp here and do that for the rest
of<00:06:09.759> your<00:06:10.000> curves<00:06:11.400> whatever<00:06:12.400> method<00:06:12.880> works<00:06:13.180> and
