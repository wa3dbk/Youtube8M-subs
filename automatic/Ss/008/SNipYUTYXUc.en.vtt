00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 then always maturity is enough nails 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.930
 and I make sugar and like a glaze 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.530
 orange we do breaks on the thumb 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.370
 annular is a single color on medium little finger 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.370
 and index 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.140
 is to let dry we need 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.150
 let's say a very thin brush 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.619
 double zero number triple zero is 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:42.470
 of the humber will be issued without France 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:45.710
 monaco the hour to make of the web 22 then 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:01:00.790
 make some curved recipes among 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:01:00.790
 these three rays that we have done 2 3 2 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.040
 in the nails instead with the france that is 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 the ring finger is the thumb 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.270
 we have to make a face on what like 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.049
 guard objects just do two 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.049
 triangles 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.210
 for teeth instead we first have to do 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.210
 a zag line 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.200
 and then a circle that inter if it 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.640
 seemed close but I assure you it is not 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.030
 also because the lines are not needed 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.450
 that they are the same perfect thing in the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.450
 coffin 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.409
 now let it dry well 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.800
 painting for a few minutes and then 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.690
 pass layer of transparent enamel and 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.180
 now it all ended with a double paste 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.810
 of top coat from the first the sugar and ed 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.810
 also the second one 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.680
 I recommend to seal controls well 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.600
 because the micro car with the enamel 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.770
 does not last long if you are not careful 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.770
 seal sides well
