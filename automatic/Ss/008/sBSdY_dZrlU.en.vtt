 shrimp deglaze with white wine you go 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.920
 in addition it is very simple and what is 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.210
 that it's good then we'll start 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 look through the vegetables 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.640
 I'm going to pay the little onions 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.230
 keep that I'm not slashed too much except 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.939
 one again because for a dead he 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.680
 must not put them at the bottom to see 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.210
 little onions and you're going 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.260
 to do with a small knife thrifty 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 go make pretty strips of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.390
 carrots 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.619
 So here you go, spread out during 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.890
 finish making carrots 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.760
 I start to heat the wok 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.460
 I put a trickle of oil you have to be 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.469
 quite generous 8.1 and wok cooking 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.239
 yesterday it takes a little bit of oil if we 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 wants to have a cooking of property browning 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.649
 well jumped okay and while that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.410
 start to heat up I'm a tiny 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.879
 little star anise or star anise okay 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.760
 and who had started infusing in the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.300
 in vacuo will put a bottle 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.129
 complete 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.870
 Okay, we put it all ok because 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.570
 we just want it to be a fuser and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 I'm going to have ginger game on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.790
 cut into three games three pretty m 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.890
 pieces of ginger okay and there I 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.780
 begins to heat is what is 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 very important is how one is going 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.110
 take his perfumes that's what will 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.780
 make war characteristics of the rock 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.290
 okay are you going to see that it's starting to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.229
 fry there we really see that it 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.330
 Ginger anibis learns 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.619
 and the garlic and the situation it's going to be very 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.250
 quickly if you feel that what is going 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.829
 super fast 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.990
 I start looking to put the onions 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.930
 in fact if you play but vegetables at 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.920
 gradually as the cooking time and there 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.049
 what is very important is that I 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.380
 a very very rich fire when we have them 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.880
 onions 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.710
 it's always a little long to cook 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.760
 we will put 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:54.630
 you are pretty way of carrots comfort 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:56.900
 start stirring again we will add the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.900
 eat all 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.940
 I love it here we are always on a 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.150
 very soft fire 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.830
 ok I eat them all we will put 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.950
 a little stand-up care 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.950
 fully 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.290
 and look we're going to talk liters this 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.269
 raw on it is the force that is 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.349
 important is to have a very bright fire 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.260
 in fact it's cooking in less than 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.219
 three minutes his brothers what is 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.790
 super convenient is the plan that 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.189
 come home from work 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.349

 really we do not stir too much you see it's 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.599
 really that it's attacking 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.530
 what's important is that the 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.329
 shrimp on not too overcooked 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.579
