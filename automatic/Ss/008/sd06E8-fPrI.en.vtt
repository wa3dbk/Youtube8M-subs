00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
you can see and I'm really happy how it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.390 
you can see and I'm really happy how it
and<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.279> blocking<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.920> should<00:00:23.160> take<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and the blocking so we should take a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.510 
and the blocking so we should take a
look<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.449> exterior<00:00:27.109> so<00:00:28.880> there<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
look on the exterior so there is the

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
look on the exterior so there is the
same<00:00:32.520> glass<00:00:32.910> which<00:00:35.540> true<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
same glass which true we can see a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.639 
same glass which true we can see a
little<00:00:38.219> bit<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.790> shop<00:00:39.300> which<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.410> there

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
little bit of a shop which is in there

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
little bit of a shop which is in there
and<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.600> is<00:00:42.600> better<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.170> used<00:00:43.879> these<00:00:44.879> pieces

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and this is better I used these pieces

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.299 
and this is better I used these pieces
because<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.910> 1<00:00:47.910> by<00:00:48.120> 4<00:00:48.420> by<00:00:48.600> 6

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.010 

windows<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:55.039> this<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.969> wanted<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
windows so this is kind of I wanted to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.790 
windows so this is kind of I wanted to
have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> look<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.489> pillar<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.800> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
have a look on the pillar but it's it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:12.969 
have a look on the pillar but it's it
isn't<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:10.670> second<00:01:11.670> story

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
isn't and here are the second story

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.440 
isn't and here are the second story
which<00:01:13.979> we'll<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.820> later

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.480 

so<00:01:18.450> whole<00:01:19.140> building<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:21.049> 25<00:01:22.049> bricks<00:01:22.740> high<00:01:25.490> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
so whole building is 25 bricks high to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.980 
so whole building is 25 bricks high to
here<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:28.579> wouldn't<00:01:29.579> count<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> really
