question<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:32.320> as<00:00:32.649> we<00:00:33.190> know<00:00:33.399> that<00:00:34.149> minute

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
question first as we know that minute

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.340 
question first as we know that minute
hand<00:00:34.960> gains<00:00:35.760> 5.5<00:00:36.760> degree<00:00:37.120> over<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.750> hour<00:00:37.989> and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
hand gains 5.5 degree over the hour and

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.860 
hand gains 5.5 degree over the hour and
in<00:00:38.679> every<00:00:39.100> minute<00:00:39.249> this<00:00:39.850> in<00:00:40.089> every<00:00:40.660> minute

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
in every minute this in every minute

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.860 
in every minute this in every minute
there<00:00:41.620> is<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.769> difference<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.489> 5.5<00:00:43.449> degree

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
there is a difference of 5.5 degree

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.770 
there is a difference of 5.5 degree
between<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.859> minute<00:00:45.219> hand<00:00:45.429> and<00:00:45.699> hour<00:00:46.300> and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
between the minute hand and hour and

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.739 
between the minute hand and hour and
minute<00:00:47.530> hand<00:00:47.800> moves<00:00:47.890> fast<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:49.059> minute<00:00:49.449> hand

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
minute hand moves fast so minute hand

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.759 
minute hand moves fast so minute hand
gains<00:00:50.190> 5.5<00:00:51.190> degree<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.760> every<00:00:52.359> one<00:00:52.989> minute<00:00:53.199> it

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
gains 5.5 degree in every one minute it

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.840 
gains 5.5 degree in every one minute it
means<00:00:54.219> we<00:00:54.519> can<00:00:54.760> say<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.890> two<00:00:57.129> hands<00:00:57.579> will

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
means we can say the two hands will

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.059 
means we can say the two hands will
coincide<00:00:58.089> each<00:00:58.600> other.when<00:00:59.229> minute<00:00:59.710> hand

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
coincide each other.when minute hand

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.779 
coincide each other.when minute hand
will<00:01:00.699> gain<00:01:00.969> 360<00:01:01.929> degree<00:01:02.260> over<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.039> hour<00:01:03.460> hand

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
will gain 360 degree over the hour hand

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.270 
will gain 360 degree over the hour hand
when<00:01:04.450> there<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.809> a<00:01:04.840> difference<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.410> 360<00:01:06.010> degree

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
when there is a difference of 360 degree

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.430 
when there is a difference of 360 degree
angle<00:01:06.610> between<00:01:06.760> hour<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.390> minute<00:01:07.750> hand<00:01:07.960> they

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
angle between hour and minute hand they

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.770
