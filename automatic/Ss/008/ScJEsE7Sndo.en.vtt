00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 if you have a particular tooth 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.429
 carious that you have neglected and that lean 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.530
 there is also a bit broken and tooth decay 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.450
 overly deep and it is not 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.599
 enough now a series of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 belting is possible to cure this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.810
 tooth and that when one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.180
 of Italianization the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.779
 devitalization many times indeed 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.300
 corpse of very compromised teeth 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.000
 the devitalization of a tooth consists 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.279
 under anesthesia in removal with 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.329
 special nerve tools 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.520
 by the institution with respect to some time ago 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.550
 techniques to devitalize a tooth yes 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.989
 they are definitely perfected and now in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.660
 just over an hour you can 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.210
 complete a devitalization also of 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.800
 a very complex teeth and tooth fleeces 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.850
 immediately caniza story a tooth goes 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.239
 devitalized on certain occasions 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.260
 for example for those very deep where 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.420
 a simple option is not enough 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.900
 or in the case of old fillings 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.030
 now compromised infiltrated or in 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.540
 case of a tooth that must be later 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.270
 encapsulated if a student has to be 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.880
 devitalized always demanding the maximum 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.200
 a tooth can indeed be 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.170
 devitalized in many ways and with 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.810
 various materials a devitalization 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.960
 not conducted well in general determines the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.720
 granuloma formation and in some cases 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.000
 also of inflammatory cysts 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.470
 my dental center 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.020
 multi-specialist relies only on 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.840
 latest generation techniques 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.970
 we use the systems the voters in 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.070
 nickel titanium for cleaning 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.190
 of the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.620
 in the channels and close the channels 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.560
 only with all hot fishing 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.650
 following the latest state guidelines 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.890
 the art of teeth was immediately carnizza 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.990
 study devitalization allows us 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.740
 therefore to save many teeth 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.530
 compromises 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.770
 after devitalization the tooth goes 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.869
 rebuilt and where necessary 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.230
 also encapsulated digitizations 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.390
 that we perform every day are 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.910
 constantly controlled by one 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.120
 special the computer that shows us all 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.310
 the parameters of the tooth in the nineteenth century 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.310
 so are the vitalization 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.980
 computer guided and this allows us to 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.709
 carry out in a short time and with the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.709
 maximum precision and reliability 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 possible 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.729
