you feel the threads grab and then you

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.360 
you feel the threads grab and then you
can<00:05:03.280> go<00:05:03.430> cuz<00:05:03.730> lots<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.360> these<00:05:04.450> are<00:05:04.630> stripped

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
can go cuz lots of these are stripped

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.940 
can go cuz lots of these are stripped
it's<00:05:06.370> got<00:05:06.670> I<00:05:06.940> don't<00:05:07.240> know<00:05:07.510> how<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.590> specs

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
it's got I don't know how the specs

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.840 
it's got I don't know how the specs
don't<00:05:09.250> say<00:05:09.630> how<00:05:10.630> long<00:05:11.400> much<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.610> field

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
don't say how long much the field

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.150 
don't say how long much the field
thinking<00:05:13.090> hold<00:05:13.390> this<00:05:13.810> does<00:05:14.260> I've<00:05:14.830> burned

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
thinking hold this does I've burned

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.090 
thinking hold this does I've burned
about<00:05:15.310> through<00:05:15.640> three<00:05:16.150> tanks<00:05:16.540> already<00:05:16.900> in<00:05:17.140> an

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
about through three tanks already in an

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.030 
about through three tanks already in an
hour<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:20.050> might<00:05:20.200> have<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.530> be<00:05:20.650> refilling

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
hour so you might have to be refilling

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.600 
hour so you might have to be refilling
this<00:05:21.220> that's<00:05:21.970> probably<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.390> only<00:05:23.310> sad<00:05:24.310> part

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
this that's probably the only sad part

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.720
