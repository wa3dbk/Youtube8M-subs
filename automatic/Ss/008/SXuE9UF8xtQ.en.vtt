goes to the engine block and there's two

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.279 
goes to the engine block and there's two
spring<00:00:27.029> style<00:00:27.359> clips<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.869> you'll<00:00:28.019> need<00:00:28.170> to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
screws aren't sticking out far enough so

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.539 
screws aren't sticking out far enough so
you<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:43.990> get<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.289> bit<00:01:44.979> oil<00:01:45.159> catch-can

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
you can get the bit oil catch-can

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.880 
you can get the bit oil catch-can
installed<00:01:45.939> so<00:01:46.720> then<00:01:46.899> you'll<00:01:47.049> just<00:01:47.200> slip<00:01:47.710> the

installed so then you'll just slip the
oil<00:01:48.039> catch<00:01:48.189> game<00:01:48.429> over<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.090> over<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.899> bracket

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
oil catch game over the over the bracket

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:04.760 
oil catch game over the over the bracket
and<00:01:52.659> then<00:01:52.780> just<00:01:53.049> tighten<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.530> set<00:01:53.709> screws

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.680 

you

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.180 

so<00:02:11.350> first<00:02:12.040> you're<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.850> install<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.380> on

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
so first you're going to install the on

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.520 
so first you're going to install the on
the<00:02:15.700> top<00:02:15.910> pour<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.860> silicone<00:02:18.010> hose<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:20.260> going

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the top pour the silicone hose is going

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.290 
the top pour the silicone hose is going
to<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.680> routed<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.700> one's<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.120> to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
to be routed and that one's going to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.520 
to be routed and that one's going to
connect<00:02:22.750> back<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.800> engine<00:02:24.640> block<00:02:25.530> onto

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
connect back to the engine block onto

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.550 
connect back to the engine block onto
the<00:02:26.740> factory<00:02:27.130> PCV<00:02:27.850> valve

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.620 

mounting<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.740> lower<00:02:32.950> hose<00:02:33.670> you're

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
mounting the lower hose you're

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.350 
mounting the lower hose you're
connecting<00:02:35.080> right<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:36.190> intake<00:02:36.850> manifold

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
connecting right to the intake manifold

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.390 
connecting right to the intake manifold
court<00:02:37.720> where<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.350> disconnected<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.280> other

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
court where you disconnected the other

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.550 
court where you disconnected the other
tube<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.450> again<00:02:40.630> that's<00:02:40.810> going<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.320> lower

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
tube and again that's going to the lower

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.290 
tube and again that's going to the lower
port<00:02:41.980> on<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.340> pan<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.640> after<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.320 
port on the pan so after you have the
last<00:02:49.510> line<00:02:49.830> installed<00:02:50.830> next<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.970> want<00:02:52.150> to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
last line installed next you want to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.910 
last line installed next you want to
secure<00:02:52.780> them<00:02:52.990> out<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.230> way<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.560> any<00:02:53.680> moving

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
secure them out of the way of any moving
