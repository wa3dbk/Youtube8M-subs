 on the last five games 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.600
 and especially this first defeat of the season in Lille the week 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.280

 even at 1 0 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.850
 the reaction paul and gasquet 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.690
 with this balloon in interesting attack 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.020
 falcao inherits the ball into the penalty area the cross-hit is 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.970
 impeccable 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.610

 pascal dupraz fools of rage because his team held 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.020
 only five minutes 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.670
 there is always a one score of a goal everywhere excellent could soon 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.880
 to fall to arras 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.390
 in the second half, it's up to monaco who pushed with this strike countered 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.810
 second chance she balances copÃ© 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 by the caretaker and the year 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.340
 and then we still make the third team of the championship to 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.480
 the outside of the young 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.070
 for 3 defeats away from their bases 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.360
 and more opportunities to come 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.620
 with that hit saved by this basic expensive 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.670

 the point of the draw 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.109
 be careful about this action for the Gascon 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.349
 it's not the passport on the surface 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.299
 the very favorable bottom hit her on the crossbar huge opportunity 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.159
 for esport aco 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.639
 and for the occasion ocampo that the Argentine striker 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.619
 we did not succeed 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.749
 evian-thonon-gaillard resisted and it will be the case until the end 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.119
 final score a goal everywhere this is only the second time of the season 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.959
