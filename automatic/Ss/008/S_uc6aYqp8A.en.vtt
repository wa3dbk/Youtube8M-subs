00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
show you on how to get the game working
on<00:00:51.090> Windows<00:00:51.270> 7<00:00:51.600> first<00:00:52.440> install<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.449> direct<00:00:54.449> x<00:00:54.690> 9c

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
on Windows 7 first install a direct x 9c

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
on Windows 7 first install a direct x 9c
because<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:57.210> isn't<00:00:58.219> coming<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.640> Windows<00:00:59.969> 7

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
because that isn't coming with Windows 7

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.289 
because that isn't coming with Windows 7
itself<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.489> first<00:01:02.940> install<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.220> then<00:01:05.240> go<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
itself so first install that then go to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
itself so first install that then go to
the<00:01:08.540> installation<00:01:09.540> folder<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.200> Dungeon<00:01:10.650> Siege

and you see this exe file called DS
video<00:01:18.509> config<00:01:19.729> double<00:01:20.729> click<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
video config double click on that and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.929 
video config double click on that and
normally<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.280> will<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.770> primary

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
normally there will be like a primary

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.560 
normally there will be like a primary
display<00:01:26.939> driver<00:01:27.390> hardware<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.439> here<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
display driver hardware in here and

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
display driver hardware in here and
change<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.369> your<00:01:32.369> video<00:01:33.329> card<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> then

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
change that to your video card and then

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.550 
change that to your video card and then
hardware<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.180> me<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.659> nvidia

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
hardware so for me it will be nvidia

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.630 
hardware so for me it will be nvidia
geforce<00:01:37.860> GT<00:01:38.579> s<00:01:38.700> 450<00:01:39.479> hardware<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
geforce GT s 450 hardware do not use the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.960 
geforce GT s 450 hardware do not use the
Phenom<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.689> doesn't<00:01:42.960> work<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.970> just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
Phenom because that doesn't work so just

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.050 
Phenom because that doesn't work so just
change<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.619> change<00:01:46.619> her<00:01:46.740> resolution<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
change that change her resolution to the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.139
