00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello everyone is bones ex art 7 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.790
 welcome to this new video by 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.740
 this series in which every time i 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.240
 I present economic players who 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.040
 they can take the place of players 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.700
 far more expensive stronger etcetera 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
 etc 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 this time I present yaya touré 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.420
 economic however I as always before 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.070
 tell you who it is I ask you to put me 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.109
 like this video to have others 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.850
 episodes of this series and I ask you to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.830
 suggest me yours in the comments 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 another player is pretty expensive from 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.060
 to be able to do precisely in this series 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.920
 I then against the hero most commented as 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.200
 in this case the aia touré and I will try 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.890
 to find the economic counterpart 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 elia economic nature is leroy fer vi 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.280
 I say right now that you won't see the clips 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.260
 video because you failed to put 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 enough material to put aside 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.980
 in this so this is say 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 review will be a little bit shorter 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.510
 compared to the others we leave immediately 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.090
 from the main statistics we have the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.300
 76 speed of yaya touré and against 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.199
 75 of fer therefore practically equal 1 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.930
 nothing changes 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.170
 then we have 79 touré dribbles 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 against the 73 also here little difference 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.710
 I always remember that between the two 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.299
 players that is well that is 10 of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.950
 difference then a whole lot too 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.460
 this time the shot is 82 hard against the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.799
 74 of iron therefore also here not one 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.220
 very high difference 80 in the defense 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.320
 of tourè against the 74 still of ferre 81 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.430
 of passage against the 71 here the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.030
 a little bit difference can be noticed 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.810
 also in game and finally 90 divides 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.610
 tour of yaya touré control 86 of fer 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.140
 very much even for him only sincere 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.060
 this time it was not very difficult 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.979
 find the yaya touré substitute 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.119
 because the will look for few 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.950
 players who have statistics 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.100
 similar to those of city players 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.710
 rica fact his strong points are 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.040
 the absurd balance between statistics 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.229
 in general and physicality for 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.189
 corresponded perfectly 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.759
 the moved stars also corresponded 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.830
 weak foot 43 chance at both e 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.110
 I said that partly also the 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.960
 Total in-game statistics are not bad 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.259
 those of fer are 2,243 those of yaya 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.630
 touré versus 2000 I don't remember how much 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.970
 2040 like those of iron but one thing 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.120
 what struck me so much about iron is the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.760
 jump jump header 88 and 83 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.740
 precision head is meadows is a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.900
 tank this player does not 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.810
 throws down in no way salt marks of 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.360
 head shot is not even that bad 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.100
 the weak foot is more than decent strength 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.770
 we don't talk about physics maybe a little bit 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.840
 the ball control you are seeing now 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.430
 the best second final on the card 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.690
 my problems against my vote 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.520
 general 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.410
 forgive me if this episode lasted a 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.360
 a little less, but I didn't have the clips 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.750
 because it failed to set it 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.240
 part 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.130
 I didn't have enough, so it's here 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.660
 unfortunately I see nothing but that 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.459
 would be found or not in all cases 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.590
 because i have spy to all my 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.300
 programming list week end is 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.040
 gone a bit so I still remember 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.900
 suggested midday expensive players 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.120
 passed in the comments I say I will have to 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.770
 find the economic counterpart on dates 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.720
 you suggest bomber you also noticed the 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.370
 last time I with verses will do it though 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.769
 I wanted to start doing those really 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.630
 really expensive though if really green 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.650
 van persie I will do it for you as long as not 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.660
